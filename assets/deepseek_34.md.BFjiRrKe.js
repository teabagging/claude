Then, my periods are regular, but the cycle is usually delayed by four to five days and sometimes more than that. My period lasts for 3 days rather than 5 to 7 days. I consulted a gynecologist and underwent some hormone tests and ultrasound. I am sharing the reports with you. Please let me know whether I am a patient of PCOS. Will PCOS cause acne?

Please provide a second opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). According to the ultrasound report, it is PCOS only (polycystic ovarian syndrome). All other tests ordered are normal. To confirm this by hormonal correlation, you need to get your FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) levels done on day 2 of cycle. It is the reversal of this ratio in PCOS. You may take Ovalife tablet. It is just a supplement. PCOS is not a disease, but just hormonal imbalance. You are a lean PCOS as you are very thin with a BMI of 23. Try to maintain your weight by a good and balanced diet and regular exercise. For reduction of acne and maintaining regularity of your cycles, I suggest tablet Diane 35 (Ethinyl estradiol) once a day for 21 days starting from day 2 of the cycle. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. However, regarding acne, your male hormone testosterone levels and also free insulin levels are within normal range and probably not the cause of acne. Consult a dermatologist for acne.

Often there is a genetic factor involved in the disorder such as if some in your family is suffering from similar kind of psychological problems. 2. Environmental factors such as negative life experiences during the past, family background, family communication and the role of a mother figure has been found to be associated with the development of this disorder. Consultation with a psychiatrist to suggest appropriate antipsychotic medicines. Observing one's own life as an outsider may be a part of dissociation or unrealization process. It needs to be differentiated from psychosis. Schizophrenia spectrum disorder (paranoid type). Generally a biopsychosocial approach is found to be the best treatment for a psychotic disorder. You need to observe the following with your specialist concern. 1. Medications are generally suggested after confirmation of the diagnosis. The medication is to balance the brain chemicals, which are released in excessive amount such as dopamine. A psychiatrist will prescribe the medicines to you. 2. Further, psychotherapy is must for such patients as a supportive treatment to get them back in life. Because, they might have left socializing, lack self-esteem, need support and guidance related to what has happened to them, to reduce the hygiene problem and develop coping skills such as checking the reality of the thoughts, personal dialogues, problem solving and communication skills. This is done through cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) provided by a psychologist or psychiatrist. 3. Support from family members is necessary to get the patient recover and complete the treatment. Family members can take counseling sessions as well, so as to get an idea about how to deal the client at home and among social spheres. Do not delay the treatment for psychotic disorders.

Can you let me know if her symptoms are anything that can be related any blood disorder? She is 54 years old. Her weight is 65 kg. There is no history of cardiac problem or diabetes. She is relatively healthy and eats a nutritional diet. She has had eight normal deliveries and hemorrhaged badly during her last four deliveries. Her last delivery required significant medical intervention to cease hemorrhaging. She was advised not to have more children as she would be unlike to survive another birth due to severe hemorrhaging. She has never required a blood transfusion. Family history includes grandmother with ovarian cancer and her mother is obese with diabetes and cardiac complications. Her past medical history includes easy hemorrhages and anemia. She always bleeds easily and has always bruised very easily and it takes a long time to disappear. She is taking Iron supplements to manage anemia. Recently, I massaged her aching leg, and immediately after her thighs became brown and it disappeared within 24 hours. Often, she gets aching legs. She was investigated for venous incompetence recently and no DVT found. A few weeks ago, she developed sudden onset of blurred vision in her right eye, sharp pain behind eye and vision loss. Then, she was diagnosed to have central retinal venous occlusion, for which she is now under treatment and got a first eye injection last week. She has been told that they do not know the reason for CRVO as there is no predisposing risk factor. Stress echocardiogram was normal, as were her INR and APTT. Doctors are unable to explain the reason, but she is still bleeding inside her eye. It has become worse and she is developing more symptoms, including pain and a slight droop in that eye. My dad and I have always thought that she may have an undiagnosed blood disorder, as many things do not add up and no doctors have been able to establish a cause for any of this. Years ago, a GP told mum that her blood was not sticky enough, but I do not know he said this on some blood tests he may have done. We are very concerned and will probably request a referral to a hematologist. Can any sense be made from the above symptoms? I appreciate any help.","Doctor":"Hi.

Recently, I had a pimple on my penis shaft and when I approached a dermatologist he advised that I get tested for HIV. I had a third generation test using vitros eci post five to six weeks past exposure and tested negative. My doctor advised me to get a test at least after 10 weeks post-exposure for confirmation. I am pretty nervous regarding the same. Can you please advise me what are the chances of contracting HIV and do the symptoms definitely occur in every individual post-HIV contraction?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, risk depends upon whether that guy has HIV or not. If not then nothing to worry, but considering the second possibility, then some risk remains of transmission, but not cent percent. Now, if the test is negative after five to six weeks then it is unlikely for you to have HIV as majority of those who are exposed becomes positive within this period. Only a minority of patients develop delayed seroconversion. So considering overall status, I think, there is no need to worry about it and you are unlikely to have HIV. However, get tested after a few weeks to clear out doubt and be sure. So you should not worry now and get back to routine, and get tested at later date. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

According to your description the lump you mentioned could be bartholin cyst as you are thinking. Usually it occurs due to the blockage of bartholin duct. Small cyst may not cause any problem but when a size increases or the cyst gets infected that can lead to formation of abscess, in that case you may experience pain and discomfort. As per as possible better to get examined by your gynecologist to find out the actual nature of the cyst. Sometimes antibiotics are sufficient to decrease the size of the cyst. If it gets infected and increases in size you may need to go for minor surgical procedures like incision and Drainage or Marsupialization. If you want relief now before going to your doctor you can take sitz bath with lukewarm water and 10 to 15 ml of Betadine solution, twice a day with 10 minutes duration.

I bit my tongue badly, but did not have any incontinence. Beforehand, I was shaking, had a loud beating heart and had a feeling of vertigo and anxiety. Afterwards, I was confused for approximately 15 minutes. I was being very active at the time and was bending down and rising several times to tidy up a room, which may have contributed to feeling faint or having a head rush. I am a 27 year old obese woman. My height is 5'6\\" and weight is 266 lbs with untreated bulimia that comes and goes in phases since the age of 15. For the previous three months, I alternated between low carbohydrate days, the days I accept as good days and bad days where I may binge and purge up to three times a day. I vomited 12 hours before my seizure and did not eat or drink anything after that. I had 5 hours of sleep and then drove an hour to work. After my seizure, my employer, who happens to be a doctor, gave me lots of water and tea and sent me to a GP. An hour later, I had a blood test and the results came back all normal, but borderline low potassium. My ECG scan is normal and nothing wrong with reflexes or balance. I do not have diabetes. I have also seen a neurologist, who has put the seizure down as isolated and unprovoked. I have not told my GP or my neurologist about my bulimia. My MRI and EEG scans are pending, but my neurologist said that they will probably come back clear. I have never felt my aura before as any indication of epilepsy, minor seizures or myoclonic jerks. I have also scared of my bulimia now, which is a positive. I realize that I am probably clutching at straws or in denial that I may have adult onset epilepsy. My question is that could my seizure have been provoked? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help you. From what you have narrated, I am of the opinion that your seizures were provoked or brought on by a combination of non-diabetic hypoglycemia, lack of sleep, dehydration, messed up electrolytes or even hypoglycemic unawareness.  Your neurologist has labeled this as unprovoked seizure since he was not aware of this. Because of this, they may diagnose this as epilepsy, when it is all the more possible that you had a episode of fits due to hypoglycemia and messed up electrolytes due to bulimia. By hiding your bulimia (eating disorder) to the neurologist and GP, you make it a risk of another worse diagnosis of epilepsy. Bulimia is a much simpler disease than epilepsy. My suggestion would be to tell the GP and neurologist the truth and get treated for bulimia and save your future.

Her foot appears to be in good condition now (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The likely cause for bluish discoloration is blockages only and is called peripheral arterial disease. So of she should be treated on the line of blockages itself. Now blockages in the foot raise the strong possibility of blockages elsewhere in the body like heart, brain, and its fortunate that she did not suffer any consequences due to that. So she should be evaluated with few investigations, like ECG (echocardiogram), Echo, Fasting lipid profile (sugar if not done recently). Also, to confirm the diagnosis, she should undergo CT (computed tomography) angiography of both the lower limbs. Now coming to the treatment part, obviously, the best would be to open it with stents. But as of now, she will need some more medications than what she is having. You may continue with Neurowin or better to have it in a tablet form once daily, and it is just a multivitamin supplement. She should also continue plain Ecospirin and dose should be 75 mg only at bedtime. Now in my opinion, she should additionally have tablet Rosuvastatin 10 mg bedtime once daily and tablet Cilostazol 50 mg twice daily after food. She should also have some antacids along with these medications like tablet Cyra 20 mg (Rabeprazole) once daily before breakfast. So these three medications should be added additionally until her evaluation is completed and probably will need to continue for the long term. Zerodol SP should be avoided as it may harm her by causing bleeding or raising blood pressure. Plain paracetamol is allowed. She should be encouraged to move and walk atleast 30 minutes a day as it would improve blood flow.

I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Pain and swelling after minor oral procedures are quite normal for the following 3 to 5 days. This pain and swelling will eventually fade off and regress. For lingering pain even after taking pain killers, please:  1. Do not skip doses and take them on-time. Please advise her to take prescribed pain medicines on time thrice daily because if the dose is missed or taken after the pain had already started, will not be that effective in controlling pain.  2. Avoid hot, spicy, hard and chewy foods. This can cause swelling to increase and delay healing.  3. Please leave the area undisturbed, because any irritant in that area could delay healing.  4. Avoid forceful mouth rinsing.  5. Follow gentle brushing.  6. Rinse mouth gently after every meal to remove food deposits coz food lodgement in that area could cause an infection.  If the pain relief is not that adequate, please talk to your dentist and get the dosage increased.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

My vision started to swim and everything turned yellow. I tried sitting down for a bit and standing up several times, my friend got concerned once he realized I was not over reacting. I suddenly felt the need to go to the bathroom and sat down once again. I do not remember what happened, but I woke up to my friend slapping me and saying that I had fainted. I insisted I did not need to go to the hospital. However, the next day we were walking around town when I started feeling what I thought were my period cramps coming on. I asked my friend to wait by the restroom while I went in to put in a tampon. I had not made it into the stall when what I can only describe as an excruciating pain shocked my lower abdomen, sending me reeling to the floor of the empty bathroom and the force of hitting the floor causing another ripple of pain. My periods are always fairly mild and even when the occasional cramp hit, it was not nearly as debilitating as this was. After around 5 minutes of gasping in pain on the bathroom floor I was able to get up alright and hurriedly shoved a wad of toilet paper in between my labia, concerned that I was giving a mini birth to a huge chunk of my uterus. I felt fine until we were in the convenience store searching for pain relievers when I felt the second wave coming. Doubled over the entire way groaning in pain, my friend paid for the medicine and ran out the door with me. As soon as we sat down on a park bench, I promptly started salivating and vomited for a few minutes. Afterwards, I took the medication Menstridol for the cramp and tried to poop and felt a little better. I am usually very tolerant to pain and this whole thing has been very scary. Could it possibly just be my period? I have never had cramps or symptoms like this before and the whole thing with the fainting was just weird.","Doctor":"Hi. You are right to be concerned.

I even remember some anesthesiologists getting upset with me as it was taking so long and the attending nurses defending me. Last time during my surgery, I spoke with the anesthesiologist before the procedure about this issue. He assured me that he had many ways to make certain that I would get the effect easily and he could monitor it well. After the surgery, he made a point to come to me and said that I was correct. I took a long time to get the effect of anesthesia. I have been told in the past to breathe differently or more deeply when the mask is on, but this does not make a difference. A few years ago, when I was having a procedure, the anesthesiologist asked me if I wanted light anesthesia. I had never been asked this before. I asked her suggestion and she said she would go with the light anesthesia. Unfortunately, I woke up during the procedure and it was very unpleasant. So, what are all the possible reasons for a person taking a long time to go under anesthesia? When I was younger, this was not an issue. This began when I was approximately in my mid 40s.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I also have a very strong kink for being insulted and degraded in bed. The thing is my partner refuses to say anything that shows dominance, let alone insult, because he is too respectful. I love that he is respectful of me, but I resort to thinking thoughts of myself to try to make myself orgasm and even that is not nearly as effective as I think him saying it would. What I am asking for is advice on how to make him feel more comfortable doing this in bed. He enjoys being on top so he is not really the submissive type to begin with. In case this is helpful, here is the information on our relationship outside sex. He is a quiet and passive one. I am the loud and assertive one. Despite this, I take care in making sure that he gives me his thoughts and feelings on things in general and never try to pressure him into anything. However, he has a tendency to do what he thinks would make me happy because he feels obligated except in bed, else I would not be here. For example, he watched a movie with me that he did not like, because he felt he had to. A slightly bigger example is that I expressed interest in taking couple's Latin dance class once we were on our own together and he hates dancing, but says he wants to do it for me, even though I told him I only want to do it if he really wants to. The one thing I say I probably dominate him in is that if I do not think he eats enough or is on his phone too much during lunch, I nag him, sometimes take the phone away and even more seldom spoon feed him. He is very laid back though, and never expressed strong distaste for my being on his case about this. This is a small aspect of our relationship though.","Doctor":"Hi.

I am a 62 year old married male. I have had several teeth extracted. I lived with a couple teeth whose caps have broken off on my left side and a few molars on the right for chewing. I am suffering from hypertension and is controlled with medicines over 10 years. I am also a known diabetic and it has been controlled with drugs and diet for the last few years. My main problem is moderate neuropathy in hands and feet for more than 12 years. I am on Neurontin and Fentanyl patch. Six months ago, I went to my dentist with the right top rear molar sharp pain. She filled it, but was not sure whether it would need a root canal. About two months later, the pain started and this time as a more typical, throbbing toothache and she decided a root canal was appropriate. I was surprised with the amount of pain in the recovery. The pain was more diffuse than the original, sort of like the pain from a loosened tooth. I complained and re-visited the dentist. She did an x-ray and said that she did not miss any roots or went too deep. But, she saw something and she described it as an injury in the spot next to it and that is where a tooth had been extracted years before. She gave me a course of antibiotics, just in case and recommended to consult an oral surgeon. But, I decided to wait and see if it resolved. It slowly got a bit better, but in a month or so started to get worse. So, I went to the oral surgeon and he said that he saw nothing wrong and suggested I could be feeling pain from a tooth on the bottom. For a number of reasons, I do not believe this. I am now at a point where the pain is endurable, but annoying. The pain changes over time. Sometimes, it abates almost completely and there is no pain at all. While the tooth is still slightly cold sensitive, there are no other symptoms. This lasts for about a few days to over a week at a time. Most of the time there is an annoying sensitivity, high sensitivity to cold, pushing the tooth to the side with my tongue is mildly painful, sort of like a loosened tooth but chewing down on it does not give me any pain. There is a full time ache and that is most pronounced at night. The symptoms are basically the same as the moderate pain, just more intense with the addition of it feels deeper and more diffuse. It sometimes feels like it goes up into the jaw or sinus. But, I really need to keep this tooth in order to have a half-functional mouth. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi.

Last Saturday, he went on his normal routine of getting ready but did not know what happened and he walked out of the house without any clothes. When we asked him if he was okay, he said yes. But after the whole episode, when we asked him if he knew what he did, he said no. We do think that his epilepsy is triggered by less sleep and the only medication he takes is Gabapentin. We think that he is getting depressed because he has a loss of appetite, loss of weight, slowness in activity, concentration problem and occasional mood swings. His current neurologist does not do anything and all he does is keep doing a blood test each time.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for your question. History of epilepsy and intermittent episodes of confusion with loss of memory of the episode (amnesia) is concerning for seizures. For the workup of seizures, he should get routine brain wave testing (EEG - electroencephalogram) or a long-term EEG monitoring to identify any abnormal brain discharges which can cause a seizure. Other things to look at it is head imaging like CT head or MRI brain (if not done already) as it is not uncommon for elderly patients to have blood collection around the brain (subdural hematoma) to present with altered awareness or confusion. I agree with blood tests as an initial test to look for metabolic encephalopathy due to deranged blood electrolytes level and body metabolites such as BUN (blood urea nitrogen), ammonia, etc. Please do not hesitate to reply if you have any other questions or concerns."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, About a month ago, I suddenly noticed a grape size swelling on the top of my right testicle. It is not attached to the testis, but above it towards the top of the scrotal sack. I went to a urologist and he asked me to do an USG. The USG showed a thickened right spermatic cord with cystic areas for about 2 cm x 1 cm. The mass was quite hard and firm. The mass had no pain on pressing it. He gave me Banocide and another antibiotic on a trial basis. The mass did not reduce after two weeks of treatment. Then, he recommended me to do a FNAC. I consulted another doctor and he too was unsure of what it was and recommended immediate surgery to remove it rather than performing a FNAC by saying that it might infect the area. After that I was out of station for a week. When I came back, the hard swelling had miraculously shrunk to the size of less than a pea, but it was still hard. The doctor asked me to observe it for another three weeks and not to go for immediate surgery. Though for the last two weeks the mass does not seem to have reduced any further, I am looking for some advice. What is the possible cause of the problem?

On my right ovary, the cyst measured at 18 cm and on my left the cyst measured at 13 cm. The surgeon was able to save my ovaries with no problem. My ovaries just needed to be stitched up after having the cyst removed. My question is, when can I try to conceive? I am 20 years old and my doctor recommended I get on the pill due to the endometriosis, but I really do want to conceive really soon. None of my reproductive organs were bothered other than my ovaries being stitched. I am currently on Junel 1.5/30.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Great to know that the surgeon could save your ovaries, though the cysts were really so large. During surgery surgeon would have removed all the visible, I mean all macroscopic endometrial deposits. But there will be microscopic deposits, not visible to the eye and they will not allow proper fertility outcome. Immediately following surgery or any such physical stress, the egg or follicular response also will be less. So, rest for ovaries for a period of 3 months will do good. During this period of waiting, the use of hormone pills or injections like Leuprolide will allow a better follicular response. So I would advise as your doctor did. You are so young and will surely have a good follicle reserve left to use. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries and for your feedback.

Can you see the PET scan report and suggest good medicine for the bone improvement? Can you suggest a good medicine for bone metastasis?

As per the scan report you sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity), though the metastasis is widespread, she has relatively improved as far as bone are considered (sclerotic). In case of cancers, bone quality is largely affected. Bisphosphonates are used to improve the quality of bone, which is a slow process. Currently, two approved and commonly used IV bisphosphonates are Pamidronate disodium (Aredia and Novartis) and Zoledronic acid (Zometa and Novartis). This will reduce her bone pain relatively. Her kidney function should be normal before taking this injection. This should be taken once in a month. You can just request the treating oncologist regarding this. Regarding your query, though there are few differences between them Zoledronic acid is preferred. But, that does not mean that the other bisphosphonate should not be taken. Any bisphosphonate work similarly with each differing in their side effects.

What do you think is the most common and most damaging misconception people have when it comes to purchasing food in the supermarket? Do you think that people focus too much on calorie counting and not enough on eating healthy foods? If you can include only three things in a nutritional label, what would you choose? In your experience, what do people mostly focus on when studying nutritional labels, calories, fats, or sodium? What do you think they should be focusing on the most? In your opinion, how can people make more educated decisions when grocery shopping? Do you think the nutritional label is enough to rely on? If you were to design a completely new nutritional label, how would you make it easier to understand or read than the previous five examples of nutritional labels? Do you have any suggestions? Of the many food trends that constantly spring up, should the average consumer believe any slogan slapped across the packaging of food products? What are some tell-tale signs to be aware of?

I think it will take time to teach people to understand the importance of nutrition labeling but with my experience, I can answer your questions from the way I have understood by my patients. Misconception spreads mainly through advertisement. People does not read and they want to just understand what media say. The trend of looking into calorie content is increasing mostly on our IT people. I would prefer calories from sugar, calories from fat and sodium content of product per 200 g. About calories, I think we need to teach each detail of sources of fat, sodium and potassium levels. I guess all medical professionals need to teach the importance of reading, food labeling as we can observe an increase rate of metabolic disorder. If we guide in the proper way it could be helpful, it might be in schools or some awareness programs. A small note on the ingredient used and its importance or guiding note on macro as well as micronutrient uses in points. The mantra of advertisement needs to be changed or we need to explain the concept of being healthy with the use of daily simple products."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I just got one side of my wisdom teeth removed both upper and lower six days ago, and I have another one scheduled after two days for the left side.

I do however have occasional episodes, which are not manageable. Sometimes, months apart and sometimes every other day, I have a very short (around 1/2 second), but very violent twist in my vision. There is no warning for this. I have experienced it while sitting, driving and standing. Afterwards, I feel very unbalanced for a few minutes and then fine. The only other symptom is my head feels like it has been pulled on the top and I have ringing in my ears afterwards. I have had three MRI scans in the last 18 months, because the diplopia onset was quite sudden and experienced a lot of pain in my head and face. These have all been clear. I do not seem to have any warning when these episodes occur and they are so sporadic at times. It is difficult to tell what exactly it is. I am also unsure, because it is too fast, whether it is just my left eye or both. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated. Apart from eye strain, which does happen occasionally, I do not have any other symptoms. I regularly do convergence disorder exercises to stop straining and it works.","Doctor":"Hello.

Gas and indigestion persisted since then. A recent CT scan has shown a possibility of pancreatic pseudocyst formation. The doctor has advised to remove the same by the procedure. My query regarding this is whether the pseudocyst can be treated by medicines or a procedure is recommended. And if yes, whether a laparoscopic procedure can be opted. What are the advantages and disadvantages? If there is a chance of the pseudocyst being formed again after the procedure? I am currently on Atowa Aony, Prankeeatoflat, Sompray D, VSC 3#, and Telma AM.","Doctor":"Hello. When he had the first episode of pancreatitis? What is the size of the cyst by ultrasound? What is serum amylase or lipase levels? Is he a diabetic? Is he an alcoholic? Will you please answer to above questions if possible. If pseudocyst usually acute means we will wait for four to six weeks for recovery. If it is not recovering with medication or increasing the size in sequential CT scans or it causing any complications (adjoining vessel compression or size > 5 cm or infected or causing bowel obstruction or symptoms of decreased appetite or weight loss) need surgery. Yes, you may undergo laparoscopic pseudocyst gastrostomy or cysto jejunostomy. For this procedure need experienced hands and long term outcome not known. But less morbidity and success rate. Yes in 15-18% of causes recurrence."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I cannot stop nocturnal emissions. I sleep on my back and I do not even put any blankets on myself. I neither watch something or think about it, but it happens two or three times a week. I get brain fog from it and my voice badly changes. I get tired of it. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Nocturnal emissions usually occur in sex dreams and often even without dreams. Sleep ejaculations are healthy and normal for everyone. They do not cause any problem in your sexual life either now or in the future. Just as pressure cooker releases steam every time the pressure inside the cooker increases, so also your body expels the unused semen once in a while and gives way for the production of new sperm or semen. This is nature's way of releasing the sexual tension building up in you. Probably it is also a way to check that your sexual system is working fine, and to make sure semen does not become stale. Night falls disappear once you enter into regular sexual life. There are a number of myths in society about night falls. Buying those myths causes psychosomatic symptoms like brain fog, weakness, fatigue, etc. Be assured, all these are myths and misconceptions due to a lack of scientific knowledge. So the next time nightfall occurs, laugh it off, wash it off and enjoy it. If the symptoms persist, they may have other reasons behind them. Get a general medical check-up to identify the causes."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 16 weeks pregnant with high GCT results. I would like to reconfirm the results.

You have made a good start by showing a physician and started on medications for your blood pressure. It is good to be aware of your health. I am sure that they already advised lifestyle changes, so I will not go into its depths. Every morning, when you wake up, you need to tell yourself that you will be happy, lose weight and work towards it. That way your mind will slowly be diverted to change your thinking to weight loss and happy, which will also drive you and reduce these thoughts of heart attack.

Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application.

The water he drinks will not affect the drain output until and unless the heart failure component is there.

My periods have been on and off however I have not actually bled as such. There is just continuous dark brown discharge for a few days but no red flowing blood.

If you have been on pills for PCOD for more than 3 years now and yet your hormones remain uncontrolled and menses have not been regularized, then there is definitely something wrong in the treatment protocol or you may not be following the lifestyle changes which you may have been advised to follow. It is best to stop pills for at least 3 months after such a long treatment already and switch to lifestyle changes now for results. If pregnancy is not a concern lately, then the pills can be avoided. However darkish brown blood indicates irregular shedding and this could be due to isolated progesterone deficiency, which can be evaluated by your serum progesterone levels. However immediate control of bleed can be achieved with antifibrinolytics. You may discuss it with your treating gynecologist. Please feel free to discuss this further in detail.

If this is painful while swallowing or drinking cold food please put it to the attention of the doctor. It can be treated with simple antibiotics then. If not this has to be addressed quickly to rule out any other infection with a blood test apart from HPV as you got vaccinated for it.

If the men or women from the affected family marry the person outside the family, then does it come to the child? Is this type of tremor curable? Women in the family are not able to hold the lid of the pressure cooker and cut vegetables. Men in the family are not able to hold the tea cup that means hands are shaking and not able to dial a number in a mobile phone without shaking. They underwent test before 10 years and was diagnosed to have essential tremor. Now, I want to know the answers to the following questions. What is the further impact and symptoms of essential tremor over a period of time if left untreated? How does it affect the daily activities? Is it genetically transferable to the next generation? Do we have any permanent cure for essential tremor? If the person has essential tremor, then what are the chances of linkage to other illnesses and disorders?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your question with care and understand your doubts regarding essential tremors. If not treated, the person will not be able to do or will do with much difficulty works involving fingers like writing, mixing food, button shirts, etc. Activities which require co-ordinated movements of the fingers will be affected. Essential tremors can be due to various reasons and a few of these reasons are transmitted genetically. A few are acquired. Even among the ones which are transmitted genetically, it can be AD, AR, XD, XR that is autosomal dominant, autosomal resistant, X-linked dominant and X-linked resistant respectively. So, unless we know the exact cause of this tremor, we cannot answer about genetic transmission. Without knowing the exact cause, the answer for this question is 0 to 100 (0 for acquired and 100 for AD). The cure of essential tremor depends on the cause. A few causes can be cured completely, a few causes can be controlled and a few cannot be cured at all. Again, the link with other illness and disorders depends on the cause of the tremor. Coming to this particular patient, who has this when going to new places or during anxiety, this tremors can be controlled with proper medication. You have to consult a neurosurgeon who has had experience in successfully treating such patients for physical evaluation.

I do not know if it was traumatic as I do not remember crying or anything. Does this count as sexual abuse? Because of the young age of my brother, I do not know if it is related. But, I am extremely emotional, self-harm and do a lot of things without thinking. Sometimes, I think about seeing someone when I am really depressed and feel empty, but this only lasts like a few hours and then I feel fine.","Doctor":"Hi.

I am attaching the estradiol (E2) hormone report of my wife. The blood serum sample was taken on the 23rd day of her menstrual cycle. The estradiol (E2) level is 179.48 pg/mL. We have been married since 3 years and have a 2 year old son. Actually, she has faced the problem of vaginal dryness lately. As it could be due to lower levels of estradiol or perimenopausal symptoms, so we got the estradiol level check done. Although, the report has a reference range, we do not know if this level of the corresponding day is optimal or not. Please advice on this. Kindly let us know regarding the estradiol levels in a healthy woman.","Doctor":"Hello. There are two major types of estrogen, the female sex hormone. They are estradiol and estrone. In younger woman, the first one is in abundant quantity and the second one is in less. And near menopause, the level just reverses. It means there is more production of estrone at menopause. The normal estradiol level in the second half in perimenopausal age varies between 39 to 300 pg/mL and it varies from different times of cycle. A level below 30 is definitely about menopause. Now, her level is within normal limit. Vaginal dryness is quite common due to the aging process as well as use of contraceptive pills. I suggest you to measure the level of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) to determine her menopausal status. However, at this estradiol level, she should not be advised for hormone replacement now. You may be benefited by the application of some gel or cream during intercourse.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

Biopsy report shows: Adenocarcinoma of prostate Gleason score 6 (3+3) associated with ultra ductal carcinoma with extra prostate. Presence of numerous enlarged nerves. I want to know its treatment and side effects. My dad is 78 years old and he has high blood pressure. He did bone metastasis and it came back negative. What is the best treatment for my dad?","Doctor":"Hi. It looks your father has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The good thing is that his bone scan is free of metastasis (spread). I will suggest them to do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) pelvis and x-ray chest plus abdominal ultrasound for staging. These investigations will show the extension of the prostatic tumor if the tumor is confined to the prostate only. He needs a surgical assessment for the possible radical removal of the prostate along with the tumor. If they found him unfit for surgery or inoperable tumor, then the next step is radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. In general, prostatic cancer is usually a slow-growing tumor. It takes years to spread to other parts. From stage 1 to stage 3 prostate cancer five years of survival is almost 100 %."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My sister is 33 years old.

How far is the risk?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. NT scan is just a screening test to pick-up cases of Trisomy. Nuchal translucency of <3.2 mm, nasal bone seen and normal blood flow in ductus means the chance of trisomy is very low. To confirm this doctor has done a double marker test. They too are within normal limits. These values are extrapolated over a graph of general values, as MOM- multiples of median. Both the markers are normal. In your case, only risk factors which have given a risk of 1: 81, is your age (any ratio < 1:250 has to be further investigated), which unfortunately cannot be altered. When the values are graphed over your age, they fall at high risk. But do not worry. So the ideal next step is to undergo an amniocentesis at 14-16 weeks of pregnancy and genetic analysis can give you a diagnostic result. I feel it will be normal. Just relax and wait for that normal result. You can definitely continue the pregnancy.

With very limited mobility and severe pain, I was under continuous medication and was taking Remicade (Infliximab) for the last five years. Till recently, Remicade was working well and my pain was under control, however with some limited mobility. But, in the last three months, the stiffness and pain got severe. As per my doctor's advice, I started injecting Humira - Adalimumab once in every two weeks. Four weeks since I had started using Humira now and so far injected two, but my pain and stiffness only got worse and the mobility is almost nil. My HLA B27 results are negative. My questions are, how many days or weeks I need to wait to see improvement from Humira? How long should I continue Humira even if I did not see improvement? What option I have if Humira does not work for me?

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

It is pinkish color and then I have a little brown color when I clean myself. I have had no cramps, no pains, no nausea the only thing that I have had is my areolae are super sensitive. My last period was the last week of last month and they are usually spots and not irregular. I have taken two pregnancy test and both came back negative. I have looked online and have heard of implantation so I am wondering if this could be a really late period or possible pregnancy. My husband and I do not use protection and I am not on birth control either. The spotting is off and on, not all day, usually, I have to change pads often for my cycle but I can use a light pad for all day use with the spotting. If this seems like implantation when can I test and get a positive? How far can implantation happen? Usually, my cycle has clots in it and is super heavy and I have some pretty bad cramps, but I have not had any type of pains with this. I have one son already and did not notice this earlier.","Doctor":"Hi. According to your information, today is a bit early to have pregnancy test positive. None of these signs predict pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test and also the serum beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is usually suggested at least one day after the expected period. Breast tenderness or pins and needle sensation is due to the progesterone hormone, which is normal before a normal period. The pink spotting can be either an excessive discharge from the cervix due to congestion. So also the brownish discharge, which is old altered blood. One more reason, if I may suggest is your weight. Your expected weight is 52-57 kg. This extra cholesterol can get converted into hormones altering the hormonal support to the endometrial lining. So this luteal phase defect can cause these clots, fleshy masses in periods blood with quite disturbing pain. Some leftover old blood also may be falling out now. The pain will be more if you have a cesarean section. Since your last delivery, mostly your body weight has not reduced. Anyway, check your urine for pregnancy at one day after your expected periods. Use the morning first sample of urine. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 26 years old. Two years back, I found that I have autoimmune hepatitis.

I am sorry to hear about your situation, I can understand it must be really difficult for you right now. What you are describing looks more like depression with anxiety, for bipolar disorder there has to be episodes of Mania which can be diagnosed after complete evaluation and psychiatry history. First thing you need to understand is that your behaviour is partially in control of you when you have a mental health disorder and the actions that you do because of depression or bipolar, is not much under your control but with medications and proper therapy treatment you can control these. There are two things that you will need to get help with this, starting psychotherapy that is counselling sessions which will help you in controlling your anger and it will also help you vent out your emotions and all the guilt that you are holding which is making you even worse. Secondly you may need medications which can be decided after complete evaluation. Please find a local therapist or a psychiatrist they will guide you. If you cannot find the local therapist we can start therapy online via video consultation.

This pattern in which wbc has behaved, does not fit into leukemia. Leukemia is an uncommon cause for wbc elevation, other common causes are infection, steroids or any bodily stress can lead to this. It's not expected to go down in leukemia, and counts are usually much higher than this. Also, you are asymptomatic. So does not appear like a leukemia to me.

I also did p24 on 15th day and get negative result. Now can I be safe from HIV? I use two condoms at the same time during intercourse and I do not know my partner's HIV status. With other partner, I just kissed her without any physical relation.","Doctor":"Hi. The answers to your queries are: If you had used the condom consistently and correctly, changed for each sexual act with one person, and it did not break or slipped off during the act and you removed it while the penis is still not soft, your risk of HIV is nonexistent. HIV cannot be transmitted by touching or kissing alone. The test you performed is highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate result. A negative HIV-RNA test needs to be complemented with fourth-generation HIV combo test at four weeks. If the result is negative, HIV rapid antibody test needs to be repeated at three and six months of last exposure. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had oral sex before months. I did the following tests. 1. HIV combo 4th generation (CMIA) during 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th month after exposure. All results are negative. 2. HIV combo 4th generation and ELISA during 7th month. All results are negative. 3. HIV test from ICTC center in general medical college hospital in the ninth month with a negative result. 4. STD tests are also done. 5. HCV on ninth month by ELISA method. Now 11 months have passed and I have lymph node under the jawline on both sides. Both lymph nodes are equal in size as that of green peas. It is moving but I do not have any pain. Is it lymph node? Do in normal body is there such type of lymph nodes present? Or is this symptom of HIV? Is this a serious condition? I am 32 years old with good health. I have attached all my reports. Please provide information on what is my status? Should I need to test more or not? What is the size of the lymph node in the normal body under the jaw line? Some say that HIV test may take nine months in some cases, what are they? Sometimes I feel muscle pain and some mouth infection, is ti sign of HIV? As per NACO, there may be very rare chance of some persons to show positive after nine months. Who are they?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the details and reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The chances of transmission of HIV by unprotected intercourse with an HIV positive person is very low (1/200 to 1/1000). If protected it is nil. Chances of transmission by oral sex are almost nil unless there are bleeding wounds in both. The risk is nil. If HIV antibodies tests are negative ​after three months and are repeatedly negative until nine months. It is conclusive that you are free from HIV. You can allay fears of HIV totally. There is no need for further HIV tests. Other STDs too are negative. The symptoms are nonspecific and do not suggest HIV. The lymph nodes swellings may be due to simple respiratory infection or tonsillitis. Antibodies are formed by two to six weeks latest by three months. In the very rarest of rare cases who has immunosuppressive disease it may be positive by six months. They have severe symptoms and signs of immunosuppression since childhood. You need not worry about such issues. Forget the episode and lead a normal life."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 3-year-old daughter was diagnosed with pneumonia eight days ago (examination and x-ray). She was put on Amoxicillin (six more days) and Klacid (supply finished today). Although she is tired during the day and breathless trying to climb out stairs, she is lots better. In the last day or two, she has come out with a red rash all over her face and for the past two nights, she has been constantly coughing as soon as she lays down to sleep. I have to hold her upright on my lap to control her cough. Is this a normal stage of recovery?","Doctor":"Hi. As per your description, the child seems better but since the child has gone through so many problems the recovery may be prolonged. What you are explaining does not exactly fit the picture of a recovery as the child is breathless and a new rash has developed. The rash may be a drug-induced rash but there should be no breathlessness. I would strongly advise nebulizing the child with Duolin every four hourly and Budecort every six hourly. Also, I think a repeat x-ray film should be obtained to find out if the patch of pneumonia is still the same or it has increased? If it remains the same it is fine since the time of two weeks to up to one to two months may be required before a complete radiological clearing. Also, you have not mentioned if the child was given an iv medication or oral. In the current scenario, I would have preferred iv (intravenous) medications. Also, sometimes one of the complications of pneumonia is an effusion which will lead to breathlessness but since your child does not have fever currently that is ruled out. Another important point I want to know is if there is a history of asthma in the family? Because if there is then this phenomenon that you are describing may be completely different from pneumonia and may actually be the start of asthma."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old.

I have seronegative arthritis. Previously I had dengue, cerebral malaria and typhoid. I am currently taking Betacap TR 40 mg bd for one month then stopped. Clonazepam 0.5 mg bd for two months but no help.","Doctor":"Hello doctor, I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concerns. First of all, you have a high BMI (body mass index). Try to reduce the weight as you know it is high for this age and height. Ejection fraction of 60% shows you have aortic stenosis due to sclerosed aortic valve. In this regard, we have to keep in mind that this much back pressure on the left ventricle with every heartbeat is making the ventricular walls and interventricular septum more thickened and dilated. Improper output is making your heart beat faster and it also reduces the cardiac output. Stenosed aortic valve. Hindrance to outflow of blood. Cardiac angiography. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are the mainstay of treatment to reduce heart rate and control palpitation and to reduce cardiac oxygen demand that has increased due to increased heart rate. Maybe we need cardiac ablation and also there may be a need for valvular replacement sometime later in life. Avoid strenuous physical activity. No junk foods, caffeine, tea, coffee, chocolates, and energy drinks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After introduction of solid foods to my 6 months old grandson, he was doing well.

And I want to eat eggs how can I eat? If I take spicy food after a few hours something burns in my stomach. I cannot even take spicy foods. What do I do? I want to eat everything? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. The pimple problem or acne is a very common issue for young men of your age. It affects morale and creates constant anxiety in the minds. The solution to this problem requires one adheres strictly to certain diet regimens and take abundant care of their skin. Drinking so many liters of water is not harmful. Continue it. Water helps to wash off bacterial toxins and remove pimples. Make sure you do not fill your stomach with water immediately after a meal as that would distend the tummy and make you fat over time. But taking so many liters of water intermittently is beneficial. You are advised to avoid oily foods. The yellow of egg is completely cholesterol. While preparing non-vegetarian foods to make sure minimal oil or butter is used. Use boiled meats better. Fish oils are good for health and fish is the healthiest non-veg food. Red meats are not very healthy, and so is beef or pork which have a lot of fat in them. You must use a good face wash that will remove excess oil from the skin as well as maintain adequate moisture in the skin. However, if your skin is dry type then you must use a face wash that hydrates the skin well and does not add to its dryness. Deciding on the right cosmetic product takes time and patience, but once you arrive at the right one for yourself then there is no looking back. If you are unable to tolerate spicy food it is best to avoid it. If this problem is a recent one then you may take some anti-acid reflux medicines like Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for two weeks and Mucaine gel syrup two teaspoons thrice daily after meals. This will remove acidic reflux in the tummy and reduce the burning sensation after meals. You are advised to reduce the intake of coffee, tea, smoking, and alcohol. Last, we have many anti-pimple or anti-acne creams available in the market. Clindamycin, Adapalene, Nicotinamide, Retinoic acid, and Benzoyl peroxide are all very effective. If you can send a picture of your face with clarity then I can assess the severity and recommend the cream and how to use the same. Do not use these creams on your own as indiscriminate use can worsen the condition and lead to disastrous side effects.

I have attached my CT report for your reference. I just wanted to know if surgery necessary. Will it benefit me? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. We are happy to help you. Your CT scan (attachment removed to protect patient identity) concludes that you have retention cyst inside both maxillary sinuses and the right frontal sinus. Retention cysts form when fluid collections in the sinuses get covered with a mucus lining. These cysts produce nasal symptoms of obstruction or running nose, which can cause a blocked nose in the night and thus mouth breathing. Mouth has lot of soft tissues (unlike the nose) which vibrate while breathing and produce snoring sound. Yes, you will get benefit from surgery. An endoscopic clearance of the pathological sinuses will remove your nasal symptoms and help you breathe through the nose at all times including at night by avoiding mouth breathing and snoring.

The cause is some of your sperms could be present in your precum that is some amount of clear secretion from penis before the ejaculation. It could cause a pregnancy. Contrary to your belief, no sperm will be present in the yellow deposit termed smegma. Finally, you have to consider in which day of her period you had sex.

I have tried all homemade remedies for my periods but I did not get it. What should I do now? And this vaginal dryness is literally making me feel irritated. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, I like to inform you that PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) could be an underlying cause for vaginal dryness due to hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS itself. Secondly, itching is probably the result of vaginal dryness rather than anything else. In case you are sexually active, we need to look for STI (sexually transmitted infection) as they can also present with similar symptoms. Practically speaking if the vaginal dryness causing significant impairment in your quality of life, it is time to see a doctor. She may run some tests and do some examination to find out the exact cause of the problem. However, for time being topical estrogen can be used for symptomatic relief. It is available in the form of gel, ring or cream. As per your convenience, you can use either cream or gel and the use of ring requires assistance of a doctor. The second thing is stress management. Stress is one of the common reasons for causing decreased vaginal lubrication. Thirdly, avoid soap-based formulations to clean the private area as it increases dryness.

I can lift 40 lbs dumbells with no problem and still do push-ups and other exercises with no problems and sprint and run without falling or tripping.

I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). You should know that there are a lot of benign causes underlying muscle twitching like anxiety, physical activity, thyroid gland dysfunction, benign fasciculation syndrome, vitamin B12 or vitamin D deficiency, low calcium or magnesium levels, etc. As long as there is no progression, no weakness, no muscle wasting, there is no reason to panic about ALS. I would recommend performing some tests: 1. Thyroid hormone levels. 2. Blood electrolytes. 3. Vitamin B12 and vitamin D plasma levels. 4. Complete blood count, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) for inflammation. Nerve conduction studies would help to completely exclude ALS and thus put your mind to peace. I recommend discussing with your doctor on the above tests.

There was orange mould on the inside of the bath, and black mold on the walls. I used a wet sponge to clean off the orange mould. It was easy to remove, as it was soft and slimey. I held my breath, and cleaned it quickly, then came back to clean some more, and so on until it was all gone. I also held by breath to clean off the black mould, which I scraped off. At no point did I breathe in any mold smell. However, a few minutes after cleaning the orange mold, I returned to shower it off, and there was still a musty smell of mold, I only breathed it in for a second, because I held my breath even for this task. But I am worried the small amount I breathed in could affect me. I am very sensitive to strong smells, and can suffer tightness of the chest; although I am not asthmatic. I do however suffer from hypothyroidism. Is there a danger I could have negatively impacted my lungs/breathing?","Doctor":"Hello.  Different types of molds can give hyper-reactive response to the airways. It is always advisable to wear mask as much as possible.

ECT and the Ketamine seem to show the best results so far but are short-lived. And I hate to keep shocking his brain if this is not going to work (He has completed 10 sessions now). All I have been doing is research on how to help him because I know his doctor has only one hour with him every two or three weeks where I am with him every day for hours. I ran across an article about using Tramadol to treat depression and I was wondering if taking this every day would produce the same (or near same) effects that the Ketamine treatments do but over a longer time? Right now he is on Cymbalta 90 mg, Rexulti 0.5 mg, Wellbutrin 150 mg, Hydroxyzine 50 mg (as needed), Clonazepam 0.5 mg (as needed).","Doctor":"Hello. Resistant or long-standing depression needs treatment with a mood stabilizer that has not been given the list on ongoing medicines. I would recommend that you add a mood stabilizer like Divalproex sodium or Lithium Carbonate. It will help hold the mood in place once it has been elevated by antidepressants. Also, Cymbalta is not a very good antidepressant. It is the least potent among SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) class of drugs. Normally, after this you can try using a TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) class of antidepressant and if that does not help then a combination of Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine is highly effective. It is also been evidenced by Star-D trials, the largest clinical trials for resistant depression. This is also my clinical experience. In addition to the primary antidepressant (SSRI or SNRI or TCA), and the mood stabilizer, also an atypical low dose antipsychotic will augment the efficacy of the antidepressant such as 50 to 100 mg of Amisulpride, or 5 mg of Aripiprazole, etc. So, there are a lot of options available which have not been tried and I would request you to consider these first, in addition to the ongoing therapies. And finally, do not use Tramadol daily that would lead to an opioid type of dependence and ultimately worsen his depression."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old but my skin is very loose and it looks very old get wrinkled on the upper part of my hands, feet and also in some other parts.

You seem to have an anxiety type disorder mixed with depressive episodes. You will need to visit a psychiatrist and he will prescribe you SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) type of medicines which will help with your problem. It basically happens when some neurotransmitters such as serotonin reduce in your brain leading to a problem with handling the day to day stresses of life. Medicines are usually given for two to four months and then tapered off slowly and stopped. The medicines I have mentioned are usually prescribed by psychiatrists. Apart from those, you can take Melatonin 5 or 10 mg. It is available in any decent pharmacy over the counter and does not need a prescription. You can try taking that daily at night. Apart from that, you can try some sleep hygiene methods like 1. Maintain good temperature, no noise or light. 2. One hour prior to bed, wind down and try reading or music. 3. Do not use the laptop, TV or phone one hour prior to bed. 4. Avoid caffeine, alcohol or tobacco two hours prior to sleeping. 5. Avoid exercises three hours before sleeping. 6. Take warm milk at bedtime. 7. Go to bed only when sleepy and avoid other activities on bed. 8. Use the bed only for sleeping or sex. If you do not get sleep, do not toss and turn, get up, go to another room, walk about for 10 to 15 minutes and come and lie down. See for 10 minutes, if not sleepy go out again. Try deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation techniques, or yoga or meditation. It will also help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18-year old male and recently I had stopped smoking and now my throat is sore. Is it something serious? I have been smoking for four months.","Doctor":"Hello. With the conversation, I understand you are an 18-year-old male who started smoking four months back and now quit it recently. However, you are suffering from throat pain now. My assessment is that the sore throat is just a throat infection. It has got nothing to do with any cancer if that is what you are worrying about. The throat pain may have got aggravated by the smoke and the agents in it. Kindly follow these suggestions. 1. Hot salt water gargles daily thrice. 2. Steam inhalation. 3. Take plenty of hot fluids like soup, rice water, etc. 4. Take all the foods hot and warm. 5. Avoid cold drinks, alcohol, cold foods, outside foods or drinks. 7. Do not smoke again. If after the precautions told above still you have no improvement kindly consult an ENT surgeon who will look into your throat and check if there is anything wrong. He will arrive at a decisive diagnosis and institute the right treatment that will help you get rid of the problem. A note on smoking: Now that you have quit it kindly hold on to it. It is easy to get back to smoking due to peer pressure and friends. However, once you become addict to it there is no going back. Also, it takes a few years for the damage to the lungs and throat to become severe enough to cause cancer. However, only if you have a strong will power will you be able to quit it completely once you restart your habit.

Surgery for obesity is considered as a treatment option for patients with a BMI (body mass index) of 40 kg/m2 or greater who have tried but failed an adequate exercise and diet program and those with obesity-related comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea, etc. It has few long-term side effects, such as a possible need for reoperation, gallbladder disease, and malabsorption. More importantly, you will have to still control over eating and exercise even after surgery. I would not recommend surgery. It would be better to consult a psychiatrist to help you get over your eating disorder and naturally help with your weight issues.

In everyday life it is manageable, but the attacks cause some unreasonable thoughts and ideas to form. I have heard about the use of Benzodiazepines for anxiety. Can they be taken to stop panic and anxiety attacks without needing consistent everyday dosages? During panic or anxiety attacks, I usually feel very worthless and in some cases try to or think about hurting myself. Generally, my anxiety tends to do with social situations where I feel like I am not liked or if I said something wrong. I have visited a counselor in the past, very briefly. Ironically my anxiety was worsened with the guilt of therapy being very expensive so I stopped seeing her.","Doctor":"Hello. Anxiety and panic attacks are extremely common and 15 to 20 percent of people suffer from this issue at some point in their lives. Standard treatment for anxiety is the use of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) type of medicines. They are usually given for two or four months and then stopped slowly by tapering it off. They take two weeks to usually start taking the effect. Till then low dose Benzodiazepines can be used. I do not recommend the use of Benzodiazepines which you are considering since it just takes care of symptoms of anxiety and the intervals at which you will need to take it will reduce as you keep on using it and eventually it will lead to addiction. This is because withdrawal from Benzodiazepines will produce the same symptoms as that of anxiety. Also, consider doing deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation along with medicines."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old.

Originally, my husband has a problem with 1% morphology. But, now I a have poor ovarian reserve. I am 39 years old and my AMH was .24. However, my FSH was 5.5 last time. AMH was not repeated. I was stimulated with the maximum dosages and only produced three eggs which all produced embryo's (I do not know the quality, only that one had progressed normally by day 3). We did a day 3 transfer. On the second day after the transfer, I had what I can only describe as scab-like discharge about the size of a tear. One the sixth day, I finally left the house and started to resume so level of normal activity (no heavy lifting) and that afternoon I had a very bright red urine flow like a small amount of blood pass when I used the bathroom. I thought that it might have been implantation bleeding, but clearly not. I want to try IVF again, but I am afraid of the same results. In doing research, I found a book that suggests many environmental factors such as BPA and phthalates can play a part in egg quality, quantity and affect the sperm as well. The book suggests waiting three to four months prior to beginning IVF to get the full effect of supplements recommended as well as let the harmful chemicals leave your body. My questions are given my numbers, in your opinion, will my number of eggs change drastically while waiting or should I be normal? Should I retest my AMH before making this decision? Also, is there any way for me to preserve my eggs (not menstruate) until the month before the IVF procedure. My thought was to take birth control pills for three months (and not take the sugar pills). Is this safe? Can it be done? What are the repercussion? Finally, Based on our numbers, would you recommend that we use donor eggs instead of trying another cycle? This time around will have to be the last as we do not have any money after this one. It is critical that we make the right decision.","Doctor":"Hi. Looking at your case history, (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it would better to go for donor eggs. Ovarian reserve decreases with age and retesting for AMH (anti-mullerian) is not going to affect the outcome (increase ovarian reserve), so no point in retesting AMH. By taking OC (oral contraceptive) pills continuously, you cannot halt a decrease in ovarian reserve (loss of eggs). Menses is just an indicator of loss, actually a woman loses 400-600 eggs per month irrespective of whether she gets menses or not. What you see on ultrasound is just loss of dominant follicle, the loss of those 600 follicles cannot be seen, it can be perceived indirectly by decrease in AMH, increased requirements of hormone injections during IVF (in vitro fertilization), reduced number of eggs retrieved and low pregnancy rate. One more effect of advanced age would be increased risk of Down's syndrome in the baby if you try with your own eggs. So considering your advanced age, low AMH, poor response to stimulation, low number of embryos formed in the last cycle and increased risk of Down's syndrome with own eggs I would suggest to go for donor eggs."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Recently, I received a letter stating I am no longer eligible to donate platelets anymore. I can donate whole blood and double red cells only. They said the reason is that I have white blood cell antibodies which can occur in response to pregnancy. The issue is I am a male. If I recall correctly from my biology class, males do not get pregnant which leads me to think this is something else. I tried asking them more details but they were vague, or maybe uninformed as to why these antibodies seen in male, when they themselves said it was often seen in pregnant women. Internet searches prove fruitless. I cannot be the only male that ran into this. The only other thing I can think of is possibly cancer only because I remember reading somewhere that if a man were to do a instant pregnancy test and it is positive, it is an indication of maybe being cancerous. I do not know, some insight into this is appreciated. I am currently taking Levocetirizine and Atarax when needed.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: I can assure you that there is no cancer or even suspicion of that. Any patient with suspected cancer or with cancer, unless completely cured, will not be asked to donate any component. You are still eligible to donate whole and double red cells, which is good. There are numerous conditions, like viral infections, which can lead to a condition called as autoimmune disease or autoantibodies maye without symptoms of autoimmune disease. Maybe secondary to an infection, you might be having antibodies, against WBC (white blood corpuscles) or platelets. You are asked not to donate WBC or platelets because there is an antibody, which could damage the recipient WBC or platelets, which can reduce the efficacy of the donation and complicate management. Your blood test is not attached, however, I think it will be normal. If you are looking for any antibodies, they are numerous. Common ones like rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA antibody, and anti-phospholipid antibody may have been screened. If the type of antibody is known, further opinion will be possible. I hope this helps.

Many times, anxiety and depression coexist and it leads to the symptoms you have been experiencing. Moreover, the body heals in sleep and that is also disturbed for you, so that is not allowing you to recover.

From your given history of breastfeed, I can understand that your baby is still quite small and so I would suggest until he or she is at least three to four years of age before trying to conceive again. This is so that in between deliveries your body needs time to recover and repair itself. If you get pregnant too soon it will adversely affect your baby. As your cycles have not yet regularized it implies that you may not be ovulating regularly. This can happen sometimes during breastfeeding. It will resume order on its own. I would suggest you start the following iron and calcium tablets as well as folic acid. 1. Tablet Livogen XT once daily at night with lemon water. 2. Tablet Calcimax 500 mg once daily. 3. Tablet Folvite 5 mg once daily if you are planning to conceive. Please continue to breastfeed your baby regardless of whether your periods come or not.

My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one. I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager. I suffered minor but disruptive withdrawal symptoms physically and mentally for about two weeks and then they subsided but panic attacks continued to occur at random every day and my GAD symptoms increased to the point where CBT methods were not working. Then last month, the script was back to 4 mg per day normal dosage. I thought yes, back to normal. But again this month the script was back down to 3 mg per day which means I am going to experience a minor hell again. I am a defense and aerospace engineer who works on a contract basis through an agency and the client had noticed a drop in my performance before month but back to normal last month, now they are going to see it again and I will probably lose the contract job. I also started online system engineer classes and I am freaking out over being able to handle the exams and homework as I typically work on the class at night and am now without my evening dose. I again asked for an explanation and was not given any. My question is a 25% cut in dosage physically dangerous and I am well aware of the strong psychological addition issues, so will this settle down before my career and social life and general well being take a hit and I revert to hiding in my apartment with my dog and my employer and friends will give up on me.","Doctor":"Hello. There are a few clarifications and advice that I need to make. Reducing the dosage of Alprazolam results in Alprazolam withdrawal.

The anxiety of withdrawal is quite similar to your panic and generalized anxiety and it is difficult to make a difference between the two. Withdrawal anxiety will reduce over time. I do not think that your disease will worsen because of this to the initial level but the withdrawal will cause distress for a few weeks. I recommend using more nonpharmacological therapies like relaxation training during this period. Ask your doctor to avoid making sharp changes in dose and consider adding drugs like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), etc. Breaking your tablets and taking the pieces in such a way so that you reduce the inter dose interval without changing the dose. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I just got all four of my wisdom teeth removed two days before and I have a bad taste in my mouth that tastes like sour dough but more like metallic. There is not really any pain there, my jaw is just sore from being held open for about an hour but the taste has been happening for about a day and a half. I am worried that it may be an infection even though I have been carefully brushing my teeth twice a day and using a lukewarm saltwater solution. Is there really anything for me to worry about when it comes to that and is there a way to get this horrid taste out of my mouth so I can stop losing my appetite? I am also on contraceptives so that is why I am a little worried that it may be a dry socket but I do not have the excruciating pain which is what confuses me.","Doctor":"Hello. It is very strange that you have all your wisdom teeth removed at the age of 14. These teeth normally start to erupt or come through at the age of 18 years or later when they start to cause trouble and we think of getting them out. Anyway, if you had all the four removed or even one of them and had the wound closed with stitches, check in the mirror and see if the stitches are still there, in which case you are unlikely to be having a dry socket. If you, however, find the socket or the hole that was holding your tooth open, it is more likely a dry socket and it is best to get back to your dentist where you had the operation to get it cleaned and covered with a dressing. Until then, continue brushing your teeth and rinsing your mouth with salty lukewarm water, or you may use an antiseptic mouthwash such as Listerine or Chlorhexidine instead."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question about syphilis. I am 29 years old, female. I am not sexually active but I got engaged recently and my fiancé had previous relationships. He only kisses me sometimes which I am worried that by kissing some disease might be transferred to me from him. I got skin rash on my palms and feet 5 days ago. And when I was searching I came across syphilis. Can syphilis be transmitted through a kiss? I went to a doctor and he told me it is a skin virus HFMV and gave me antibiotic cream. I did not mention the kissing part to him. But he took blood test, crp was normal, also blood count test was normal. I did not mention this to my partner yet. I am really worried that it could be some other disease.","Doctor":"Hello. Syphilis cannot be transmitted through kissing. It is only transmitted through oral, anal and genital sex. However, syphilis can cause oral ulcers. If you kissed someone with an active oral ulcer, then the risk of getting syphilis through kissing may occur. Is there anything else I can help you with? Or anything that is not clear to you? I would gladly clarify them."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with parkinson last year at the age of 45. I am on Azilect since then. My symptoms are mild, stiffness, lately I did not sleep well and I suffer from RLS about 4-5 nights per week. I do sport but everything which required quick movement, I am not able to do it well. My neurologist suggested that I start sifrol ER 0.26 mg, should I start or not? I have a Neupro patch samples 2 mg which I tried 2 days ago, I sleep better and have more ability to move quickly, so I see the difference but I feel headache little bit. Should I start treatment with Agonistes dopaminergic? What is the best first treatment for early onset in my case? Is there Neupro 1 mg , could I take Neupro 2 mg each two days?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, in young persons, it is recommendable to start treatment with IMAO (which you are already taking, Azilect) and a dopamine agonist. In the this regard, both Neuropro and Sifrol ER would be good treatment options. Dopamine agonists can help improve RLS too. You can increase the dose of Neuropro to 2 mg daily after two weeks. Headache and increased sleepiness are common adverse effects of this drug. If you do not tolerate it you can switch to Sifrol ER."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Hope you are fine and doing well. My mother has been diagnosed grade 4 breast cancer last month. She had abscess drainage last month on left breast. So now she is taking Femara 2.5 every day and took Zometa 4.0 mg recently as per doctor's advise. So the next day she felt sick like fever, the next day she was felling weakness and then lost consciousness temporarily for 30 seconds. Then we took her to the emergency. They did some tests which they found the sugar level was 331, PO2 level was 18.4, PCO2 was 26.8, and now she is fine and under treatment. So doctor, I selected you as our second opinion and I will keep following up with you concerning her treatment. I am attaching all the reports and doctor's advise which we received here. Please check the reports and doctor's note and advise in detail.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through all the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like she is having a metastatic inflammatory breast cancer with lung and bony metastasis. My recommendations: She needs to control her diabetes with diet, exercise and medication. Consult a diabetic clinic or endocrinologist. Replace zometa to Denosumab if possible, as her kidney may be suffering from diabetic nephropathy. Denosumab is more effective and comparatively safe for kidneys After denosumab she needs calcium and vitamin D supplements. Breast abscess once drained can recur, so doctor should examine it at every visit. Also in case of fever. One possibility may be reaccumulation of abscess. As She had an episode of temporary loss of consciousness. It can be related to sudden drop of Calcium after Zometa or can be related to some brain pathology, if she will develop same symptoms one more time, she should do an MRI brain with contrast. She has a multilevel disc disease with thecal compression, need a neurosurgical review urgently. Regarding treatment of Breast Cancer. She should continue with Letrozole, but alone it is not enough. So need to add Palbocicib or go for Letrozole plus Fulvestrant. Continue for 2 to 3 months followed by CT scan workup, etc., for reassessment before further decesion."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Symptoms: has frequent urination during day 5 minutes- 1 hour starting from about a month ago, if she wakes up at night she will go pee; she is diagnosed with pollakiuria and cystitis. The symptoms started with gradually more and more frequent urination. She has no pain when urinating or during a medical examination of the lower/higher abdomen. Stool is normal consistency with a frequency of 1-3 days. Other medical condition: General condition is okay, she has constant small pain around the belly button since she was little, unconnected to what she eats, time of the day or stool/pee; she is used to ignore it; she has a light form of vulvitis meaning it gets red and starts scratching so in order to fix this we use a dermatologic creme recommended by a dermatologist: Cicalfate; before bed each day, we wash her and use the creme; and the skin returns to a normal aspect if we keep using the creme; we tried other cremes as well, mostly they work but if we stop the treatment it starts inflammation again. There is no kind of liquid or secretion from vagina.","Doctor":"Hi. The child has only day time frequency. If she wakes up, then she voids. This is very significant history. This means there is no organic disease. A diseased bladder will lead to frequency day and night. No constipation, normal urine examination, normal ultrasound findings. Such frequency is transient behavioural issue. Do not pay attention to her demand to pass urine. Neither positive nor negative response. Stool habits are important, avoid constipation. During this transient period of symptoms: may give tablet Oxybutynin 5 mg extended release after breakfast. If persistent symptoms repeat urine analysis (no need of culture if no significant pus cells/ leukocytes)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 17-year-old male. I have an extremely poor back posture. It came from forever not keeping my back straight and watching tv, reading, and other sedentary activities that leave my back hunched over. Now, despite being skinny, my core is lopsided, there is no tone whatsoever, and I imagine it had done a lot of mental effects as well. I would also like to mention that I cannot push out my belly and breathe deeply without hurting my lower back. When I try to stand up with correct posture, I shake uncontrollably as if I have no stability. I want to know if there is any possible program to help with this to get me back on track physically? Are there ways for me to recover from the mental and respiratory effects too? I have pictures of me to give you an idea of what I am dealing with. What exercises can I do to develop muscles here?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Yes, you can get back to normal if you start now. Your back does not look too bad. You need to start an exercise program called 1. McKenzie back stretching exercises. 2. McKenzie back strengthening exercises. 3. Core strengthening exercises. 4. Shoulder deltoid strengthening and trapezius strengthening exercises. These exercises will help you with all your problems. Also, start yoga and breathing exercises slowly and then build up. Do all this under the supervision of a physiotherapist. This will really help you. I hope this helps. Exercises Follow up after one week of starting exercises to tell me about the improvement, so that I can change the level of exercises."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor. I am 35 years old. My triglycerides are 628. I am taking Adilip 135. But since I have started taking the medicine I have lost my appetite i.e, I do not wish to eat anything and I am feeling heavy stomach always. Simultaneously, I am having extremely dried lips round the clock. I have started using Olive oil in my food. I take one glass of milk (dairy non-creamy) daily. My diet is three chapatis in the morning, five chapatis in the noon, one bowl of roasted chooda in the evening, three to four chapatis at night and I glass of milk. I take approximately 1.5-2 liters of water in a day. Kindly suggest me why I am having dry lips and loss of appetite? Do I need to change my diet?","Doctor":"Hello. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concerns. What about the family history of high cholesterol in your family? Is there family history of diabetes in your family? Is there heart disease history in family? Anybody in your family have diabetes? Are you a diabetic? If not ever got screened for diabetes? Do you have hypertension? If not, have you ever screened for it? Any other medications you are taking for any reason? The symptoms you have may be due to: Side effects of the Fenofibrate you are taking for hypertriglyceridemia. Diabetes also leads to the issues you have. Fasting lipid profile. Fasting blood sugar levels. (Do not just tell me the triglyceride levels. Make a picture of the reports, and please upload them in a follow up query along with the aforementioned asked details in the history). Your best treatment is lifestyle modification. Add exercise in your routine life. Jogging for 10,000 steps at a healthy pace daily will lead to a fair decrease in your triglycerides levels. Olive oil is also good. Canola oil is also a good option for cooking. But try to cook in non stick utensils without using more than a few drops of oil. No meats, fried food, fast and junk foods, beverages, alcohol, and cigarettes. No added salts and sugars. No spices and caffeinated drinks for you. Avoid cheese, yogurt, ketchup, etc. You need to change the diet. One chapati for breakfast and one for lunch, half chapati at dinner. You are taking extra diet. Our diet makes cholesterol. Not only fatty and oily meals lead to the production of cholesterol, but also the sugars, carbohydrates, and proteins (amino acids) also lead to the manufacture of de novo cholesterol through a metabolic process called metabolic cross-talk. Take salads, vegetables, and fruits. Fish is better for protein intake."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a tingling pain all over my body for weeks. The pain, however, is mainly located in my chest. I have almost had any heart disease ruled out. Can a bad cough for a few weeks cause subluxation? Should you be able to feel a subluxation? Do all vertical subluxations show up on x-rays? What is the rate of patients who come into chiropractic treatment with subluxations? And can subluxation cause deep chest pain or pain in various areas of the body?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, cough can lead to rib head subluxation, although not a common mechanism of subluxation but cases are seen in patients with vigorous coughing episodes. Careful palpation of the region can point to the abnormality, they usually go back into place on their own, if not they should be best dealt by a chiropractor or orthopedic surgeon. Self-adjustment techniques are available over the internet by videos ad images but a lot of people find it hard to learn or perform it during the first instance. Rib subluxation is usually anterior or posterior, hard to visualize on x-ray and are mainly clinically diagnosed from history and examination. These subluxations come quite often to chiropractor or orthopedic surgeon but do not cause pain in various areas of the body or tingling all over the body.

But as my pregnancy started, I got a cough with white phlegm. I wanted to avoid medicines during the first three months of pregnancy but due to late night coughing and phlegm I went to see a gynecologist. At first, she tried to control my cough through a mild cough syrup with ivy leaves but cough does not go away. Then my gynecologist asked me to visit a pulmonologist after a detailed checkup I was diagnosed with bronchial asthma. He advised me to take Budesonide with Formoterol dry powder inhaler and Montelukast sodium. I am feeling better nowadays. I do not have a cough now. I do visit my gynecologist for a monthly checkup and she knows that I am taking dry powder inhaler for bronchial asthma. This month my gynecologist advised me to take Rejuva tablet that contains vitamin D and K, it is a kind of nutritional supplement for bone health and Fiore-f tablet for iron deficiency. My Hb is 9 nowadays. My question is: Is it safe to take iron tablets and nutritional supplements while taking bronchial asthma medicine? I am afraid that may be due to iron I will get cough again. Secondly, I am extremely worried due to the reason of diagnosing bronchial asthma in pregnancy. I am taking medicine for asthma and I have heard it affect the unborn baby in terms of low birth weight. But my asthma is under control due to this medicine and I am feeling much better nowadays. I visit my gynecologist monthly for baby growth and she says it is perfectly fine. Note: I cannot take dairy products, citrus fruits, and rice because I got cough and throat irritation due to bronchial asthma.","Doctor":"Hi. You should continue bronchial asthma medicines. As it is required to control your symptoms and to make you healthy. If you do not take it then the effect on baby can be worse than while you are taking. As baby growth is fine do not worry about it. Iron and calcium are also minimum requirements during pregnancy and if you do not take it and your Hb is down during delivery then it can be very dangerous if you bleed more. So it is required during pregnancy. And, mostly it will not have any effect on bronchial asthma."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have observed a white smegma on my penis head.

Four teeth and top gum become numb for the past eight days. I can bite my teeth though I feel numb. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Do you find any changes in the way your teeth rest? Do you find any tooth that hits when you bite on? Any tooth sensitivity? Any fractured or chipped tooth? This is not normal and you need to visit a dentist straight away and get your jaw and front teeth x-rayed. The dentist may check for the vitality of those teeth. If the teeth are vital (has sensation) and is disturbed, you will require a splinting procedure that will hold your front four teeth in position for the next two weeks. If the teeth had lost its vitality (no sensation), you may require a root canal procedure to remove the clotted blood from inside the teeth. This procedure prevents a future color change of your front teeth due to clotted blood. The injured front teeth get discolored in the future if left untreated. Please visit as soon as possible and get it checked because if there was clotted blood inside the injured teeth or if the teeth are slightly disturbed, this could cause complications like cysts or jaw issues in the future.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from hypothyroidism for the last seven years and your current medication is Levothyroxine 75 micrograms daily, but last Friday you took double dose of Levothyroxine that was 150 micrograms and felt nervous with increased heart beat and joint pain. At first let me ensure you that taking an extra dose of Levothyroxine by accident is unlikely to harm you. You get side effects such as rapid heart beat, chest pain, sweating, nervousness, etc. They may not develop at once, it may be several days before they come on. These side effects that are resulted from over dose will be subside over time and basically no treatment is needed. Normal range for TSH level is 0.4-4 mU/L.so your recent TSH level is within normal limit. As your last year TSH level was 0.55 mU/L and recent result is 2.6 mU/L which is within the normal limit, so continue your current dose of Levothyroxine. No dose adjustment is needed. Now you are suffering from weight gain, puffy eyes, hair loss, etc., if these are resulted from the side effects of Levothyroxine then they will be subsided soon. Please monitor your blood pressure and do investigations like with CBC (complete blood count), RBS (random blood sugar), and S.creatinine level to exclude other causes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an experience with a tooth as a child that I have never received an answer.

I was not sure what was happening inside my mouth and realized about 3/4 of a molar baby tooth was gone and I was spitting out hundreds of small pieces of the tooth.

When did it happen (at what age)? How many molars? Any history of bottle feeding? Diet history? History of dental checkups and dental treatments had during that period? More history of the details would help. It could be tooth demineralization caused by occult caries or backward caries. This cannot be diagnosed clinically by the dentist and may not be apparent to our eyes. It can only be seen in a radiograph. Primary or baby teeth are more prone to decay even if well maintained. If not decay, the baby molar could have demineralized and become weak enamel by birth. Sometimes medicines taken by mother during her pregnancy (typically during the in-vitro formation of that tooth bud) could have caused this demineralization, if not decay. But the most common likelihood is by hidden decay. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Is this HPV or vestibular papillomatosis?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It is vestibular papillomatosis. But tell me the answers to some questions. Since when it is present? Painful or not? Is it also present in areas other than mentioned in the photo? If it is since childhood, not painful, and not present anywhere else then, it is vestibular papillomatosis. There are many thoughts on the condition and some also believe that it can be caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). It is a debatable issue. So if you are confused with two or three opinions then you can go for biopsy for confirmatory diagnosis. But as I said it is vestibular papillomatosis on the first look, with symmetrical spread only on labia."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, About 10 months ago after a workout, I had pins and needles on the left side of my body. After months of MRIs and EMGs, I got a skin biopsy that showed you gave small fiber neuropathy. Before I knew this, I got a deep tissue massage and started getting fasciculations. They had calmed down much since October but I will notice them here and there. I always developed movements before I fall asleep. My feet may just move or even my chest, it gives me much anxiety to go to bed. Lately, I have been noticing a little tremor in my right hand and tingling in them when I tried to put in fake eyelashes or hold a pen for a little time. Last week, I have noticed my thumb moved twice. Also, I feel sometimes like my teeth are shaking. A lot or neuros have told me that I am 32 and not to worry about much but they overlooked SFN. I am worried all EMGs are normal. I am concerned now and I have early Parkinson's?","Doctor":"Hello. I have studied your data. 10 months ago, I have a sudden onset of tingling on the left side after workout but with normal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain and spine which means the stroke is less likely. Later you noted random twisting of muscles (fasciculations) with right-hand action tremor occasional. Movements before sleep (hypnogogic periodic limb movements) work up showed SFN but the cause of it not known until now with normal NCV EMG. We need to find out the cause of SFN like autoimmune disorders etc. It is not Parkinson's syndrome as it is not fitting into it. So do not worry about it. It seems some benign tremor fasciculation syndrome. Please answer some of my questions. Any family history of similar tremors? Any painful or burning sensation in palm and soles? I want to know about your blood sugar status, thyroid profile, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), ANA (antinuclear antibody), APLA (antiphospholipid syndrome), ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a unilateral submandibular lymph node swelling on the right hand side of the neck. I had an ultrasound and at this time the lymph node measure 5-6 cm and the onset were sudden with pain. After three-course of antibiotics (Augmentin two doses and Clindamycin one dose), I was referred to have another ultrasound. This was after two months of the initial appearance of the lymph node. This ultrasound scan showed the lymph node had become 3 cm but was still present. So the doctor ordered FNAC. The results of this have come back and there is no sign of metastasis or no sign of TB lymphadenopathy. The doctor has suggested yet another course of antibiotics of Doxycycline and remeasure the Lymph node after three weeks. The FNAC said it was an inflammatory lymph node. Does this mean reactive lymph node? What else could be causing this?","Doctor":"Hi.  I want you to be completely calm because according to the course of the lymph node enlargement, symptoms, and investigations the lymph node enlargement is just an inflammatory reaction. It is not a tumor at all. Just complete your antibiotic treatment then follow up on the lymph node again just for assurance. The lymph node may decrease in size but never comes to its normal size again. This is normal. Now about causes, any neck, mouth, or pharyngeal inflammation can cause inflammatory enlargement of a submandibular lymph node. Even without the previously mentioned inflammations, a submandibular lymph node inflammation can start by itself as the lymph node works as a filter for the blood picking up pathogenic microorganisms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with IPF last week. My two x-rays, two lung function tests and HRCT scan showing that I had scarring. But I am confused, because I feel better than I have felt in 10 years. I have always smoked and had cough for years. I have been on a diet and have lost one stone so far. I have been doing some tests at home such as at rest I can hold breath for 1 minute 25 seconds with relative ease. Breaths per minute sitting at rest are 15 and my blood oxygen levels at rest are between 95 to 99%. Running up and down stairs three times my blood oxygen levels drop to around 91 to 92% and it rises to 95 to 96% in less than a minute. When I wake up in the morning my blood oxygen levels have been around 86% rising to 92 to 94% in around two to three minutes. The other thing is that when I had my second lung function test five months ago I was at the end of a cold or flu. I did mention this to the consultant. Do you think I could have been misdiagnosed? Is it worth me asking for a second opinion? Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. For further information consult an general practitioner online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a concern about my cholesterol levels and the possibility of an underlying condition. I am a 37 year old female with uncharacteristically low cholesterol. I donate blood regularly which gives me the opportunity to have my total cholesterol level tested. About a year ago, I created an online account with my area's local blood bank, where I found they keep a record of your past health screenings. It was at that time that I realized how low my cholesterol was. The lowest being 118 mg which was several years ago when I was in my 20's but, most recently and over the past year, my levels have averaged in the 134-137 mg range. For my age, I have been overweight for close to 10 years. I had never dieted or limited my cholesterol intake. I began researching online for any information that might explain levels this low. While there is an abundance of information regarding high cholesterol, regarding its causes and risks; there is practically no information available regarding low cholesterol levels or causes outside of the obvious low cholesterol intake (vegetarian or vegan diet) or use of cholesterol reducing mediations such as statins. With one exception celiac. As I began to read through the signs and symptoms of this disease, I could not believe how many I had been experiencing. In fact, some of these were things I never even realized were symptoms of anything. One specific symptom however that each and every article I read seemed to use to define a celiac was weight loss or being severely under weight. Months later, I stumbled across an article about celiac disease going undiagnosed because of the misconception that with celiac you cannot be overweight. So, I decided to raise the question with my GP. Unfortunately, after giving the doctor a rundown of my symptoms and explaining my concerns, as soon as the word celiac came out of my mouth, he quickly dismissed this as a possibility stressing that because I am not underweight and it was absolutely out of the question that I could have the condition. He then dismissed all of my symptoms saying, they were nothing to worry about and added that the lower my cholesterol was, the better. In his words, I should be thrilled at how low my cholesterol was and I must have good genes and with that he sent me on my way. For close to a year after that appointment, I too dismissed all of these symptoms. Then, six months back, I was admitted into the hospital for an emergency cholecystectomy due to gallstones that caused me to have a severe gallbladder attack. At the time, I knew nothing about the gallbladder's function or its purpose so, there was no argument from me when the doctor explained that some people just get gallstones and the only way to treat gallbladder disease is to remove the gallbladder. Needless to say, my week at home following my surgery, I spent a lot of time learning about the gallbladder and almost immediately I found information describing the correlation between gallstones, gallbladder disease, low cholesterol, and yes, celiac. This past weekend I attempted to donate blood and for the first time in my life, I was turned away because my iron was too low. I went online thinking my iron counts for previous donations would be noted in my wellness chart and although they were not. My cholesterol result from my previous donation, just 2-3 weeks after my surgery, was down to 128 mg. Would the fact that I am overweight truly rule out any possibility of celiac? If it would, what other conditions might explain all of my symptoms? Are there any others conditions with the same or similar symptoms also present with weight loss or being underweight? If celiac should be ruled out due to being overweight, what can I do to convince a doctor to test me for it?","Doctor":"Hi. I welcome you and want to assure you need not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. There are a lot of reasons for this to not being celiac disease. 1. Diarrhea in celiac is very prolonged and there are watery stool. Not only pale they are greasy and floating on the pan, they are foul smelling too.  2. Steatorrhea is the feature of celiac in which large amount of dietary fats pass undigested.  3. Yes, weight loss is a feature of celiac. I have made my patients get to the same weight or so while having celiac but with a lot of efforts and special diet charts to follow and giving them extra calories in diet and special high caloric diet. If a patient keeps the same diet all the time, she definitely will get a decrease in weight.  4. No chances of weight gain with celiac unless extra efforts put in for that. I do not think you took some more than 3000 kilocalories of diet to observe and that is too for years.  5. You had a gallbladder issue from long ago. Firstly there is only a smudge before the stones appearance. Before getting symptomatic (painful) stones remain silent may be for months to years and during that time the bladder function deranges without getting attention of the patient. Your cholesterol levels were also sue to this fact.  6. Cholesterol is good if it is low. Genes also play a role in maintaining a set range of blood lipid profile. So, do not just worry.  7. No one can remain unnoticed for so long if she has had celiac. Severe flatulence is also a feature related specifically to celiac.  8. Excessive blood donation leads to low lipid profile ranges; iron deficiency and even anemia sometimes. You also had the same and it is due to the same reason.  9. Bleeding diathesis occurs due to the vitamin K deficiency in celiac patients.  10. Other celiac symptoms may be dysmenorrhea, calcium and potassium levels in serum dramatically low, muscle weakness, nerve issues, skin disorders, tongue and gum diseases, peripheral nerve issues, etc.  You may ask your PCP (primary care physician) to refer you to a gastroenterologist and you will not need to convince him. He himself will get you tested for any possibilities if needed. 1. You need a latest fasting lipid profile. 2. Check your fasting blood glucose levels, CBC (complete blood count) with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and differentials. 3. Thyroid profile. 4. Get complete stool analysis.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

My stomach feels stretchy most of the times and I feel cramps too often. A few days back, I have started facing left side pain as well. I do not really know what is the reason for the blood not stopping and my pains. Just to add, I do not have constipation issues because I am having Ispaghol every night before sleeping. The medication I am taking are Sucralfate enema (once daily), Transamin 500 mg (twice daily), Mebever 200 mg (twice daily), Motilium 10 mg (twice daily), Caflam (twice daily), Ciproxin 500 mg (twice daily), and Ispaghol (before sleeping).","Doctor":"Hello. Well, the peptic ulcer disease often presents with upper abdominal pain. It does not present with per rectal bleeding unless some once has a brisk and huge amount of bleeding ulcers with the stomach or small bowel. And the color of stools often appears dark tarry black, if the source of bleeding in within the stomach or small bowel. I understand you have fresh red color bleeding in stools which comes every day you pass stools. Plus cramps and pain over the left lower side of the abdomen suggest few possibilities. 1. Infections with the parasites such as E. Histolytica. 2. Diverticulosis with diverticular bleeding. 3. Ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease causing ulcers in the rectum and large bowel (colon). I want you to stop Caflam (Diclofenac) since this is a painkiller and can cause ulcers within the stomach, small bowel, and large bowel. It can also precipitate your peptic ulcer disease. I recommend you to use tablet Flagyl 400 mg thrice daily for five days, plus capsule Cefspan (Cefixime) 400 mg once daily for five days. I ask you to get the following tests and get back to me once they are done. I would further guide on you what to do next. You should also stop Mebever, Motilium, and Cirpoxcin, they would not be useful in your case. Rest of your medication can be continued.

I had severe pain in lower back on left side shooting down my leg. They felt like electric shocks and it lasted for a little over a week. During that time I had a lot of memory issues and I forgot my son's birthday too. Three months back, I had an episode of double vision. Vision was double out of my right eye, but when I covered my left eye I could see. During this period, my head felt heavy. It only lasted for about five minutes and then got corrected by itself. The next day my eye was very sore. It started to hurt when I look from side to side. I had lot of flashing lights in my left eye that look like shooting stars on and off throughout the day. I just did not feel very good. I am having trouble finishing sentences. The thought just goes away and I forget what I am saying. The next day when I had laid down to rest I realized my left arm felt weird. It was numb and tingling from the shoulder down. I thought I would just take a nap and see if it got any better. I woke up at 5; still it was numb and tingling. Took a hot bath and got out but it remained the same. It felt as if I had rubbed icy hot all over it. It felt very cold to me, but not to touch. By the time I reached ER I was having trouble talking. I could not get my words from my head to my mouth. It was like they were getting stuck. I had CT scan done and laboratory tests all were normal. ER doctor recommended seeing a neurologist. I got an injection of Solu-Medrol. Immediately the following day I was stuttering and even my thoughts were stuttering, the more I tried not to the worse it got. Both hands started tingling and there was left leg tingling from the knee down. At night while I was lying on the couch I had excruciating pain on the left side of my face. My entire cheek felt like it was going to explode off my face. I took 800 mg Motrin. The pain lasted for about 45 minutes and just stopped. It did not gradually go away, just stopped. Then the next day, still felt off and very shaky. I felt hard to even type or text. I cannot focus on thoughts. I had very fuzzy head along with stuttering. My hands, feet, arms and legs still tingling on and off. I have started feeling my scalp tingle as well. Following day had very shaky hands. My hands hurt and felt weak. It felt like I have been holding onto something really tight and just let go. Still do not feel right. Glasses were not helping. Eye still hurts and still seeing flashes of light. Next day, I drank a very small amount of wine that was not even a full glass. Hands felt like they have been hit with a hammer and my scalp tingles so bad, it made my eyes squint and gave a horrible feeling. I have no energy. I feel so tired and could not even cook supper. My arm was too weak to brown hamburger meat. Head feels very strange like someone is pushing on the right side of my temple. It is all still pretty much the same the following week. My scalp tingling, still stuttering, along with a lot of weakness in hands and arms. Left leg has started giving out on me and had fall in my living room. Black out when I stood up. I am still seeing flashes of light. Not sure what night this was but one night when I went to bed it was like my body had the hiccups and my arms and legs just kept jerking. I woke up feeling really bad. Head hurt, eyes hurt, hands and legs are still tingling. Still stuttering, sometime mid day I noticed my thoughts were no longer stuttering. The stuttering was gone. And slowly that day I started to feel better. No more tingling scalp, hands or feet. For the most part this is how it has been since. Thanksgiving I had a very small amount of wine again (not even a glass) and felt horrible again. Scalp tingling, body hurt and even fell into the wall. Other than a few little tingles here and the symptoms have stopped. No more flashes in eyes and no pain other than headaches. I am having some strange red and purple feet and hands.

I am getting severe shin and ankle pain for many days. Even if it is only five minutes of jogging downhill the impact is severe.

Is your acne like bumps only localized over arms? Or do you have these kind of eruptions over face, upper back and chest? If yes please review with picture. With your descriptions it seems you are having keratosis pilaris, which usually localized over upper arms. Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a genetic disorder of keratinization of hair follicles of the skin. It is an extremely common condition that manifests as small, rough keratotic papules, often described as chicken bumps, in characteristic areas of the body, particularly the outer-upper arms and thighs. The affected area may be washed once or twice a day with a gentle cleanser such as Dove or Cetaphil. You can try combination product of Lactic acid lotions (AmLactin or alpha hydroxyacid lotions), Glycolic body lotions, Urea cream (Carmol 10), Salicylic acid (Salex lotion), and topical steroid creams (Triamcinolone 0.1%, Locoid Lipocream), Retinoic acid products such as Tretinoin (Retin-A).

She however did not have chemo or radiation. She has a little extra fat to the lateral area of the breast that after surgery it looked like a small third breast. Right over the old incision has developed a large ulcerative cauliflower-like wound. The tumor is protruding and is very vascular. It currently has no odor, but it is bright red and bleeds excessively once the dressing is removed. She is 86 years old with a history of high blood pressure, COPD, CHF, diabetes, CAD, TIA and pacemaker. She still ambulates, alert and oriented. Also she understands what is going on. We visited the oncologist and were told she will either need to undergo chemo or radiation. The surgeon, who did mastectomy, is recommending surgery to remove the protruding tumor. Which is the best option to do first? My family is very leery about her ability to handle chemo and frankly does not want her to have chemo. We know that removing it does not cure the cancer. Should we do radiation first then remove it with surgery? If we were to consider chemo should we do some cycles first then remove it with surgery? Which option would you say is the safest route? We want to keep her around many more years if we can. Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"Hi. Here are my suggestions: Assuming that you want to undergo full treatment, the best method would be to start chemo and radiotherapy. The cycles of chemotherapy will depend on the medicine chosen by your oncologist. This will reduce the tumor size. Then go ahead with the surgery and then complete the treatment with further cycles of chemo and radiotherapy. Another option is surgery followed by a few cycles of chemo and radiotherapy. The above options are important because if left untreated, the site may get infected. Other complications are of course to be considered. The other option is no treatment at all. Just palliative medicines to keep her comfortable. This way she can live a comfortable life considering that you have said she is stable. Please note that I am just explaining the option. The choice of treatment would be your decision. I suggest getting a PET scan before deciding.

I have seen your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and well understand your concern. You are having lichen simplex chronicus (LSC). It arises because of repetitive scratching or rubbing. I could see thickening of the skin with variable flakes. Lichen simplex chronicus usually described as stable, itchy and thickened one or more areas. However, thickening of the skin occurs on any location that the patient can reach, like nape of neck, extensor forearms and elbows, scrotum, upper medial thighs, knees, lower legs and ankles. In your case it involves extensor aspects of ankles. Cause for LSC includes age related dryness, venous insufficiency like tortuous veins or pooling of bloods due to prolong standing or weakness of blood vessels wall due to aging and eczema in old age due to bath with hot water (asteatotic eczema) are common factors. 1. Age related dryness. 2. Venous insufficiency like tortuous veins. 3. Pooling of bloods due to prolong standing. 4. Weakness of blood vessels wall due to aging. 5. Eczema in old age due to bath with hot water (asteatotic eczema). Skin biopsy for histopathological examinations and serum immunoglobulin E. 1. Lichen simplex chronicus. 2. Neurodermatitis. Lichen simplex chronicus. 1. Apply Xerina cream (Glycolic acid) or Moisturex cream (combination of Urea, Liquid Paraffin, Propylene glycol and Lactic acid). Wait for 15 minutes and then apply topical steroids with Salicylic acid should be applied twice daily for two to four weeks and also take one tablet Levocetirizine once daily for similar duration. 2. Propysalic NF lotion (Clobetasol and Salicylic acid combination) occlusive dressing will be more helpful. The method of occlusion is after application of Propysalic lotion put flat polythene cover then cotton bandage and leave it for whole night for two to three days, occlusion is not need in day time. 3. You can also try injection Kenacort (Triamcinolone acetonide) 10 mg/ml 0.1 ml/cm^2 intralesional at the three weeks interval should be given by dermatologist. Try to avoid scratching.

Then when I had sex the other night this big glob of red stuff came out of me when I got off of my partner. Is this normal? Is there a way to stop this?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your complaints. Seasonique is an extended-cycle birth control pill where period occurs once every third month. The pills are active pills and remainder pills. Periods will occur when you are taking the remander pills. It seems likely that you are taking reminder pills which lead to periods. Periods could be of longer duration when on Seasonique. Breakthrough bleeding is also common in the first three months of usage. The body takes time to adapt and it could also be because of that. Please consult your doctor if bleeding is persistent or heavy. The big blob that you have mentioned, it would have been better had you mentioned the size. Nevertheless, I hope that you did not miss any dose in between. Missing dose increases the chance of pregnancy. If you did miss a dose, please get an ultrasound done to rule out if an abortion occured. You could also get your hemoglobin level tested as this could cause persistent bleeding. If your hemoglobin is low you need to get that corrected first. If all investigations are normal, and still the bleeding is causing discomfort you could stop using Seasonique and choose some other method of birth control.

My weight is 60 kg and my age is 19 years but everything which I eat is like a cold drink which is helpless for me.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand you want to gain mass to your lean body. A combination of right diet and right exercise can help you gain mass at the right places without becoming fat also. It is important to develop mass at the right place so that you put on weight healthily and look good as well. Your BMI (body mass index) is less than what is required for your physique. However, there is no cause to worry. You are a tall young man in your teens (19 years), hence you would have attained your sudden growth spurt a year or two back. Understand that boys grow suddenly in their late teens when they do not put much weight and hence appear very slim. That is what has happened in your case. For gaining mass, your dietary intake should be more than what the body burns. Also, you must do adequate weight training to improve your muscle strength. To improve your weight follow these suggestions. 1. Take two whole eggs in the morning and two egg whites in the evening. You may increase egg whites in the morning or evenings to a maximum of four or five. 2. Drink plenty of milk and eat nutritious healthy home food. 3. When eating non-vegetarian food prefer boiled meat to fried items. Fish is healthier than other meat. 4. Drink at least four to five liters of water daily, even during winters when you do not feel thirsty. 5. Buy some weights at home and start working out. Find out the right exercises for you, you may find it on the internet various home exercises catering to specific muscle groups. 6. When you exercise one muscle group, give it rest for two days which you may exercise some other muscle group. 7. You may even enroll in a good gym with a physical trainer or instructor who can guide you with exercise machines and what exercises you must do. 8. Before work-out and after work-out take a protein shake (or a milkshake in the beginning days). 9. Incorporate a lot of fruits, vegetables, greens, and salad in your daily diet, so that you consume a balanced nutritious diet complete in every way. You can get detailed advice regarding diet if you contact a dietician who we have in our panel in iCliniq itself. They can guide you with the right protein powders, the ingredients in a diet for gaining mass at your age. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 17-year-old male from India.

When you banged your tooth and part of it chipped away, the pulp or the core of nerves and blood vessels that provide nourishment to the tooth probably died. It is not possible to judge this now but your dentist must have done the required tests to come up with this diagnosis. The discoloration that you noticed following root canal treatment could be due to decomposition of pulp remnants left inside the tooth following treatment. The problem can be solved in different ways. You may try first internal bleaching which is a form of tooth whitening directed at the inner part of the tooth. If this fails you can think of a veneer or even an aesthetic (tooth-colored) crown to mask the discoloration of your tooth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is suffering from hypothyroidism and was having thyroxine 137.5 mg for the past four months but on his own started 125 mg from the past two months.

At first, when she was three days old till the eighth day, I had engorged breasts with full milk but later there was a sudden drop in the supply. What might be the reason? Will the hot summer influence breast milk production? Also, I have taken a lot of stress due to the death of one of my relatives. So now what should I do to increase my milk production can I use Lactare capsules and Lactolina powder together? If so how long should I use and what is the dose? I have been using fenugreek since three days. Are there any other natural techniques to increase breast milk production without the use of these capsules? I do not have any complications throughout my pregnancy. Everything was normal then why did this happen to me? I am worried. Please help me because I want to breastfeed my baby exclusively for at least six months if possible until 1 year.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand the problem which you are going through. During breastfeeding period if there are any stressors (like excessive worry regarding the baby, sudden demise in the family) it decreases the prolactin reflex in the body and hence reduces the milk output. There are a few tips which may be helpful. 1) Be relaxed, calm and positive. 2) Try to generate lots of positive feelings towards the baby. 3) Keep continuing with a good diet and adequate sleep. 4) If the baby is on formula feed now, try to attach the baby to the breasts every time before giving formula. 5) Try to find out local causes like inverted or sore nipples if any. These are the few ways that you may try to increase milk output naturally. You can try taking Shatavari powder in milk twice daily and the capsules you are already taking. These things may be sufficient to increase the milk output because most of the times it is the psychological impact that affects the milk output. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a sore throat since january, at first I thought it was COVID-19 and have been self-isolating for a month but no other symptoms have occured. It is nearly June and my sore throat still has not cleared.","Doctor":"Hello. Please mention the symptoms what you are feeling? Any throat pain? Any cough? Any sputum production? Any nose block? Any chest pain? Any acid reflux? Any fever? Are you diabetic? Any post nasal drip? Send me a photograph of the inner side of your mouth showing posterior part of pharynx in open position. Common causes for chronic pharyngitis is 1. Persistent infection in the nose or ear. In chronic rhinitis and sinusitis, purulent discharge constantly trickles down the pharynx and provides a constant source of infection. 2. Mouth breathing is seen in nasal polyps or adenoids. 3. Environmental pollution: smoky or dusty environment or irritant industrial fumes may also be responsible for chronic pharyngitis. 4. Faulty voice production: excessive use of voice or vigorous clearing of mouth throat in some professionals. 5. Acid reflux due to lower esophageal sphincter leads to acid reach the pharynx cause irritation and pharyngitis. Treatment depends upon the cause. Use salt water gargling thrice a day for five days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My scan report reveals: The study reveals circumferential asymmetrical wall thickening of pyloric antrum of stomach extending upto first part of duodenum. The wall thickening is for a length of about 12 cm. Maximum wall thickness is about 1.8 cms in the posterior wall. There is a luminal narrowing with proximal gastric dilation. There is anterior gastrojejunostomy. The thickening is extending along the greater curvature up to the anastomotic site. There is perigastic and omental gat stranding. Adjacent peritoneal thickening is seen. There is a loss of fat plane between the lesion and gall bladder. There is infiltrations with abnormal mucosal enhancement of gall bladder. Impression: Malignant wall thickening of the pyloric antrum of the stomach extending along the greater curvature of body to the anastomotic site of anterior gastrojejunostomy. Omental and perigastric fat plane thickening suggestive of infiltration. When compared to the last CT study the extent of wall thickening has mildly increased.","Doctor":"Hi. The report suggests that there is malignant (cancerous) growth in the stomach that has metastasized to gallbladder as well as spread to anastomotic (joining) site of stomach and jejunum. Omentum (fatty tissue around the stomach) is also involved. As compared to previous CT (computed tomography) scan report the growth has increased and infiltrated deeper layers of the stomach wall. You had done surgery treatment for cancer and also round of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to destroy cancer cells. The symptoms in stomach cancer may include blood in stools, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight and excessive fatigue. In the last stages, depending on the part of the body to which cancer has metastasized (spread), symptoms other than these may appear. It may metastasize to the brain, liver, bones or lungs and may produce associated symptoms.

This happens very commonly, one in four women can have this at any point in their life. Due to any prolonged stresses, sometimes the stress handling capacity of the brain gets reduced due to the reduction of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. The medicines will just replace these chemicals and make you feel better. Medicines start taking the effect in about a week or so and show full effect in about two weeks. Medicines are usually continued for two to four months and then tapered off. Please consult with a psychiatrist for the same. He will start you on SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) type of medicines such as Escitalopram 10 mg for example and with some other medicines if needed to augment its effect."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The gall bladder is a bag-like organ adjacent to the liver where bile gets collected. When we eat food at that time the bile is released from the gall bladder into the small intestine. The patient has the formation of sludge within the gall bladder. This happens when the person does not have food on time and does regular fasting. It might also happen in those who take a lot of oily food. What happens is that the bile acids cannot get expelled because the person does not eat food regularly. If the bile stays in the gall bladder for longer periods then there is sedimentation and the bile solidifies into a semisolid consistency called gallbladder sludge. After a few weeks and if not treated then the sludge will transform into stone. Pantodac is a medicine to reduce acid formation in the stomach and treat gastritis. Ulyses 150 is ursodeoxycholic acid and is given to dissolve the gall bladder sludge and prevent stone formation. Please get liver function test repeated every two months if she is given this medicine for a longer duration. Please continue giving the medicines as recommended by your doctor. Most important is to make her eat in small amounts of food at regular intervals. Since she is elderly therefore the food should be prepared with less oil and made easily digestible. Also, give her adequate amounts of water and fresh juices."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 34-year-old married woman. I had physical intercourse on the day of my ovulation. After that, I am having cramps in my lower abdomen specifically pelvic area. Also, yesterday I had an indigestion problem and I am feeling sleepy for the entire day. My last ovulation date was five days ago. But my pregnancy test showed negative results yesterday. What are the chances of pregnancy considering my age?","Doctor":"Hello. If you had unprotected intercourse around your ovulation period then there is 40 to 50 % chance of getting pregnant if everything is fine. Ovulation can be plus or minus and we have to calculate it retrograde after getting period. If you have a regular period then there is more chance that your ovulation date it to be final. Even if there is pregnancy it takes 14 to 15 days to turns urine pregnancy test to be positive. You have to wait for those days. Age is important but more important is hormones releasing in your body and the quality of ovum produced in this cycle, which is more important than anything else. There are hundreds of factors that can affect the course. But at last, we have to wait for 15 days. You can do bHCG (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) blood test after 10 to 12 days. But you have to repeat to see whether the pregnancy is there and it is growing or not. Pelvic pain and indigestion problem can be due to stomach infection or urinary tract infection. Do drink more water. During later half of the cycle, weakness can be due to progesterone releasing in your body. As I said there are many things and many explanations. So the best thing to do is to wait for 10 to 12 days and do bHCG blood test or wait for 15 to 16 days and do a urine pregnancy test. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter suffered a concussion 16 weeks ago. She is still struggling with several symptoms like constant headache, fatigue, trouble falling asleep, feeling weird and occasional dizziness. She does feel a little better compared to a couple of weeks after it happened, but unfortunately, she still feels pretty bad. She has taken the impact test with her doctors twice since it happened, just to track her progress. The first one she failed, but she just took another one this week and passed. Her score was back to baseline. How can her cognitive function be back to normal when she still feels so bad? Does she need to continue to rest as she has been for four months? Does she still have a concussion? She has special accommodations at school right now. Should those continue? Her case is being referred and sent to a neurologist as the pediatric concussion specialist does not specialize in post-concussion syndrome or symptoms and he wants her to get the best treatment possible. We are awaiting that appointment so I do not currently have a doctor who can answer these questions. The only medication she has been taking is Naproxen (Aleve). The doctors have not allowed anything else, but we are hoping the neurologist will prescribe something. She is also taking a lot of vitamins to try and help her energy level. I have attached a file.","Doctor":"Hi. I can completely understand your concern for your daughter's illness. I have seen the attachment. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Sports concussion injury is a new concept in medical sciences. Concussion is basically a very mild injury to the brain which impairs the basic mechanism in which a brain functions under normal circumstances. Concussion can be caused by a direct blow to the head or by indirect blow, for example, when an athlete is sprinting very fast and suddenly stops or changes direction leading to the sudden change in movement of the brain tissue leading to a friction between the brain tissue and inner surface of the bones of the skull. Let us discuss the queries asked by you one by one. Regarding how can her cognitive function be back to normal when she still feels so bad? Well, at present her problem is not concussion brain injury because concussion brain injuries usually heals within a few days. Various scientific studies shows that 90-95 % of concussion injuries heals as fast as within eight to nine days after the injury and only 5-10 %,injuries take more than 10 days. So medically and technically it is post concussion syndrome which she is presently dealing with. Post concussion syndrome can develop in a person with a very mild concussion and on the contrary, do not develop in some patients who suffered a major injury which in turn means that development of post concussion syndrome does not depend on the severity of brain injury, it happens in some and do not happen in others. But the good thing is that in sooner or later the person gets cured with time. 90% cases of post concussion syndrome resolves in two to three months and 10% resolves six to eight months after the initial injury and very rarely it may take maximum upto one year but the point is that almost 100% cases get resolved maximally within one year after the injury. Regarding does she need to continue to rest as she has been for four months? Yes, as she is still having symptoms of post-concussion syndrome i.e headache, fatigue, dizziness, sleeping disturbances, etc., she needs to continue both physical and mental rest till all the symptoms go away. The medical reason behind recommending both mental and physical reasons is that doing physical activity the heart starts beating fast and more forcefully leading to increased blood flow in the brain which inturn can exacerbate the symptoms of post-concussion syndrome and can cause the symptoms to reoccur. Similarly performing cognitive activity and even mental activities like thinking use energy in the brain and can slow the recovery process of post-concussion syndrome Regarding does she still have a concussion? No, she does not have concussion now. As I have already explained that in almost all cases, concussion injury heals within 10 days. Her primary concussion injury has healed and presently she only has the symptoms of post-concussion syndrome. Regarding her special accommodations at school right now. Yes, she should continue and follow those special accommodations till all her symptoms of post-concussion syndrome subside and go away, otherwise as I explained above, any physical or mental stress can delay the recovery and can re-trigger the symptoms repeatedly. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. I have mild lower back abdominal pain, lower back pain , and pressure on the bladder area. My local dr. diagnosed me with IBS after doing CT Scan (ethnography oral and IV contrast) , urine, stool and blood test. The CT scan showed everything was normal and urine, stool and blood tests also normal. He said take these 2 medicines. 1 - duSPATALIN 200mg twice daily, and 2 - DOGMATIL 50mg twice daily. When I read the side affects of DOGMATIL 50mg, it has a lot of side affects for which I am a bit scared of. My question is should I be taking DOGMATIL 50mg?","Doctor":"Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. Well Dogmatil is not otherwise indicated in irritable bowel syndrome, it is better given and effective if someone who has upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, or early stomach fullness, frequent belching. IBS is more a problem with small and large bowel, not stomach otherwise. So, since you do not have any symptoms suggestive of stomach involvement, I suggest you to refrain from use of Dogmatil. Duspatalin however can be used and very well tolerated among IBS patients. It is basically an anti spasmodic agent, it reduces pain, but can cause constipation. You should remember this while its use. I hope this serve the purpose. Take care and have a good day"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For three years, my RBC has been slightly elevated (~4.9). My DNA results show a homozygous GG genotype for SNP rs12340895 of the JAK2 gene indicating greatly increased odds of developing JAK2 V617F-positive MPN. I have no symptoms and I am in good health. Should I see a hematologist to establish a baseline and periodically monitor for MPNs?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: Numerous DNA mutations are always present and it is difficult to monitor for any specific malignancy. However, speaking specifically, the mutation you have described can be seen in 50% of the normal population, which is very high considering the percentage of MPN prevalence. A higher RBC count can be seen due to high altitude, lung problems, smokers, athletes, etc. RBC count above 6 would suggest a possible risk. 4.9 is too low to comment and the only thing, I can comment is it is very good hemoglobin levels. Based on your BMI, I would consider you to be physically fit and this RBC count should be appropriate. Not to worry, no monitoring is necessary for now. Annual checkup of complete hemogram should be adequate. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,  I have been doing Zumba for six months, three times a week. A month ago, my instructor significantly increased the intensity of choreographies and my shins started hurting after dancing. They hurt all along the tibia, all the time. It is not extremely painful, but quite annoying. I would like to continue exercising, but I am scared of potential long-term consequences. Should I just slow down and avoid some moves (like jumping)? Should I switch to pilates?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query. I would suggest you to reduce the intensity or time duration of Zumba, if possible. Do some warm up exercises before starting with high intensity Zumba dance. You can also do some low intensity Zumba dance before moving into the higher intensity every day. Please have a look below for more informations. Start with warm-up exercises or low intensity Zumba dance before starting with high intensity Zumba dance. Take frequent brakes between the high intensity dance. You may simply stand or sit for two to five minutes in every 10-15 minutes of dance. You may use shin support braces during the dance. This may reduce the pain you get after the dance. Dip your legs in warm water for 10-15 minutes after going home or take hot pack on the shins. Rest in between the high-intensity dance. Shin supports or braces while practicing Zumba. Try the above suggestions and see, if you still feel the pain let me know. You may later opt for pilates instead of Zumba."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, More than 20 years ago, I suffered from anxiety derived from the use of drugs and my family situation, from which I recovered with Deanxit and psychoanalytic therapy. Of course, I quitted cocaine forever. I was in therapy for seven years. At the end I recovered completely, having a full and happy life for more than 10 years. I have a great wife and daughter and very good friends and have a good relation with my family. The fact is that I was feeling very well until about two years ago I began to experiment as if I could not enjoy things. A few months later, being quiet at home at night, an incredible and strong chemical depletion suddenly came over me. It was like a feeling of chemical depletion of the neurotransmitters or something like that in the brain that caused me a downturn similar to when you use drugs. Like when you have a sudden drop of blood pressure. It was not the depression of being crying, feeling of worthlessness, deep sadness. It was these desperate and unbearable feeling. This lasted about 3 days, so I went to my psychiatrist because I could not take that feeling of intense downturn anymore (I have to say that years ago I had already felt those feelings for short periods of time, like a few minutes, and then disappeared, but I did not give them much more importance). He prescribed me Deanxit again two times a day and after four days I was fine. The fact is that he withdrew it a month and the next day I noticed again the unbearable symptoms of the beginning. I went back to the medication and felt good again, but I wanted to switch to a stronger one, following my psychiatrist's advice, because sometimes I was still feeling bad. I tried many others that did not work or made me feel worse. I have tried in between other therapies such as cognitive-behavioral, EMDR, acupuncture and I believe that none comes to the heart of the matter, that it is a serious chemical imbalance that is happening to me and that I cannot overcome and balance. I have also performed neurofeedback, as well as resonance of the head requested by a neurologist and they saw nothing. I am a person who is not obsessed at all with things, very cautious in life and have a successful business for years. I do not usually stress except on some occasions and I consider myself quite rational in general, so I cannot understand why this is happening to me, I am looking for someone who can diagnose my disease, beyond the generic term of depression and anxiety, in which, because of the symptoms that I have explained, I am not reflected. I think that the dysphoria would be the closest, but I also do not feel that irritability that accompanies it. Have you met a patient with similar symptoms before? Or maybe someone to whom you can refer me to understand what is happening here? I absolutely trust science, and I just want to return to the state of normality that I had before all these crises that, I repeat, are so intense and unbearable that I want to die when I suffer them, and that I need to understand what happens to me, having more opinions from other experts.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. You have actually got everything right with what you think you are experiencing. It is dysthymia. Basically the neurotransmitter deficiency, be it for whatever reason is the cause. In males, it usually appears between 30 to 40s. Also, it is not necessary to have irritability to be called dysthymic. Basically, if you look at a figure of 50 between 0 to 100 as normal and the baseline for mood, you are persistently unable to return to the baseline and are always beneath the normal mood, what people call as mildly depressed. This dysthymic period, when an episode of depression is superimposed, is called double depression which is the episodic problems that sometimes occur. The core of treatment here is the addition of a mood stabilizer, such as Lithium. That in addition to an antidepressant will show you the greatest improvement. Basically the antidepressant will elevate your mood and the mood stabilizer will hold it there. Rest in addition to the medicines, you should continue your therapies as advised. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father had cataract surgery yesterday. His sugar levels were fine before surgery. Today he was given a Dexa injection 2 ml in his eye due to inflammation. After that the sugar levels have stayed between 280 -300 through out. Just before dinner, his sugar levels were 300 mg/dL. As advised by our doctor have gave him 16 units of Mixtard instead of 14 which he takes regularly along with regular sugar medicines. My questions are: Does Dexa injection increase the sugar so much and when will the effect go? In addition, he is also putting one drop of steroid eye drops Predmet every hour. From tomorrow, it will be once every three hours. Can this also increase the sugar level? From tomorrow how should we manage the sugar levels? Will the effect of steroids go away? Please see the attached prescription of all the eye drops after cataract surgery. He is taking Mixtard Insulin 30/70 - 50 units in the morning,14 units in the night, Glycomet GP2 1-0-1, Linagliptin 5 mg 1-0-0, Fibator 10 mg -0-0-1, Metolar 25 -1-0-0, Dynapres 0.4 - 0-0-1, Arreno 1-0-1, Ecosprin 75 1-0-0, Thyronorm 25 mg one tablet from Monday to Thursday and two tablets from Friday to Sunday, Cap Uprise once a month.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that your father’s blood sugar has increased because of steroids. As for your questions let me answer them one by one. Yes, Dexa injection increases the sugar so much and it will have decreased effect once your father is off steroids completely. Yes, steroid eye drops Predmet (Methylprednisolone) can also increase sugar level. Regarding managing the sugar levels, if his fasting is above 250 then increase his evening dose of Insulin by adding two more units. If his dinner blood sugar is 250 mg/dL above then add two more units to his morning dose of Insulin and continue monitoring accordingly. If drops to 200 then do not increase his insulin at all and maintain at that dose of insulin. Keep following his blood sugar closely and watch for any signs of hypoglycemia as well like increase sweating or shivering or headache or hunger or cold skin, etc. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"HelIo doctor, I have been diagnosed with PCOD and endometriosis suffering from irregular bleeding which does not seem to stop. I saw a gynecologist last month, she happens to be my regular doctor. I am also planning to conceive so she gave me certain medications that would help me to plan. But the main problem arising is my period does not seem to stop and now it is really disturbing. I am confused with my medications also when I am planning to take contraceptives to regularize my period it would not be good for me I guess. Kindly suggest something which will regularize my period and also help me continue with baby planning medications. I am currently on Folic acid with Metformin tablets.","Doctor":"Hello. The PCOD (polycystic ovary disease) is confirmed by ultrasound transvaginal and there is a presence of a small fibroid as well in the posterior wall of the uterus along with a left ovarian endometriotic cyst. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).   This simply confirms that there is an estrogen depletion and testosterone excess in your body which needs to be rebalanced and that can be done with the help of oral contraceptive pills and Myo-inositol and D-Chiroinositol supplementation for at least three cycles. You have to understand that PCOD is alike diabetes and cannot be completely treated but can be controlled and prevented with lifestyle and dietary modifications post-medical treatment. You need to be placed on medications before you start ovulating naturally which you are not due to PCOD. The presence of a hemorrhagic cyst, unlikely endometriotic too can be addressed with the PCOD regimen. The insulin resistance in your body would too have to be controlled and you need to avoid oily, spicy, and fried foods to an extent along with brisk walking daily with adequate daily water intake. Please do not opt for an ovulation induction cycle as that would be an attempt in vain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I cannot get any SSRI medicine to work anymore after 25 years.

My head feels weird. I just weaned completely off Zoloft three days ago. What new family of medicines do you suggest for me to try for my anxiety? Lately, I can get it under control for four to five hours taking 1/4th of a 0.25 mg of Xanax. I take a Sliver tablet of 0.25 mg three to four times a day or maybe once. Anxiety ends every day at around 3-4 PM each day and I sleep fine too.","Doctor":"Hello. Considering your age, it will be difficult to try a low dose of TCA (tricyclic antidepressant), but if nothing works that is always an option. Apart from an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), there is always SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) like Venlafaxine which is pretty effective for anxiety. Also instead of Oxcarbazepine, you could try a low dose of may be 200 mg of Sodium valproate. Also, there are some dietary supplements like L-Theanine 200 mg which can be taken two times a day or on SOS basis. Finally, instead of Xanax (Alprazolam), you can try Tofisopam which is a different type of benzodiazepine with lesser addictive potential, no sedation or impairment in work performance. Also, consider doing deep breathing exercises daily and when you have an anxiety attack do more repetitions of deep breathing. Also, consider starting with yoga, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation or other types of calming exercises."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I thought it will not come back but then it happens recently then the gums in my second right molar teeth have the red lining and it always hurts when I eat or drink and even when I do toothbrush. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your query. I am sorry for your inconvenience with the tooth. As an expert in this field, I know what is exactly wrong. Nothing to worry it is your third molar. What happens during erupting third molars or partially erupted third molars is the gum between the second and the third molars undergo swelling and pain due to infection. It also makes mouth opening difficult in some cases. But not to worry. Kindly upload an image if possible for more help. Follow these instructions: - Do warm saline gargle two to three times a day. - Take tablet Sporidex (Cephalexin) 500 mg one tablet BD for five days, Zerodol SP (Aceclofenac, Serratiopeptidase, and Paracetamol) one tablet BD for five days, capsule Pan D (Pantoprazole) one capsule BD before meals for five days.

I have also gone blind in just one eye. I just went back to the eye doctor when I had the pressure of 24 and 30. I have been there three times and each time I had a high eye pressure. He at first told me everything looked good until I asked him what my pressure was again because he specifically said my pressure was good when I knew that it was high. He told me that it was fairly high when I asked for it but he says I do not have any optic nerve damage and that it is highly unlikely that I have glaucoma because I am 23 years old. But my research has told me differently that high eye pressure alone does not mean that that you have glaucoma but if you have visual field loss or optic nerve damage with your high eye pressure then you do. So I do not know what is going on? Can you please help me understand and is it possible that I do have glaucoma and should go to another doctor?","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history. The presence of elevated intraocular pressure is called as ocular hypertension. If it is associated with visual field changes or optic disc changes it is called as glaucoma. However, ocular hypertension alone also requires treatment particularly in your case as intraocular pressure is high. Hence you need to consult glaucoma specialist for evaluation and advice accordingly. Increased intraocular pressure. Visual fields, OCT (optic coherence tomography). Glaucoma. Antiglaucoma drugs. Once in six months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old male. I am having throat pain with red tonsils and white patches on them, frequently clear throat, excessive mucus with low and not clear voice. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. From your description I understand that you are a male aged 20 years, having the symptoms of throat pain, excessive throat mucus, throat irritation and change of voice. From perusal of your symptoms, I conclude that one of the following could be the most probable causes: 1. Acute follicular tonsillitis: It is the infection of tonsils. May be accompanied by an infection of the pharynx and upper respiratory tract. It produces acute pain, painful swallowing, change of voice, and throat irritation. 2. Diphtheritic tonsillitis: It is a serious condition where after healing of tonsillitis the diphtheria organism can cause myocarditis (inflammation of myocardium) and nerve palsies/neuralgia. Neuralgia is a nerve associated pain. The symptoms of your case that match this condition are in addition to throat pain, red tonsil are the patches you mentioned. Diphtheria forms a dirty white membrane over the surfaces. 3. Other less probable conditions are infectious mononucleosis, tonsillar malignancy, Vincent's angina. However, the details you have given do not seem to match these. However, I must insist that only when we examine you we can be sure of what the findings are and what could be the diagnosis. You could take a picture and send us for a better understanding of your problem. Meanwhile, try the following. These are just suggestions. I would recommend you to do the following tests for a more decisive opinion. 1. Complete blood count. 2. Throat swab and Albert staining of the swab. Some general measures you can take to alleviate the pain and change of voice are: 1. Take plenty of warm and hot fluids. 2. Avoid spicy, oily, and cold foods. 3. Take salt water gargles many times a day. 4. Take steam inhalation. 5. Take pain killers to alleviate the pain. Only after a more decisive opinion can we provide you with antibiotics or more specific measures."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a lot of irritation on my vagina opening and when I scratch it, it feels good but it gets more irritated. I went to the doctor recently and I had a UTI, however I am still feeling very itchy and I am getting concerned. I am 22 years old and right now I am only taking the antibiotics for the UTI.","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like boil. And mostly it is UTI related (attachment removed to protect ptient identity). Continue taking antibiotics. Can be in healing phase and that is why itching must be there. But you can take Syrup Cital like liquid 2 times a day for 15 days. And can also apply Candid - B like ointment which will help in reducing itching. Do not scratch. It will increase the infection. Drink more water. Keep the vaginal area as dry as possible. If you have white discharge per vaginal then can take Candid V6 tablets vaginally every night for 6 days. If not controlled with given antibiotics then may require to change antibiotics or antibiotics by injections."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have an issue that really needs taken care of. I am not sure which type of medical professional I should be seeing? I have gone to a gastroenterologist and got a colon exam. They said they did not see anything wrong. But I have had this issue for a few years now and it is not getting any better. I seem to constantly have a fecal odor. My rectum area always feels moist and smells constantly like poop. I will be in the shower scrubbing and soaping up my butt and by the time I get out my anus already smells like poop. Every time, I have a bowel movement, I have to either shower or use soap and water to clean off as best I can, even though minutes later it starts smelling again. I clean myself much more thoroughly than I feel most people do but it does no good. I am also really gassy if that might be related. Always feeling like I have to fart or like I need to poop. It never feels like I am able to fully evacuate my bowels on the toilet. I am also very sweaty in my groin butt area. It probably does not help any. What should I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query. You have feeling of incomplete evacuation, smell of stool persistently and also gas problem. I would like to know what is your daily bowel frequency. I would suggest you to check with gastroenterologist regarding finding of your rectal examination which should be done by finger. If it was not done it should be done to check the synchronization of your rectal muscle contraction and anal sphincter contraction as you have mentioned you have incomplete evacuation. A special test called manometry can also help to check the muscle coordination. Regarding gas problems, you can modify your diet e.g. if you are lactose intolerant reduce milk and milk products. If you are taking too much protein in your diet you can reduce it. You can give me feedback once you try this suggestion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The radiologist stated scattered white matter lesions but does not tell the location, or size. They state as unsure etiology or clinical significance. The ordering physician suspects MS due to symptoms like disorientation, incontinence, and body pain. If the radiologist suspected MS would not they state the size and location? And diagnoses suspected disease or kind of lesion? Was this a poor report? Or was he basically not sure of what is going on? I leave it up to the ordering doctor. I have done blood for lupus, arthritis, Lyme disease, and complete blood test.","Doctor":"Hi. The few scattered white matter lesions could mean that there are areas in the white matter of brain which are seen as small pinhead size on T2 and flair sequence. This is commonly from small vessel ischemic changes and is seen usually in older age and slightly uncommon in the young population. The cause is sometimes unknown. Suspicion of MS (multiple sclerosis) is by diagnostic criteria and matching it with clinical examination. There is McDonalds criteria for imaging in MS and if the radiologist did not mention any findings which are under these criteria then it is unlikely to be MS from this scan. The criteria specify that the patient might require a subsequent MRI scan and the new scan is compared with the old one to make a probable diagnosis of MS in you. It is clear that the findings are less likely to be from MS on this scan. Talking about radiologists, every person has their comfortable style of reporting and I feel mentioning the location of the larger white matter lesions would have been good for your ordering doctor. I will not say this is a poor report but surely it can be improved by providing the size and location of the larger white matter lesions. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old female and I weigh about 168 lbs. Seven months ago, I was in the ER with severe lower abdominal pain. I had blood work, abdominal x-ray, internal ultrasound, and an abdominal CT scan with contrast. They found that I had a ruptured cyst. However, for a couple of months now I have had on and off nausea, bouts of diarrhea, some blood in toilet when wiping, and I have started to poop a little more than I used to. Now I will say that my diet has been kind of crazy since moving to another state. I am not sure if I should be worried about what is going on.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand that the earlier severe abdominal pain might have been due to the rupture of an ovarian cyst, form which you have made a good recovery since. As you have already pointed out a change of location and with that, an erratic diet pattern, the focus should be on any infection involving the large bowel which might be causing your symptoms. It is important that you keep in mind the following. 1. Please have well cooked and hygienic foods at all times. 2. Drink plenty of water and fresh juices and visit washrooms regularly. 3. Never skip meals during the day and if time permits, have helpings of fruits and snacks in between larger meals. 4. Control your anxiety and stress levels. This can also cause some of the symptoms mentioned by you. If you ever have diarrhea for more than 24 hours then please consult a doctor for emergency first aid and medicines."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was just wondering how long germs would live on in a liquid lipstick? Around five weeks ago I had a vomiting bug, most likely gastro. I went out on Saturday night and wore a liquid lipstick, and was sick on Sunday. Will these germs still be living in the liquid lipstick and make me sick again or will they have died. Also, if I shared my liquid lipstick with someone who potentially had a cold sore, I am not sure if they get them or not, would those germs live in the liquid lipstick?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I understand your concern. There is exactly not much research done on how long bacteria or viruses could survive in a liquid lipstick. If you have had a gastrointestinal infection, and if your lipstick came in contact with your saliva, the microbes could have gone into the lipstick. How long they survive in the lipstick, and how fast they multiply, largely depends on what kind of chemicals were used in the making of the lipstick. Moreover, different microbes need different kinds of growth environment, so it is hard to comment on that. I would advise you to avoid using cosmetics when you are sick. Regarding sharing of your lipstick, it is never a great idea to share your cosmetics with others. Cosmetics should be used as personal items, just like you would use your toothbrush. Sharing cosmetics can lead to the spread of skin infections. If you think you have shared cosmetics with someone you think might have some kind of infection, I would advise you to dispose it, and buy something new. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I picked up a grade 3 hamstring injury from playing football around four months ago. Stupidly, I tried to play football again three to four weeks after the initial injury which caused me to pull my hamstring again. I have then left it for around two and a half months and I have slowly tried to get back into exercise. I started by cycling which I had no problems with I have also been away skiing and I have not felt any pain whatsoever. However, since I came back from skiing I went to play football yesterday and although I was fine for the majority of the game once the game had finished I noticed my hamstring felt sore. It also is still a little bit sore this morning, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I could easily run on it now no problem but it does feel slightly sore. Is there anything I should or should not do?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. In my opinion, you had enough time to recover from tears. However, a grade 3 hamstring injury needs a bit more concentrated management. I think you should do proper rehabilitation to completely gain strength and stability. Exercises like bridging, single-leg bridges, clamshell, swiss ball jackknife, swiss ball hamstring curls, step-ups, and goblet squats will help you gain stability and strength. Slowly you should start running. If everything goes well then you should start gradual progressive running sessions. These exercises to be done for three weeks and then progress with the next level of rehabilitation. After progressing to full strength and stability and once you are confident then slowly you should return to play. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past two months, I have had a pretty consistent elevated heart rate. Not by a lot but noticeable for me compared to what I was coming from. I cut out alcohol and caffeine and that helped but it always returns. My resting heart rate (I wear an Apple watch) is pretty consistent in the 53-58 range. But when I get up, go up or downstairs, it will jump to 100 pretty fast, then average out in the 80's as I move about my day. When I am sitting at work it is 78-85 bpm. This is a good 8-10 bpm faster than when I am at peak health. I am not sure what is going on. I did a fair bit of cocaine and took some ED pills a few times (with the cocaine) before three months, so I wondered if maybe there is a connection. I have not done anything like that since then. I am a runner, but now when I run or jump it goes up to 150 bpm and higher pretty fast. If I push myself anywhere close to hard I am at 170-180 bpm pretty easily, so I slow down. And it seems my body does not recover quite as fast. So I have stopped running hard and just do light jogs, and play tennis. I recover pretty easily there. But it is annoying as I want to run and push myself. I will go two to three days with no caffeine, alcohol and then I notice my walking around rate is lower, like what it used to be mid 70's. When it is like that I can feel it noticeably, I feel much more complete and whole. I feel great and no shortness of breath. So then I will have a few glasses of wine that night, and maybe a dessert (I like sugar at night) and I will lay down to sleep and my heart seems to jump up to 85-95 bpm for a while and it takes two to three hours before it rests at 53-58 bpm. And then the cycle starts again. I am so confused I do not know what the deal is. Is it the alcohol or sugar? I drink this one type of white wine a lot but I have noticed my heart rate does not react as much when I just drink beer. One night, I had white wine then tequila and my resting rate was like 68-78 bpm all night. I saw a doctor about three weeks ago and they did an ECG and listened to my heart and it showed no issues or irregularities. I do not have heart pain, though I did have a few sharp pains over the past two months maybe two to three times all lasting about one second and then it is gone all when I am lying down in bed trying to go to sleep. I do have shortness of breath due to the elevated heart rate when I am carrying stuff, going upstairs, etc. I do not have pain in my chest, jaw, left arm, etc. Sorry, this is so long but I really would love to discuss this with someone who maybe has heard of this before. To be clear what is annoying and confusing me is that my heart rate will steadily be 8-10 bpm higher at all times (aside from resting rate) for like a 7-10 days before it feels like it goes back to normal. But then there is always something that sets it off again. I never see it spike over 105 or so.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I understand your concern, but I assure you that there is nothing to worry about. It is normal for the human heart rate to fluctuate. For instance, during exercise the heart rate can go as high as 350 bpm in some people it does not mean there is a problem. It is normal. It is also normal for the heart rate to slow down when laying down. But it can increase while laying down in cases where you take alcohol just like in your case. You are having issues with anxiety probably because of the cocaine you used. I advise you to resume your exercise. Start jogging, it will help with your situation. You can only worry if you begin to experience shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old.

The foreskin opening appears to be slightly narrow due to which you are not able to pull up the foreskin easily. This may need some lubrication like KY jelly or coconut oil before pulling up the skin. The boils in the pubic area are due to skin infection. Apply Soframycin (Framycetin) or T-bact (Mupirocin) cream twice daily and take Cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily for five days. This would heal the boils. Avoid shaving the pubic hair, just trim with hair clipper or scissors. Penis head is always very sensitive. I would suggest you get your blood sugar checked once.

Just a month ago, I experienced painful stomach cramps, diarrhea, excessive gas, sweating, and belching with bad taste which lasted for one night. I rested up for two days and felt much better but a cold sore appeared on my lip which again only last a few days. I am not sure if it is related but quite shortly the aforementioned incident I noticed enlarged papillae slightly apart from the others. I was naturally curious so rubbed it with my finger and it did not feel any pain so I just forgot about that. Shortly after I started to feel pain in my tongue, the pain would change location throughout the day and often move to my hard palate. I then noticed my tongue appeared white coated. I started to use oral thrush lozenges, rinse my mouth with mouthwash, gargle with warm water and salt, brush my teeth and tongue before bed (I never used to). After a few weeks, my tongue appeared pinker but the pain is still on and off. I finished the lozenges hoping that would be the end of it but I have noticed today that my tongue again appears white-coated and I now feel sore on the hard plate near the front teeth, also a new cold sore has appeared. I have read and looked at the photos about oral thrush, hairy tongue and so on but really I have no idea what my condition is. I have not been to see a doctor or dentist because quite honestly I am very scared. Reading that white-coated tongue causes can be anything from excessive alcohol, tobacco use right through to HIV or cancer is simply terrifying me. I did purchase a diabetes home test kit (urine) which did not show any traces. I drink and vape once a week but on that day I consume both excessively. Please shed some light and guidance. Photos run in chronological order.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, thank you for the detailed history of your symptoms and photos which you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Before I discuss further about possible diagnosis let me assure you that your symptoms or the photos you have sent do not show anything sinister in your mouth or tongue. Analysis of your symptoms are suggestive of a condition known as laryngopharyngeal reflux disorder (LPRD) where backflow of digestive acid causes significant injury to throat and mouth structures including tongue and palate. In your case symptoms seems to be triggered by an initial attack of acute gastritis and reflux, which may have caused significant injury. Acid can injure tongue papillae causing a coating of tongue, multiple small ulcerations, inflammation of tongue papillae. If the reflux continues to occur it can keep injuring different areas of tongue and mouth leading to migration of symptoms. Occasional binge drinking and vaping seems to be causing further damage to already injured tissue. You may need to take a few week course of anti-reflux medications and avoid drinking and vaping while on treatment to facilitate the healing process.

Recently, he got attach with a brain hemorrhage on the right side, and he stopped to talk and his right side hand and leg become inactive. Slowly with medication and physiotherapy exercise, he recovered somewhat and able to speak. He can walk with rod support and his hand is still inactive. His creatine level in blood keeps on the higher side from 5.0 to up to 8.0. In the last few days, he started vomiting and unable to digest any foods. Doctor advised for immediate dialysis and is undergoing the procedure. Within a week's time, this is the second time he is going with the procedure. The first time it lasts for one and a half hours, and for the second time it lasts for three hours. While discussing with the fellow patient taking the procedure, they said this is a regular procedure and may require on a daily basis also. My query regarding dialysis is if once we opted is it a regular procedure? Please clarify the doubt.","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. No, this is not a permanent procedure for every patient. It depends on the status of kidney functions and roughly we can predict from creatinine levels (just to make it clear to you). If he gets creatinine levels of 0.2-1.2 mg/dL and the kidneys will be doing normal functions, then we can stop doing dialysis as kidneys are now doing their job by themselves. Dialysis is alternative kidneys actually. The job which kidneys do normally, dialysis does the same for the time being until the patient gets normal kidney functions back. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My brother having a problem. When he was 3 years old he underwent an operation in the bladder. I have attached all the summary for your reference. Now he is 25 years old, still, he cannot control the urine for sometimes. Could you please suggest what we can do for this? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. Your brother was treated for a tethered cord with a lipoma in close proximity to the cord at the sacral region. It means that he had a fat-containing tumor in the lower end of the spinal cord. These are birth and developmental problems that cannot be completely treated. At 25 years of age, he can get another MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of lower back done and discuss it with a neurosurgeon if there is any persisting area where there is pressure on the spinal cord or the nerves. Usually, if any pressure effect on the nerves or cord is present now then they can think of releasing the pressure and this might improve his symptoms. If his condition is not possible to be treated after discussing and doing an MRI scan then the only way is to pass urine at regular intervals and avoiding an over distended bladder."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am on dialysis for kidney failure and I have noticed a fluctuation in my monthly blood work for the creatinine and BUN levels. At the beginning of the year, my creatinine was 11 and it has decreased every month to 7. I was also making more urine as I went along. All of a sudden, last month my creatinine jumped back up to 10. I have not changed anything in my routine or treatments. Does anyone have any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello. I have worked as a chief in a hemodialysis center for 20 months. Once the kidneys have failed and the patient is hooked up on dialysis, the creatinine value is always high. At this time we do not care about the creatinine values because once we start dialysis on a patient, it is assumed that his kidneys have incurred permanent damage and he cannot come back to normalcy. At this juncture, we use the patient's creatinine value as a measure of protein intake. If a dialyzing patient's creatinine value is high, it is assumed that he is having good protein intake through diet and high creatinine value is desirable in dialysis patients, since intake of much proteins gives them a long life. When creatinine value drops, we start worrying that the patient is not taking much proteins. So the drop in your creatinine value may be because you have started taking less proteins than usual. In this situation, we advise you to take more protein containing foods. For a dialyzing patient, the most important parameter is blood urea. See what is your blood urea level before and after a single dialysis session. Ideally, there should be a 60% reduction. Then it can be comfortably assumed that dialysis is effective. If you do not achieve this reduction, complain to the dialysis technician. He will do the needful adjustments with the machine. The big factor we have to afraid of is potassium. It should never cross 6. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, It has been seven months since I got my braces on. I got then to treat bimaxillary protrusion. My dentist has placed thin wires and elastics and also extracted four teeth to make space. The space has not yet completely closed and he has never changed the wires. When I asked him when he would change the wires, he replied that he would not be removing the wires. For the monthly appointments, only repairments of broken braces were done. For a few appointments, he did not even change the elastics. Should I continue with the same treatment or should I change to another orthodontist? Please reply as I am extremely worried about the situation.","Doctor":"Hello. As per your description, you are having bimaxillary protrusion. Case told by you needs extraction. In the initial phase, alignment of the teeth occurs. Wire will proceed only when correction happen with previous wire till then the only religation has to be done. When there is bracket debonding or bracket broken in that case treatment gets delayed, so for that purpose you have to take care not to break or debond the bracket. To avoid bracket debonding you have to follow certain precautions in oral hygiene measure and while taking food, i.e. avoid sticky, hard food, etc. Space closure occurs on SS (stainless steel) wire that is a stiff wire.

Over the past three years, it has gotten much worse. I take Lyrica two times a day and Tramadol as needed for the pain. I still have a great deal of pain every day. The Lyrica makes me feel like I cannot think straight and the Tramadol just does not work anymore. I was prescribed Cymbalta which I took for approximately two years. It did nothing for me either. It was after that I started taking Lyrica. I have been taking it now for about six months. I recently saw my provider and he did some trigger point injections which do help in the areas injected. He told me he does not know what else to do for me. I just feel like there are no doctors that want to even try to help people with fibromyalgia. Especially those with which all the current medications do not work. I am terribly frustrated and very tired of being in pain every day. I never get a break from the pain anymore. What other treatments are out there now. Anything new that I may have not heard of? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I work full-time and I just do not want to be so miserable while doing it. Apart from Lyrica, and Tramadol I am also taking Estradiol, Progesterone, Levothyroxin, and Fluoxetine.","Doctor":"Hi. Fibromyalgia is a very frustrating condition, but with the help of the patient, a doctor can treat it. I have treated my patients with all the drugs you have mentioned by managing the doses, but I always ask my patients to do meditation that would help the most in this problem. In your case, I would recommend you to take Lyrica (Pregabalin) at the dose of 50 mg in the night time, which would not affect your thinking process. You should also take Cymbalta at doses of 60 mg per day. Your doctor would adjust these doses according to the symptoms you have been getting as well as the side effect profile. I hope this helps.

DRE had nodules and TRUS shows calcification and volume of 27cc. Path description says reactive and atrophic acini and focally reactive. Does that mean BPH or prostatitis, or is that a precursor to PCa? I have no symptoms of BPH or prostatitis, other than getting up between 3 AM and 4 AM every morning.

I have studied your reports and consulted with my pathologist. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  As per her advice and mine too, your reports are normal, the biopsy changes are age related. In the biopsy no carcinoma is identified. Doing DRE (digital rectal exam) and TRUS (transrectal ultrasound) again will not be beneficial as biopsy has already been done. And results are negative for cancer and BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Biopsy was done because in benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer calcification occurs in 10% of cases. And your biopsy is normal. Biopsy is the choice of diagnosis. And your biopsy is normal. Your doctor has asked for the followup to see the changes in prostate calcification.

It smells like dog poop, I am so embarrassed to say that, but it is true. It smells terrible even after I brush. It has affected me my whole life. Over the years I have had people consistently make comments about how bad my breath is. I have great dental hygiene; see the dentist twice a year, brush twice a day, floss throughout the day, mouthwash, etc., and nothing helps. Finally now that I am a 38-year-old woman I mustered up the courage to talk to my dentist about it and also to see an ENT doctor about it and they both have stated they do not believe it is a mouth or ear/nose/throat issue. Probably about 15 years ago I was on an antibiotic for something and it amazingly took my bad breath breath away and when I had a bowel movement the smell was not as bad either. That is also an odor issue I have, I am extremely embarrassed about my bathroom smells, I have IBS-D so it is a common thing in my life. I remember when I took this antibiotic noticing that it \\"took away\\" my bad smells. I had typical \\"not so pleasant\\" odors but nothing extreme and I could also tell in my mouth I did not have this kind of yucky taste that I commonly have. I was so relieved, but that was short lived once the antibiotics were gone. I cannot remember at all what the antibiotic was (maybe Doxycycline or Metronidazole). I am desperate for advise or help. This has effected me in so many ways in my life. I try not to get close to people when I talk and I avoid my husband like the plague when he tries to get close, I am desperate to find some help with this issue.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query and yes it seems likely that this is a medical issue and not a dental one. Since this is a long standing issue, diabetes or kidney disease seems unlikely as you would definitely have had other symptoms too by now. You already suffer from IBS which could be secondary to \\"acidity\\". The cause for bad breath and bad taste of mouth. Usually dietary modification and medicine are good enough for management but considering your history of breath getting better with antibiotics, you should get tested for H. pylori, a bacteria causing gastritis. If positive for it, follow up for a proper antibiotic course. Also, not to neglect other causes, do get CBC, HbA1C and B/Urea and S/Creatinine tested also. In the meantime, avoid spicy, oily or rich in proteins foods. Increase carbohydrates and use yoghurt if you cannot tolerate milk. Elevate head end of bed. Walk at least 15 minutes after dinner. Do not lie down til 1 hour post meals. Drink fluids with meals to decrease acidity. Eat dinner 2 hours before bedtime. Eat smaller portions for ease of digestion.

He did MRI two months ago and it showed involutional changes, early small artery disease but the above symptoms were not there, there was only constipation, but now after we went to a doctor he gave him two medicines for his anxiety and sleep. But after taking these two pills his condition got worse. Please explain in detail that what is going on with him and can the medicines really worsen his condition? What are we supposed to do now? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I will suggest some of the medications as well as remedies for quick result. First of all, do not be so anxious everything will be gonna alright. Ringing in the ear is known as tinnitus. Please follow these precautions to prevent the buzzing sound in the ear. 1. Avoid excess cold water head bath. 2. Avoid excess traveling. 3. Avoid intake of so much spicy and bitter food. 4. Administration of the cow ghee one tablespoon every day. 5. Applying oil around the ear and on the scalp. Treatment for severe constipation include intake of 5 to 10 gram of the ghee in diet daily, intake of food rich with diet fibers, intake of warm water in the morning and evening. Treatment of insomnia include stimulus control therapy. This method helps remove factors that condition the mind to resist sleep. For example, you might be coached to set a consistent bedtime and wake time and avoid naps. Use the bed only for sleep and sex, and leave the bedroom if you cannot go to sleep within 20 minutes, only returning when you are sleepy. Sleep restriction: Lying in bed when you are awake can become a habit that leads to poor sleep. This treatment decreases the time you spend in bed, causing partial sleep deprivation, which makes you more tired the next night. Once your sleep has improved, your time in bed is gradually increased. Sleep hygiene: This method of therapy involves changing basic lifestyle habits that influence sleep, such as smoking or drinking too much caffeine late in the day, drinking too much alcohol, or not getting regular exercise. It also includes tips that help you sleep better, such as ways to wind down an hour or two before bedtime. Sleep environment improvement: This offers ways that you can create a comfortable sleep environment, such as keeping your bedroom quiet, dark and cool, not having a TV in the bedroom, and hiding the clock from view.

Now it occurs again. What I should do?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Corneal abrasion usually occurs due to a trivial or serious injury to the cornea. It should be treated immediately to avoid a more serious sight threatening complication like corneal ulcer. Injury to the eye. Test for dry eyes should also be performed for recurrent corneal abrasions. Corneal abrasion can be best treated by administration of Vigamox (Moxifloxacin hydrochloride) eye drop one drop every two hourly and Systane eye drops every two hourly (difference between the two eye drops is approximately five minutes). Application of Panthegel eye ointment (Dexpanthenol) along with Zymar (Gatifloxacin) eye ointment at bedtime. It is a good idea to patch the eye for the whole day with a sterilized eye pad to avoid any dust and minimize the blinking rate for an effective and speedy recovery of the abrasion. Avoid cleaning the eye with water, or any unsterilized cloth or whatsoever. If the condition is associated with pain and redness Homide (Homatropine hydrobromide) eye drop once daily along with anti-inflammatory tablets like Combiflam, etc., can be taken twice daily for three days. If the condition does not improve in three days you should consult an ophthalmic consultant for proper examination and treatment of the pathology. Use of contact lenses to be avoided at all times. Avoid use of water. Patching of the eye with sterilized eye pad for the whole day. Avoid use of contact lenses and eye cosmetics. Use of topical steroids should be avoided at all times. If the problem does not improve in three days proper slit lamp examination of the eye should be done by a trained ophthalmic surgeon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been dealing with severe lower back pain, hip pain, butt and leg pain, fatigue, insomnia, hot and sweaty, pain in wrist and fingers, foot pain (left foot my toes are curved down and one is curved to the left).

I have had Arnold Chiari malformation and underwent decompression surgery.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry you are having these symptoms. Have you had any laboratory workups done before? How about imaging studies? There are many causes of your current symptoms and this makes it more complicated since you have Arnold-Chiari malformation. This includes autoimmune condition, degenerative condition and metabolic conditions. I would recommend that you do further testing to understand your condition. I would recommend that you check your CBC (complete blood count), RF (rheumatoid factor), SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) and SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), thyroid function test and FBS (fasting blood sugar) as initial tests. In the meantime, I recommend that you undergo a physical therapy program to include ultrasound, TENS (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation), William's flexion exercise, Myofascial release, joint conservation techniques, range of motion exercises within pain-free range, endurance exercise as tolerated. I would also recommend you take Naproxen three times a day for pain and Ibuprofen twice a day for breakthrough pain. Once you have the results of the tests, please do follow up. I hope this helps.

I have a 3-year-old son and I have been trying to conceive my second child with no success during the past several months. During the pregnancy with my son, I had a cervical cerclage placed, which was not removed at the cesarean section (the doctor forgot). The cerclage got infected three months later after birth when resuming sexual activity. I went to a different doctor who removed the cerclage and gave me a course of Augmentin antibiotic. I had no more infection. However, during my period I would perceive a vague fishy smell of the blood. No other smell during any other time of the cycle. I had multiple cervical and vaginal cultures done (including mycoplasma, ureaplasma, gonorrhea, chlamydia) and everything is always negative. My PAP tests are also normal but show non-specific reactive inflammation. I was given Doxycycline and Metronidazole for 14 days and I also took Cephalexin for seven days during this month for a UTI. However, when repeating the pap and cultures last week, it is still inflammatory with negative cultures. I am also scheduled for a sonohisterosalpingography this week. Can this procedure be done when I have an inflammatory pap considering cultures are negative and the pap is still inflammatory despite antibiotic treatment? Is it safe? Can the inflammation be related to the cerclage somehow? Or can it show in fact some cervical cancer or dysplasia? And if there are precancerous changes in the cells of the cervix (although the pap did not say that) could the sono-HSG actually push them into the uterus and ovaries and possibly cause cancer there? Or am I over reacting? I need to mention my paps were always normal before the pregnancy and the cerclage situation. I am worried and do not know what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not think much. If you have a negative culture and you had course of antibiotics after an inflammatory pap test then, mostly infection or active insects are removed from the cervix. Now in hysterosalpingography dye is pushed inside the uterus and two or three x-rays are taken for tubal patency. And along with that many times, doctor prescribes one antibiotics course as a precaution for prophylaxis against infection. Inflammation can be chronic, can be post-delivery, or age-related. But do not worry if you have taken antibiotics already. Secondly, hysterosalpingography is mostly prescribed to see the tubal patency to rule out any problem related to fallopian tubes. So it is a safe procedure do not worry. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 47-year-old female. I started to have severe joint pains and inflammation around three weeks back.

After extensive blood tests, I was found that my ANCA-MPO (p-ANCA) is 202.55 U/ml and ANCA-Pr3 (c-ANCA) is 40.74 U/ml. What does this mean? I was prescribed Imuran 50 mg once a day.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. I need to clear a few doubts before giving you the final answer. I understand you had some problem which started three weeks back with joint pains followed by high blood pressure causing a nose bleed. I would like to investigate why you had sudden blood pressure rise? Is it due to inflammation in the kidneys or some other reason if previously things were normal? Do you have any history of fever, recurrent nose blocks or hearing loss? Were the other blood tests done like CRP (C-reactive protein), urine routine, chest x-ray, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate)? As per the results, these are the markers for vasculitis. So we need to be sure these are the ones that are causing your joint pains or high blood pressure.

He has wet diapers, passed stools, ate a bit but not much, drinks water and is breastfed. He has a bit of cough (wet) and a very runny nose. We did bloodwork. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. I have gone through the blood investigation (attachment removed to protect patient identity), which is suggestive of viral fever with low thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).  From the history and investigation, it looks like a viral fever which usually requires symptomatic treatment and will subside over a period of five to seven days. Give fever medicine round the clock (four to six hourly). Instead of Nurofen (Ibuprofen), give local brand of Paracetamol 15 mg/kg per dose. Nurofen affects platelet counts, so it is usually avoided in viral fevers. Make sure that the throat is clear, no congestion which is usually a source of infection.  Use warm saline gargles frequently and use soap to wash your hands. If fever does not subside after 48 hours please do visit a doctor.

I did some online research and it looks like a subconjunctival hemorrhage. Everything that I read about this condition says it will heal on its own. But I would like a professional opinion. He did have some eye goop the day before as part of his cold sickness, but that cleared up on its own.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history and the photos attached to the question. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The photos show sub-conjunctival hemorrhage as rightly thought by you. This is because of the collection of blood under the conjunctiva. This occurs most commonly following injury but can also occur in cases of coughing or severe sneezing as in case of your son. This will resolve slowly as the blood gets absorbed over a period of two to four weeks. No treatment is required. Use of vitamin C tablets will help in quick resolution.

The anti-tubercular drug AKT-4 is a cocktail of four drugs namely Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol. I will concentrate on the side effects that have disturbed you now, side effects on the ear and the neurological effects. Most of the neurological effects are caused due to Isoniazid. It is known to cause decreased sensations, altered mental status, numbness, etc. To counteract the same Pyridoxine 100 mg per day is given. Pyridoxine is a B-complex vitamin whose function is affected by Isoniazid. Nextly, Ethambutol can cause some mild neurological disturbances and significant vision problems. It can result in decreased field and accuracy of vision. If you experience any such defects with vision please contact the doctor who prescribed AKT-4 and ask him if Ethambutol can be substituted. Ear side effects are common with Streptomycin (another anti-tubercular drug). But Streptomycin is not present in AKT 4. So you need not worry. Tuberculosis requires dedicated treatment for a long time. Some amount of side effects are inevitable for the sake of curing the disease. Earlier longer therapies were advocated for TB which used to have even more side effects. A good diet, regular exercise, calm and peaceful mind and vitamin supplements are all necessary to tide over the many of the side effects caused by these drugs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old.

It seems like it has changed its shape slightly. It does not look like a popeye. There is no constant pain, but I do get a dull pain when I firmly touch that region. What could this be? Could this be a tendon rupture or tendonitis?","Doctor":"Hello. I have received your query and have gone through your physical findings and my diagnosis and treatment advice regarding this would be as follows. You said that previous night you have worked out your arms, the next day you had pain in anterior shoulder, and pain is not constant. Yes, I do suspect it might be a biceps long head tendinitis. I am saying this because you had more pain in the anterior shoulder. This thing could be because of your heavy workout, sudden lifting of weights, sudden high tensed overhead activity, improper maintenance of posture while workout which could stress your biceps long head which origins from the anterior shoulder blade and lead to pain, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, and minimizing activity levels. I would say that in your case, it might be an acute mild or moderate injury and not severe. My advice would be 1. Please do break your workout for some days. 2. Do not perform any overhead activity. 3. No external rotations of your shoulder. 4. No pulling or pushing using your shoulder. 5. Apply ice for 15 minutes for two to three times a day until pain and swelling subside. If symptoms do not subside, please do consult an orthopedic or qualified physical therapist. There are many techniques available for further rehabilitation. Protocols such as soft tissue mobilization, iontophoresis, ultrasound, tens, stretchings, phonophoresis, etc., can be used if injury is severe and long term rehabilitation is planned. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from irregular periods and PCOS for more than 10 years. I had to take Clomid and with HCG injection conceived my first baby three years back. Now I have been trying for my second baby with the help of Clomid. I took Clomid for six months, with no luck. This month my doctor had prescribed a combination of Clomid 50 mg (from day 5 to day 9, 10 tablets for five days) and Nolvadex 10 mg tablet (from day 2 to day 12, 20 tablets for 10 days). Going through the purpose of the tablet, I understand Nolvadex is for treating breast cancer. I am scared to take this tablet now as it also says that it may harm the fetus. Can you please enlighten me in this regard? Will it help wtih fertility? Please let me know the possibility of having a healthy baby by taking Nolvadex during TTC, will it affect the baby by any means?","Doctor":"Hello. Novaldex is Tamoxifen which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Yes, it is one of the most common drugs that is used for treating breast cancer patients and also certain birth defects are possible if you take this medication when you pregnant. In your case, this medication is being used because you are resistant to Clomid with failed attempts at getting pregnant with Clomid treatment. This is being given in the phase of your menstrual cycle when even the egg formation has not happened and basically to help your egg or follicles formation so that you can conceive with the medications. So there is absolutely no harm taking this medication to get conceived. Recently, few studies have shown improved ovulation rates with Tamoxifen in Clomifene resistant women. However, I would suggest you to please consult your fertility expert again before you start the course and be confident about your treatment and solve further queries regarding the same because trusting your treating doctor is important before you start any treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 19 years old and have had acid reflux for the past five years. I have had a cough and whistling sound (wheezing?) with it for five years and over the past few months I have had rattling in my chest. The doctors cannot hear the rattling, but I feel it mostly when I lay down. In addition to the rattling, the cough has gotten worse. It is much more of a dry cough and it burns. Also, for the past five years it feels like it is hard to breathe, but the doctor say my lungs and says it sound clear. An x-ray was also performed a few weeks ago and they said the results were normal. What could cause this? My biggest fear is chronic bronchitis. I am having another endoscopy soon, but would a bronchoscopy be better?","Doctor":"Hello. From your history, it is very clear that you are suffering from too many problems in your teenage. First thing, I want to clarify is you are having morbid obesity. Also, you suffer from chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease i.e. GERD. So you are having dry cough for such a long duration. The current symptoms you suffer are suggestive of bronchial asthma. GERD is the aggravating factor for your dry cough. The most important investigation to rule out asthma is spirometry also called as pulmonary function test (PFT). Obesity is making all symptoms worse. So you should also concentrate on weight reduction and regular exercise. If PFT is suggestive of asthma, you need definitive inhaler treatment to keep your asthma under control. Chest x-ray may appear normal but dry cough for such a long duration again suggest asthma. Priority should be given for weight reduction. Allergy to dust, GERD, and obesity. PFT or spirometry, AEC (absolute eosinophil count) blood test. Bronchial asthma, GERD. Bronchial Asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids through metered dose inhalers, antacids for reflux and weight reduction for obesity. Avoid spicy food. Needs regular monthly follow up with your doctor to keep your asthma under control."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know about weekly chemotherapy for Peritoneal cancer of 76-year-old lady. Instead of full dose chemotherapy at 21 days interval, weekly chemotherapy is done at a lower dose to have a less side effects. First chemo charged on her caused severe side effects like dysentery/diarrhea. Please confirm this whether this is really fruitful. For elderly patients, whether the weekly scheme is as effective and less toxic. Please help with your answer. I am writing for my writing for my 76-year-old sister suffering primary peritoneal carcinoma. Before four years, one MD (Medicine) while treating her for asthma problem detected by clinical examination a huge lump in abdomen. He ordered for USG of lower abdomen and pelvis. The report says: Kidneys: Both kidneys are normal in size but maintains shape, outline, and position. Cortical echogenicity is increased with maintained corticomedullary differiention. No evidence of any hydronephrosis, renal calculus or mass lesion is seen. Right Kidney=7.4 cm, Left Kidney=7.5 cm. Ureter: Both ureters are not visualized hence not dilated. Urinary bladder: Urinary bladder is seen normal in size, shape and wall thickness. No intraluminal lesion is seen. Uterus and ovary: It is not visualized (removed in 1996). Suprapubic region mesentery is grossly thickened and appears as SOL (10.4X5.4 cm) with displaced bowel loop around it. Impression: 1. ?Mesenteric mass suggest CT scan 2. Bilateral small size kidneys with Grade I renal parenchymal changes. Next seen by an oncosurgeon. He ordered for noncontrast CT of upper abdomen (Noncontast because as her creatinine level was 1.9 compared to a maximum of 1.0 for females. CT scan of upper abdomen done and report shows: The liver is of normal in size and is of normal contour and attenuation. No IHBR dilation. Gallbladder is well distended with normal wall thickness. Pancreas is normal in size and attenuation. Peripancreatic fat planes normal. MPD not dilated. Spleen is of normal size, contour and attenuation. No focal lesions. Sections through the lower abdomen show omental fat stranding and nodularity. The Bilateral kidneys are mildly contracted. The pelvicalyceal system are normal. Adrenals are seen. No evidence of any focal lesions. No evidence of ascites. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is noted. Visualized bowel loops reveal normal in position, caliber, and wall thickness. Scoliosis noted with convexity towards left side. Impression: Omental stranding and nodularity. The surgeon also asked for contrast enhance MRI of pelvis. The report shows: MRI report patient postoperative case of ovarian malignancy (no documents available). Study reveals omental thickening and nodularity (caking). There is a focal protrusion of the omentum through a defect in the umbilicus (? postoperative). Post Contrast study shows enhancement of the omentum. DWI images show restricted diffusion within the omentum. No abnormal lymphadenopathy seen. Bones under review are are within normal limits. Uterus and ovaries are not visualized (postoperative). There are minimal pelvic ascites. On post Contrast study thin smooth peritoneal enhancement is seen with few nodules at places. Enhancement is also noted along the sigmoid and descending colon. Impression: Nodular cake like omental thickening, smooth peritoneal enhancement with nodularity at places in a patient with previous malignancy features suggest possibility of peritoneal carcinomatosis. (advise-omental biopsy) Next core needle biopsy from omental mass was ordered. The report shows: USG guided core biopsy from Omental mass. Microscopic examination section shows deposition of malignant gland formed by cuboidal cells within fibro collagenous tissue with desmoplastic stromal reaction. Impression: Adenocarcinoma Deposit. I have forwarded to you four reports in respect of her for USG, CT scan, MRI, biopsy. Probably she is suffering from extra ovarian primary peritoneal cancer (EOPCC) which happens to candidates whose ovary/uterus already removed. For her Hysterectomy was done some 20 years back when biopsy report was normal. Please also note that her CA 125 is 2948 almost 80 times the normal value. Please intimate me in short whether any first dose of chemotherapy given caused heavy side effects like acute dysentery/diarrhea for her? Whether at this age of 76 chemo with one single drug is advisable? As per discussion with doctors here this peritoneal cancer resembles almost like ovarian cancer (treatment mode also same), although ovary removed some 20 years back.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The investigations conclude the presence of peritoneal cancer which has characteristics like that of ovary cancer. Most patients are diagnosed at stage III or IV and chemotherapy is the preferred treatment. I confirm that the treatment is same as ovary cancer. Chemotherapy protocols are being updated every day but what your doctors have suggested is in the right direction. Treatment is usually with medicine like Carboplatin and Paclitaxel with some patients being given Cisplatin. Dysentry and diarrhea are known adverse effects of chemotherapy and occur in some patients. Weekly treatment is good as full-dose chemotherapy with comparable rates of response. Talking about single drug and multi durg options, every cancer is different and the treatment course is closely monitored and changes made appropriately. Every cancer patient is different and changes should be made after carefully studying the patient condition. In conclusion, as a patient relative you can help maintain a good general condition of the patient and give adequate fluids and nutrition. Side effects are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Even if I get six to eight hours sleep at night, sometimes less than five, I always end up being tired throughout the day. I am always sleepy even if I drink coffee, but when I decide to get some sleep, I cannot sleep. I am 18 years old and weigh about 74 kg. I have severe vitamin D deficiency for which I was prescribed vitamin tablets, which I stopped taking after a year. However, as per my last medical test, my condition has not improved. I go for a 30 minutes walk every morning and I am on a keto diet. My finals are coming up and I need a way to get proper sleep and not be drained throughout the day.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand you are concerned as sleep is vital for a proper functioning of the body. We need to look at a few things like have you gained weight recently or does this coincide with the sleep disturbances you have been suffering from? As I can see you are overweight and this can cause obstructive sleep apnea which keeps waking you up while asleep due to temporary episodes if apnea. So when you finally wake up, you may or may not have a headache and you are drowsy throughout the day. Total inability to fall asleep could be stress-related. Do you suffer from chronic anxiety or stress or even depression? In these cases practicing yoga or meditation can help tremendously. But if you have the former, you need to reduce weight. In order to diagnose exactly what is causing your sleep disturbances, give me more details like is there headache, nasal obstruction, symptoms of frequent stress or depression, etc? I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For about a few months, I have been surviving on less than an hour of sleep per night. For the first 27 years of my life, I have always had a little bit of trouble getting sleep (overactive mind), but I have never had any trouble getting a full night rest (anywhere from 6 to 9 hours). This recent bout of extreme insomnia had nothing to do with the habit (i.e.- It is not like I made the choice one night to sleep only a little bit, and then my habit got out of hand). Try though, my brain simply is unable to let me sleep normally. One day, I could not sleep at all. The next day, and the day after that, the same thing happened. I finally managed to get a decent night sleep the next day, and after that, the pattern of only being able to sleep for less than an hour (if at all) maintained itself. I struggle and struggle to sleep, and then I dream for a little bit, and then my brain kicks me out of sleep, and I cannot go back I cannot even nap. And yet, usually, my mind and body find a way of feeling rested after one measly dream. I ought to feel like a zombie, but most days I feel physically well-rested. I have heard of cases where people who used to sleep well became insomniacs after periods of great stress or depression. I am almost certain that I became an insomniac because I was nervous about starting my new job. The thing is, though, that it does not look like it is going away any time soon. Will it be permanent, how scary is that? I know the dangers of not getting enough sleep and I have tried certain things, like sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, etc. Nothing seems to work. The only thing that helps a little is 400 mg of Seroquel prescribed by my psychiatrist. However, I have such a high tolerance for sedatives that I have to stop it and reintroduce the drug after a matter of days. I guess what I am trying to say is there probably is not a solution for my extreme condition yet, as sleep and the human mind are both great mysteries. However, I would like to have an opinion as to what is going on in my mind, and how it started. I hold the theory that the stress leading up to my new job somehow fried my brain. I do not know in what sense, exactly did the sudden onset of stress somehow deplete some of the chemicals in my brain that are necessary for sleep? Or could there be another explanation or hypothesis?","Doctor":"Hi. You have a unique situation and though I do not have a clear answer to your complaints, I can give you some relevant advice. The first thing to do is to evaluate your insomnia. I would suggest you use a camera to video record your sleep. You can use your phone camera with good memory capacity and place it somewhere higher, so you can see your movements at bedtime. The reason for this is that personal evaluation of one's own sleep is far from objective. I frequently come across patients who say that they cannot sleep while their partners say they do and occasionally even snore. There are phone applications like sleep as Android, etc, which record your movements in bed and can give you a reasonable estimate of your sleep time. Another possibility is that you are sleeping but not getting enough deep sleep. Deep sleep is characterized by slow waves on EEG (electroencephalography) and the feeling of having rested during sleep. That is why sleep study is the ideal investigation for sleep issues as it does an EEG recording as well as a video recording of your sleep. Sleep as android also gives a rough estimate of your deep sleep percentage during your entire sleep. In such a scenario, there are specific medications which enhance deep sleep like Pregabalin which you can ask your doctor about. Sometimes, trying too hard to sleep is counter-productive. Beliefs like I should get seven hours of sleep at any cost and if I do not, it will cause great harm to my mind and body are incorrect and very likely to impair with sleep. These irrational thoughts need to be addressed via cognitive behavioral therapy if you think this could be the problem with you. The most important component of sleep hygiene is if you cannot sleep, leave the bedroom, sit somewhere else and do stuff like reading or listening to music. This breaks the classical conditioning (association) between your bed and inability to sleep. Go to bed only when you feel sleepy. Remember that the use of electronic displays in the late evening could be a major cause of insomnia. Keep their use to minimum and use a blue light filter app on your phone after evening. Try taking natural sleep promoters like Melatonin 3-6 mg which you can find on the internet. This should give you some guidelines to investigate into your sleep and hopefully improve it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I get sick every two-three months. My doctor diagnosed me with chronic bronchitis about a year ago. I get the same symptoms every time the illness flairs up again. The symptoms consist of a snotty nose, fever, shaking, weak, shortness of breath and a persistent horrible cough. I also throw up some of the things I eat and foam when I drink things. I have an inhaler that I plug into the wall and inhale the Albuterol vapor that the machine produces. I would just like to know what else I can do to treat this painful illness?","Doctor":"Hello. In many cases of chronic bronchitis, acute symptoms appear due to infection. So, I would advise in such a scenario to get a hemogram with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and chest x-ray done. If the chest x-ray and these blood investigations show no sign of infection then, you would be treated for bronchitis. Treatment constitutes antiallergic drugs like Levocetirizine and Montelukast and in severe cases inhalers containing like Salbutamol and steroid inhaler like Budenoside. In case of severe spasm and coughing, a steroid like Prednisolone can be used for a short course, after being sure that there is no active infection or pneumonia. If you do not have a severe cough or respiratory distress, and your chest if found clear on examination, then a cough syrup containing Salbutamol, Levocetirizine, Dextromethorphan will help you greatly. Benzonatate pearls are helpful in an allergic cough only, as they just anesthetize the throat and reduce the allergic cough response. But in cases of severe chest congestion, they are not useful. Also, do steam inhalation for symptomatic relief. I would advise you to see your doctor and get investigated. Share my opinion with him, I am sure he would agree to it and would prescribe you accordingly. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 35 years old. I am taking the following medicines for the past seven years, but I am extremely suffering from erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. What can I do?

Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Why are you taking anti-depressant and antipsychotic drugs, that too for so long time? Why these medicines were started? Are you also suffering from some heart problems? Please reply so that I may guide you accordingly. Regarding erectile dysfunction, most of the antidepressants do cause dysfunction. I would suggest you to consult a psychiatrist to taper down antipsychotic medicines or replace with other ones. As for as cardiac point of view, Bisoprolol also causes erectile dysfunction in some patients. Replace this medicine with Nebivolol 2.5 mg, which also enhances erections. You are taking Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Bisoprolol which are usually given for ischemic heart disease, which is uncommon in this young age. In old age, blockage of arteries also causes erectile dysfunction, but in young age, this is less likely. If this problem started suddenly, then most probably due to anxiety or depression. If progressed slowly over years I would advise you to have penile doppler ultrasound done. But before that, I would recommend providing a bit detailed history of your past illnesses, family history, so that costly investigations may be avoided. Follow up with detailed history."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering with headaches, a feeling of pressure in my head, occasional dizziness and tinnitus. I am on the waiting list to see a neurologist, but in the meantime I paid for 2 non-contrast MRI scans 6 months apart, both of which came back normal, apart from the second one picked up a small pineal cyst 6 mm x 3 mm. I would like to know whether these scans are sufficient to rule out a brain tumour, or whether this is still a possible diagnosis given that the scans did not include contrast.","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that two MRI are more than enough to exclude any possible brain tumor (attchment removed to protect patient identity). The pineal cyst may be an incidental finding, as it does not seem to be related to the symptoms that you describe. It is strange that it results in the second MRI and not in the first one. Maybe the radiologist did not see it in the first one. I recommend comparing with your radiologist these two MRI in order to compare the presence of this cyst (if it is a new finding, or just was not described in the first MRI). In my opinion, the type of headache that you refer, coupled with dizziness and tinnitus are typical of tension type headache, which is benign type of headache, caused by a wrong posture and psychological stress. So, there is no reason to panic. I recommend you to perform regular physical exercise, trying to avoid staying before your smart phone for a prolonged time and trying to correct your posture. Avoiding caffeine intake will help too."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

My mother has been suffering from same kind of allergy but her case is not worse than mine. I feel runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose and eyes, mild rashes after having a shower and breathing difficulty also. My heart beat gets faster and rapid. I am also suffering from noise sensitivity. I cannot tolerate loud voices, my heart starts beating faster and I feel dizziness and headache. In my own residential area, I catch allergy for almost 360 days of the year. I am feeling much suffocation and rapid heart beat. Another thing, whenever I get stuck in some kind of mental or emotional stress, my heart rates becomes faster and irregular and at that point of time I feel suffocation too. A nearby doctor suggested me the treatment of nebulizer, but I am not feeling much better.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query and there are two components so I will deal them separately. First, the increased heart rate in stressful conditions: that is anxiety and not uncommon. You can try breathing exercises but if not controlled/or aggravates to full panic attack, you will need CBT by a psychiatrist or psychologist and medication. Best breathing exercise is placing a paper bag over mouth and nose, and completely inflating and deflating it till heart beat and breathing become normal. Now for your allergy: seems to be allergic rhinitis/sinusitis. You can use a maintenance therapy of Myteka 20 mg once a day with once a day Softin and increase Softin on excessive exposure to allergens like dust, pollen, etc."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old. This all started two weeks ago. I started to have some loose stools, abdominal pain (lasts about two seconds, it comes and goes almost twice a day) and grumbling in the stomach. My doctor gave me a three-day course of Buscopan, charcoal, and Apo-ranitidine after which the loose motions and cramps have stopped. But now the problem is that I have frequent toilet urges and feel that my bowel has not completely emptied. I am also experiencing a lot of gas and grumbling in the stomach. I have had gas problems from childhood but since these two weeks, it has turned a little worse. What am I suffering from and any treatment?","Doctor":"Hi. Occasional abdominal pain, loose stool, urges for toilet all suggest that you might have irritable bowel syndrome. This is a chronic condition. If you experience worsening of symptoms, change in consistency of stool, any episode of any amount of bleeding along with stool then you might need further evaluation in terms of colonoscopy or CT scan of the abdomen. Primary treatment is medications which you suppose to take for a long time (as prescribed by your doctor). You also need to change some sort of life-style modification in terms of avoiding food which worsen these symptoms and also suggest to take high-fiber, low-gluten diet. Might require a colonoscopy. Indigestion, Inflammatory bowel disease.  |"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, First, I went to the doctor for extremely itchy scrotum that felt as if it had cuts in it and red spots on my penis that dry white. My itchy scrotum is now healed but I have got little cuts at the base of my penis and those spots will not go. He gave me scabies cream but I do not know if it is working. Is this an STD? I am scared. I am currently using Permethrin cream.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed the attached photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I can see few red erosions at the base of the penis. They can be either an irritant reaction to something you have applied over the penis or due to herpes virus infection which is an STD (sexually transmitted disease). In herpes infection, there are small fluid-filled blisters to start with followed by erosions which are painful and heal over two to three weeks. To confirm herpetic infection you can go for ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test, HSV 1 (herpes simplex virus), IgG, HSV 1 IgM, HSV 2 IgG, and HSV 2 IgM. In scabies, there is excessive itching on the body especially at night, positive family history of scabies and itchy red bumps on the body including penis and scrotum but cuts or erosions are not seen in scabies. On the erosions, you should apply topical antibiotics like Mupirocin or Neosporin (Neomycin) ointment. I hope this helps. Irritant, Herpes virus. ELISA for herpes virus. Irritant contact dermatitis. Herpes genitalis. Mupirocin ointment or Neosporin ointment. Wash the area with plain water, avoid soap on the affected area. After seven days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old male. For the past six months I do not do any physical activities, no exercise, I work only on my laptop and drink very less amount of water. I masturbate almost daily for the past 10 years. I never had sex with any girl. I never used any kind of contaminated stuff with my penis. I never had erection problems in my life in fact, I got erection any time I wanted (except when I was extremely stressed). And I always used to have morning erection (until I started research on internet). I usually wear tight briefs, and often while wearing tight briefs when I got erection, the tight fitting underwear tries to restrict the erected penis inside. And due to tight fitting brief my penis bend (where shaft meets the penis head) inside the underwear. And I firmly believe this caused the injury to my penis. When I urinate sometimes some drops of urine are left in my penis head, which comes out later after a minute when I walk back to my room. For the last two months, I have been suffering from very high levels of stress, depression, anxiety, anger related to my job, health, relations, past, and future. And I am severely constipated for the last two months may be due to these stress. I do not have frequent urination. Last month, I thought I should ask a doctor about this extra skin on my unerected penis (see attached photos). I started research on the internet. At this time I do not have any erectile problems and I was not aware of any kind of terrifying disease that can happen to the penis. Everything was alright. But then, I started reading about the bend I have in my penis (see attached photos) and I read about all these terrifying diseases (Peyronie's disease, prostate, etc.). Since then I am extremely terrified, stressed, depressed, hopeless, more constipated, like someone is holding my stomach tightly. And I also breathe very slowly when I think about these things. I cannot take my mind off these problems. I am terrified like I may have one of these untreatable diseases. After this internet research, I cannot think about porn and stuff which I used to think for erection and masturbation. And even if I watch porn or try to think about porn, all these queries and worries are running into the back of my head all the time and I cannot get erection. Yesterday, I masturbated with a fully erected penis. And I am able to get full length erection (if somehow I draw my attention off these terrifying things). I am having very mild pain in my penis on erection. It is like a muscular pain inside the penis and had premature ejaculation (this particularly started after internet research). What is the cause of this pain? Are pain and premature ejaculation related? What can be done to solve these problems? I am suffering from erectile dysfunction (problem in maintaining an erection). It does not get hard for more than a few seconds. What is the cause? I noticed a darker patch of skin located on my penis shaft. More specifically it is located on the very bottom of the shaft, starting where the shaft meets the scrotum and traveling up towards the head little ways. It is oval in shape. The color is a bit darker than my usual skin tone. What and why is this black skin on the lower side of my penis shaft? What can be done for this extra skin on my unerected penis (see attached photos)? Is my penis shape normal or not? Why is my penis head bends downward? Is this normal? Why is the head of my penis is large (in length)? And it often remains less hard (spongy) on erection while shaft gets very hard? Why not my penis erection is not parallel to the floor (which it used to be)? It always slopes downward. Is this damaged suspensory penile ligament? Because tight briefs forcefully restricted the erect penis in a downward direction.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen every picture you have uploaded and I understand your concern. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Premature ejaculation is when you discharge within 30 seconds of masturbation or doing intercourse. Do you ejaculate before 30 seconds when you do masturbation? The pain you are having is because you are doing excessive masturbation. You should reduce your masturbation habit to two times a week otherwise you will have a lot of problems when you will be married. If you are having early morning erections then you are fine. It is your stress which is causing premature ejaculation. You have to understand that premature ejaculation can be diagnosed when you really do sex with someone. It is normal to have dark areas in penis like you have in the Indian population. You are comparing yourself with people in porn movies. My advice to you is that you must reduce watching porn movies because it will affect your sexual life when you start doing sex with your partner. People in porn movies take drugs thats why they have a longer duration for doing sex and also you will expect your partner to be like the women you watch in these movies which will also spoil your relationship with your partner. The extra skin can be reduced by doing circumcision. But it should be done if you are having a problem in rollback on your skin when your penis is in erect form or if you have a problem in doing sex with someone, in your case since you are a virgin we can say anything for now. And yes, the shape of your penis is normal. You are taking too much tension. The only thing which you really need to do is to reduce doing masturbation. If you do not you will have a lot of problems in the future. Take vitamin E tablets for 15 days once daily. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 8-year-old daughter continues to have strong abdominal pains. Couple of months before, it was really bad and was also coupled with mono and fifths disease. At that time her levels were crazy high. AST = 1312, ALT = 1692. These levels freaked out the doctors so we went back the next week, still high but much lower AST = 394, ALT = 807, GGT = 84. We also did a sonogram at that point which was inconclusive. We went back two weeks later and not better AST = 532, ALT = 682, GGT = 71. Doctors have no answers and no idea about what was going on. The doctors seem to phone it in at that point. My daughter started feeling better so we did not push it for a couple of months and went back in and the levels seem close to normal AST = 57, ALT = 42, GGT = 12. We were given no comfort as to what caused it. My daughter does complain a couple of times a week about her stomach hurting, but she is not in the extreme pain she was in until this week. She is back to waking up in pain, spending most of the school day in the nurse's office. So now we are heading back to the hospital for more blood as we did not get any answers from the first 37 vials of blood they have taken. Any clues what might be causing this?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. This appears to be a case of obstructive jaundice. The main cause of obstructive jaundice is gallstones. Since GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) levels are raised more than 70 in the first report it suggests an obstructive cause. AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) can increase in both hepatic and obstructive causes. In obstructive jaundice, the level of direct bilirubin increases more as compared to indirect bilirubin levels. Gallstones are easily visible on the ultrasound abdomen. It also causes severe acute abdominal pain. There are some syndrome like rotor syndrome which can also cause obstructive jaundice. Nevertheless, the enzyme levels are falling and the child is improving now. But, I suggest you to repeat ultrasound to look for gallstones. Review with ultrasound report and liver function test report especially bilirubin levels. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 11-month-old daughter has been sick for about a week. She was throwing up all day and vomiting and there was blood mixed with it at one pint. We were giving medicine to stop the vomiting. Her diarrhea has continued since Sunday night. It is progressed to the point that she is passing stools almost instantly after drinking anything. The diarrhea smells like a sour milk. Is this a reason for concern?","Doctor":"Hello. Before I answer your query I would like to ask you some questions. Until when did your daughter have exclusively breast milk? When did you start other food along with breast milk? Did she have similar episodes in the past? Did she receive all her vaccines regularly? Kindly provide me with the answers so that I can tell you further on the diagnosis and the reasons behind it. As of now, it seems like a case of acute gastroenteritis which is quite common in this age group. So do not worry much at this point. The treatment plan consists of some considerations. Generally, we prefer to give ORS (oral rehydrating solution) to the baby at regular intervals and as much as the child wants to drink. Continue breastfeeding normally. Add Zinc to the baby as per the dosage schedule. Antibiotics are not mandatory, it depends upon the condition of the baby after a thorough checkup. I would suggest you to continue with ORS solution and breastfeeding and you can take her to your pediatrician for further consultation. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a compound fracture of both the radial and ulnar forearm bones that resulted in two bones sticking out of my arm, torn ligaments and muscle, and nerve damage. I had the arm reconstructed with titanium and it has been two years since then. To this day, I still have nerve pain and aching in my bones and I am trying to find relief. I have been using an average of eight Ibuprofen a day for nearly two years and it is not getting the job done. I feel as though the nerve pain is not getting better but instead worse. My question is what recommendations do you have for me to help relieve the pain? I have tried almost every common remedy that doctors have recommended. Should I give up on trying to avoid the pain and get a consultation to talk about possible options?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your complaint and seen your pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I feel sad that you had to undergo such a procedure and pain. Since you have chronic pain I would suggest you to use opioid analgesics like Oxycontin (Oxycodone) and Percocet (Oxycodone and Paracetamol) which are very effective in chronic pain. Alternatively, you can use Piroxicam tablets and Flupirtine (centrally acting analgesic) capsule which has also shown good results in chronic pain management. If the pain is of neuropathic origin then Gabapentine and Pregabaline are the best drugs. You can discuss all these options with your treating physician and get prescribed the medicine that best suits you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I did see the facts I was looking for on your site. Maybe you can answer some questions the best you can. This is about a 16-year-old female. If the mesentery and/or pancreas has a tear in one or both and if that tear was big enough to bleed, where would the blood go? Would it go through the tract of the vagina or rectal tract to seep blood out of the body? How long does it take the body and skin to show bruises or an area that has been injured somehow? When you cut let us say your arm or leg with some kind of tool. After the cut, when does the blood start clotting? If someone was sexually assaulted and have tears from stretching or penetration. When do the tears start healing? How long will it take minutes, or hours, or days, or months?","Doctor":"Hello. Pancreas is highly vascular and is surrounded by major vessels. Hence pancreatic trauma may be associated with life-threatening hemorrhage and shock. Pancreatic injury or pancreatic trauma can be as follows. Due to blunt trauma as well and car accidents when the internal hemorrhage ensues into the peritoneal cavity it leads to peritonitis or retroperitoneal hematoma. When it is because of sharp penetrating injury as in stabbing external hemorrhage the wound occurs. A bruise is bleeding under the skin and is due to the rupture of vessels in the skin due to blow or any impact. The timeframe for the appearance of bruise is in relation to the amount of the injury. In case of significant trauma it appears immediately. The classic feature of the bruise is to change its color. The force that is enough to rupture the skin capillaries is all that defines the bruise. When you suffer a cut your body immediately reacts in seconds to stop bleeding by hemostasis. Your blood should clot with in one to nine minutes by primary platelet plug formation. Again the time is variable as it depends on the nature and depth of the wound. If it does not clot in nine minutes, it should be evaluated for platelet dysfunction. Vaginal tears like any other wound start healing immediately after the injury. But again time for healing is based on the degree of the tear. First degree or second degree vaginal years usually heal within seven to ten days. Third and fourth degree may take months to recover. Any vaginal tear longer than an inch requires suturing. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have itchy bumps located on right breast with blisters filled with pus.","Doctor":"Hello. Could you attach picture of it? Are those painful? Are you sexually active or do have close contacts with other individuals or do you share any clothes? If those are multiple small vesicles aligned or grouped together, with clear fluid inside rather than pus, then those are likely a herpes infection. Then you would antiviral like Acyclovir or Valacyclovir. Now since it is less than 72 hours, it is better to get antiviral prescribed, which gives better result with early treatment. Herpes is usually painful to begin with or may get painful later. If there is single swollen area with clear pus demonstrable or there is drainage then it is a bacterial infection which would need antibiotics like Augmentin. This would be associated redness or tenderness.  So, be it either ways, you will need medications. So get it prescribed after examination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 5-year-old daughter has scalp ringworm.

Topical ketoconazole cream is good. The oral medication prescribed is also good for the infection. There are a few alternatives. Any medicine carries some side effects along with it. We need to weigh the benefit and risks. If the benefit is more, we go for the medication. Side effects are mentioned but are rarely seen. It is usually tolerated well by children.

Could you please tell me how to properly use Lidocaine spray without numbing my whole mouth and tongue? I just want to target the lower jaw.","Doctor":"Hello. I should recommend you revisit your Dentist to get it adjusted. The retainer might be too tight ,it should not be as tight to take a numbing spray (Lidocaine). For now if you are using a numbing spray there is no way you can stop numbing your tongue in as you cannot manage the aerosol of the spay, eventually it is going to spread and numb the entire mouth as you are saying. For the time being, I might suggest Rexidine M Forte gel (numbing gel). It contains Chlorhexidine + Metronidazole + Ligocaine. It will help you better but its action might be less than the spray but definately will help you with the issue of numbing the entire mouth. Dressin mouthwash (relieves a bit pain upon using).

These are nothing but accumulated skin due to fissure. Usually nothing to do that but if you do not like them, you can opt for surgery. It is a very minor surgery. No side effects or any problem after removing them by experienced hands. A raw area will form that will heal by its own. It can reappear if you have another formation of anal fissure.

This could cause development of diverticula in bladder or urethra.  2) Kegel Exercise is a good option to improve the sexual performance. The exercise can be done at home or at any place without any issues. This is nothing but pelvic muscle strengthening exercise. In this one should tighten the pelvic floor muscles and hold the muscles in tightened position for around 8-10 seconds (on count to 8). After holding the muscles should be relaxed. This should be done multiple times a day. Do as if you are holding gas in your anus or as if you are lifting the anus.

I am using Lox-2%, Osil and stool softener Softovac now regularly. Last time when I consulted a doctor he told me that I am having piles too with warts. Warts are now disappearing as I used Imiquimod for more than a month but it caused the skin around my anus red, little itchy, and inflamed. Please help. I am an HIV positive person. Can I use Candid around the anus?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to cliniq.com. I see you have taken all the necessary medications for the fissure in anus. What I would like to tell you is you need to do two more important things. Firstly, since you have fissure and piles I can guess you might have constipation quite commonly hence you must be straining to pass the stools so I suggest you stop straining while passing stools. Next, add fiber to your diet. Consuming one cucumber and carrot a day will help you a lot to avoid constipation. Also, drink plenty of water throughout the day. Secondly, how you use the medication is also important. I advise you to do a sitz bath twice a day (add Betadine 5 ml in lukewarm water in a tub and sit on it for 5 to 10 minutes). Next apply the Lox-2% (Lignocaine hydrochloride) cream (opaque) and not gel, as gel does not get absorbed and the cream crosses the skin. Apply it before passing stools and immediately after cleaning yourself after passing the stools. You can apply it whenever you have severe pain also. You can also take syrup Lactulose 15 ml at night time after food for 10 days. For the piles, if you have third or fourth-degree piles then surgery is the only choice. For first and second degrees you can treat by tablet Daflon 500 mg one tablet a day for 14 days. Apply Pilex ointment or Hemoproct ointment before sleep in the anal region. Avoid anal sex if any until the fissure heals. Lastly, all acute fissure can be treated by the methods I have mentioned here and more than any medication follow the dietary advice and you can keep the fissure occurrence under control. However, if the fissure is persistent for more than two to three months it is better to get operated. Suggested operations are lateral internal sphincterotomy for the fissure and hemorrhoidectomy for piles. Also, keep a check on your viral load and Cd4 counts. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

It is difficult as I have been traumatized with memories, flashbacks, important dates and numbers relating has engrained on my mind unconsciously.","Doctor":"Hello. I am so sorry to hear about your situation. I can imagine how hard it is for you right now. I can understand that changing the place could be a big step to take and not always possible. I would suggest you continue the therapy. ISTDP (intensive short term dynamic psychotherapy) and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), can prove helpful in your case. For emotional blocks, only CBT is sometimes not enough you need to learn to not get stuck by the past memories and have control over your thoughts instead of your thoughts controlling you and your behavior. The physical signs are an expression of the psychological and emotional stress that you have been suffering from such a long time. So, on your own start with maintaining a mood journal and keeping a note of your thoughts and emotions which overwhelm you. Try to spend a few minutes a day practicing relaxation techniques such as box breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, otherwise hear light music that makes you feel calm. You will also require some life coaching to being yourself on track and become the best version of yourself. You need to learn to make yourself and your well-being a priority. I hope this gives you some idea of what you need to do again. So you can find a therapist locally or if you need it. We can start therapy sessions online via video consultation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 4-year-old daughter has asthma. She was diagnosed with a moderate asthma flare at urgent care four days ago. Flovent was increased to 88 mcg twice daily, Albuterol 2.5mg every four hours for 48 hours and Prednisolone 15mg/5ml one and a half tablespoon once daily for five days. She seems to be having retractions at night between 10 PM and 2 AM like clockwork. They are not severe as her respiration rate is 22-28, pulse oximeter reading is 96-98%. Pulse is elevated at times due to Albuterol and the highest recorded is 160 with no fever. She is tired and is pale in the face with dark circles under her eyes. I followed up with the pediatrician yesterday and he diagnosed her with an ear infection and put her on Augmentin. He listened to her lungs and said they sounded fine. She had an Albuterol breathing treatment about one hour prior to her visit. These symptoms that comes on night are scary. Productive cough and the sound of occasional constriction in the throat causing a gag, with these mild subcostal retractions. It is hard for me to determine do we go to the ER or not? It is hard to justify a trip to the ER with normal vitals and these sets of symptoms. Wanting suggestions regarding is my daughter on the right treatment? Could this be something other than ear infection and viral illness causing asthma flare? She has been sick with a stuffy nose, postnasal drip, and mild cough for three weeks. She is also taking Claritin, Singulair, OTC Tylenol or Ibuprofen for ear pain and Mucinex. I also have a video clip of these retractions and I am attaching it.","Doctor":"Hello. As per your history, it is very clear that your daughter has asthma exacerbation. It can be because of an ear infection or viral infection in the airways. As you said in spite of antibiotics, oral steroids and frequent nebulization it is not under control. She needs urgent hospitalization to give her urgent care and to find out other problems if any. This flare up is a valid justification for her hospital admission. As she is very young child she needs treatment under observation. The very fact that oral treatment being not effective. She needs intravenous drugs and steroid nebulization, x-ray and other blood tests. So I advise you to go to the hospital for admission without wasting much time. This will help to recover her fast and find out the exact cause for her flare-up. Once she is settled and the acute problem is under control. She can continue with her inhaler medicines as advised. I think this explanation is enough for you to explain her situation to you. I hope this helps. Ear infection or viral infection. X-ray, blood tests. IV antibiotics, steroid, and Levoalbuterol nebulization."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter 5 years old and having allergic cold symptoms sneezing, irritation of eyes, nose, and wheezing in some occasions. Our pediatrician prescribed Montair-LC kid syrup 5 ml daily. Given for three months. I want to stop the medicine but the doctor suggested to give it on alternate days. If the medicine is stopped even for a day, she gets back the symptoms severely. Is there any alternative? How to taper the medicine?","Doctor":"Hi.  As your child might have airway reactive disease, it suggests she is having airway reactive problems or allergy to some substance. The best plan of action will be to give Montelukast sodium 4 mg tablet in the night time. Give Salbutamol syrup 2.5 ml once daily for five days. Buy a nebulizer and give nebulization with normal saline to Asthalin solution in a concentration of one to one ratio. Rest medication will be gradually tapered off. Stop all syrups and rest of the medications. Gradually medicines will be reduced according to the symptoms. Allergy. Complete blood count. Asthma, reactive airway disease.

I had unprotected intercourse four days before the abortion. I was given 200 mcg of Mifepristone and two days later Misoprostol which expelled the pregnancy. (the intercourse occurred six days before the Misoprostol). I am worried that this may start a new pregnancy after the abortion was completed as sperm can live up to seven days and if I ovulated immediately after abortion the sperm could be alive to start a new pregnancy. Please can you help me and give me an explanation of the following: Can 200 mcg of Mifepristone be effective at preventing pregnancy, if taken four days (96 hours) after unprotected sex? I have found information on the internet which says in some countries that Mifepristone is used as an effective emergency contraceptive. However, they say small doses of up to 50 mcg. Please tell me whether 200 mcg would be most effective?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  There seems to be confusion about the dose of Mifepristone which you know about. Usually, three 200 mg tablets (600 mg total) orally administered Mifepristone as a single one time dose and two days later Misoprostol is given. Your idea about 200 mcg Mifepristone is therefore incorrect.  Regarding ovulating immediately after medical abortion is not possible. This is because the hormones in your body are still abnormal and ovulation will not occur in this situation.  I guess you have been given 200 mg of Mifepristone and there is no risk of pregnancy from sexual intercourse four days after the abortion. The uterus is not ready to have another pregnancy right now so there is no risk to you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Yesterday, I had an ultrasound of my abdomen. They gave me the report online and I am not sure how to read it. The things I am looking up are extremely worrisome. It is all saying cancer. I am going for a CT scan within a week. It is without contrast because I have myasthenia gravis and the contrast really affects my breathing. Will contrast make a huge difference? Below I have pasted the results and it says: Normal liver and gallbladder. Left renal calculus. Complex heterogeneously hypoechoic cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney for which further imaging is recommended. Also, I have been urinating almost every hour and it feels like my bladder is never empty. I have had a kidney stone four years ago. But the part about the complex cyst on my kidneys is troubling me.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I understand your concern. So, you have a cystic lesion in the upper part of your kidney. First of all, you are only 28 years old and at your age, I would favor many benign lesions over malignant ones. If they are not talking about solid components of the lesions, it again favors benign lesion. Let them do CT (computed tomography) with i.v. (intravenous) contrast, if possible share both ultrasound images and CT images with me. One more thing, if you do not have any sign of night sweating, weight loss or redness in your urine, again malignancy risk is too low.

So I abruptly stopped this and it triggered discontinue syndrome and hypermania. I have not felt the same since. I am not suffering so much now from hypermania after a month or two. I am Lamictal and when needed on Seroquel. On current medicines, I feel blank, unstable, unable to think normal, and some frustration, anger thinking, concentration, and speech affected at times. I feel I need to go back to antidepressants, my brain needs that and boosts mood and taper off appropriately like Effexor or Lexapro. I have had success but Lexapro cause stomach issues and Effexor is good but can cause weight gain or if working in the night it can cause mood swing. I believe my current issue is just because of Cymbalta induced hypermania. I did get psychosis from LSD. Do you think I should taper off Lamictal to Effexor low doses?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Considering the history of mania (even if it is drug-induced), it is not advisable to start Effexor alone in my opinion. So, I would suggest you discuss with your treating psychiatrist regarding starting Seroquel regularly as it also acts on depressive symptoms, or starting low dose Effexor along with Lamictal (as mood stabilizer).

I have seen the images. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  There is a larger nodule in the left lobe and a tiny one in the right lobe of thyroid. The left thyroid nodule measures 14 x 19 mm and is isoechoic and solid areas and shows peripheral vascularity with a small focus of possible cystic change within which can be cystic changes probably colloid changes. The right thyroid nodule is 4 x 4 mm and is iso to hypoechoic. It is too small to comment on vascularity. There is no calcification in the nodules. In my opinion, it is likely to be a benign condition but FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) from the larger left thyroid nodule is suggested for confirmation. Usually, 80 percent of thyroid nodules are benign. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is mental health not as important as or more important than physical health? Why? What seems to be the dominant approach to treating people with depressive disorders? And, how do you think it could improve to prevent mental health crises, namely suicide? How should the topic of mental illness and more specifically depression and suicide be discussed? What role should religion or faith have in the diagnosis and treatment of depression? Is suicide morally wrong and why? How should it be portrayed in education?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Sharing my thoughts based on my professional experience and expertise.  Mental Health is as important or probably even more important than physical health because most physical ailment or issue starts within the mind or if it is not for to a mental process, its tolerance and recovery depend highly on the mental state of the patient.  Depression has a biological basis of primarily disbalance of the neurotransmitter serotonin. So, first and foremost medications should be taken which is SSRI.  SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) which are a group of medications that help in increasing the level of serotonin and are first-line treatment of depression.  Therapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most tried and researched form of therapy which works really well for most of the patients.  Therapy and medications combined are gold standards for the treatment of depression. Suicide is one of the consequences of untreated depression. Almost 80-90 percent of people who attempt suicide have been estimated to have an underlying mental health disorder. So, one way to prevent suicide is  1. Creating awareness  2. Creating resources and trained professionals  3. Treating mental health disorders early.  Depression, suicide or any mental health issue should be discussed as often as possible and just with the same approach as any medical illness because they all essentially are biological disorders. It is important to normalize the approach which helps in reducing the stigma related to mental health. Role of faith or religion is similar to having any personal goal because they give a sense of purpose but it can be sometimes a negative influence as well because sometimes religion teaches us that our suffering is a consequence of our actions and people often are denied treatment based on this belief.  Suicide has nothing to do with morality. It is an end-stage consequence of long term suffering. It has been proven that people who attempt suicide in most cases have an underlying mental health condition that might have not been detected. It is important to address this issue and educate people as much as possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My bilirubin level is 1.7, but I do not have any symptoms of jaundice. How can I bring the bilirubin level to normal?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, there are certain medications that can bring bilirubin down but your bilirubin is 1.7 which is within normal limits. It does not require any treatment. The possible cause of asymptomatic small raised bilirubin is Gilbert syndrome which is completely harmless.

My endocrinologist mentioned lupus because of joint pain and hives. I have an appointment with a rheumatologist in four months. I am considering changing my detergent back to see if the hives stop. Could it all be coincidental? How long would an allergy take to show? I have always thought it was the onset of arthritis. I never got a butterfly shaped rash on my face. I am currently taking Methimazole 10 mg, Multivitamins, and Gianvi birth control.","Doctor":"Hi. Well, the hives do go in favor of urticaria. It can be a part of lupus or can be independent as well. But usually, it is an autoimmune process triggered by some allergen (it is possible it is detergent in your case). But the joint pains you have do not really point towards lupus since it is only restricted to the shoulders. Most of the time, shoulders have a mechanical cause, that is you are overusing it in the wrong way. But never the less, since your appointment is far away, I would suggest you get a few tests done. Even with urticaria, we do these tests. Meanwhile, change your detergent and take a course of antiallergics and see if it improves. You can let me know the results when available. 1.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Can you help shed some light on this? I have been googling and it says I could have an auto immune disease. If so, which ones are likely with this bloodwork? I am currently on Nexium, Xanax and Proair when needed.","Doctor":"Hi. You have mildly positive antinuclear antibody titer which suggests auto immune disease and Anti-dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) which is slightly above the normal range suggests that you might have SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) but there are 11 other criterias out of which four should be positive to confirm SLE. People who have positive ANA or Anti-ds DNA but cannot fulfill the clinical criteria for SLE need to be followed closely because they are at risk to develop SLE in the future. SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect almost any organ system. Muscular manifestation includes myalgias as in your case. Titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies often fluctuate with disease activity and are therefore useful in many patients for following the course of SLE. I would suggest you to consult a rheumatologist. You need to take drugs that suppress your immunity. Steroids are the treatment of choice. I would advise repeat testing for both ANA and Anti-dsDNA after one or two months, to look for any change in the titer. Rising titers or very high titers of IgG Anti-dsDNA antibodies are closely associated with impending or already flared SLE. Genetic. Anti-dsDNA and ANA titer. Collagen vascular disease. SLE.

Though many more presentations can be there in stroke depending on which area of the brain gets affected. Stroke can be prevented by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and healthy food, regular exercise, keeping blood pressure (BP) and sugar under control. Take regular medications as advised by a doctor. Lack of sleep and stress can lead to increased BP, impaired blood sugars and increased sympathetic response in the body, which can be a risk factor for stroke.

First, we should know the patient's gender. Then, if female, ask if the sleep problems are all the time or more evident prior to periods due date?

Stress makes it difficult to fall asleep and keep asleep and altering sleep quality. Hormonal changes will cause an increase in body heat (which becomes not stable) and adrenalin, which alter the quality of sleep, and time of sleeping. Estrogen will cause an increase in body fat in women more around the tummy. This will cause snoring and sleep apnea. We should ask patients more details about their sleep like, is it difficult to fall asleep? Why? Do you wake up during the night? How many times if yes? Why? In this way, we will find more details about the sleeping problems my patients are having.

We were told to slather it from head to toe for miraculous benefits. However, lately, it is been getting some backlash thanks to its comedogenic properties. My questions are, What are the pros of using products that contain coconut oil on your skin? What are some potential cons? What skin types can benefit most from coconut oil? What skin types should stay away from it? How do you recommend using coconut oil in one's routine to reap benefits and avoid breakouts? If someone wants to use natural coconut oil on their face, what kind do you recommend using (i.e. unrefined, organic, etc.)?","Doctor":"Hi. Coconut oil is extracting traditionally from raw coconut or from dried coconut kernels. It is saturated oil and frequently used in skin, hairs or cooking purposes. This oil has health-promoting properties. It contains several fatty acids that have benefits to skin health as well. Now we will discuss some more about coconut oil step by step. Coconut oil contains several fatty acids which of them lauric acid and myristic acid are very common. These fatty acids have antimicrobial properties which help to protect the skin against harmful microns. Coconut oil also has anti-inflammatory properties. It helps to protect the skin from inflammation, contact dermatitis, eczema or other inflammatory conditions. It also helps to nourish and moisturize the skin. Coconut oil does not contain protein or carbohydrates and a trace amount of a few nutrients. The fatty acids found in coconut oil raise bad cholesterol like LDL. These are the cons of coconut oil. This oil can be used in dry skin or hairs to moisturize them. It benefits skin health but not ideal for everyone. Coconut oil could potentially clog the pores and causes black heads. Sensitive skin people should not use coconut oil. If anyone has dry skin or hairs those can apply. They can do gentle massage with this coconut oil. Coconut oil is very healthful if used externally. As it contains highly saturated fatty acids and raises bad cholesterol so those who have bad cholesterol should be avoided to use it internally. Coconut oil has a lot of benefits but one should use it after knowing its properties and their health conditions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is provisionally diagnosed with SCA (spinocerebellar ataxia).

Why is urinary incontinence more prevalent in women? Why do pregnancy and menopause contribute to incontinence?","Doctor":"Hello. Female, unlike men, have short urethra and less effective urinary continence systems than men as a part of normal anatomy. Female normal continence is dependent on normal sphincter anatomy, normal vaginal anatomy, and pelvis muscle strength. Thus any factor causing changes in the above-mentioned area can lead to incontinence. After vaginal birth delivery, it is a normal process that the pelvic floor muscle becomes lax thus support system of bladder is reduced. This leads to hypermobile urethra and defected continence system. So problem like stress incontinence, urine leak during increase abdominal strainings like cough and sneezing, are increased and are typically common in elderly women with a history of vaginal delivery earlier. After menopause, the loss of estrogens in the body can cause vaginal atrophy which leads to less urethral support and is again one of the causes of incontinence in women. It is important to diagnose the cause of incontinence so that treatment can be individualized. Sling surgery, trans obturator tape, trans vaginal tape, are few surgical modality where support is given to bladder neck and urethra respectively thus improving the continence."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband is a type 2 diabetic.

Since his triglycerides are high, he has been taking Stanlip 145. His sugar levels are fine now with HbA1c at 6.74. But, the recent kidney tests show higher levels of serum creatinine at 1.7. Also, his amylase and lipase values are significantly high with amylase at 86.4 and lipase at 98.5. He is just 32 and has been a diabetic for seven years. A general physician says that the elevated levels of creatinine and lipase indicate the risk of the organs malfunction. Also, he says that Glimy 2 and Janumet are to be blamed for the harm. What should we do to protect the vitality of the kidney and pancreas? Kindly guide.","Doctor":"Hi. Well, I do not think elevated creatinine is due to medications. It is most likely due to diabetes itself. But elevated lipase is due to high triglycerides (apart from high triglycerides, alcohol intake can also cause elevated lipase). For the protection of pancreas, his triglycerides have to be controlled. When was his triglyceride tested and what is the value? He needs to do exercise daily. As of his kidney is concerned his medicine Janumet 50/1000 has to be stopped and instead he can use tablet Galvus 50 mg (Vildagliptin) two times a day. He should avoid pain killers and inform the doctor that his creatinine his on the higher side before any doctor prescribes any medications. Repeat serum creatinine after one month and revert back with reports."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had all four impacted wisdom teeth out a week ago. The pain has been absolutely horrible which I knew it would be. However, my left side has healed very well, is no longer swollen with minimal sensitivity. Now my right side is still as swollen as day two or three. It is hard, sensitive and the constant dull throbbing pain is still waking me up at night and literally bringing me to tears. It is not even the incision site that hurts, it is my entire jawline from my eye all the way down into my lip. My surgeon said this was normal and stuck some medicated gauze there and called it a day. That in which did not help the pain, actually only made it worse. I cannot open my mouth wide enough to even fit a spoon. Should not this be improving by now after seven days? Should I be concerned about the bone fragments or possibly a fractured jaw bone? I am really stressed and my surgeon has provided zero help. I understood that it is four days of recovery time and not seven days of the same miserable swelling and pain with no improvement. I am currently taking Penicillin and Ibuprofen.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me explain a few things first. Wisdom tooth, first of all, can be fully erupted, partially erupted or totally unerupted, sometimes lying deep within the bone. The swelling of the extraction site depends on the amount of bone removal to take the tooth out. It is not that easy job. It occasionally happens that a nerve lying close to the tooth gets lacerated giving rise to prolonged numbness. Another thing, a chance of fracture is there when the tooth lies too close to the angle of the jaw bone. I would advise you to take an OPG (orthopantomogram) first. Make sure you gargle with Chlorhexidine mouthwash and apply ice packs at least five times daily. It will help reduce swelling greatly. There is nothing to worry though. Keep your mind at ease. Just visit your dentist soon and determine the cause first. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Last ten days I have a weird heavy feeling in my ankles and sometimes it goes to the top of both feet. It started in my calves and a couple of nights it went to my thighs and it felt like both my legs are on fire. The feeling is more like tingly, sometimes burning sensation and sometimes cold. After this, I started to have a tinging in my fingers, face and the occasional feeling of something is crawling on the body (however, this is not major symptom). The most annoying thing is the heavy feeling in my feet which is there constantly. It is more annoying when I am still but as soon as I start walking it feels like the feeling is not there. I went to my GP and they did blood tests and Lyme disease and did not find anything. Please can you explain what may be causing this?","Doctor":"Hello. So there are two possibilities, one is peripheral neuropathy and the second is restless leg syndrome. Now do you have access to any of those tests or atleast knows what all tests were performed? Are you having any medications for that? I guess, you do not have any hormonal issues or did not receive any medications recently? There are certain causes we need to rule out besides diabetes like anemia or iron deficiency, thyroid problem, Vitamin B12 or Folic acid deficiency and liver or kidney disease, Vitamin D deficiency, and hypocalcemia. You may have some multivitamin supplements containing vitamin B12 like ME12OD or Neurobion forte etc, which may resolve this issue as vitamin deficiencies are quite common cause for the same. Meanwhile, try to have a diet rich in green leafy vegetables, fruits, and calcium. So you should discuss with your doctor regarding tests performed and request for remaining tests.

Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. For further doubts consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having infrequent deep chest pains, along with pain in my left arm, right arm, and legs at times. The pain mimics that of a heart attack, but I had an EKG, echo, blood, and CT everything has come up normal so far. When I am on the computer I usually slouch and have poor posture. Could my pain be related to the back (like the thoracic spine) and is there any way this could be diagnosed or a chiropractor could do about this?","Doctor":"Hello. You have already ruled out the fearful cause of such pain, so the second most common cause of such pain is improper posture. More than a chiropractor you need to understand the need for correct posture as you have to continue working in a similar environment for the next 40 years. Proper working table and chair are a must for good posture. The chair should be stable and adjusts easily for the height and tilt. Chair with a backrest that supports the curve of your lower back should be used. You should sit back in the chair when you work on a computer. Thighs should be horizontal with your knees and hips at the same level. Feet should rest comfortably on the floor or on a footrest while seated. The height of the desks is at about elbow level when sitting down. The chair should be adjusted such that back can rest against the chair while working on the computer. Your elbows should stay near your body in an open angle allowing circulation to the lower arms and hands. Your arms are nearly perpendicular to the floor. Your wrists are nearly straight. Along with this regular muscle stretching and isometric strengthening exercises for the neck, shoulder girdle, and lower back must be done to avoid such pain. Acute pain such as in your case requires analgesics (narcotic), hot fomentation, TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), ultrasound by a physiotherapist and alternative treatment modalities like acupuncture for immediate relief and yoga and meditation for long term benefits. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am diabetic and hypertensive. I also have arthritis. I am taking Gemer-1, Folvite, Febituz, Methotrex weekly once, Ecosporin and Repace 25. My fasting blood sugar level is 140 mg/dL and on taking Gemer-1 my postprandial blood sugar is 72 mg/dL. Why this happens?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it happens. In a diabetic, fasting blood sugar usually results from a combination of factors, the two most important being, 1) What you ate the day (or night) before and how high your blood sugar spiked. If you have very high blood sugar the night before, you should expect your fasting blood sugar to be elevated. Sometimes an eight-hour fast is just not long enough to bring down the blood sugar. 2) Dawn Phenomenon is common in diabetics, and it is when hormones that you produce in the morning cause your liver to release more glucose for energy. Either way, higher fasting levels result. Often Dawn phenomenon and high blood sugar from the day or night before work with each other. When you eat, the liver stops pumping out so much glucose, and postprandial blood sugar can drop, which is what happened to you. My suggestion is to do a pre-dinner sugar and see what is your blood glucose level before dinner. If it is high (>130), we have to alter the drugs and dosage. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wisdom teeth came a few years ago. The top ones are straight but too close to the molars next to them, so they broke the molars. Those top molars next to the wisdom teeth, as well as those top wisdom teeth are broken, decayed, and sometimes painful. My bottom wisdom teeth have not damaged the molars next to them, but they are not fully erupted out of the gums. One is impacted but does not cause trouble. The other is straight, but in pain, it is also infected. There is green pus that comes out from between the gum and that tooth as well as from the tooth in front of it. There is also a cracked second molar which the gum is partially detached from and it also has some pus coming from it. Now here is the dilemma, I have been taking Amoxicillin 250 mg three times a day for a month now, and just yesterday I switched to 500 mg three times a day to try to clear up that infection. Yesterday there is no pus, but today there is. I do not have an appointment with the oral surgeon until a few weeks. I am afraid that this infection will not clear up with the 500 mg Amoxicillin. And the big problem is that I am on Medicaid and they only give us 1000 dollars a year which resets every July. I only have about half of that left which means I cannot go to any more appointments until after this oral surgeon. I can only have three to four of the six bad teeth out. So do I have to extract the bottom infected wisdom and cracked tooth or the semi painful broken decayed top teeth? And to make it even better, I have high blood pressure and severe anxiety and happen to be on Propranolol for the blood pressure and heart rate. I know that Propranolol interacts with local anesthetics that have vasoconstrictor in it, but local anesthetics without vasoconstrictor do not last as long and I am severely afraid of death from dental work (or from infection). So I do not know which teeth to do, what to do about the anesthetic, and I am afraid of the infection spreading. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Put your mind at ease. There is a high chance of food getting stuck between the wisdom tooth and the molar because of the position of the molar. This gets unnoticed during brushing and over time gives rise to the decayed tooth. Plain Amoxicillin will not help in decreasing the infection. You need Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid combination (675 mg) two times a day for three days. This with Metronidazole 400 mg three times a day for three days. Before having these, it is mandatory that your blood pressure is within the normal range. Local anesthesia with vasoconstrictor can be used for hypertensive patients with proper guidelines being followed. Do not worry. Please visit the dentist first, take the revised set of medicines, bring your BP under control as well. Let the infection subside and then remove the infected tooth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is hyperpermeable intestine treatable and or curable? Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I hope the following information will help you understand the condition first, and thereafter the possibility of cure and treatment. Together it should help you get your answer. To start with, I am sorry, but your question does not have a simple yes or no answer. Normally, the gastrointestinal epithelium provides a semi-permeable barrier that allows nutrients to be absorbed while preventing larger, potentially toxic, antigenic, or pathogenic molecules or organisms from crossing into the bloodstream. Abnormally increased intestinal permeability allows the individual to absorb the bad food molecules and absorption of bacteria and/or yeast from the gut to extra-intestinal sites, such as mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and systemic circulation. This can be also be due to certain drugs, microbial overgrowth, radiation, stress, alcohol intake, enteral/parenteral nutrition, or injury. Increased intestinal permeability occurs commonly with diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, asthma, eczema, food allergies, alcoholism, trauma, and surgery. Glutamine, phosphatidylcholine, flavonoids, soluble fiber, and fish oil, as well as probiotic organisms, including Lactobacilli and Saccharomyces boulardii, can assist in correcting this abnormal permeability. It would be necessary to avoid triggers like alcohol. And of course, other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis should be looked for. The treatment of cause will help remove the cause. So the treatment and cure would depend on how well one is evaluated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain in the pubic area. Urine test revealed protein in the urine. But there is no pain while urinating but I get pain only when I touch the area. I am just getting sick and wondering what it might be?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, the presence of proteins in urine is not a good sign. Let me explain to you in simple words that why it is not a good sign. The whole of the blood in our body flows through both the kidneys in our body and kidney functions as a filter, the harmful substances, and toxic molecules are taken up by the kidneys and are excreted out of the body via urine. Proteins are very essential for our body and proteins are big molecules (in size) so they do not pass through the small filtering mechanism of the kidneys. So the filtering mechanism of the kidneys is such that it allows toxic molecules to pass through the filter but does not allow substances to filter out which are essential for our body. But when the filtering mechanism of kidneys is damaged due to some underlying disease then the proteins also start leaking out, so if there are proteins present in the urine that means that the kidneys are not functioning normally. So I would advise you to get the following tests done so that I can do a detailed evaluation of your reports to make a precise diagnosis and find out the reason which is damaging your kidneys. So please get these tests done. 1) Complete hemogram 2) LFT (liver function tests) 3) KFT (kidney function tests) 4) Blood sugar (fasting and postprandial) 5) Ultrasound KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder) region 6) Get your blood pressure checked. Once you get these tests done, kindly send me a scanned copy of your reports for evaluation and please do not get panic, everything shall be fine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24-year-old female. I am 5'7\\" and weigh approximately 280 lbs. I am overweight. My question is that I have had this calf pain intermittently ever since I went bowling over a month ago. It comes and goes and the pain is honestly very random when it appears. It does not hurt worse with walking or working out and I really notice the pain only if I am not focused on something (I work as a nurse and never notice at work). It is maybe a 3/10 pain. It is not a sharp pain, sometimes it feels like I need to stretch my leg and other times it feels like a burning pain. I am also having a chest pain intermittently. No short of breath. It changes with positioning. I basically want to know your opinion, do you feel it is a DVT with a PE or that I could have pulled a muscle? I should also note that I just started a new job which gives me a massive amount of anxiety and worry, which I realize does not help with any of this. I am currently taking Norvasc and Lisinopril for hypertension. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. After reviewing your info, I think there are a couple of things I can tell you. I am assuming you have a B/ L (bilateral) pain and aching discomfort and not a sharp localized pain. Some of the causes for your pain are: 1) Most likely you have dehydration. 2) My second differential would be varicose veins. 3) Medication side effects of your anti-hypertensive drugs. 4) Psychosomatic pain because of stress. 5) If you have a history of coagulation disturbances, then I would suspect something on the lines of DVT (deep vein thrombosis). Take care of your hydration status in consultation with your cardiologist. Most likely this will help. Also, discuss the side effect of your medicines. Second, get a good sleep and watch out so OSA (sleep apnea). Third, if these do not help, then work up for varicose veins. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex with a lady and after three days my penis gets pain a lot in the night. I cannot sleep much in pain.

But I would recommend you to repeat HSV 1 and 2 tests again to rule out herpes infection. As far as treatment is concerned, wash the affected area with water only and keep it as dry as possible. Apply Sertaconazole cream on the affected area twice daily for at least two weeks and take tablet Fluconazole 200 mg twice weekly for two weeks. You can revert back to me after two weeks.

I have read your query and the first thing to know about a single kidney cyst is that it is usually harmless. You have not mentioned if this was an incidental finding (usually they are) or are you experiencing any symptoms like dull flank pain or abdominal pain or problems with voiding urine? In case of former, no need to do anything and get an ultrasound every six months to see if the cyst enlarges. In case of latter, or if size is increasing, two options exist but conservative management with medicines will only provide short term relief. Surgical intervention is the only long term solution. That said, considering your age you are a candidate for MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young) especially if you have a family history of diabetes. Also, if on any later ultrasound you find more than one cyst polycystic kidney disease or even Wegner's might have to be taken in to account. For now, you need to get the following tests done: 1. HbA1C (glycated hemoglobin) 2. CBC (complete blood count) and 3. U/CE (urea and electrolytes). Follow up with the test results and also do elaborate on why was ultrasound done and what were your symptoms for proper future management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend is 21 years old and suffers from anxiety. He feels like it is getting in the way of his daily activities and interactions with people. He used to get attacks more often but that is a lot better now. He decided to start taking L-Theanine pills or supplements. I would like to know more about these pills. How safe are they? How long or often should they be taken? He currently takes them with caffeine (200 mg of supplement for every 100 mg of caffeine) average of 400 mg L-Theanine a day. Could they become addictive? Does it have any side effects? What more should we know?","Doctor":"Hello. L-Theanine is an amino acid synthesized from tea. It helps with reducing stress and anxiety and induces a sense of calmness by increasing serotonin and dopamine in the brain which are the feel-good chemicals. As such, it is a supplement and not a medicine per se, so there are no fixed guidelines issued by any regulatory authorities. Normally people do get relief with 200 to 600 mg. Since it is synthesized from a stimulant (tea) it is advised not to combine with other stimulants like caffeine. It can increase anxiety once the effect of caffeine wears off. Apart from that, there are no side effects as such and not really addictive. If the anxiety issues are troubling, it would be advisable to visit a local psychiatrist and take a short course of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) class of medicines which will help with this problem. Also, consider doing deep breathing exercises or yoga or meditation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 years old.

Doctors prescribed him with diuretic medicine. A few months back, I took him to emergency and spent a night over there, later transferred to ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for almost a week, his situation gotten worse and doctors put him on a ventilator for 72 hours.

I need your advice in this matter. I have uploaded the medical history report and the tests we have done here.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing your query to me. I can understand your concern about your father. I have seen all the reports attached herewith (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Considering his general condition now, your concern of air travel is very important to analyze before you book tickets with the airlines. Also, it is not as simple as we think but with careful evaluation and guidance he maybe able to fly shorter destination flights. Very important to remember that he is still recovering from bad respiratory failure and cardiac event. Also, still he is oxygen dependent at room temperature. Being hypertensive and recently hospitalized, it is advisable to avoid any travel at least for 6 weeks to prevent further complications. Fitness to fly for COPD patients need to comply a definitive pre-travel eligibility criteria and need necessary documentation from treating Pulmonologist. During air travel in commercial flights, oxygen level falls considerably due to low cabin air pressure and we must supplement oxygen to prevent further hypoxemia and other complications. So it is advisable to keep checking oxygen saturation frequently. If the resting oxygen saturation is less than 92 %, he may require supplemental oxygen in-flight. But commercial flights generally dont allow to carry our oxygen cylinder but you can carry oxygen concentrator with prior confirmation from airline. Airline can provide supplemental oxygen if required during flight but it will be very costly and has to be booked well before in advance while booking tickets. So it is very important to take opinion of his treating Pulmonologist and do pre-flight evaluation if he is fit to fly or not. Necessary medicines, inhalers and tablets need to be refilled before flying. Once he is fit to fly, while booking seats, consider seat neat toilet to avoid walking, frequently check oxygen saturation and avoid tea, coffee or any other drinks during air travel. Please make firm confirmation for all the concerns with the airlines before you book tickets. Do not forget to get fitness certificate and medical prescriptions from your doctor and carry them during air travel.

Two weeks back my brother got infected with chickenpox and after that, even my sister in law is infected with chickenpox. My wife has already had chicken pox in her early schooling days. I have a few questions. Is it advisable for my wife to stay in the same house as we are? Would there be a chance that a person would get infected more than once in a life with chickenpox? We performed a varicella IgG test for my wife and the report says equivocal, what does this mean? (I have attached the report). How bad and critical is it for her to get infected at this stage of pregnancy? Is there anything that could be done to protect the baby if she gets infected?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the report. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can understand your concern. I will answer one by one. As you told me it is 8th week I would like to tell you that in the first 12 weeks the overall risk of transmitting infection to the child and development of severe disease in child is only 0.4 percent. In your case, the mother already has protective antibodies (IgG antibodies), cutting down the risk further. But still, we do not want to risk the child whatever risk may be. So I will advise for isolation of mother or patient until all the lesions of chickenpox get crusted because after they crust, they get noninfectious. The chance of getting chickenpox again in life is a rare phenomenon but at times if the immunity is low it may occur. Equivocal in the report means that the mother has protecting immunity against chickenpox but not very strong. It would be strong if the levels were more than 12 but it is not negative. That means the mother can fight some infection. It is not very bad to get affected at this stage, but if it happens near the delivery time or within five days of delivery then it is very bad. Right now, even if she gets infected, she will develop immunity and pass on to the baby. Some antiviral drugs can be given if infected, but I do not think she requires it now. And yes definitely, until the infective stage of your brother and sister vanishes you should think of isolation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to the E.R twice in the past two weeks and I went to two different hospitals. I am 20 years old. The first time I went to the ER with chest pain, they did an EKG, x-ray, blood work and put me on the monitor for two hours. Everything came back fine and they sent me home. The doctor said everything looked good. Well, the second time I went to a different hospital and did all the same tests and the doctor came back and said everything looked great and I should not worry. He sat down and talked to me and my husband for about 30 minutes. He said he is pretty sure of what I am feeling is bad anxiety because I was in a bad car accident about five months ago. I hardly leave the house and he said it might be a depression sitting in with anxiety because I am just sitting at home and not doing what I normally do and go out. He said another thing, I have two small kids and lifting them and playing with them can cause aches and pains. My chest still hurts only when I am lifting something or moving my arm or body in the wrong way. I also think I am a hypochondriac because ever since my chest first started hurting that is all I think about, then new things pop up like headaches, back pain, neck, shoulders, ribs and I keep having to use the bathroom and it is runny. I keep thinking something is wrong and my husband and family keeps telling me I am fine. Two doctors said I am fine and I am just over reacting which is making my body tense into thinking something is wrong. Can that really happen? I do not have any health insurance so it is hard to just up and go to the doctor. I just want some reassurance.","Doctor":"Hello. Such chest pains during stress occur because of anxiety only and we label then non-specific cardiac chest pains. But we should always keep in consideration cardiac chest pain and acid reflux. It is important to differentiate between the all. However, the cardiac chest pain is severe and crushing in nature. It increases on activity like walking, exercising. It is also radiated to the left arm. In such a scenario, you should get an ECG (electrocardiography) and chest x-ray done. If they are normal, I would advise you to go for a treadmill test and echo. If they are also normal, then the pain is not due to cardiac issues. For acid reflux, I would advise you to take a combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone once a day. For anxiety, you would be treated with antianxiety drugs like Etizolam. Share my opinion with your doctor before acting upon it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed by urinatory tract infection. My scrotum testicle doppler ultrasound was perfectly alright. But I have visible veins from then my testicle are misaligned, right is forward and left is backward. Do I need to see a doctor? If it is normal. Can anyone tell me why this happens and how to fix it?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern, as you have urinary tract infection and problems with testicles let us discuss both the aspects one by one. Urinary tract infection: 1. Urinary tract infection means you have a bacterial infection anywhere in your genitourinary system i.e. anywhere in kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, prostate or urethra. 2. You should get these three tests done to precisely diagnose the location and the bacterial organism causing that infection. The tests are: a) Ultrasound of prostate and KUB (Kidney, ureter and bladder). b) Urine complete analysis. c) Urine culture and sensitivity. Urine culture and sensitivity will reveal which particular bacteria is causing infection and most importantly it will enable us to know that to which particular antibiotics this bacteria is sensitive to. Once you get this culture and sensitivity report you can either consult your doctor or else you can send me a scanned copy of your report so that I can prescribe you the appropriate antibiotic course along with dose and duration for which antibiotics and other drugs to take. I would strongly advise you not to take any antibiotic blindly on hit and trial basis, it can cause more harm than a benefit so get the culture and sensitivity test and only after that start taking antibiotics. Testicles: As you have mentioned doppler USG (ultrasound) of the testicles was normal, you should not worry about the visible veins. Veins are very superficially located in the scrotal skin and it is perfectly normal to have visible veins especially in the scrotal region. The only point is that in some people they are less prominent and in some more prominent, thats it and it is absolutely normal to have visible veins. Having one testicle forward and one backward is also perfectly normal and everybody has one of either testicles placed forward and another one backward. It is not misalignment it is what the normal alignment is, so shed off all your worries completely out of your thoughts and relax. Both your testicles are absolutely normal and also there is nothing wrong in the veins of your scrotum. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 5 months old now and turning 6 months in four days. He had loose motion three days back. Since yesterday he is better, but he has lost his appetite and weight as well. He used to have 120 ml of formula milk in three to four hours gap. But now he is having only 60 ml of milk. Now, what can I give him as he is turning 6 months soon?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. For loose motion give Walamycin DS (Colistin sulfate) 5 ml twice a day for five days. Syrup Vizylac (Lactic acid bacillus) 5 ml twice a day for five days after meals. According to me after completing 5 months stop milk from 8 AM to 8 PM and give semisolid diet like dal, dalia, khichdi, alu, kela, rice, apple, upma, halwa, patola, rab, kadi, idle, poha, satu, custard, etc, and from 8 PM to 8 AM mother's milk is preferable, if not give top milk without water and add sugar as per your taste. To start with stop milk for four hours for 15 days and give a semisolid diet, then for the next 15 days stop milk for eight hours and give a semisolid diet. Lastly, stop milk from 8 AM to 8 PM and give a semisolid diet.  For your knowledge 100 ml milk gives 70 calories of energy, 100 ml juices give 55 calories of energy and 100 gm of semisolid diet gives 350 calories of energy. According to me give following supplements Vitanova D3 drops half ml once a day, Zincovit drops 1 ml once a day, Feris drops (Ferrous ascorbate and Folic acid drops) 1 ml once a day and syrup Ostebon (calcium and vitamin D3) 5 ml twice a day.

Recently I completed the 10 days dose of Ciprodex drops, and the discharge has cleared, but fullness and pain have not reduced. Recent hearing test also showed mild-moderate hearing loss in the right ear and tinnitus. I have a history of cholesteatoma in the left ear. Doctor noted visualization of granular tissue in the attic during the last appointment and ordered a CT scan to rule out cholesteatoma in the right ear. Is there anything remarkable in either ear on these scans? Any evidence of cholesteatoma? If so, has it done any damage to the middle ear structures? Also, can you tell me what surgery they did on my right ear?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the CT report. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  There is a residual soft tissue density in your right middle ear, likely granulation tissue. Additionally, there is right mastoid effusion, meaning air cells in the mastoid bone filled with fluid, Combination of mastoid effusion and middle ear soft tissue results in fullness and may explain the pain. Soft tissue around the middle ear ossicles results in conductive hearing loss. It is expected that you have a mild or moderate hearing loss. Good news, it is usually reversible with regression of granulation tissue. Regarding granulation tissue, it usually regresses and your symptoms usually get better with time. Regarding evidence of cholesteatoma, there is no evidence of bone resorption. Especially scutum is very well preserved. Unfortunately, this granulation tissue may progress to cholesteatoma, you understand that if your symptoms get worse. On the left ear, there is evidence of cholesteatoma surgery, partial mastoid resection. Mastoid cavity looks clean. Very minimal soft tissue in the left middle ear. Bilateral inner ear, meaning the sensorial part looks good. Additionally, minimal mucosal thickening in right posterior ethmoidal cells are present. I hope this helps. Right middle chronic otitis without evidence of cholesteatoma. Follow up if symptoms get worse, repeat ENT examination and scan."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I used to play football a few years ago, however, I had to stop playing due to symptoms of immediate fatigue after a maximum of one sprint, wheezing, dizziness and palpitations. They were first attributed to asthma, however, upon having a cardiac MRI, I was told there are no issues with my lungs and the problem lies with my heart. They took an ECG and I was told I have two slightly impaired valves with some regurgitation and a slightly swollen right side. I might possibly have ARVC, however, I am still waiting to get a Holter strapped. What I would like to know is, will the Holter definitely let the doctors know if I have ARVC? If it is not the case can the performance of my valves be rectified or will my heart's condition remain permanent?","Doctor":"Hi. ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) is diagnosed on echocardiography or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Then further risk stratified on past history, family history of ARVC or sudden death in the first degree relatives, or Holter monitoring to detect ventricular tachycardia. Furthermore, genetic testing can be done, especially if your first degree relatives also have the same disease. Competitive sports are a risk factor for the progression of this disease and also for sudden death. So exertion is contraindicated. It will be easy for me to guide you better if you share your echocardiography, and MRI reports with me and also send ECG."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 23 years old. I weigh about 70 kg.

But the cause depends on the consistency of stool. If it is loose then we need to be worried. I need some information and would suggest a few investigations. What is the consistency of stool? Is there any blood or mucus in the stool? Any fever? Weight loss? Pain in the abdomen? If the answer for all these questions are no, then do x-ray abdomen. Is there any constipation?

So continue Formoterol plus, and Fluticasone inhaler in prescribed doses and also tablet Montelukast 10 mg one at night. In case of emergency, you can take Asthalin or Levolin inhaler for relief from cough or breathlessness. Consult your doctor regularly to adjust the dose of the inhaler if you are not getting any benefit. Usually, you must continue inhalers as no other medicine will cure asthma permanently.

And also sometimes I have difficulties with breathing and I keep having itching throat. I went to the doctors they always give me medication that does not stop the allergy. I do not know what to do?","Doctor":"Hello.  Nasal congestion, running nose, itching of the nose, watering of eyes, sneezing, etc are classic symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Added to this breathing trouble, wheezing, mucus production in lower airways are signs of asthma which signifies allergies of deeper air tracts. These two constitute the presentations of the hyper-reactive airway. It is also termed airway hyper responsiveness. The best way to treat allergy is to find the offending agent or what we call the allergen. Once that is done we can give small subclinical doses of allergen into your body to make you immune to the allergen. This is called immunotherapy. Before we subject you to immunotherapy we first want you to take a skin prick test. Various common allergens of your area are injected in small doses in skin intra serially and response noted. Positive response to allergens noted. Specific immunoglobulin E produced against these allergens are measured in the blood by tests. After quantifying immunotherapy is started. Any other form of treatment is only symptomatic. Only immunotherapy can give you lasting relief from allergy. If however, you require immediate temporary relief from allergy, you may take the symptomatic treatment which usually consists of a short course of steroids, intra nasal steroid sprays, antihistaminic and leukotriene inhibitors. These drugs are prescribed by the medical practitioner and if you require those kindly revert back to me. I will be happy to help you with the drugs and their correct dosage and how to take them. I must also say avoidance of allergen plays a great role in keeping allergy at bay."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a patient of bipolar disorder.

Normally, after the first episode of bipolar illness, medicines are advised to be taken for one year and stopped slowly. After a second relapse it is advised for two or three years and then stopped. For the third relapse, it is to be continued lifelong.

I do no do any exercise nor under contraception. Also, I am not sexually active for the past three months.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have missed your menses and the home pregnancy test is negative as on date then the most common cause of delay in menses during this cycle would be stress-induced hormonal imbalance. However, if you are breastfeeding then sometimes irregularity in menses is possible as well. Next, the best thing to do in your case would be to wait for another five days and if no menses then repeat the urine pregnancy test and then if negative again, then opt for a transvaginal ultrasound to check for endometrial thickness. If the endometrial thickness is more than 9 mm, then you can opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterones to resume your menses. Keep your daily water intake to three to four liters as it is the best anti-oxidant and de-stressor considering your disturbed sleep pattern. This would help regularize cycles naturally. Maintain a menstrual calendar for the next three months to understand your fresh pattern of bleeding and if no change and this being a singular episode then no apparent need for any medications for regularization of cycles would be required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a chronic migraine for almost five months now, no medicines or treatments have worked and transferring to a hospital with more resources soon.

I also have occasional pain in my inner ear, the pressure that feels as though my ears clogged even if they are not. The other day my hearing was tested at an ENT and they told me my hearing is perfect, and that auditory processing disorder (APD) was a possible answer but that if so there would not anything to do. I have looked into APD and it was described as almost auditory dyslexia which does not sound like an accurate description of what I am dealing with. It is hard to process what could be going on based on the fact that my ears were tested to be in perfect help. If you have any insight or advice, I would love some guidance.","Doctor":"Hi. Auditory processing disorder could be the possible reason but before that, the initial level of otosclerosis (spongy bone formation in the middle ear ossicle restricts the sound transmission, middle ear infection) should be ruled out.  My advice is to consult with an audiologist available nearby. Please undergo pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, impedance audiometry, BERA test (brain stem evoked response audiometry). If possible go for HRCT temporal bone (high-resolution computed tomography) also. That will give us a much clearer picture of your problem.

The condition is known as nevus sebaceous. In case of deep surgical excision in nevus sebaceous, chances of it coming back are very less. The thing is the excision should be deep to minimize the chances of recurrences. Laser treatments are there but not very effective and chances of recurrences are more.

There are a few things that you can try before the period starts, which would help to make it less painful and some which you can try during the period. When you are not having a period include physical exercise (at least 30 minutes) to increase the strength of your body. Eat healthy food, less fried foods and gradually reducing the portion of each meal. So instead of three big meals, have five small meals. Yoga poses such as child pose, knee to chest pose, camel, resting corpse are a few which help a lot in menstrual cramps if done regularly. Have enough sleep. During the menstrual cycle, the warm water bottle is always the easiest way to soothe the cramps, keep it handy. Having lighter and warm meals like soups or porridge instead of heavy like bread is a better choice. Hydrating yourself is essential and will keep your energy levels high. Avoid caffeine, eat more fruit and vegetables. Do light exercise, take a warm bath, and get enough sleep (6-8 hours).

Mention the name of the first food and why it can negatively affect or worsen arthritis symptoms? I am hoping to highlight inflammatory foods, foods high in sugar, foods high in saturated and trans fat, and dairy which may be a cause for arthritis for some people due to its casein proteins. Please try to name a specific food (i.e. yogurt) and not a group of foods (i.e. dairy) and reference studies when possible. Please specify the name of the second and third food and why it can negatively affect or worsen arthritis symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. There are some lifestyle and nutrition recommendations that can be given to any patient suffering from arthritis that may help reduce the pain. Diet rich in omega-3 and antioxidants. Some studies have shown that omega-3 help decrease swelling or inflammation and the antioxidants help reduce the free radicals in the body. Avoid alcohol and red meat. Some patients suffer from high uric acid levels, which may worsen arthritis symptoms. Red meat contains high levels of purines, which are then metabolized in the kidneys and may affect and increase the uric acid levels. Alcohol dehydrates the body and this makes it even more difficult to eliminate the purines or toxins from the kidneys. The easy way to achieve a healthy weight and include omega-3 and antioxidants in the diet is by a Mediterranean diet. This means cutting back on red meat and eating fish and legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas) as the protein source. Omega-3 rich foods are healthy fats like avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds and olives, and also salmon. The Mediterranean diet suggests that you eat lots of vegetables and fruits, which are rich in antioxidants. Stick to natural grains like quinoa or brown rice and avoid processed foods like white bread or pastries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What are all the foods men should eat every day?

Stretch? For each reason can I ask you to explain how exactly that helps the sore muscles? What are the signs that your sore muscles are something more serious than just sore muscles? Anything else you would like to say about DOMS?","Doctor":"Hello. Muscle soreness or DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) generally occurs if someone does strenuous physical activity in any form. Strenuous physical activity means when one's body is unable to do more physical work but that person pushes his body to do that. It can occur within 24 to 72 hours. It occurs due to small scale damage in the muscle fibers. The best way to get rid of it is to increase any physical activity gradually because it will help in increasing the strength and stamina. Epsom salt bath, massage or sauna, etc. are helpful in muscle soreness because first they relax the muscles and second they increase the blood flow. The clear role of cryotherapy is still not understood. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

In general, a person requires 1500-2000 calories per day. Carbohydrates, in general, can fulfill approximately 50% of our daily calorie requirements. People should usually take around approximately 200-325 grams of carbs daily. But if someone is aimed at losing weight then they should aim for a low carbohydrate diet. Then people should take around 50 to 150 grams of carbohydrates daily who are adopting a low carb diet. Also, proteins and fats are also important parts of our diet. If someone is on a low carb diet then they should consume 38-130 grams of protein per day, depending on their weight. One can consume between 30-60 grams of fats while on a low carb diet from healthy sources. There are a variety of vegan foods that you can use for energy like spinach, oats, almonds, lentils, fresh fruits, and chia seeds, etc. These foods are easily available and have a variety of nutrients and also easy to eat. So they are recommended for quick energy needs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am writing to you in connection with my partner’s allergic reaction which happens when we are together. Basically she is already allergic to dust and has atopy on her right hand since she was a child (now she is 23 and I am 27), which is sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker but always there. As she is a Japanese girl living in Japan, we have met three times in various places, but her symptoms have appeared every time. Small red rashes appear on the hands and later on the legs too. Her face gets itchy and breaks out in pimples too. These always start days after meeting again and get better some days after we leave each other. We also tried sleeping apart and that helped a bit on the symptoms (no sexual intercourse yet). So I am afraid I might have something that makes her produce such reactions. She also blames my dreadlocks which indeed catch not few dust (but I will cut it before we meet soon so that possibility will be crossed out). Because of her dust allergy, they live in a very clean environment so I also suspect that staying longer at an inherently dustier place (like my flat) might get her reactions acting up. Also, she had a lot of stress because of traveling to meet me, which also does not help such skin diseases. In some places, we slept in hotels, so we always suspected the local washing powders to cause these effects but in my work place I deliberately bought a new linen bed to avoid such a problem (although I washed it before using it). Dishes were different in the three countries so I cannot see that there would be a common ground for an allergic reaction. I will buy new clothes and will wash them myself according to her hygienic discipline and we will see how it goes. I do not regularly use deodorant, nor aftershave and I had different shower gels all the time. What else could we change to stop her reactions or to find out what caused them? How could we soothe them? Maybe after being together for a long time she would get used to my flora and she would eventually stop her reactions in an environment with less stress? Of course, I sent her to a specialist as well to get checked (to see whether I can be the cause).","Doctor":"Hello. You have described your partner's problem very nicely. She is suffering from chronic urticaria. Urticaria is an allergic reaction that takes the form of itchy red bumps on the skin as shown in your pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Name anything that can cause an allergy, and it can also cause hives including pollen, dust, dander, dust mites, shellfish, and other foods. First thing, in the management is to find out the trigger. To avoid hives, you need to figure out what causes them. If you do not know, start keeping a daily diary. The most probable suspects are things that you eat, drink, or swallow, drink, supplements, and medications. But even if you do not see any obvious connections, continue keeping your diary, noting other factors like weather, stress levels, clothing, or the amount of time that you spend in the sun. With careful tracking, you may link a specific lifestyle factor with the eruption of those red, itchy welts. Foods most likely to trigger hives include shellfish, nuts, chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, and milk. Some people react to preservatives in certain foods and wine, such as sulfites. Once you have identified a food trigger, eliminate it from your diet and see whether you have fewer outbreaks. Common drug triggers include antibiotics and non­steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen. But doctors have heard about many other triggers, including sedatives, tranquilizers, diuretics, diet supplements, antacids, arthritis medications, vitamins, eye drops, eardrops, laxatives, and douches. Seek emergency medical treatment if you develop hives around your eyes or in your mouth or experience difficulty breathing, wheezing, light-headedness, or dizziness. You may have a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis, and the internal tissue swelling can block breathing passages. So better you get done her blood allergy test. That will give you a clue about your trigger so that you can avoid it. Tablet Levocetirizine or Desloratidine are helpful when you have a rash. Calamine lotion or astringents help shrink blood vessels, so they do not leak so much of histamine or mix one teaspoon of any kind of vinegar with one tablespoon of lukewarm water and apply the mixture to your hives with a cotton ball or tissue to soothe the itching. Take Fish oil in capsule form three times a day. The primary treatment is to increase the immunity of the body. An excellent remedy is to take one teaspoon of turmeric powder (Haridra khand) with a glass of milk or water two to three times a day. Massage the skin with mustard oil for 15 minutes, followed by a bath with lukewarm water. Make a paste of two cups of oatmeal and three teaspoons of cornstarch and water. Apply this paste on the affected areas until the itching is reduced. Stress can cause hives or make them worse. So avoid it in any form. Try meditation or yoga to boost your immunity. So after allergy test avoid that specific trigger. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I visited an Asian massage parlor and received anilingus and a whole body tongue massage on an exposed pimple on my back that was slightly bleeding from irritation during the massage.

Also, should I be concerned about rabies? She was not symptomatic but she mentioned that she was recently from Shanghai and had a dog. I did not notice any bite marks on her and she appeared in good health but I am still worried. Is rabies a concern at all?","Doctor":"Hello. Rabies can only be transmitted only if she is infected and her saliva is having rabies viruses. So rabies is not a concern because probably she is not infected as she is not having any symptoms. If she does not develop any symptoms for another ten days then it is highly unlikely, because this is the time period within which she develops symptoms if her saliva is having viruses. However, the possibility of STI (sexually transmitted infection) is definitely possible and depends whether she is infected or not.

How does vitamin C content in okra help to reduce respiratory illnesses like asthma? What is the relationship between okra and kidney disease? How can eating okra daily help reduce kidney damage? How can okra help reduce the absorption of glucose in diabetics? Why is it beneficial to add okra to your diet to lower bad cholesterol levels? How does okra aid your immune system?","Doctor":"Hello. Okra is a vegetable with amazing health benefits. It aids bowel movements in constipation, lowers cholesterol and reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Research shows that this vegetable has natural anti-diabetic properties. Remember that the benefits of okra are due to its fiber and its mucilage (that unpleasant slippery inside). So if you cook the veggie in such a way that you leave the fiber and the mucilage intact you can enjoy its immense health benefits. Chop off the ends, cut them into a few pieces and soak them in a cup of water overnight. The next day remove okra and drink the water. Naturopaths maintain that this medicine also works great for joint pains due to the viscosity of okra which aids joint movement. It is wise to consume okra like other vegetables. But okra alone cannot do miracles like getting pregnant in a woman with some gynecological problem or it cannot cure kidney stone."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently hurt my middle left side of my back in wrestling.

If you have localized back pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, and neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesias, etc, then you can start with following recommendations for an initial period of two to three weeks. 1. Maintain a proper posture of your back while working and sleeping. 2. If pain is more then you can take a short course of an anti-inflammatory medication which suits you. 3. Physical therapy initially under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist and then to continue at home. 4. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake if levels are low in the body. 5. Ice packs should be applied three to four times a day (10-15 times every time). 6. Analgesic spray for a local application can be used and is easily available. 7. Avoid lifting heavyweight, acute forward bending in the mornings, etc. We will observe you for the next five to seven days how you respond to this conservative management protocol.

With constant sitting or lying down you will additionally get pain or sore muscle aches. Try to move your position frequently. Do you have a tingling sensation after a prolonged posture or continuously? Nerve compression can lead to a tingling sensation. Compression at the cervical spine level leads to tingling in arms and compression at the lumbar spine will lead to tingling in legs.

As for the feeling of cold water going down your thirst and the acid reflux, both indicate an inflammatory condition esophagitis and gastritis. This can be treated with a proton pump inhibitor Controloc (Pantoprazole) once daily and an antacid Ranitidine before every meal. The bad breath could be due to inflamed gums or an infection such as H.pylori. So I recommend you get a test for H.pylori infection and consult a dentist to examine your gums. Bad breath can also be due to sinusitis.

Your platelet count is low and suggestive of severe thrombocytopenia (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The bleeding could be due to that. The reactive large platelet also seen in smear. So platelet destruction might occurred in your body. Dengue and viral infection are common cause for that. Your platelet count need to be monitored at 48 hour interval. Drink lots of water. If platelet count still go down and bleeding does not stop than platelet transfusion might given. You can rule out dengue by Elisa or Rapid card test."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need help for my 19-year-old son. He has tried SSRI's which did not work (Then we had the Gene testing done and it showed that he should not be on the one that he was on) and seemed to make him worse. He is now on an SNRI, the same one that his mother is on and that is not working as it should either. We have tried the Ketamine treatments and they seem to help short term (a couple of days). We stop those treatments when he was hospitalized at the end of last year. He was required to be hospitalized to be observed for ECT treatments which were started. We saw a great improvement with the ECT and after about 7 treatments, he was backed off to once a week which seemed to work okay, with only one bad day. Then he was moved to every two weeks and it got bad again. We got him in a few days before the two weeks were up and he still had some very bad days. He is a psychiatrist but my son is not honest with him because he fears being locked up again. I guess my question is this. What medication in the SNRI class have you found to work the best for major depression? (I know he has been labeled treatment-resistant but the anxiety medication he takes seems to work). Is there another class of medication that you would suggest we try?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly sir, it is just a brief labelling to broadly differentiate classes, but many people who do not respond to one SSRI/SNRI, will do well with another drug of the same class, so cross switching between classes is also done. Among the SNRI, my personal experience as well as the literature, supports the use of Venlafaxine as superior compared to others. Lets assume that we are going to use Venlafaxine as a primary drug. In non responders or resistant, usually augmenting agents are given. I do not know what agents have been tried for your son so far. But normally, SNRI with mood stabilizer like Sodium valproate or Lithium, or SNRI+low dose second generation antipsychotic, or SNRI plus combinations of mood stabilizer and low dose antipsychotics can be used. Apart from this other classes of drugs can also help such as Mirtazepine, Bupropion, and as and when needed temporary use of low dose Benzodiazipines and Propranolol can also be added.  The goal here will be remission of symptoms or atleast reduction to an acceptable level. In patients with resistance, usually 2 or 3 drug combinations will be needed. Also many psychiatrists do not reach the maximal dosage recommended of most drugs and that also needs to be tried out. Apart from this, you should consider getting 6 to 8 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy from a clinical psychologist. It will also help and add to the effect of medicines."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know, what is your role in working with children with hearing loss, or more specifically, what are the duties that involve the children with hearing loss?

If you are familiar with the speech and language services that children with hearing loss receive in your school or community, do you think that these services are meeting the needs of the students? What do you think about this? If you are aware of the hearing-related services that children with hearing loss are receiving in the schools or community where you are, do you think that these services are meeting the needs of the students? What do you think about this? Do you have anything that you would like to see done differently by people who work with kids with hearing loss? (e.g. programs, funding, devices, etc.).","Doctor":"Hi. The primary role in working with children with hearing loss is an early diagnosis of the disease and etiology. Once the diagnosis is made, our duty is to treat the reversible cause of hearing loss (this is more common than irreversible or genetic causes). Our goal is, prevent the probable, diagnose the inaudible, treat the curable, rehabilitate the disabled. Hearing is one of the most important sense organ, mutually connected with vision, for speech and language development which is a must for communication. Most important consequences of hearing loss are speech and language development, and overall psycho-social development (this is dependent on communication).  Children with hearing loss have special importance, as they have to be diagnosed early to prevent the delay in speech and language development. The best means to achieve this can only be Universal neonatal hearing screening. This scheme is not followed in our place due to various reasons like a) social factors requiring community and individual participation, b) economic resources, c) Government policy support. I would like to have a universal hearing screening program, because, only if we can diagnose early, we can do something. So the first step is early and all the cases to be diagnosed.  Hearing and Speech and language services for hearing impaired are meeting the needs of students who are receiving treatment facilities at tier1 and few tier2 cities. But at the rest of the places, these services are not adequate. The reason is again a) lack of awareness of available facilities, b) constant changing of technology and products, c) low literacy also prevents parents from utilizing these resources d) lack of funding and support from dedicated organizations, e) human resource and f) society participation.  Few important needs are: a) Universal neonatal hearing screening. b) Social awareness of the impact of hearing loss and treatable diseases. c) Funding for hearing impaired children, with the provision of financial support for special schools. d) Need of low cost and effective rehabilitation devices that should have stable technology, easy to boot, does not have much maintenance cost. e) Increase in more and more audiologists are needed, especially to serve the needs. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 38 weeks pregnant (38 weeks and 2 days). I took an ultrasound today. My report shows: Biparietal diameter 8.93 cm (36w 1d) Head circumference 32.17 cm (36w 2d) Abdominal circumference 31.65 cm (35w 4d) Femoral length 6.98 cm (35w 6d) Average age of gestation based on today's scan: 36 weeks Estimated fetal weight: 2765 grams. I just want to ask if I need to be worried, as my doctor said the baby is small. Is there any problem for the baby because I am on 38 weeks 2 days now, but base on my ultrasound the baby is 36 weeks.","Doctor":"Hello. The growth of the child is two weeks smaller for 38 weeks but corresponding to its ultrasound age, the weight of the baby is fine. There is a likelihood that you may have had an irregularity in your menses earlier and your ovulation may have been delayed and leading to late conception. However, best would be to undertake a biophysical profile and an umbilical artery doppler, MCA Doppler studies (middle cerebral artery) to look for cause for decreased supply to the fetus (if at all). If these parameters are normal, then your dates are probably wrong or you have had delayed ovulation and fertilization because fetus would then be considered growing and pregnancy can be continued and followed up with serial ultrasounds.  But nevertheless, even if dates are not good, still it is advisable that one should go with your dates as at 38 weeks and deliver the child by 41 weeks, considering the child has matured and the average fetal weight is also good. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 10 years old. He had cough and low-grade fever. Five days later, I showed him to a pediatrician. She advised Augmentin 625 mg, Mucolite and Duolin nebulizer. The next day my son has symptoms of reaction with Augmentin like diarrhea. So my doctor switched to Azee 250 mg. After 10 days, my son still has a little wet cough that only interferes a little at night with no fever. His chest is clear but the doctor has advised Zocef 250 again and she says though the chest is clear, productive cough is there. Please advise me what should I do? Should I give him antibiotics again?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Your 10-year-old son had a cough and fever which required Augmentin and nebulization, this means that the child has got wheezing with lower respiratory tract infection. Augmentin contains Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid which may cause diarrhea in some children so rightly the antibiotic needs to be changed. You have been given Azee which contains Azithromycin antibiotic, which has made the system better. Now, there is a mild cough but it is wet or productive. A productive cough may persist for some time as the infection which was earlier there in the chest of your child has formed mucus or phlegm which needs to come out from the body. This productive cough will persist for some time even if you take an antibiotic. In my opinion, there is no need for any antibiotic now and you should only give cough syrup. This productive cough will subside in one week. Just protect the child from cold temperature. Avoid cold drinks and ice cream. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a stage 1 to 2 bladder prolapse. I would like to get the surgery but I am suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. I am terrified about getting the surgery. In my mind, it got fixed that if I go there I will die from that surgery. It is said that it will be done through the vagina and she will fix it to the solid part of the pelvis. No mesh will be used and it will be by spinal and not general anesthesia. I am someone who does not tolerate the medication. I always have bad reactions even if it is Demerol, Morphine or Codeine. It does to me the opposite effet that it is supposed to do. Could you tell me more about the surgery? What are the risks? Will I die from getting the surgery? I do not even have a date for it and I think about it all the time. I am terrified. I do not want to die. Can it be done by local anesthetics only?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question and understand the concerns. Vaginal surgery for the bladder repair is safe and there are no major risks associated with it. Complications like bladder injury can occur, which is not at all life-threatening and can be surgically managed. Spinal anesthesia is safer than general anesthesia, and all the vaginal surgeries are done in it. It cannot be done in local anesthesia. You should consult a psychiatrist and get properly treated for panic attacks and anxiety, before going for surgery. Bladder prolapse cannot be treated medically, and surgery is the only option. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 24 years old and I have had PCOS and was on homeopathy for five years. Sonography reports came normal. Now I want to know that if there are any chances of it coming back as sometimes I do feel pain in the left ovary. Also, my grandmother has breast cancer and at times I cough and sneezes a lot. Are there any chances of me getting the same?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concerns, but you should not worry as there is no reported association between PCOS and breast cancer. Also, you should know that PCOS cannot be cured completely, medications and homeopathy can control only the symptoms and increase the chance of fertility if required. Advice: Take oral contraceptive pills (Gynera once daily for 21 days then 7 days off repeat every month), Metformin 500 mg twice after lunch, Spironolactone 50 mg once before sleeping as anti-androgenic. Please send me a copy of your sonography report as well as any performed lab tests e.g. fasting blood sugar, postprandial glucose level, etc. Send me a photo of the acne or facial hair if still there. Follow up after two weeks. Note: If you desire to be pregnant, seek advice some of these medications must be changed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have small white bumps in my testicles skin like pimples, one or two looks nearly 1 cm size.

From the pictures I saw (attachment removed to protect patient identity), those are called sebaceous cysts the small ones can disappear with time. Keep in mind you should keep the area clean and dry in summer like you can use powder to keep it dry but the bigger ones need to be removed. Do not worry, removal does not need admission.

It has gotten worse over the years and now I cannot deal with the anxiety, I cannot deal with the lows and I contemplate leaving away for good so many times.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry to hear about this, I can understand how hard it is for you right now. Personal beliefs and thoughts are formed through our experiences, social background, parenting and family structure., during our childhood. As you have mentioned, that you have always felt this way, this means there are subconscious thought patterns, called cognitive distortions in technical terms which are faulty and dysfuctional and are clouding your thinking. I would suggest you to start Psychotherapy. There are various techniques through which these fixed beliefs can be brought to conscious understanding and then changed and learn to cope up with. Then work is done to find out where and when in your past experiences you picked up these beliefs and you can remove your emotional blocks away and get past these. Sometimes high functioning depression or anxiety presents like this. Please do not delay, this can be resolved and there is hope. Take care of yourself."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Does this report show a normal result?","Doctor":"Hi. I have worked through your query and understand your health issues. I assure you not worry as you have consulted the appropriate expert physician who will take care of all of your medical concerns. I will simplify the things for your understanding and will go through whole of the echocardiography report attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  There is no tumor seen inside heart chambers. No blood clots seen means your heart is pumping in such a normal way that there is no turbulence of blood and heart valves are not causing any thrombi formation. All the chambers of heart are seen normal inside. Pumping of blood to the lungs and to rest of the body by right and left ventricles respectively is all normal. Relaxation of heart chambers during beats is also normal. No abnormal connections between the heart chambers. Very mild mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation of blood, and that is insignificant and considered normal. Nothing to worry right now but keep a follow up with a cardiologist in the future too. Right ventricular systolic pressure of 30 mmHg is a little in the higher figures (15-25 mmHg being normal range usually). They have suggested an eustachian valve remnant at right atrium. Eustachian valve is a fetal structure, and we usually see just a flap of the valve after the birth of the baby. After birth, it has no function and it is seen usually and normally on echocardiography. So it is normal for you too. Problem was if there was a giant eustachian valve that may have been dividing the right atrium into two chambers inferiorly due to rigid overgrowth of the eustachian valve. Another abnormality (you do not have) related here is cor triatriatum dexter and needs cardiac surgery to correct it. You are safe. Final Impression:- Normal Echocardiography report. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was wondering if I have a reaction to cardboard and/or the chemicals in them. About eight months ago, I started working in a warehouse working with cardboard boxes, after about a week my fingers started to tingle and bother me. Best way to describe it if you fall asleep on your hand the only thing that would help was to ice them. After I stopped working there within a week or two everything was back to normal. I recently started working with boxes again and the same exact thing is happening to my fingers. So is there something in the cardboard that I have a reaction to? I wear work gloves. OTC pain pills did not help, bio freeze help a little. Is there anything I need to do for this to go away?","Doctor":"Hi. Well, the sort of complaints you are saying looks more of a nerve compression than an allergic reaction. Allergies are common at workplace where you deal with new stuffs. But in allergy, you get more of skin eruptions and peeling (contact dermatitis). Since you have more symptoms of tingling and numbness, it fits in more with nerve compression. Probably due to fine motor movements you have to do, which compresses the nerve. Something like carpal tunnel syndrome. To confirm this, we need to do NCV (nerve conduction velocity) studies. Meanwhile, I would suggest you wear a wrist band while working to prevent the nerve from getting pressed. You can read up on the internet about it and let me know if your symptoms match this."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to lose weight. I do not eat much and I have been working out regularly.

In recent years, I have developed a sensitivity to Morphine and I cannot take Dilaudid (Hydromorphone) because it gives me terrible headaches. What other options are available to put into my spinal catheter for post-operative pain control in the hospital? I know that Fentanyl is short-acting and they do not use Demerol any more in my place.

From your brief history, I can sense that you have already become tolerant to opioids. Once tolerance develops to one group of opioids, simultaneously other opioids also develop the same way. I would suggest the addition of Clonidine, Dexmedetomidine through your spinal catheter since opioid-tolerant patients do have good postoperative pain relief with this drug. Multimodal analgesia with intravenous Ketorolac, Buprenorphine through the spinal route can be another option. But I do not know whether your anesthesiologist is comfortable with these drugs.

Finally, for a few times, you can try taking Sildenafil or Tadalafil to help with getting erections.

Is it possible for someone to have this result and an infection that does not make the patient's symptoms visibly worse for a week? If so, could you give some examples of such infections? The patient is not on antibiotics. Can a high vacuolated neutrophil result indicate some sort of problem other than an infection?","Doctor":"Hi. I appreciate your knowledge. You are right, vacuolated neutrophils suggest towards infective etiology more likely. But let me know you in such a case usually neutrophilia is also seen. So vacuolated neutrophils interpretation should be done in accordance with total WBC (white blood corpuscles) and total neutrophils count. Your clinical correlation and physical examination are also necessary. Vacuolations in neutrophils suggest phagocytic function of it in infection e.g. pneumonia, fungal infection, septicemia, typhoid, etc. Sometime in inflammation also such cells are seen. As you have rapid weight loss cause for that should be searched. Some of the causes are HIV, acute infection, COPD, gastrointestinal problems like celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, tuberculosis, etc. So the clinical correlation is necessary to do further work up. Provide your other reports if it has been done along with full CBC (complete blood count) report. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old male. I am married for the last six years. Before getting married, there was an incident where I had a sexual encounter with a girl. However, during this, I had erectile dysfunction. So after about one year, I got married to my long term friend. In the initial three to four months I had issues of not being able to maintain an erection. However, over time we adjusted to a pattern and we got over it after about six months. We have been having frequent sex over the last four to five years. However, throughout this time, maintaining the erection for more than say 10 mins has always been impossible. Recently, I had a sexual encounter with another girl but had a lot of problems in getting the erection and maintaining it. I have a well-built physique and do regular exercise and play games. My weight is 89 kg and height is around 5' 10\\". I am a heavy nonvegetarian and eat lots of fish, chicken, and beef. After the above incident, I have started doing a bit of diet control along with my regular exercise. I also have an inguinal hernia over the last few years and I am planning to get it operated soon. I have been thinking of buying Tentex royal but wanted to take advice from you before going ahead with any medication.","Doctor":"Hello. From your query, I could infer that you had difficulty in getting and maintaining an erection with the new girl only. You were able to have frequent and normal sex with your wife before the encounter with the above said girl. It means that the cause for erectile dysfunction at the incident was due to performance anxiety which is purely situational and psychological. Hence nothing to worry much about physical causes and be relaxed and enjoy your sexual life with your wife and masturbation (once in a while). I will not recommend any such enhancers like Tentex royal, as it makes you feel that you lost your vigor and you have regain which is not real. What you lost is your confidence which you need to regain. Exercise, yoga, etc., can make you fit which in turn improves your sexual life. If you are so much worried about physical causes, then you need to do 1. Routine blood and urine test. 2. Serum testosterone (fasting state). 3. FBS (fasting blood sugar) and PPBS (post prandial blood sugar). 4. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). 5. Prolactin. These are basic tests for male dysfunction.

PIease advise me on whether I really need to have it check physically by an ENT because I am afraid of the COVID 19 situation.","Doctor":"Hi. The most common reason for nose bleeds in children of this age group is 1. Frequent nose picking: We need to ascertain the cause of the nasal bleeds as the most common cause is secondary to dry nose and crusting which in turn causes irritation. Dry nose can be treated by using saline nasal drops four drops six times a day to ensure that the child's nasal mucosa is kept moist and does not dry up. In addition, I would also recommend the child not to get directly exposed to AC / fan as it can also dry up the nasal mucosa often. 2. Adenoid hypertrophy: Usually the adenoids increase in size and they can also be a reason for recurrent nasal bleeds. The child can be put on Mometasone nasal spray two puffs two times a day for the next coming three weeks. 3. Infection in the nose: This can also be another cause of recurrent crusting and inflammation in the nose which results in nasal bleeds. You can give her syrup Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 228.5 mg 4ml three times a day after food for the next one week. It is better to treat all three possibilities for long term relief from the symptoms. All three aspects are extremely common and there is nothing that you need to worry about as it is very common for children to present with such a problem. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

So whenever someone has a fever, it is very likely that they also have a high WBC count. There are different types of WBCs which increase/decrease in different situations.

My question is, many times I feel a sudden sharp shooting pain in the middle and slight left of the chest which shortens the breath and gets normal within a few seconds (drinking water helps in to be able to breathe at this time). Also, I wear a MI fit to track the heart rate while walking. Even when not walking too fast, my heart rate touches 165 bpm. Is this normal? I am suggested to take Amtas 2.5 but I have not too it so far. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly it is a moderate to severe AR (aortic regurgitation) with normal heart function and normal LV dimension. So there is no significant damage to the heart. And also since you do not have symptoms of aortic regurgitation like palpitations or shortness of breath with exertion, serial monitoring with echo would be enough. Now regarding chest pain, it is unlikely to be cardiac. It is likely related to acid reflux which is diluted by drinking water. So you may have some antacid medications like Rabeprazole, Domperidone or Pantoprazole and Domperidone combination before breakfast for few days. You should also avoid spicy, oily, and hot foods as much as possible. Have light meals and walk for sometime after meals rather than resting immediately. Avoid too much tea or avoid caffeinated drinks. Now regarding heart rate, it is unusual for heart rate to go up this much with simple walking, however, with running it is expected. Also, one would certainly feel palpitations at this high heart rate. And arrhythmic tachycardia would have other associated symptoms like dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. So it is probably an artefact, which is read as heartbeat by watch. It is better if you can wear a watch which also shows ECG tracings to confirm it or have 24-hour Holter monitoring to confirm it. Amtas is for blood pressure, not to control heartbeat so if your blood pressure is elevated then you may have it. So in a nutshell, it is probably artefactual rather true tachycardia, as it is unlikely for the heart rate to go above 150 with just walking. However, if one is too breathless during walking or has severe low hemoglobin or hyperthyroidism with baseline elevated heart rate of more than 100 bpm then it may or otherwise not. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

It is completed.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine the level of your frustration for your chronic unresolving symptoms. And I really feel sorry to hear that you been back and forth around doctors for solution of your symptoms. Well, I can very well understand your problem, I will explain to you point by point.  1. Lax LES (lower esophageal sphincter) is not a uncommon findings on endoscopy. It reflects that the valve which controls reflux from stomach to lower part of food pipe is little bit open. However, your endoscopy did not show any ulcer formation in the food pipe which suggest you do not have Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). Again your symptoms are not related to GERD. It is something else. I tell in a moment.  2. So you see the fundal gastritis (inflammation of the fundus- a part of stomach). Usually inflammation of stomach confines to the other parts of stomach -like antrum and stomach body, but not to the fundus. The one cause of inflammation predominantly to the fundus suggest H pylori infection. This bug initially infect antrum of the stomach then it moves to fundus if chronic infection that has not been treated. I will suggest you investigation before I suggest you an antibiotic course of this H pylori. And remember this H pylori can cause stomach slowing leading to your symptoms of gas. The condition is called gastroparesis. Below I explain to you in more detail the reasons of your symptoms of gas.  3. To simplify the constellation of your symptoms, we doctors classify in to two- the predominant gaseous symptoms or predominantly pain symptoms. You have predominantly gaseous symptoms including bloating, sounds, burping, fullness, early satiety after meals, and some gas in stools as well.  So it is important you should understand why these gases production is in excess in you. The one such reason is: i) Dysbiosis-which is alteration of human gut bacteria more gas producing species. These bacteria or harmlessly present in the human gut, however; at times the environmental factors, food, water, other dietary habits; change the composition of these bacteria and turn them in to gas producing bacteria. I will give you an antibiotic for a 3 week duration, this will correct your dysbiosis. ii) The other reason is excessive of food intake that produces gases. These foods are collectively called as FODMAPs. These foods to be avoided as possible as you can. I will share with you a link where you will find the list of such foods which should be avoided. iii) Less common mechanism is feeling of normal amount of gases-this condition is called hypersensitive gut. For this I would suggest you behavioral therapy called diaphragmatic breathing. I will share you the link how you can exercise it at your home.  I really hope now you would the some idea of mechanism causing your chronic unresolving symptoms. I would just correct your above mentioned mechanism, and you would see the things get improved for you.

Key findings include: Sinus rhythm with frequent supraventricular ectopy (2559) which included couplets and one seven beat SVE multiplet. No complex forms. No significant pauses or periods of heart block noted. Constant feeling of missed beats coincides with frequent supraventricular ectopy. Very infrequent ventricular ectopy that was isolated and univocal. Cardiologists not concerned with findings and recommended positive affirmation, distraction, and cognitive behavioral strategies. He was very reluctant to recommend anti-arrhythmic treatment seeing this as overkill. Other matters of interest. Recent stress echo (March) indicated above average fitness for age (14 mets) and reached a maximum heart rate of 160 bpm. Moderate aortic regurgitation (grade 3-4), normal ejection fraction (60), LVEDV (138 mls), no demonstrable ischemia or arrhythmia. The recent PACs are very noticeable and I feel every one of them. I would appreciate a second opinion or advice on whether there is anything else I can do to stop them. I am currently on Atenolol 100 mg, Crestor 40 mg, Effexor 74 mg, and Valium 5 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. Premature atrial contractions or supraventricular ectopics are not harmful per se other than giving you symptoms. So antiarrhythmics are not usually recommended, so I do not disagree with your treating cardiologist. Beta blocker is the safest option available, although not the most effective one and other options are ablation or antiarrhrythmics. So trying behavioral techniques is a good option. But if it troubles you a lot then you may request low dose antiarrhythmics like Amiodarone for a short period of time, but they may again come back after the drug is stopped. Since there is no atrial fibrillation or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmics are absolutely necessary, but the benefit would be in you is just symptomatic, which comes with the risk of side effects. However, you should have Holter at regular intervals like yearly (with echo for aortic regurgitation), or if you notice sustained ectopics or irregular rhythm implying development of fibrillation. You may discuss changing Atenolol to others like Metoprolol and see if its help. You should try to identify triggers like sleep or gastric disturbances, alcohol or smoking (if any), any particular medications (which you are on), stress, etc. Also, if not had recently, thyroid should be tested. So in a nutshell, antiarrhythmics may be avoided, but if not tolerable symptomatically then may be tried.

See what happens not only third molar, any tooth extraction carry the risk of a dry socket. It is nothing serious just unhealed extraction site. Upon extraction healing takes places by the blood clott that stays in the socket post extraction.That clott dislodges if rinsed vigorously by the patient , so as a precautionary measure I make sure to advice each of my patients not to rinse forcefully for atlest 24 hours and after that warm salinge gargle gently, just to remove if any food lodgement to the socket. Symptoms of dry socket is very painful area of extraction, pain similar to the day after it was done and no such relief upon medication. Bone is visible at the extraction socket with no signs of healing. This was all about the dry socket. It is not like it a sureshot or rare thing its totally based upon how a patient manages himself 1-2 days prior extraction. Now coming to the management it is simple too. Nothing to be worried about, You will have to visit your Dentist, he/she will clean the socket to remove if any food partice and then place a gauze mixed with medication and pack the area of the socket . Due to placement of the gauze the area gets secures from further food lodgement and heals itself in 1-2 weeks to be maximum. To ckeck, it is better you send me an image of the extraction site, I will have a look and let you know. It is better this way to avoid any confusion. I will be waiting for your response so kindly upload as soon as possible.

The capsules are 100 mg, and I would like to take 50 mg, but I need the delayed release to remain working because otherwise, I get too many side effects with nausea. The side effects are also the reason I would like to take 50 mg two times a day instead of 100 mg once a day. I investigate and found that the delayed-release mechanism can be in the capsule (and if this is the case, I cannot open it, to remove half of the pellets, because it will loose the delayed release mechanism). But I read on the internet that the delayed-release mechanism can also be in the pellets inside of the capsule. If this is the case, I could open it, and remove half of the pellets, and the delayed-release mechanism would still be working. I want to know is the delayed-release mechanism of Doxypal 100mg RL contained in the pellets or is it due to the capsules?","Doctor":"Hello. The delayed-release capsule contains the active drug (Doxycycline) and few other excipients that slowly release the active drug from it. So, the active drug is mixed with the excipients and put into the capsule. So, if you divide the capsule into equal half, it still works. Still, it is delayed-release and you can make 50 mg dosage.  You also see that whether the infection in acne is controlled with 50 mg dose. If so, you can follow it. If not controlled, then 100 mg must be taken. The benefit and side effects should be weighed to choose the balanced dosage."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Eight months ago, I had severe RSV lasting for 10 weeks. I am 66 years old, athletic, fit and in perfect health before RSV. I took no prescriptions whatsoever. I got RSV from my friend's infant at church. My husband is a double-boarded physician and recognized the RSV very quickly. I had acute wheezing and coughing. I was on five prescriptions (the usuals) for 10 weeks. I was off all medicines and back on the treadmill daily and also at the gym. The one very noticeable thing that has remained and is very troubling, is that every time I climb stairs in my home (about 18 stairs to the second floor) I am quite out of breath. This does not happen on the treadmill but just on the stairs. I am convinced this is damage from RSV. The two x-rays, six months apart are showing scarring from the RSV. I was recently at a high altitude after many visits to that same location, and I was seriously struck with altitude problems. I was extremely short of breath and had to get a prescription inhaler which helped enormously. When I returned to my place of low altitude, my breathing greatly improved. My questions are: Can I improve my lung scarring in any way? Should I get pulmonary studies? If I am not wheezing, will an inhaler help shortness of breath upon exertion? This is a problem for my fitness program and my very busy personal life.","Doctor":"Hi. Scarring is an irreversible process so it cannot be cured. Your breathlessness is due to less lung reserve because of scarring. Kindly share your x-ray chest image. Your lungs will not become normal but breathlessness problem will be corrected by medications and respiratory exercises (pulmonary rehabilitation). Medications are simple bronchodilators like tablet Doxophyllin 650 mg OD with inhaler combination of Formeterol and Budesonide. Respiratory exercises can be done in the form of pulmonary rehabilitation. Download pdf form of pulmonary rehabilitation and do it slowly in increasing way. I hope this helps.

I could see my blood sugar gone up to 289 mg/dL on post prandial (PP) last month and reduced to 175 on PP and 109 on fasting last week. In the meantime, for the past two weeks, I suffer from fissure. I am a case of vitiligo and epilepsy for 20 years and under medication with Valproic acid 500 mg (reduced to 250 mg for the last 10 months) and Clonazepam 0.5 mg. I have been noticing that my penis skin is shrinking for the last eight months and now narrowed down to 8 mm opening on the penis forehead skin. For the last three months, I am suffering from back muscle spasm. After consulting MD medicine, I am taking a sitz bath for fissure, continuing Valproic acid 500 mg for epilepsy and back pain, following a strict diet for blood sugar, and no medication for vitiligo.

I have checked all the attached reports thoroughly (attachments removed to protect patient identity), and here are my notes: 1. Repeated high post prandial sugar above 200 means that you are diabetic and need to start therapy. Do you have polyuria (frequent urination)? do you drink water more than usual? 2. Repeated cholesterol level above 200 along with fatty liver grade 2 means dyslipidemia that requires management. 3. Stress ECG shows some changes that could mean some cardiac ischemia. Do you feel any chest pain especially with efforts? if yes, could you describe it?  4. All other investigations are within normal limits. Advice: 1. Healthy life style that includes daily 30 minutes walk, a healthy diet with low sugar, starch, and oily foods. 2. Metformin 500 mg after meals plus Glimepiride (Amaryl) 2 mg before breakfast (for diabetes). 3. Rosuvastatin 10 mg once per day (for high cholesterol). 4.

I just had my blood test done. Kindly advise the possible medication and preventive health care. I am attaching my complete blood report.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query and attached report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), my opinion is as follows: Most of the values are borderline normal. Early iron deficiency anemia manifestations through low MCV and MCHC are present. However, iron levels are normal and should get corrected within two months. Hemoglobin being the lower limit of normal, it should not be the cause of the symptoms being experienced at present. Vomiting and dizziness sensation appears to be possibly local cause like gastritis or gastric reflux esophagitis. Proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole with Domperidone should be helpful in curbing vomiting. Irritation in the stomach or esophagus is known to cause dizziness. I hope there is no tarry or black color stools (if present, it indicates bleeding in the stomach). You need to reduce stress, eat regularly, and avoid spicy foods. Sleep should be regular and proper. Avoid lying down immediately after food, at least for two hours. Also, you need to concentrate on nutrition to improve borderline values. Take protein rich diet with green leafy vegetables, two egg whites and Vitamin C rich fruits should help in improvement. Also, maintain good hydration, with at least five to six liters of water per day. Avoid coffee or tea, if possible as it can cause gastritis and also reduce iron absorption. For now, Pantoprazole with Domperidone should be helpful along with lifestyle changes as indicated above. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My granddaughter is 17 months and one week old. She was a term baby born out of a normal vaginal delivery.

So, I am wondering if I should see professional help? It started about a year or more ago, and then it was merely the lower left side of my back. It would go numb for a brief time after riding for about thirty or more minutes. However, as time has progressed the pain has gotten worse, and mostly the pain is in my left knee. I own apartment buildings, and I love working on the properties, but it is beginning to wear on my body being a 53-year-old male. Yesterday was especially hard because I was on a ladder a lot and it makes my lower back and left knee hurt when I use a ladder, and I went up and down three flights of steps numerous times moving supplies from one apartment to another, and it took its toll. Therefore, today I am experiencing pain in my left knee on the side of my knee and in the back. Last night, I woke up with a lot of pain in my left knee and it was a burning sensation, but my back did not hurt as it usually does. I had a baker's cyst many years ago on this same knee, and my doctor advised me to take it easy for a few days and take Advil. Once I did as he recommended the pain went away and until recently I have had no problems with my knee. One more thing most of the time when I feel a sharp pain going through the left part of my lower back it makes my foot numb. If I sit or lie down and pull my leg up to my chest it gives me a lot of relief. Most of the time if I am feeling this sensation in my lower back and it starts to go down to my left leg (pulling my leg up to my chest for a couple of minutes) will usually make the pain go away completely. Most of my time is spent about ten hours a day at my desk working, and while my favorite thing to do is work on my properties. I have to sometimes hire people because of spending so much time at my desk. At one time (about ten years ago) I used to lift weights (free weights) and workout on a cross-trainer for two to two and a half hours a day (from Monday to Friday). Although as I got more responsibility for my work, I started cutting back on the exercising and eventually gave it up altogether. So, I do not do anything outside of working on my properties for exercise, and I hope to start lifting weights again and doing cardio because my waist has gotten up to a 34 and I want to stop it from expanding more. However, I am afraid to start any exercise routine before I find out what is going on with my left side. The pain I am referring to is strictly from my waist down the leg and to my foot. I have no problems with my right side, and if a doctor recommends surgery, it is not going to happen because I grew up with a dad that had Perthes. And I have seen how he has suffered his entire life and how many times doctors have replaced hips telling him this one is the last one only for him to have to go back over and over until he is finally in a wheelchair. Sorry, there is one more thing my primary doctor has retired, and I have not been sick in over seven years, so I have no primary doctor to give me a referral, but I have to do something about this pain. Thanks for any advice or ideas you can give me because I always worry it might be cancer because my grandmother died of osteogenic sarcoma. I am currently taking Vyvanse, Sawpametto, Vitamin C, Magnesium and multivitamin.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to icliniiq.com. Your symptoms (back pain radiating in the knee and leg) are suggestive of a bulging (slipped) intervertebral disc in the lumbar region, which is causing irradiating radicular pain in the knee. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical examination and a lumbar spine CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study. Prolonged sitting position or weight lifting could be the cause of such clinical situation. For this reason, I would recommend having some rest, avoiding prolonged standing up or sitting position, and avoid weight lifting. Painkillers (Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen), coupled with a muscle relaxant (Flexeril) can help improve the pain. Local warm packs on the lower back and massage or physiotherapy can help improve your situation. A nerve conduction study would help to determine the possible damage to your nerves. You should discuss it with your doctor on the above tests. I hope this helps. Bulging lumbar disc. Lumbar column CT scan or MRI scan. Nerve conduction study.

I am sorry to hear about your problem. Let me try to explain your problem in detail. What you are describing is called obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A person suffering OCD has repetitive thoughts that are beyond control. For example in your case, it is this feeling of doing the same thing several times, these are obsessions. The act you do to feel better and get rid of these thoughts are called compulsions. Coming to the management, the first thing you need to do is start cognitive behavioral therapy, in which the therapist will help you recognize his thoughts and teach you techniques to control them and not get involved in this behavior. The second thing is medication, in severe cases medications are required. This can be checked after complete evaluation. Medication and cognitive behavioral therapy combined are the gold standard treatment of OCD.

It is a rapid vibration that I can see when I look in the mirror and feel when I touch the affected area. I do not experience any pain when the spasms are happening and I can still talk, smile, and otherwise move my face. I first began noticing the issue last year. The spasms seem to come and go. For the past few days, they have been occurring at night. Sometimes the spasm is still happening when I go to sleep, but by the time I wake up, the spasms have stopped. Last night, I noticed the spasm started after a workout where my heart rate got up to 171 bpm. I have talked to a few doctors who have recommended magnesium and I have noticed that when I take 400 mg per day dose, the issue does not last as long. That said, the spasms are still happening. I do not drink large amounts of caffeine never more than one cup a day so I do not think it is related to that. A couple of weeks ago, I noticed a similar spasm under my left eye, but that only happened for a day and then disappeared completely. Last winter, I noticed an eye spasm as well, which lasted for a few weeks, but then disappeared entirely. My GP did HbA1c, TSH, T4 free, CK, sedimentation rate, magnesium, basic metabolic panel, and GFR all results came back normal. She provided me a referral for a neurologist and I am working on getting an appointment. There are some long wait times so I am hoping to speak with a specialist in the meantime to get a little bit better of an understanding of what this might be.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand the issue. It is basically the facial muscle spasm that you have. In the classical pattern, it involves larger areas of the face and not smaller area or single muscle. The cause for it can be mild compression (more of irritation than compression) over the nerve which runs into the facial muscles. The site of compression can be near its origin secondary to pressure from a neighboring blood vessel. The less common cause can be viral involvement of the nerve in the ear. For that, you should be investigated with the TORCH panel (viral screening test). Depending on results we can plan further management. A short therapeutic course of steroids may help. If it persists for a long time then Botox injection into the muscle to inactivate it will help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 19-year-old female doing MBBS.

With chronic stress problems like severe headaches, migraines social avoidance can occur. I would suggest you to talk to a counselor and they will help you find out the negative thoughts which are causing this anxiety and this type of behavior and they will help you to cope up with them and be able to enjoy your life again. Either find a local counselor or you can opt for online counseling sessions with me via icliniq.

It is so embarrassing as I am a lean guy and with a belly protruding out. I am going low on confidence. I cannot leave my depression tablets but I cannot ignore my increasing weight either. Could you please let me know what should I do to lose this excess weight and get back to shape? I cannot walk as I have a slipped disc problem. I cannot go to the gym either as it is not recommended by doctors. If on leaving Topomax, I am going to gain weight again. Then it is only a temporary solution. Further, in spite of taking Cipralex 20 mg at night, I am extremely sleepy and feeling tired all day. I fall asleep unconsciously even while driving and working on the computer. I have disturbed sleep at nite and the weight gain is another trouble. I still feel I am depressed and Cipralex is not doing all it can. I need your help to tackle my depression, sleepiness, tiredness, and my increasing weight. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Stopping Topiramate is not the reason for weight gain in your case. Topiramate resulted in weight loss and the drug is also a good mood stabilizer drug. This helps in stabilizing the mood and supplements the antidepressants. So stopping Topiramate probably result in worsening of depressive symptoms and thus altered food intake which consequently resulted in weight gain. In my opinion, you can start Topirmate again and this will help in controlling the weight gain. The drug will help in improving the depressive symptoms too. So there is no harm in restarting the drug. Apart from this please change your dietary intake. Avoid any foods with refined sugars and high fat. Take high protein diets rich like meat, and animal food. Avoid fried food totally. Lime juice in an empty stomach daily without sugar should be included in the diet. Please take at least a cup of green tea which will help to dissolve the belly fat. This will help in making you fit again. If you are feeling sleepy and tired then drugs like Modafinil can be added to your prescription. Modafinil will help in improving alertness and will reduce your tiredness. This will help in improving the depressive symptoms too. So you can make these changes and you will definitely come out of depression."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 34 years old and I have facial droop in the lower half of the left side of my face. It has been with me for years. I would not call it a paralysis or bells palsy as I have full control of my forehead and eyebrows, but the lower part when I talk it is noticable that the lip from the left side is way lower, and the nose as well seems lower from one side. I was wondeing what this could be, all the searches online say stroke but I am young and never had any symptoms of stroke, so what else could it be? And what would you advise me to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to know some details about your symptoms: 1. When, first time, you noticed facial drop in left lower half face? 2. Did it happen suddenly? Or it happened slowly and gradually? 3. Did you had any weakness in left arm/ hand / left leg along with? 4. Had you any change in voice that time? 5. Have you ever undergone some tests for its evaluation? 6. Have you any symptom in left ear: hearing difficulty/ ear discharge/ hearing abnormal sound? 7. Have you any other significant medical history (apart from this facial droop)? 8. At what time this facial droop is most noticeable: at normal forward face look? while smiling? while speaking? while eating? while laughing? 9. Have you any difficulty in swallowing?

The first time we used the condom, the second time without and did the withdrawal method. I took the action about one and a half an hour later. I do not know when I was ovulating and did not think it could be my fertile week. I started bleeding five days later and it was light and pink then has gotten heavier and turned red and moderate enough to soak a panty liner. I have taken HPT twice and both showed negative. Is this implantation bleeding or withdrawal bleeding?","Doctor":"Hello. If it was your second day of your period and you take an emergency pill after intercourse that it is withdrawal bleeding and due to the tablet. Your period can be irregular this time and may take two to three cycles to get regularize and maybe the next cycle will be normal depends on your body's own hormonal cycle. If HPT (home pregnancy test) is negative then no need to worry, you are not pregnant and the second day of menses is counted as safe days of any cycle. So you cannot be pregnant during that period because of no ovulation during menses. Drink more water and wait for your period and do not get much stress. Everything is fine and under control. And if you get your period for three to four days and if you have intercourse two days after that, also you had taken the precautions like condom, withdrawal and at last emergency pill and it also comes in safe period. So do not worry. More chances that it is withdrawal bleeding and sometimes ovulation bleeding. In both cases, you do not have to worry because if it is ovulation bleeding then it is happening now and no need to worry about before. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old. I am experiencing weak erection and difficulty in sustaining the same. This condition was observed 10 years back.

Recently, I might have been exposed to mercury vapor in a hotel room I was sleeping in for around 6-10 hours the room was small and the type of mercury was unknown. I remember the one type of chemichal was clear liquid watery substance and the other onces was more clay grey wich dissolved in water. I left the room around 6-10 hours later and did not touch anything but I might have breathed in the vapors in this small room. I also washed away the crystals that has landed on the carpet. All of these substances I have no clue about what was, except when I asked I was told mercury. 3.5 months later I got a pins and needles feeling in arms and feet wich has lasted a month, but no other symptoms until now I feel like I have some kind of internal vibration in my feet and my knees are shaking when I stand up like I am freezing or have done a hard workout from time to time. I went to the doctor in my area and told him about what had happend and showed him pictures of the various substances and I took a urine test and a blood test and this was made around 130 days after possible initial exsposure and the test came back at normal levels, but can it be that I had a toxic exsposure and the mercury has already settled in organs and therefore do not show in blood or urine I am not sure about the half life times in these metals or can I settle down and accept the test results are final and that mercury levels do indeed declear that I have not had an exsposure of toxic levels and that my symptoms might be of other cause? 2. If not number one is the cause then, a few months before that, I got an acute pins and needles feeling in hands and feet (paresthesia) which continued untill today and it increased over the one month before it stabilized a little, it went from pins and burning sensations different parts of the hands, and pins feeling in the legs. A few times I got shooting pain from a finger and up my arm but very rarely which has not returned. After alcohol consumption one weekend it went from stabilized to worse and I also noticed my knees shakes a little when I stand still but not when I am walking, the feeling can be compared to when you are freezing or after a hard workout on your feet. It started with a sensation under my feet like I was standing on a vibrating phone and then moved up to my calves which felt like they were bubbling inside and now my knees which shake when I stand, but the vibration under the feet is gone. My hands also one week felt like they was shocked and they turned red and stiff, the kind of feel like I put my hands down in hot water and then removed them, red spots on my hands underneath the skin appeared and the closest thing i found resembeling it was purpura when I looked up causes online, my hands are much better now but it still feels like some areas are \\"sunburnt\\" and my fingertips are peeling, but I think that is because of winter and dry weather (the red spots remains) I have taken multiple blood test for vitamins deficency and other things which turned out normal besides vitamin D which was a little to low and neurolgical test like standing on one foot with eyes closed and finger pointing and sensation test of sharp/cold/hot which all was normal.

So Doctor do you have any ideas about what this can be?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of mercury intoxication. Anyway, I would recommend performing nerve conduction to in order to examine your nerves and a brain MRI in order to examine your brain.

However they said they were not being sold. They prescribed Althea cypriterone acetate ethinyl estradiol (2 mg / 35mcg tablet) from Trust and said to take 1 per day for the next 21 days. However if I understand correctly: Is this a normal contraceptive? I read some things about the yuzpe method, how would this work with the contraception described? And I already took one pill an hour ago. What should I do? I do not want to get pregnant. Especially since this is the 13th day since my menstruation, I am getting worried.","Doctor":"Hi. You should get emergency pills if they are selling normal contraceptive pills. Anyway in emergency pills the dose of hormones are more. So you can take 4 tablets two times a day for 2 dose. Can also works same as emergency pills. But at the same time you should understand that emergency pills are not 100 % safe and there is up to 30% chance of failure. But have only option after unprotected sex. When you stop taking tablets than there can be withdrawal bleeding within 7 days. And your cycle can be irregular for 1 or 2 periods if you are not pregnant. Best way to confirm whether pills worked or not is to wait for 15 days atleast and do urine pregnancy test on kit and see. If turns to be positive than you are pregnant and if negative than pills worked well. Do drink more water. Chance of failure is because pills worked by stopping ovulation but if ovulation already happened than it will not work. So have to wait and watch after taking pills."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My dad has been on dialysis for 2 years and has only recently been getting pounding headaches 1 hour into dialysis. He says they are pretty painful and it only occurs in his forehead and just to the right of the forehead. It does not make him sensitive to light, sound or any vision changes. He was in the hospital a month ago for a left leg amputation and while in the rehab unit, he had a seizure that we witnessed and it took him 2 days to wake up from it. The MRI showed Posterior Reversible Encepholopothy, caused by very high blood pressure. Luckily, he is almost 100% neurologically and memory regained. I bring that up because only after the seizure and PERS MRI result is when the headaches started on dialysis. He never had headaches before on dialysis prior to the seizure/headache. The doctors did not put him on any new medications after this and tylenol helps the headache greatly but it still bothers him, and I do not like him taking tylenol almost every day. He is on Metoprolol 50MG Extended Release 1x per day usually in the morning and his blood pressure is fairly controlled (usually in the 130's/70's) however sometimes it gets high during dialysis . I have an appointment with a neurologist in January, as that was the first available. Any answers?","Doctor":"Hi. Having headache one hour into dialysis suggest either it could be related to transient increase in blood pressure or changes in electrolytes during this interval. Is his BP monitored during dialysis and where do they stand. One way to get around is by slowing the dialysis speed which will help in slower change in electrolytes and body fluid thus preventing fluctuation in BP. See if has BP fluctuation during dialysis and his nephrologist should be able to help you. Metaprolol is also a migraine prophylactic medicine, thus it should help with headaches. There are other medications also but will discuss once we are sure its not related to BP. Taking Tynelol daily is not good. It can cause rebound headache the day you dont take it. Limit its use to 2/day or max 2-3/week and/or max 8-10/month. How is his MRI brain now. He had PRES but has it completely resolved, not just clinically but also radiologically. Is he on any anti-seizure medication post seizure. How was his EEG. Is it normalized?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

I take too much stress before starting some work and thinking that it will not work and also my temper is becoming too high. Whenever I get angry I cannot control myself. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand it must be really hard for you to be in this situation. What you are describing looks like an anxiety disorder. There is nervousness in starting anything new because the mind has negative thoughts which overwhelm you and make you feel it might not work out, and then the mind gets fixated on this pattern of negativity and you just cannot stop the overthinking which gives you stress. And long term stress produces aggression. What you need is to start psychotherapy. Via counseling (psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy) the therapist helps you find out where these thoughts are coming from and help you in changing these thoughts in and controlling them so that inside it is not produced in the first place. Second part is anger management where you learn some techniques to control your temper and also via therapy you will be able to find out the source of your anger. I would need to talk to you in detail to be able to find out why you are having these thoughts after I take a detailed psychiatry history and evaluation. You can find a local therapist or we can start therapy sessions online via video consultation. If the problem is severe which we will be able to find out after evaluation, we can decide whether or not you need medications. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, About a month ago, I had protected sex with a woman and unprotected oral sex with her as well. Then two days after that I had unprotected oral sex and fingered a different woman. Five days later, I got a low fever of about 99 degrees. The following day I got chills, night sweats, joint pain, and a bad fever about 102 degrees that broke that same night. The next day, I got a rash that covered my entire stomach, chest, arms and legs. I went to the hospital and they told me they thought it was a viral rash. The rash went away in about 24 hours. I got an HIV RNA and fourth generation test done ten days after the last incident and then I got another HIV RNA and fourth generation test done again at 17 days from the last incident. Both came back negative. I tested the woman that I had protected sex with using Oraquick and she came back negative, but I did not test the woman that I had unprotected oral sex with. Could this still be HIV? I have never gotten a rash like that before in my life. What are the chances that this could be HIV based on the two negative RNA tests?","Doctor":"Hi. See, a rash does not confirm the diagnosis of HIV. A rash is a very common finding in viral Infection and you could have got the viral infection from your partners only. Luckily this time the virus was not HIV. The fourth generation PCR tests are highly sensitive and hence you do not require any further evaluation. I would hereby conclude based on the details that you do not have HIV. I would also recommend you to avoid unprotected sexual exposures as well as to indulge with more than one partner. Every time you cannot be lucky like this time. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After a neck injury five years ago, I get a headache every morning.

After careful review of your detailed case, I want to add that musculoskeletal insult is the main cause behind this pain and lifestyle modification is its main solution. I will elaborate all of this in a very simple way so that you may come out of this pain and can sleep comfortably. Thanks for uploading all the supporting documents and I have thoroughly reviewed all of them. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Fortunately, your cervical spine and the surrounding structures bear no visible signs of major trauma that may have warranted immediate interventions by an orthopedist and neurosurgeons. Your cervical spine, spinal ligaments, and the muscles got extreme stress due to excess weight on them. The spinal in cervical region is not made for weight-bearing. Due to stress or strain caused by weight, there had been a stretch and/or compression causing a change in anatomical structures out there. You need to change the sleeping posture and position your head so that there is a least possible strain on the cervical spine. Keep track of everything you are doing to modify sleep habits. Adopt the one that best suits you. Buy a mattress that is angle adjustable. There are smart mattresses available in the market that makes sleeping a bit comfortable for the cervical spine patients and the general healthy population too at the same time. They are temperature controlled too so if you need to provide heat to the body they help doing it with the click of a button. First, try sleeping without pillows underneath your head. Try sleeping straight (supine position) your whole body facing upwards. Then try sleeping on the right side, then on the left side of the body. It is only you who can tell which ever suits you best. Then you may try keeping a soft pillow under the head. If it hurts again, you need to try the angle-adjustable mattress and try different angles every night. Keep track if raising the angle soothes you or decreasing the angle is a better option for you. Meanwhile, physical therapy is my advice for you. Please consult a physical therapist for proper evaluation and management accordingly. It will assist you in getting out of this pain very fast. You may use heat wraps around the neck to soothe the deep neck structures. It alleviates the pain and improves circulation. Keep a balanced and healthy diet and avoid stressing your spine out by spending a lot of time in front of TV, laptop, smartphone, etc. These are bad for your cervical spine as they all make the neck stiff at a certain angle. If required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old male. I have been diagnosed with Crohn's disease before years and I have been on Humira 40 mg every two weeks. I had unprotected sex with two different girls a year ago. I have had done three HIV tests and one HIV combi Elecsys at 10 months from the last possible exposure. After a few days of the first possible exposure, I had flu. After a few weeks of the last possible exposure, I started to have some skin condition Sebopsoriasis around my mouth and under my armpit. I am also losing some muscle weight. All my HIV and Elecsys test results came back negative. My questions are: Are my tests reliable? Does Crohn's disease affect HIV test results? Being on Humira, will it affect HIV tests? Does Humira cause a false negative? Also, I know that sebopsoriasis is associated with HIV. Is there any other tests I have to do? I am under huge stress, I need your help.","Doctor":"Hello. Going by your description, it seems highly unlikely that you have contracted HIV infection. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immuno0sorbent assay) detects antibodies to HIV antigens whereas the combi test detects both antibodies and antigen. Since you have done these tests much after the exposure, I believe there is a little chance that you could be harboring HIV infection. The rashes you have developed are more likely to be a part of Crohn's disease syndrome progression. Humira, although may suppress the production of antibodies, it does not affect the detection of HIV antigen. Crohn's disease has various non-intestinal manifestations that could crop up anytime. I believe the new rashes are a part of Crohn's disease syndrome complex."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For about two years, I have constant problems with my hand skin.

Smoking tobacco seems to make symptoms more severe (more peeling and cracking), the problem occurs only in few places on my hands mainly index fingers and right thumb (please see attached photo). Cream with urea content seems to give the best effects. Barrier creams did not help, diet does not seem to have a noticeable impact on my condition. Silica, Q10 and collagen supplementation did not help.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

This person was on 5 mg of Cipralex for quite a few years, then about 8 months began a change of medicines, about 6-7 in this time. Finally this person was given 25 mg Fluvoxamine. First 4 days everything was fine. Then anxiety attacks started. As of last night dose went up to 50 mg. Result is the person is feeling calmer however they feel very disconnected and cannot do anything, cannot concentrate, cannot think or analyse things. I forgot to say that when they started Fuvloxamine they stopped the 5 drops of Cipralex. We do not know what to do tonight, whether to stop this Fluvoxamine and go back to Cipralex or whether to keep going and maybe these side effects will stop (if so how long aproximately). We are very confused and cannot get hold of the psychiatrist that prescribed this. Please if some doctor there is an expert on these meds and theri side effects that could help us. A lot of these medicines and maybe all give strange and serious side effects that are not listed by the pharma companies.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. As you have mentioned that the patient is feeling better with this medication, I would suggest you to continue 50 mg Fluvoxamine for atleast another 2 to 4 days and see if they feel okay. Fluvoxamine has a sedative effect and that is why the patient is feeling all these symptoms of not being able to concentrate or do anything, etc. I would suggest you to take the medicine before sleeping. 50 mg is actually a low dose so you should not be worried. Continue same dose for a few days and see if body adjusts sometimes if anxiety is under control with Fluvoxamine, some medicine can be added to prevent the side effects.  Secondly, you have not mentioned details of the patients age, etc., I would suggest you that if possible, patient should start therapy as well. Medications and therapy when combined give faster results. Take care of yourself."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I always had a lower left brow causing the lid to appear more droopy than the right side. However, the skin on the left side has recently become thinner in the past year I would say, causing less of my lid to appear and I feel a sensation now on that eye like something is sitting on my lid. I am only 18 so I feel like I should not be having any issues with my eyes yet. However, I did have Hashimoto's and thyroid cancer and got the thyroid removed and all of my thyroid levels have been stable since then. However, the skin on my left lid never went back to normal. Also, I feel like I might have a little bit of ptosis in both of my eyes, but it does not obstruct my vision. When I look back at old pictures when I was a baby up until the age of 12, my eyelids appear much more open. So is it normal for eyelids to droop as we age? I am currently on Synthroid.","Doctor":"Hi. You have explained your history nicely. You have not mentioned about photos. Both are recently taken or different. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  In the photos attached first one which is showing your lower lids down seems to be taken in a slightly down gaze. That is a normal thing. When we look down lower lid goes down with the eye. While in the second picture light reflex is central in both eyes and lower lids are in normal position. Your both upper lids are in a normal position. Normally upper lids cover 1-2 mm cornea superiorly. I would not say these as droopy lids. While in cases of thyroid disease skin changes occur like skin thinning and dryness. So these sensations could be due to hypersensitive skin. For dryness of the skin around the eye or dry eyes, you can use artificial tears. It seems you are thinking too much about it. No significant changes are seen in your eyes or lids after seeing these photos. Just relax. Nothing to worry about and you are absolutely fine. If these are older photos you can send the latest ones. And do not take photos yourself (selfies) because it is not taken in primary gaze (looking straight). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, After shaving my face six days ago, I saw a big red bump on the right side of my nose above the mustache. At first, I thought it might be a pimple. Last week, I felt something wrong on my throat and visited a doctor. Doctor said lymph node inflammation and prescribed me Penicillin. Doctor did not ask me anything about that red bump in my mustache area at that time. I have been suffering from mild fever as well after my lymph inflammation. Right now I am worried again since the red bump on my mustache becomes large, and from two or three openings drains watery liquid when I tried to squeeze it. It is really painful and irritates a lot. I am worried about HSV 1 since it is near my mouth. I am having mild fever and lymph infection. I am not in sexual contact for the last seven years. What is your suggestion? What might cause this problem?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Two broad differential diagnoses are folliculitis or HSV 1 (herpes simplex virus) infection (most likely). I would want you to know that we all are exposed to HSV-1 and it could spread without sexual contact. It stays in the ganglion (nerve endings) and pops up when your immunity goes down. It is also known as fever blister. My feeling is that since you were about to come down with the sore throat, which seems like strep throat, you had a reactivation of the HSV-1 and got these lesions. As you feel better they will subside, you may use Acyclovir if you want but usually, we treat the underlying cause and you are receiving the antibiotics for sore throat. Please do not squeeze it. You can use any anti-inflammatory agent for pain and fever like Acetaminophen. You can also try topical steroids like Desonide. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had unprotected intercourse but no ejaculation was done. I have a fear of being exposed to HIV. What necessary steps should be taken earliest?","Doctor":"Hi. Unprotected sexual intercourse is a risk factor for STDs (sexually transmitted disease) including HIV, however, the risk is very low (0.03%). There is no reason to panic at the moment. If possible, please get the partner tested first. If she is a known case of HIV then it would be advisable to consult the nearest dermatologist for post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). In case if this is not possible, it would be advisable to weigh the risk benefit ratio for PEP in your case. High-risk exposures such as homosexuality, contact with blood during intercourse, sex with a commercial sex worker may warrant a need for PEP. 1) HIV by Elisa at 1 and 3 months after exposure. 2) HBsAg (hepatitis B virus antigen). 3) Anti HCV (hepatitis C virus). 4) VDRL (veneral disease research laboratory). If high risk exposure then consider PEP."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 34 years old and diabetic. My penis foreskin is not pulled back.

One month back I checked my BP, it was 120/90 mmHg and today again I checked, it was 140/90 mmHg. Both were done in doctor's clinic. I did blood hemogram and cholesterol tests everything is normal. Two yrs back I did USG of full abdomen it was normal. In my family, my mom is having a high BP due to which she is a CKD patient and on dialysis.

Blood pressure is different at the same time by different machine or the instrument used previously. Now regarding the value of blood pressure, it is not mandatory that the value is fixed. It is different for different people of the same age. But it depends on weight, height, food habits, regular work out, etc. Take a low salt diet and avoid pickles. Family history did not count but you can prevent it by changing the lifestyle i.e. regularity in food habits, exercise, etc. Avoid consuming alcohol. stop smoking if you do. Avoid or decrease the non-vegetarian diet as it may increase your cholesterol levels and leads to atherosclerosis, heart disease, kidney failure, etc. In nutshell, all organs may be affected. Do not start blood pressure tablets as 120/90 and 140/90 mmHg does not make any big difference. The upper value is called systolic pressure which up to 150-160 is no worry and the lower value is called diastolic pressure in which 90 is the lower limit of high blood pressure.

I am not under any medication.","Doctor":"Hi. Such type of cough is called allergic cough which occurs in a particular time. Gas formation is due to irregular bowel habits. Advice: Hot saline gargle before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Stop fried things, it enhances the problem. Are you hypertensive? Check out your blood pressure also. Treatment: Tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once every day for three to six days, Nexpro RD 200 mg one before breakfast and dinner, Esmoprezole plus sustained released Domperidon for three days one before breakfast for five days or whenever required. For irregular bowel habits, take one bowl of salad in the morning and evening. Add curd in lunch. Take buttermilk in the afternoon it is very good for health. Take husk Isabgol three teaspoons full at night with milk. It is a herbal remedy good for the intestine also. It forms a slimy layer and protects the mucosa of the intestine.

Pregnancy can happen rarely in the scenario you described. There will not be any immediate symptoms of pregnancy. The earliest symptom is missing the next expected period. You cannot do anything to stop the pregnancy right now. If she misses her period, she can confirm pregnancy at home by doing a urine pregnancy test. If pregnancy is confirmed, you can consult a gynecologist for abortion through medicines. In case, she becomes pregnant, she will miss her next expected period. Remember one thing, pregnancy is very rare (most unlikely) in the scenario you described, so there is no need to fear.

We asked her pediatrician and she said with time it will fade away, but I have been researching because white stuff comes out from the tiny hole. Now she is 4 years and it starts to swell up and it is red and tender, her nose also sweats a lot. Is it a nasal dermoid cyst? Please help. Also, what can I do to bring the swelling down?","Doctor":"Hi. This is definitely a dermoid cyst sinus. This lesion typically presents as a small opening (sinus) at birth and as the child grows the wall lining in the cyst accumulates sebaceous material which can get secondarily infected, resulting in swelling and then a discharge. In very few cases, the sinus disappears as age progresses. The infection has to be treated with antibiotics and once the infection subsides this cyst along with the enter sinus tract has to be excised under general anesthesia. For now, you can give her an antibiotic containing Amoxicillin with Potassium clavulanate 475 mg 4 ml three times a day for one week. In addition syrup Ibugesic plus (or its equivalent) 4 ml two times a day for one week to reduce the inflammation and pain. I think, for now, this should be sufficient. Please do not go to puncture or do anything to the swelling as it can flare up the infection and inflammation.

The pain is usually accompanied by the feeling of needing to urinate, as well as some diarrhea. When the pain begins to set in, I make a point to drink lots of water.

Well, I understand you have pain with diarrhea and pain that lasts a few hours before it goes away. Listening to your history, it seems a few possibilities. The pain of intestinal loops affecting the cecum a part of large bowel or terminal ileum which is small bowel. The causes are many but given your age, there are possibilities of Crohn's, yersinia infection or Whipple, and lastly uncommon is intestinal tuberculosis. The other possibility is renal stones. It is not necessary to have stones in urine in person with renal stones. Thirdly, functional abdominal pain syndrome which is basically hypersensitivity of the intestine to food, stools, water, etc. This pain cannot cause weight loss however, the causes mentioned above can cause fever and weight loss.  The third often overlooked cause of pain is nerve entrapment pain. This is because of the compression of the nerve in between the muscles.

I am sure you have seen the story in the news today about the newborn baby who is in critical condition after contracting meningitis from someone kissing her (according to her mother). I am working on a follow-up story on whether parents really do need to shield their babies from kisses/contact with other people. Specific questions: 1) Do new parents really need to worry about someone making their baby very sick by kissing it? 2) How common are occurrences like the ones in the news today? 3) What should parents allow/not allow in terms of people having contact with newborn babies?","Doctor":"Hi. I do not recommend kissing a new born baby. Firstly, a newborn baby's immune system is not fully developed and is prone for infections. Secondly contact with the baby can transmit many types of bacteria and viruses which can cause various infections. Hence hand washing before touching the baby, handling only by mother and a couple of caretakers is ideal. When a baby is kissed there can be transmission of various bacteria/germs which are normally present in the mouth of people.These generally do not cause any infection in healthy people who have a strong immune system. But these can cause infection in people who have low immunity and newborn baby is one among them. Kissing cannot cause meningitis per se but can transmit few bacteria which can first cause a mild respiratory infection which can spread to brain especially in low immunity people like newborns. Kissing can transmit viral infection like herpes simplex and infectious mononucleosis. Hence it is better to avoid kissing the baby especially by friends and relatives, etc. Even parents should avoid if possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a big scar in my right thigh that has led to a contracture with little flexure on my knew joint for over ten years.

From what I can see in the pictures is that you have got a massive tissue loss over your thigh and that too over such a long period that it has gone for severe contracture. Only the Z-plasty will definitely not give you enough results. As your doctor has suggested you will have to go for complete removal of the scar and fibrotic tissue with reconstruction by a large free flap. Before that, few investigations will be required which will give the idea about how much post op benefit u will be gaining.

That imbalance subsided in some time and then it occurred once in a week. If there is a little bit of anxious environment it will come back. Since then I had been to cardiologist, MD, psychologist, and ENT all of them brought it down to anxiety. I had done all blood tests, x-ray, and MRI of neck.

My symptoms are imbalance during sitting and walking (feeling best in moving vehicle), heavy head like a tight band at the back of head, restlessness and have started physiotherapy with some relief.

I have gone through all your records. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

Please avoid traction to the neck even if you are feeling better with physiotherapy since there is no evidence of any root compression in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).

I have taken treatment for depression before years. I am now happy and my studies are going on. My sister is studying 10th grade and she was also a black belt in karate. Now she is mentally disturbed and thinking about her self, not concentrating on her studies and she wants to stay alone. She is writing on papers, on the wall, or otherwise writing on notes like \\"Why I was born, I want to die\\". She is having this problem for the past six months. Please suggest solution to solve this problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I feel your sister is suffering from the same depression for which you got treated in the past. The possibility is very high as there was a similar problem in genetically related elder sister (I mean you) as the presence of family members with depression increases the risk of depression among other family members. I must acknowledge that you do not need to feel anything wrong as the genes are at fault and not the family. Depression as a diagnosis is based on the fact that your sister have poor academic performance at a time when we expect better performance (board exams). In addition, the social isolation and preference to stay alone indicate depression as people with depression lose interest in almost all activities especially the pleasurable ones. The presence of expressed wish to die is another thing which indicates the possibility of severe depression. In my opinion, it is urgent to seek help from a psychiatrist. You may argue that I am a psychiatrist and I must handle the case but the presence of suicidal ideas points toward need of urgent and personalized care and online help is not sufficient.

When I searched on the internet it says big diseases like esophageal cancer. The symptoms say difficulty in swallowing, coughing and things and now I feel like I am feeling all those symptoms.

The symptoms you have been experiencing such as difficulty in swallowing and burning pain warrant a more extensive study with barium studies (in which you swallow a material composed of barium and then you will be radiographed, the esophageal structural pathologies are going to be demonstrated by this way, such as strictures), and endoscopy (to have a more clear view of esophagus and stomach). Gastroesophageal reflux which is the backflow of acid into the esophagus is the most common reason and it can be treated easily with medications. Gastritis or H. Pylori infection needs to be treated with specific medications (UBT- urea breath test, is required to rule out H. Pylori infection). The results of the aforementioned test are required to make a definite diagnosis, however, esophageal cancers are extremely unlikely given the duration of your symptoms and your age. I can assure you in your age most common etiologies are esophageal spasm and strictures. Former can be treated with calcium channel blockers and antidepressants, and in case of strictures, endoscopic dilation can be done to relieve the pressure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I broke my nose in kindergarten, I am 26 right now and just now realized how my facial features are not symmetrical, how much does a broken nose affect that, as you can tell my right side of my face is more laid back and natural looking even my mustache above my lip, and my left side looks more tight and my mustache and lip does not match the right side. What causes this?","Doctor":"Hi. Definitely there is a whole lot of asymmetry as you suggested, because of the old broken nose. I can also see that the base of the nose is a bit too broad and gives a feeling of oddly joined fractured segments. This can be confirmed by few X-rays. Further correction if this is as well simple. We call it osteotomy and splitting. That will give you more symmetrical looking sleeker nasal dorsum. It's better if you can get yourself examined by a board certified plastic surgeon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past one month, I am facing a frontal tooth decay with receding gum. Sometimes, I have bleeding gums. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your query. As an endodontist, I would like to assure you there is no major issue with your gums and teeth. Just minor caries in upper left lateral incisor and bit of inflamed gums due to deposition of tartar and improper brushing techniques. First, try to brush in a proper technique that is in soft vertical strokes (from gums to teeth edge) and not a forceful horizontal motion. Improving these habits will solve your issue 30%. Rest you need scaling to remove the already accumulated tartar and also the issue of bleeding gums. Betadine mouthwash gargle in lukewarm water two to three times a day. You have a very minor caries, please do not call it a decay. It will need a small restoration and you are good to do. Gingivitis (gum bleeding and recession). Caries in upper left lateral incisor. Gingivitis and Irreversible pulpitis. Improve the brushing technique. Get a scaling. Avoid sticky or sweet or cold food items until then. Let me know if any further query.

For further doubts consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After sex with my partner, I am feeling pain in my penis and my testes are also too small. I am feeling weak after sex.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that your question have a lack of details and this will limit my response to generic one rather than specific applicable to your problem. The pain in penis after sex is indicative of infection if it occurs up to 24 hours or more. If the pain was immediately after sex most probably it was due to vigorous sex. In there former condition, you need to get blood investigations and urine examinations such as CBC (complete blood count), urine microscopy, urine culture, and sensitivity. If the later condition applies to you, a simple rest for a few days will resolve the condition on most occasions. Regarding smaller testes, I will suggest semen analysis. This will reveal the amount of sperm produced and thus the measure is testis capacity. Weakness after sex is non-specific and indicates your poor health. The CBC test advised above will assist us in this. I will request you to eat healthily and do regular exercise. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a clear wart looking things pop up on my genitals for a few years now, never many I just burn them off and all is fine. However, a few months ago, I had three darker color things popped up and I burned one off but it did not heal fully. It actually got bigger and redder and more painful. I have attached a picture. Can you tell me what I am dealing with here, please?","Doctor":"Hi.  I have seen the picture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  This does not seem to be herpes genitalis. In case of herpes, you would have got vesicles that would burst to leave erythematous erosions. These can be verruca plana variety of wart. The second one looks inflamed. Use antibacterial cream for it. Between I hope to burn them of means, getting them treated medically."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had an STD for 30 years but it occurs only on the surfaces for every four or five years and only under much stress. I was able to photograph it this time but still cannot see a doctor for a couple of days. I am afraid it will vanish again before I see a doctor. The bumps are in clusters of three on my shaft. It lasts for two or three days and then goes away.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the photo. (attachment removed to protct patient identity). It is herpes genitalis. Is it associated with itching or burning sensation? Does your partner suffer from a similar problem? How many episodes per year? If you have recurrent episodes you should consider oral antiviral medication. Standard treatment for herpes genitalis is Tablet Acyclovir 400 mg three times a day for seven days after meal, Rantac 150 mg before meal twice a day, Fusidic acid 2% cream twice a day can be applied. Partner treatment is a must. Avoid sexual contact. In case of recurrent episodes patient is given suppressive therapy for more than seven days with a low dose. You said you have STD for 30 years means, have you done STD profile before? If not you should get it done. In herpes genitalis vesicles appear on the genital area commonly on the glans or shaft of the penis which burst even without touching leaving small clean looking ulcers, which usually heal within seven days. It is associated sometimes with itching or burning sensation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,  I had some vocal fatigue for a while and I have been resting my voice for pretty much one month now. I was not so sure if I should start speaking again or not. I am a bit afraid if it is going to affect my singing voice. Either way the first time I consult an ENT they said I had hemorrhagic patches on my anterior one-third of both of the vocal cords. I have been drinking a lot of water and also I took some proton pump inhibitors. I also have a phonatory gap but I do not think that is the problem here really. Anyway, I was just wondering how much time do you think I still have to keep resting.","Doctor":"Hello. I assume that these videos are one month prior to today's condition. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I see some amount of inter arytenoid pachydermia (suggestive of acid reflux and associated changes in the posterior part of vocal apparatus) and anterior phonatory gap. Although I cannot see the anterior one-third of the vocal cords that clearly, I understand that your ENT has found that those portions had some hemorrhages. He was right in advising you voice rest and proton pump inhibitors. Ideally, a week of absolute voice rest is sufficient. Followed by voice restriction, vocal hygiene, antiallergic treatment, nasal sprays (based on nasal symptoms), increased hydration, etc. Now considering you have taken a month of voice rest, I think it is sufficient. But do you have any symptoms whatsoever now? Any nasal symptoms or allergic symptoms? Any history of substance abuse? Do you suffer from diabetes or hypertension? In my practice in addition to antireflux (PPI tablets), antiallergics (antihistaminics like Fexofenadine, Allegra, Deslor, etc), hydration, voice rest, dietary and lifestyle changes. I add some voice therapy. Probably you should explore some vocal hygiene tips from a speech-language pathologist or voice therapist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have some pain due to injury. Last week, I was at a construction site and marine plywood that is used for construction fell and hit me on the back of my head. My head is fine but my upper back is still in pain and chest also. I did not fall down when I was hit but the impact pushed my upper body down and forward I think beyond normal that is why I am getting back and chest pain. I did not go to the hospital because I do not feel the need. I am sure they will just tell me to give time and take pain killer. Can I get your advice? Is it possible I fractured my spine? What should I do? I am just taking Ibuprofen. Pain is not very bad I am still doing things normally and I can move. I am just wondering why I am still in pain after one week. Can this be a fracture? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems that you have suffered whiplash injuries. This is common following high energy impacts on the upper body. From the mechanism you described, it seems unlikely to sustain a fracture. However, it is very difficult to be certain without clinical examination and x-rays. How is your pain? Is it tender at any particular spot? Is the tenderness is on the midline of your spine or on the sides? Pain directly in the midline with a particular spot of tenderness is something I would recommend that you get an x-ray. The fact that you are otherwise moving and carrying on with life normally is reassuring. However, unfortunately, whiplash injuries can take many weeks to settle. With regard to the chest pain, it is possible that the injury might have caused a crack in your ribs. X-rays are not very good at showing this. The treatment, in any case, is rest and painkillers. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I try to help a mentally limited woman of 36 with ACS complaint from which the ECG is not clear. I have a photo of her ECG.

How will I manage it?","Doctor":"Hi. Your knee pain could be due to many reasons but common ones are chondromalacia, pain due to knee instability, inflammation due to an underlying pathology or just degenerative joint disease, etc. What was the cause of onset of pain in your knees and what has been the total duration of your symptoms? Apart from pain, do you also have any associated swelling, skin redness or any other local inflammation like skin warmth, etc as well? What management and investigations have been done until now by you for the existing problem? If there is no history of any injury, and no inflammation or infection like swelling, skin redness or local warmth on touching, then I will like to advise you for conservative management initially in form of: 1. Intensive physical therapy with a focus on strengthening of quadriceps and stretching of other groups of muscles. 2. Gentle anti-inflammatory medications like Etoshine or Paracetamol for five to seven days usually helps in such cases (take according to your body's suitability). 3. Adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation as per requirement. 4. Ice packs at home three to four times a day and see how it goes for around two weeks time. If your condition does not improve, then we will have to get certain investigations done."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 29 years old. I never had intercourse before.

My doctor prescribed Banocide and Ultracet tablets.","Doctor":"Hi. There could be many reasons for the problems you are stating. So to know exactly what is the cause of pain many more questions need to be asked. I would like to know exactly where on the left side does the pain occurs? Is it below the ribs or lower than that? Do you have any change in taste or acidity? Does the pain also go to the back? What is the color of your urine? Any other problems like loose motion or vomit? Do you have a fever? These questions will help me come near to the diagnosis and then with relevant tests, we could come to a confirmed diagnosis. As far as the medication that are prescribed to you I would like to say that both of them are strong pain killer which are given for problems like kidney stones, but they will not cure the problem. So the diagnosis is a must to find out what is the problem with you in order to give you the correct drugs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have trouble concentrating.

There are several different possible reasons that can cause these symptoms. For example, if these symptoms were present since childhood we may need to consider ADD/ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).

Now I can make severe eczematization, so I would advise you not to apply any such thing if you have applied in the past. Start applying Mometasone plus, Sertaconazole 2% twice daily over the affected area for seven days, then stop Mometasone and continue Sertaconazole.

I received your neck MRI images and saw it now. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  There is a loss of cervical lordosis (straightening of your cervical spine). There is squaring of the vertebral bodies. Signal changes in the bodies suggestive of marrow edema more at levels C6, C5, C6 and C7. The discs are hyperintense on both T1 and T2 suggestive of calcification. Early syndesmophyte formation at C4-C5 levels. The height of the disc spaces are maintained. There is no disc herniation. There is no cord or root compression. Well, this was the scientific description of the set of images you have sent me. The message for you is stated below. The good news is that there is no disc herniation or buldge and pressure on the cord. But there are changes suggestive of the inflammatory changes in the spine at multiple levels and that is the reason for your pain in the neck. Regarding inflammation, my first impression would be an autoimmune disorder called ankylosing spondylitis. We need to do several lab tests to catch the diagnosis, the most important being HLA B27 assay, the others would include the ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), RA factor (rheumatoid factor) and anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies. The results of these tests would find the cause of the inflammation. Regarding treatment, the primary (or first-line) treatment of all the inflammatory disorder is common NSAIDS like Ibuprofen thrice daily after food. Along with this, you should take Pantoprazole 40 mg one tablet before 20 minutes of your breakfast. (If Ibuprofen causes uncontrollable heartburn, you can go for other options in NSAID group). Going through the tests is required to establish the cause of inflammation. In case the NSAIDs does not work, further treatment depends on the cause. Also, the ESR and CRP levels help in monitoring the response to the treatment with NSAIDs. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know the substitute for Melacare cream, as I got the look after using the cream and want to stop it.","Doctor":"Hi.

No, there is no need for inspection. You can go for pregnancy tests with home testing kits. This change in periods (duration and flow) is normal for her as she is active sexually and there are emotional and hormonal changes that cause all of this.

She is unable to move her left arm for the past three days and also has shoulder pain, especially when not sitting. There was no injury to the arm. And the trouble moving her arms is such that she cannot even braid her hair. Does this indicate heart disease? Can a finger pulse oximeter reading of the affected arm be of any relevance in ruling out a cardiac issue? What about ECG reading? Please reply.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to ilciniq.com. Please attach the ECG report, it is not attached. Please clarify, whether the pain is prominent feature or inability to move the arm, or is it like that she is not able to move arm because of pain or fear of pain. Now, this is not indicative of heart disease. Left arm pain without chest pain is unlikely to be related to the heart. Also, there would not be any difficulty in moving the arm with a heart attack. So it is unlikely to be related to the heart. The possibilities are, one is cervical and second is shoulder problems like frozen shoulder, or arm dislocation, even if there is no history of obvious trauma (frozen shoulder is more lifely). So she will need, 1. ECG (electrocardiography) to be sure. 2. X-ray of shoulder AP/lateral view and maybe cervical spine if having symptoms. Next, the pulse oximeter will not helpful in ruling out heart disease. However, if she has severe shortness of breath and low oxygen reading then this may indicate heart failure, so indirectly we may infer. However, if the pain is mild and weakness is prominent then it is probably either cervical issue or neurological issue. So get her examined by local doctor and x-ray done. You may use Volini spray or Diclofenac spray. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I would like to consult regarding my situation, my blood pressure is normal but everytime I go to clinic or hospital I feel nervous so my blood pressure becomes high.

I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. I would like to know some more details about your present problem. How many times have you checked your blood pressure in clinic and what was the range of BP? I mean how much it rises? Do you have any cardiac symtoms like chest pain, breathing difficulty on exertion or walking, palpitations, fatigue, giddiness? Family history of hypertension? I would suggest you to get a digital BP apparatus at home and monitor your BP at home. If it is high at home also then you may definitely have hypertension and will have to be treated. Decision to work in COVID 19 pandemic depends on the place you stay, the number of cases you have around, the safety environment of your office and so on. But definitely has to be very careful and follow all safety measures. Kindly get back with above details for further discussion and management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old male. I played soccer throughout my teens competitively. Five years ago, I injured the muscle in my thigh, what I presume was a tear of which I sat out from sports for a week or two, however, was rushed back into playing by my mother who thought I was faking the injury. I injured the muscle again, and these proceeded to happen again once more, leading me to quit sports and focus on going to studies the following year. Currently now, whenever I stretch my thigh muscle by pulling my leg up behind me, I get a slight uncomfortable feel in my thigh muscle which I know is not normal, however, it is not painful enough to tell me to stop doing it. Furthermore, I have been in the gym and jogging where my muscle seems to be fine, but when I decide to sprint there is a 50 percent chance that I will get into discomfort again. However, it does not feel like a tear, but it will become numb for a few days and finally, if I go to kick a ball it is almost certain that the same result from sprinting will happen. I have recently started to stretch the muscle to try and see if I can regain its strength to allow me to do these few things again without worrying about hurting my muscles again. I am not sure what other things I can do to help this, such as different types of stretches, etc?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. In my opinion, you had a tear of your quadriceps muscle which has not healed properly and got reinjured again within less time. So there is a possibility that a scar formed on the tear area of the muscle leading to stiffness and numbness is due to any neural stiffness around the scar area. Possibly there will be nerve entrapment. Do not worry. All you have to do is: 1. Get a deep friction massage to relieve the tension in the muscle. 2. Slowly release the scar by massaging the scar frequently. 3. Gently stretch the muscle and hold it. 4. Keep icing that area frequently. Before attempting any running or any strenuous activity, I advise you to properly activate and then strengthen that muscle. Progressively increase the load on the muscle. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I hit my head twice this week and wondering if I should see a doctor. I am a 29-year-old female. The first hit was four days ago on the top right of my head when standing up underneath something metal. It was a pretty hard hit. It hurt on and off for a day, just the spot itself on my scalp. I did not have a headache or nausea, or any other symptoms. Today I leaned forward quickly and bashed the front top of my head onto a wooden dresser. It hurt pretty badly and I felt my teeth chatter. I do not have a headache now other than the spot itself hurting. I am not nauseous, nor do I have any other symptoms of concussion. I have read that if you hit your head twice, two concussions within days, you should go to a doctor, but I am not even sure these are concussions. I am not sure when a simple bump actually is a concussion, or really how to tell. Do you have any advice?","Doctor":"Hi. I have carefully and thoroughly reviewed all the details related to your case and feel sorry for the health issues you have. There is no major harm to the brain when hitting like this even twice in quick succession. Your concerns are notable but that worrisome situation is when someone gets an impact harder enough to cause some signs of real concussion like nausea, vomiting, getting unconscious, severe headache, vertigo, etc. You did not have that large impact in both cases and there is no need to go for immediate medical care. You need to handle it at home. Take Ibuprofen for pain and apply local painkiller and anesthetic ointment on the scalp if needed. These are available over the counter at any pharmacy. Apply heat to the site of impact and take care of yourself.

She is having a small rim of pneumothoraces bilaterally with subcutaneous disease and mediastinal emphysema. I am attaching here her medical test reports for review by a specialist who can suggest a treatment to manage this condition.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through all CT scan reports and images. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like this is a long-standing problem and it is progressing as well. But, unfortunately, there is no mention of the chief complaints of the patient and no previous treatment details are available. Before we plan any treatment, it is very important to review previous medicines and see if there was an improvement or not. As per CT scan, it looks like to be NSIP (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia), a chronic type of interstitial lung disease. Also, it is complicating as leakage of air surrounding the lungs and heart. It is very important to see what is the oxygenation status of the patient and other comorbidities. The treatment of NSIP mainly consists of steroids as per the weight. If oxygen saturation is not maintained above 92% on room air, oxygen supplementation either by cylinder, concentrator or NIV (non-invasive ventilation) must be considered. So it is advisable to see a specialist pulmonologist near to you and take medicines and other required treatment under his observation as it has to be reviewed frequently according to the condition of the patient. If the patient is suffering from any other comorbid autoimmune disease, it should be treated simultaneously. Then only the lung pathology will be under control. I hope I have elaborated the treatment plan in detail for you. Autoimmune ILD (interstitial lung disease). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. NSIP (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia). Steroids like tablet Medrol (Methylprednisolone) as per the weight of the patient. Supportive treatment as required. Oxygen supplementation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old.

I was on Desvenlafaxine 50 mg ER tablet prescribed by GP. I took it for around eight months and felt better. Then I consulted my psychiatrist and told that I have only anxiety. So, he prescribed Clonazepam 1 mg and Alprazolam 0.5 mg in the morning and Nitrazepam 10 mg and Clonazepam 1 mg in the night and stopped Desvenlafaxine 50 mg ER tablet. I slowly tapered from first month itself to finally in around one year; I was on 0.25 mg Clonazepam in the morning and 2.5 mg Nitrazepam in the night, which I felt has same effect as I started. Later, I tried to come out of it without any medication, but I was feeling anxious. Actually, I felt better with Desvenlafaxine 50 mg ER tablet, compared to other anti-anxiety medicines. So, I asked my psychiatrist and he said start taking Desvenlafaxine 50 mg ER tablet. But, I do not have the same effect as I felt earlier. Now, it is almost seven weeks. I am taking 2.5 mg Nitrazepam in the night and occasionally, Clonazepam 0.5 mg or Alprazolam 0.25 mg or 0.50 mg when I feel more anxious. So, I want to be only on Desvenlafaxine 50 mg ER tablet as earlier. Should I wait for some more time? Or should I increase dose to 75 mg or 100 mg? I really appreciate your help. By the way, I feel more anxious only at traffic signal or sometimes waiting in line at grocery store or sometime anticipatory fear in going far from my home. Thank you very much for your help.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Desvenlafaxine is a good antidepressant and anti-anxiety drug. The drug should be continued for long time to see its full effects. Drugs like Benzodiazepines (Clonazepam, Alprazolam or Nitrazepam) can help to control anxiety symptoms immediately, but these drugs are not the definite treatment of anxiety. High risk of tolerance and increased abuse potential are the main reasons that these drugs should not be taken regularly for more than four weeks. It is good that you have started taking Desvenlafaxine again and the drug will help you to come out of the symptoms. Currently, you are on 50 mg dose and in my opinion the dose should be increased to 100 mg per day to see more effects and to get better control of symptoms. So, you can increase the dose of the drug without worries. Keep other drugs like Clonazepam and Alprazolam for use on SOS basis only (as and when necessary). You continue Nitrazepam for some days and then gradually reduce the dose and stop the drug completely. Wait for at least four more weeks to see the effect.

Well you it is not uncommon to have fart and burping. Since these are the normal.process of body of emitting gases which are produced in the small bowel. However, excessive gases are produced in someone who have problem with two things. 1. carbohydrate maldigestion. The corbohydtates are the major compotent of our diet approx. 70% of diet we take it is corbohydrates. This corbohydrates are fermented by small bowel.bacteria and produces excessive gases..one such example is milk and wheat grains and barley rye etc. You have to cut them to half before excessive production of gases can be prevented. At least you should try avoiding milk and milk based dairy production such as coffee, tea, icecream, and sweets. You can learn more about the foods who are carbohydrated and who freqeuntly cause excessive gas production on the internet. 2. Dysbiosis. Excessive of gas producing bacteria and lack of lactobacillus which help digest corbohydrats. This altered composition of bacteria is due to many factors namely oast use of antibiotic use, enviormental influence, sorts of diet one take and water one take. The one way is to treat this dysbiosis with a 10 day antibiotic course -Tab Rifaximin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. Followed by use of probiotic which are healthy bacteria reguraly for 6 months at least. With the above explanation and advise you would be in good position to treat your condition.. Lastly only food modification can improve your symptoms by 50%. So I suggest you to start with that. There are formal testing for Dysbiosis by giving stool sample for microbiota spectrum analysis.

BP and tiredness has disappeared. There is no other complication like fever, stomach pain, etc., except bleeding. She needs to feed one month baby as well. Also note that there is no sex done post-delivery. Please help us. I am attaching her CBC, PT, INR/PTT reports for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. Your wife is having bleeding per vagina following one month of Cesarean section. This is termed postpartum hemorrhage and often creates an emergency. This could be caused by an infection of C-section wound commonly. But, as per your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) she is having some form of blood clotting disorders raised prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR). Now, definitely she needs hospitalization. She might have another bout of bleeding and in that case, you will not be able to control the situation. Pause MF (combination of Tranexamic acid and Mefenamic acid) and Methergine (Methylergometrine) can subside the bleeding temporarily. But, she needs intravenous antibiotics and may need clotting factor transfusion (fresh frozen plasma) as well as blood transfusion. As her hemoglobin is 10.8, it is substantially low to combat another episode of massive bleeding. I know the baby will be deprived, but do not take the breastfeeding as a priority in contrast to your wife's impending danger, if any. Blood coagulation disorder. 1. Routine blood, liver function tests (LFT), urea, creatinine, platelet count, bleeding time (BT), clotting time (CT) prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin (APTT). 2. USG (ultrasonography) whole abdomen. Postpartum hemorrhage. Admission along with IV antibiotic as well as FFP transfusion and blood reserve required.

Masturbation is a healthy way of satisfying your sexual desires and you can masturbate weekly twice or thrice. Anything in excess is not good. It will not affect your sex life or general health. By watching porn continuously and masturbating daily is common in your age. It will not cause any serious damage except early ejaculation. That is because you have trained yourself and your penis to ejaculate early. Lot of constructive time was wasted in this. You can divert your mind by concentrating in your studies or professional career. Also, learn yoga and meditation which will help your back ache and assist you to concentrate on useful activities.

Try finding any other cause of taste loss like consumption of any drug like Metronidazole. If you are sure that no other cause explains it then I will suggest to get NCV (nerve conduction velocity), EMG (electromyography) test because it can pick up delay in nerve conduction earlier than the symptoms. Results are available by the same evening. Bell's palsy prophylaxis is not recommended anywhere. However, if I imagine myself in your position I would start the medication by the time all these investigations are done. You can also get a detailed neurological examination. Many a time clinical signs can be seen when a patient cannot appreciate symptoms.

Breast implant illness is a term associated with symptoms of health concerns in women having breast implant surgery done. It includes a wide spectrum of physical symptoms and commonly involves fatigue, chest pain, headaches, anxiety, vision problems, nerve, and hormone problems. This is not officially a confirmed medical term in use and is a more general expression of symptoms. However, one should not ignore if there is a likely possibility of implant rupture.

Now i want to ask can ear drops cure inner infection too if i keep taking my drops.

In such a situation plain ear drops will not treat the infection completely. You will require oral antibiotics to completely treat the infection failing which the ear discharge will keep recurring again. I recommend you to start the following treatment Make sure you keep you ear dry and don't let any water to enter. Place a sterile cotton in the ear entrance of the ear canal and change the cotton every 6 hrs. Make sure you don't clean the ear using ear buds or any foreign object as it can introduce infection into the ear. I hope I have answered your query.

It was moderate and I took the same antibiotics they prescribed. I did not have any symptoms but I treated it anyway. Then, earlier this month, I had catarrh which I also treated with an antibiotic. Now, I am four days late from seeing my period. I am very scared, I do not think I am pregnant because I check with a strip two days ago and it tested negative.

Vaginal infection should be taken care of, but these infections are not uncommon in sexually active females. So do not worry. If there are no symptoms, taking antibiotics every time may not be the right thing to do. Just maintain hygiene. Staphylococcus infection is also not an uncommon vaginal infection, sometimes even contamination from the surrounding areas while taking swab may show such a picture. Period delay due to this seems unlikely. Wait another week and recheck in the urine. If still negative, see a gynecologist who can examine you and find out the reason for it.

Since the MGUS, I followed up with hematologist three times and he said my numbers are so low they do not show up on M spike. All other labs were normal. I saw a dermatologist to see if burning was skin related. She said no maybe vascular so I saw a cardiovascular doctor who is also running tests. I also saw a rheumatologist so does not believe it is rheumatology based on blood work.

I have seen your hand pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). To be frank, it is really a tough case.  There can be a few things that can be looked for: 1. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder. 2. Rarely, MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undefined significance) can be associated with neuropathy. 3. It can be Raynaud's phenomenon. 4. ? Any heavy metal related. I have a few suggestions which you can ask your neurologists or hematologists if they have thought about them. Did anyone think of getting a nerve conduction study? Later on, can a nerve biopsy give an answer if we are thinking CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy)? Sometimes, can any heavy metal can cause this kind of symptoms. Lab work for Raynaud's phenomenon if your symptoms fit into that criteria, looks less likely though. Any remote chance of amyloidosis. There is a test for that as well known as fat pad biopsy.Please ask the doctors to consider these points. To your question, MGUS has been shown to have an association with neuropathy related pain, though less likely. I am here always if you need further guidance.

I had my daughter a little over two months ago and started my birth control last month (I was still having on and off bleeding but it stopped about a week or so after taking my birth control). I started my period on the 3rd of this month and it stopped completely yesterday until I had sex last night. When I went to the bathroom after the fact I was bleeding as if I were on my period and my vagina hurt and burned a little (not when I urinate, just in general). Is this normal? Am I still on period? Next is my birth control. As I stated in the first question I started my birth control last month. Well, I still have one more pill to take out of it and I had unprotected sex last night. I take it at 7 PM every day. Never missed one but we are late taking a couple especially yesterday. I was late by an hour taking the pill. Am I able to get pregnant immediately due to the fact it is still my first month on it and I only have one pill out of the pack?","Doctor":"Hi. What I could gather from the information you gave was that you are on birth control since last month. What I would want to know is what was the mode of your delivery, vaginal or operative? It has a bearing on the answer. Also what kind of pills are you on? Are they continuous pills without a break or like three weeks on one week off pills. Were you still taking pills when you had your periods on the 3rd? If it was a vaginal delivery, sudden bleeding could be due to vaginal laceration. If the bleeding was while on pills, it could be a breakthrough bleeding. If only one pill is left and you have been taking it for more than two weeks regularly, pregnancy seems unlikely. Being late for pill by one hour does not decrease its efficacy. If you are breastfeeding your child, chances of pregnancy are even lesser. I would suggest you to see your doctor and understand clearly how and when to take pills to avoid such problems in the future.

My back pains occasionally and I think it is the nerve which is hurting, because the pain is like a sting. Currently I am taking rest and doctor said that he will check if  physiotherapy can be started after a couple of weeks. I am afraid of the pain especially when it is near the neck or shoulders. I am able to walk and work. I am being treated by a spine specialist. Please let me know if I have to go to another doctor like a neurosurgeon and can I lead a normal life in future.","Doctor":"Hi. I am not sure of your neck symptoms as the neck has nothing to do with your lower back and from your description it is not clear if you have any leg symptoms or bladder symptoms. However I need to see your MRI scan to be able to make a judgment on the further management.

The associated central bronchi are impacted. Without an obvious mass, although a small central lesion is not excluded. The impression at the end said a focus of bronchitis and bronchiolitis with airway impaction has developed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe. An infectious etiology is suspected, but a small endobronchial lesion could be obstructing, this is not a typical site for aspiration. Follow-up is recommended to confirm resolution. I am of course concerned about lung cancer, but my pulmonologist said this mass looks like pneumonia, but the airway leading to pneumonia cannot be seen well. That is where the bronchoscopy comes in, as the airway cannot be completely visualized on a CT scan. If there were to be any abnormality in the airway, it would be more along the spectrum of a benign growth than lung cancer. Does this make sense? Do you agree?","Doctor":"Hello.

Three days into the trip, I started getting chills accompanied by diarrhea once or twice a day, usually in the morning. I took Imodium each day and continued doing activities. Three days after diarrhea, I got a scratchy throat. The next day, I got a stuffy nose as well. The day after that, I flew home. My throat felt less scratchy, but my glands swelled up and it was painful to swallow. I still had diarrhea that morning. The next day (yesterday) I got a fever of 100.8, chills, fatigue, and coughs. I had a stuffy and runny nose throughout the day, and the left side of my nose got congested that there was painful pressure in my sinus. On the bright side, there was no diarrhea yesterday and the swelling in my glands went down. But last night diarrhea came back and then happened again this morning. It is now been a week since diarrhea first started. I still feel feverish and I am still very congested. Should I be concerned? I am currently taking Ibuprofen, Sudafed and Mucinex.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post, you have mentioned the duration of illness as one week which makes it an acute illness. The characteristic features of your illness are loose motion, fever, congestion in nose and sore throat. All these are features of acute viral infection, because of loose motion the possibility of influenza are high.  Viral infections of this kind are self-limiting and settles in one to two weeks. I would suggest to stop Ibuprofen as it causes rashes and platelet dysfunction in viral infection. You can take Paracetamol 650 mg eight hourly. Last but not least, take plenty of fluids and go for CBC (complete blood count) to see whether there is any decrease or increase in cell count."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please help me to understand my STD results.

There was no pain but it was accidentally observed in the ultrasound. We waited for three years, but then, later on, one of my friend’s mother developed gall bladder cancer which was fatal. This incident prompted us to take a second opinion. And this time, the doctor also suggested that gall bladder should be removed because the stones might create problems in pancreas. Therefore we had her operated and the gallbladder was surgically removed. After the operation, biopsy of the gallbladder was also done. (All the relevant reports are attached the pre-operative medical tests are also there. In one of the reports in history, it is written that patient gives a history of pain in abdomen, complaints of acid peptic dyspepsia. She had no pain in the abdomen and no problem of gas or indigestion before the operation). After the operation, she had pain in the operation area which was healed later on. She has had typhoid thrice and TB once when she was young. She had chikungunya type fever last year which was negative for chikungunya tests, but the doctor said it might have been chikungunya and the tests might not have been done in the right time period that is why they came negative. She also takes medicines for blood pressure, knee and joint pain (calcium), cataract, homeopathic medicine for nose polyp infection. Here are my questions: The biopsy report says the impression of chronic non-specific cholecystitis, should we worry about it? Is chronic non-specific cholecystitis cancerous? My mother faced gas problems after the operation which became normal after a week or so and rarely she has that (like recently she had some dal paratha which was oily and caused the gas). Is this normal? Would she be frequently having gas incidents since her gall bladder is removed? We never did a biopsy of the gall bladder stones, should that also be done?","Doctor":"Hi. Having gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) I just need to reassure you that the surgery was done by a world class surgeon. Reply to your queries: No need to worry about non-specific cholecystitis. It is not a cancerous lesion. If she avoids fried and fermented meals then there will be no issues of gas. Stones are analyzed not biposed but it is fine if that was not done. Type can be interpreted from the gross appearance but anyways it does not affect management. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a very painful skin condition on the sides of my thumbs and forefingers. It started months ago and is steadily getting worse and spreading to other fingers. I also have it on one of my toes. The nails have gone very thick and have a chalky formation under the nail. This is not painful but I have lots of tiny water-filled pockets under the skin that eventually crack and bleed. I have to wear plasters on my fingers to stop the infection as the skin is constantly splitting and bleeding. My doctor has prescribed me four creams over the last four months. They are Betnovate, Dermovate, Lotriderm, and Fucibet, but none have worked. I am very aware that these creams need to be used very sparingly but my skin seems very thin so I have stopped using the last cream he prescribed (Fucibet) as I am worried that it may give me lasting damage. Like all of us with medical problems, I have been online and I am pretty sure that I have discoid eczema. I have been waiting for a dermatologist appointment for two months, I cannot wait any longer. What do you think and what treatment, if any, can I get?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Yes, this is eczema only and you are using the correct cream, but the problem is that it is a very resistant condition, so it takes time to get resolved. You should avoid touching soap, detergent, chemical cement, or any other chemicals. You have to take oral steroids also to get faster relief. Also, use good moisturizer frequently. Can apply Fucibet (Fusidic acid and Betamethasone) cream and put some cover over the finger to allow the cream goes deeper. Also, use moisturizer at least three to four times a day, if you feel itching then you should take Levocetirizine 10 mg."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick. Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would agree with your Doctor on the fact that all your symptoms are suggestive of anxiety. The fact that your symptoms are relieved by lying down, alcohol or physical activity is another argument in favour of anxiety. Anyways, before coming to this conclusion, I would recommend checking vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency and blood pressure for possible imbalances. It is also necessary performing a cervical spine X-ray study, in order to exclude any possible bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column, which could lead to burning sensation in the neck and shoulders. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements, to help relieve the muscle spasm."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I had periods on 26th and had protected sex on the 4th of the following month. After that, I took an i-pill within 2 hours. Now, I am bleeding like my periods ie after 8 days of i-pill. Is this my period? If not, can I expect my periods on the coming 26th?","Doctor":"Hi. It is a withdrawal bleeding after i-pill. As you are bleeding now, your menses going to be irregular mostly. Now your period is going to delay mostly and very little chance that it comes on time. I-pill is a hormonal pill so it can disturb your normal cycle. Withdrawal bleeding can be very small and also can be like normal menses. so do not worry. Please wait for your menses. But keeping in mind that i-pill can not be 100% effective, do a urine pregnancy test after 26th, once or twice. In your case, there is almost no chance of pregnancy because you had protected sex. So do not worry. But, yes periods can be irregular for two to three cycles. So, watch for it. Drink more water. Hopefully, you got your answer. If you still have more query, then you can ask in follow up."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 35-year-old male. I have been to several doctors (neurologist) and I have not been told what is wrong and what I can do to fix it? My symptoms are: for the last ten months, when I go to sleep I wake up with one or both of my arms being numb from my elbow down to my pinky and ring finger. So I know there is something up with my ulnar nerve. This happens when I am asleep on my back, which is why I got an MRI of my neck to see if it was happening from there. When I saw the spine specialist he said my MRI was normal for my age. This is what the MRI report showed. C5-C6 = 2 mm disc protrusion, mild effacement of thecal sac, AP canal diameter 9.5 mm. C6-C7 = 2 mm disc osteophyte complex, moderate effacement, AP canal 9.5mm. C7-T1 = 2mm disc protrusion, AP diameter 11.5 mm. He looked at the images and said nothing would be happening to the nerve from the neck. Also, I saw a neurologist and they did an EMG, nerve conduction study, EEG, and MRI of the brain. They said everything was normal. Everything I have found online points to ulnar neuropathy or cubital tunnel syndrome. I just have not had any doctor confirm what is going on and I do not know anybody personally that has experienced this issue. It is disrupting my sleep causing me to wake up multiple times each night. My questions are, what can I do to fix this physical therapy, surgery, etc.? Are there long term effects for having this?","Doctor":"Hello. Sorry about your present health condition. Usually during sleeping on supine position or sleeping on sitting position with hands side by side may can cause some compression of ulnar nerve lead to temporary signal interference call neuropraxia which is common in all individuals, but more in obese people, or hypothyroidism, or diabetic, or B12 deficiency, or hypocalcemia, or anemia, or hypokalemia conditions. So prevent medial rotation of arm while sleeping. Get it done serum calcium and electrolytes. Als,o get done your blood sugar and thyroid status. Use vitamin B12 and Folic acid tablets. Tablet Pregabalin 75 mg is useful at night time. If no improvement, please review with the above investigations. Avoid smoking and alcohol consumption because it aggravates the condition. Rest your arms on pillows by the side."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 54 years old. I have been diabetic for long years and under insulin. I also suffer from diabetic retinopathy for two years.

Better thanks to physiotherapy, I returned as before. Except in the legs the pelvis and purse, erection problem and the rest constipated. For 100 meters of walking, I am exhausted and tired.

I went through your post, you seem to have diabetic neuropathy which is the cause of your erectile dysfunction and easy fatiguability. In addition, there are features of osteoarthritis. Instead of Paracetamol 325 I would suggest sustained-release form like XT Para 1g half tablet twice daily, and neurotropic medicines like a combination of Methylcobalamine with Pregabalin which will improve neuropathic symptoms. Good control of your blood sugar is important to decrease or slow the progression of diabetic complications. Evaluation of cardiac status is important as it may cause easy exhaustion. The x-ray does not show any gross abnormality."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been suffering from dry eyes for four years. I have seen many eye doctors, but no cause has been found. A while ago, I started noticing my eye-lids looking weird. I also discovered I had Demodex mites on my face, but none were found on my eyelashes. However, I made some photos of my eye-lids and found the base of my eye-lashes looked white. My question is, could this, after all, be the sign of Demodex mites? During these four years of dry eyes, I get occasional left eye pains. The problem is exacerbated by computer use, reading, being outdoors. My eyes are not red, no blurred vision, no excess tearing. Warm compresses, eyelid massages, eyelid hygiene, and diet changes did not help. Around a year ago, eye-lid problems started. My eyelashes do not fall out easily, though.","Doctor":"Hi. We do have natural microbe or flora on our face and eyelashes but Demodex mite cannot be, it is a foreign microbe that needs to be treated. I can see the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and there is redness beneath the eye and also white at the base of the eyelash. There are many reasons for it, firstly, are you having psoriasis which itself can be flared up and needs treatment by a skin specialist. This also has an effect on eyes causing dryness and burning. Secondly, as you are saying dandruff that you have to check. Do you observe it at your hairs, shoulders, and eyebrows? That also has to be treated by antidandruff shampoo again call for a skin specialist. Thirdly, blepharitis because it also causes similar symptoms apart from the face. Do you have any other symptoms like thirsty mouth, itching in any part of the body, or rashes? Well, I would suggest you to get it checked once with a skin specialist also because it is now a chronic condition. I will write medications for you. Eye ointment Dexamethasone over the eyelashes at night and day for 15 days. Eye drop Systane ultra (Polyethylene glycol) four to five times a day for 15 days. Eye ointment Neosporin at the face just down to eyes where rash is there. Genteal gel at night and day inside the eye. Use any anti-dandruff shampoo. use anti mite shampoo for hairs. Lid scrub by scrubbing it with buds dipped in one part of shampoo and two parts of water. This should be continued for 15 days. Please consult a skin specialist. It is important since you are so much in pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 49-year-old male. I took Prevacid for 17 years. One or two pills a day. I stopped five months ago after I read about that it increases the risk of dementia. If I do not have dementia now, and I have stopped the medication do my risks of dementia remain elevated for the rest of my life? Is the effect reversible? Does stopping the medication mean I am no longer at higher risk for dementia? Is the damage already done even if it is not noticeable at present? I asked my GP, and she said nobody knows. That even if I took an extensive test from a neuropsychologist, it would only mean I do not have dementia today, but it does not mean that my past Prevacid use would not cause dementia in the future. That leaves a life of uncertainty ahead. Is that the answer we just do not know? I wanted to ask a neurologist before I accept that answer.","Doctor":"Hello. After careful review, I understand you are worried about the side effects of Lansoprazole (Prevacid). Now as you have stopped taking it, the risk of side effects do not remain the same as with taking the drug. The reversibility of effects is based on the extent and the nature of damages done by any drug. For example, if a drug causes scarring (fibrosis) of the liver tissues, it usually does not come back and is an irreversible side effect. Dementia does not come so early and usually decades are needed for its development and not every patient on Lansoprazole ends up with dementia. To give you good news, the link between dementia and Lanoprazole is not certain. It is still under research and is not an established fact as of today. Also, we have to see that Lansoprazole prevents the patient from serious bleeding and ulcers of the stomach. So it outweighs the risks of dementia if any. For better understanding, you have the option to consult a neurologist. He will be able to articulate this fact in a better way based on your clinical evaluation. Yes, your GP is right in saying that. But based on the facts in pharmacological post-marketing research, there are the least chances, if any of dementia.

I am the biggest trouble maker of mine. I am stupid and foolish. I have grown up in the environment of too much care, fear and adopted fear in my nature. I have too much hesitation and assertiveness. My communication is very poor and cannot express in a polite manner giving an impression like an arrogant. What I feel inside is good but cannot express as easily because I feel ego. My biggest problem is fear. I shout loudly in sleep sometimes. I always feel I do not know anything and others feel bad about me and I will be shameless. I used to depend the most on parents and I used to do what they say. My life decisions also I cannot take myself and did what they said. I came to a city for pursuing a degree. I felt inferior by looking at the environment. I used to stay in a small room and I did not even know any languages properly, not even my mother tongue because that slang was not that good. I tried and could not complete the course, wasted that fee also. When I got backlogged for exam fee and attendance shortage, I had to keep my dad's watch in pawn brokers shop. Later my dad came to know and screwed up like anything. I did not like all these by hurting my parents and cheating them. 10 years got wasted. I did fraud things like this. After that long gap, I was in big trouble and my mind became blank. Do not know what to do. I feel shame about myself. I started social media chatting to overcome my emotions and got addicted. I wanted to get easy money so I got attracted by the lottery but never got anything. I tried online easy money sites also. I got a small job in a hospital for 6500/- per month, that also closed after two years. I searched for some other jobs, I got offered for small pay and my dad suggested doing a business with the help of one of my uncles. I deposited some amount to start the business in our town itself. We completed the project on time and submitted, but he did not pay and said the client cheated. I started searching for other projects, but all looked like fake or some other risky things. Depression got doubled. Then I joined RK Math and did a personality development course and attend some classes. As per my brother's suggestion, I learned SAP and did certification, could clear it successfully. I studied B. Sc in correspondence due to the long gap in education. I did not get a job in any good MNC. So I had to join some small company without pay. After eight months, they sent me for a project on TATA steel. I struggled a lot to adopt with Hindi, atmosphere and work environment also. It took almost six months to get adopted in those circumstances. I worked there for around two years. I had to leave this job because of less pay and homesickness. I applied for many companies and placed in a small company. I felt a bit relaxed. I did well in the interview. I proud this moment, because I got it with my own efforts. Good MNC's is not accepting me for the gap in education. I feel every time work pressure and insecurity of losing the job. My parents are very much worried about me. I am no more can avoid this worry from them. Whatever, I do not want to give them any worries and let them enjoy and live peacefully.

I need discipline, good daily routine, good attitude, enjoy the work and the way of life. I should behave politely and confidently. Enjoy work and challenges I am facing. I want to lead happy life with peace and enjoy all challenges and grow in life honestly.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. First of all, stop blaming yourself for anything. You are not your biggest enemy and you are not a trouble maker. Your anger is getting directed to yourself only and this has resulted in depression. Repeated failures (whatever be the reason) resulted in a state of helplessness and you lost your confidence. Due to shifting from a small town to city and then language issues all resulted in poor performance in studies and which ultimately costed failure in engineering. After that, you could not finish your studies and then got deceived in business and ultimately this also failed. All these setbacks resulted in learned helplessness. Your anger is towards yourself and this is the main reason for your depression. First of all, keep one thing in mind that never leave a job unless you are sure that you will be getting a good offer. Since there is a study gap so you will have to try hard in order to get a good offer. Continue to do your work sincerely and you will definitely get success. Suicidal ideation, low mood, poor confidence, etc, all resulted in severe depression.

I have lost more than 25 lbs in the last eight weeks which has triggered the doctors to look closer into this. I have elevated anxiety, shaky and unsteady, high pulse rates especially in the morning 100 - 115 beats per minute, and fatigue. I am currently taking Xanax. I have attached a couple of blood tests that I have on hand. Please let me know your thoughts.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and saw the results which you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and it appears to be an absolutely normal thyroid function test results. As your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is within the normal range, your thyroid function is normal. The slightly high T4 is not responsible for your symptoms since it is just a variable component, so as long as your TSH is normal your thyroid function is normal. Although you have impaired blood sugar levels, since HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is normal therefore just diet control will help. Take low carbohydrate and low-fat diet with daily 30 minutes of walk. You could benefit from a prior ECG (electrocardiogram). I would suggest taking tablet Bisoprolol 2.5 mg once daily for your tachycardia and anxiety. It will decrease your heart rate to normal levels and help you with your anxiety as well. Try also to do yoga and meditation daily.

I have always been a hypochondriac and ultra-sensitive to any irregular heartbeats or heart-related issues. I grew up around a family who always helped each other out and was cared for by my grandmother (mom and dad always worked). The older family members have all since passed away but I think growing up with them and my job has done me more harm than good. I now constantly question every single thing I feel going on with my body. I am 5'6\\" and weigh 170 lbs. I do not typically work out since we have a ton of animals at my house so I am doing an activity with them daily, I would not call it a workout but it is me moving around. I am currently on several medications since I have high blood pressure and anxiety. I take Lisinopril, Inderal, Hydrochlorothiazide, Asprin, fish oil, and Nexium. A few years ago I had one brief episode of A-Fib, they believed it was holiday heart syndrome, my rhythm reset itself and never had that issue again. So with that being said, lately I have been feeling down and out about my health, I bring a laundry basket from my basement up to my second-story bedroom and I am out of breath. I constantly think about having a heart attack, I am so worried that it makes me sick to my stomach and also my anxiety starts to give me symptoms. I have been so worked upon certain occasions that I actually went to the ER and they said nothing was wrong. I do not know what to do to stop thinking about this and worrying it is going to happen to me. My family does have hearth issues but all lived well past their 80's. I had an episode a few months ago where I started to get really nauseous and felt like my heart was skipping a beat when I felt it skipping a beat is when I felt the overwhelming nauseous feeling. I went to my cardiologist and he gave me a monitor to wear, he did notice that I had an extra heartbeat from time to time and said it was completely normal, I told him I can feel this each time and it gives me extreme anxiety, I am afraid it is just going to stop beating. I had a stress test was done about 5 months ago and all normal. Another one of my big fears is that my arteries are clogged or getting clogged, I wish there was a non-evasive way to test this so that I can ease my mind, that is what I need a way to ease my mind that everything is working as it should and no issues. I know it may sound weird but I just need peace of mind. I don't know what to do at this point, I do not want to have a heart attack and I want to stop thinking about it all the time. What can I do? How do I know that when I feel these extra heartbeats it is normal? I have never had an abnormal EKG besides when I had the 1 round of A-Fib. This is most likely why I have high blood pressure and anxiety. Is there any hope for me getting over this fear, I do not want to be the 37-year-old that has a heart attack.","Doctor":"Hello. I appreciate your detailed write up. It made it easy for me to understand what the problem might be. I really do understand your situation. Having to constantly live with fear of having a heart attack can weigh you down. But I assure you everything is fine. The extra heart beats you feel are called palpitations. They are harmless and do not pose any harm. Stress, caffeine, smoking, sleeplessness are often the cause. - The EKG, stress test, lipid profile tests are enough to tell us if you have a chance of heart attack to some extent. You are fine since these results are normal you should avoid from fear of a heart attack. Most likely the cause of your high blood pressure is because you are overweight. At 37, high blood pressure is quite common amongst overweight people. I advise you start a proper workout for atleast 3 times a day for 30 minutes to an hour. This will help your palpitations and will bring down your weight. Get sufficient sleep, avoid smoking or caffeine and diet. These will reduce the rate at you get palpitations. Avoid worry, it kills faster than any disease. Your test results are enough to prove that you do not suffer from heart disease."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

What I want to know is whether I can fly- take an airplane without getting ill and sustain further inner damage?","Doctor":"Hi. 1. Super semicircular canal dehiscence is a rare inner ear condition. In this condition there will be giddiness and imbalance when exposed to loud noise and imbalance, echoing of once own voice, etc. This condition usually does not get worsened by change in environmental pressure. So air travel will not be an issue in this condition. In any case keep anti-vertigo medications such as Stemetil handy when you fly. 2. Patulous eustachian tube is a condition involving middle ear and nose. My guess is because of similarity in symptoms you have been given both the diagnosis. I can say that if there is vertigo then it is superior canal dehiscence if there is no vertigo chances of Patulous eustachian tube are high. In any case people with Patulous eustachian tube will have certain degree of pressure symptoms in ear when they fly but most of the times it will not be very severe. You can use simple saline nasal spray before boarding the flight and every two hours in air to reduce symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 28.

After 7 days today, I took a test with Prega kit and Cipla kit .Both results are negative. But I am so tensed about my periods. Am I pregnant or is this the side effect of I-pill?","Doctor":"Hello. As pregnancy test is negative, you can wait for 10 days more for the periods to start. If no periods by that time then repeat pregnancy test. If test is negative even after 10 days then you can take tablet Norethisterone 5 mg twice a day for 5 days to get period. You should be getting periods within 15 days of finishing the tablets.

If in case if the coconut vendor had HIV, could it be possible that the blood on the straw could have had touched my chapped lips and infected me?","Doctor":"Hi. Your risk of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) acquisition is unwarranted in this case. HIV can only be transmitted by sexual contact, through the exchange of contaminated syringes or needles, blood transfusion or there can be vertical transmission from HIV infected mother to her child during pregnancy, delivery or through breast milk.

I am still being confused, that I have to continue 21/7 regime or 21/5? My gynecologist said to me do not think about your menses just follow 21/5 regime whether menses come or not. So I want to ask is it normal to lost menses for two to three months, because I feel that if my menses came on 6th or 7th pill-free day on 21/7regime, then if follow 21/5 then I have to start my pack on the 6th day after five pill-free days. And if my menses will not come in these five days then after starting the new pack my menses will not start still a month, is it normal? What I have to do?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I would sincerely advise you to keep having pill in the 21 pills, 7 pill free cycles. This will avoid all the confusion. Hormone control will be the same if you take 7 pill-free or 5 pill-free cycle. We give the gap for proper hormone withdrawal so that the bleeding will be completed and the inner lining of the uterus is completely lost. So I would say you just follow the three weeks pills and one week pill-free cycle."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, When flaccid my penis is 2.3 inches and sticks straight. When erect it points straight up to my chin and has a large curve back to my belly button. My erection feels tight. I am circumcised. I also have very tender testicles and after sex, my lower back hurts and so do my testicles.","Doctor":"Hi. From what you say, it seems to be excessive upward curvature of penis (towards belly button). Though it is abnormal, no active treatment is necessary as long as you are able to have sexual intercourse. Only when it prevents sexual intercourse, treatment may be pursued. A photo taken during good rigid erection can help in better suggestions regarding treatment. Pain after ejaculation is usually due to retrograde ejaculation. If ejaculate is coming out of the penis, then there may be partial retrograde ejaculation. Check your urine after ejaculation for any evidence of semen by testing in a lab.

Earlier he used to get very angry over small matters. He was not able to concentrate on anything and was not able to sleep. He was confused and used to think that everybody was watching him.

He is now calm but has tremors in his hands and legs and feeling numbness in head and is very confused. He is feeling as if he is mad. He is mostly confined in home and hardly goes out. Need your advice on what to do and when he will feel better? Is antidepressant Fluoxetine not working?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I would like to inform you that three months are generally enough for the antidepressants to show effects. Secondly, 60 mg of Fluoxetine is generally a sufficient dose for antidepressant purposes. Considering the fact, that there is some response despite the presence of adequate dose for sufficient time indicates the possibility of partial response. Thirdly, the above observation is not unique as problems are often encountered in patients with long duration of untreated illness. Now regarding the tremors, I think Divalproex is likely to cause tremors as a common side effect. In my opinion, 250 mg of Divalproex has a little role on this day as his aggressive behavior already reduced. Regarding the next course of action, I feel adding another antidepressant is the first option. In case there are reasons for not doing the same adding low dose antipsychotics can be used provided there is aggressive behavior still present. I often prefer low doses of Olanzapine 5 mg to boost up the effect of Fluoxetine. I must assure you that over a period of time he will improve further.

I can understand your concern.

You are 35 and your height is around 175 cmand your weight is also in normal range. In a lot of individuals obesity is one of main reasons for low testosterone. But your BMI is normal and also your main issue is PME and not ED. PME is not related to testosterone levels and in most of individuals hyper excitation, poor experience and anxiety are main reasons for early discharge. I would advise you to start taking Vitamin D supplements (60k IU per week for at least 3 months) and this will bring the levels to normal range. For PME, drugs like Dapoxetine can be utilized. You can use the drug on SOS basis about one hour before sex and this will surely help to delay the ejaculation time. The drug is safe to use and has no serious side effects. Dose of 30 mg is normally used. You can talk with a doctor for prescription of this drug.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Your lipid profile is all fine and there is no risk to cardiac muscles and blood vessels of the heart due to this cholesterol and its counterparts. Index is safe according to the blood work.  Your high-sensitivity C-reactive protein is above normal and falls in the high risk group for cardiac blood vessel issues like coronary artery syndrome. But, this test is not that specific. We usually do repeated tests for C-reactive proteins and compare all of them separated apart with considerable time.  If there are no other risk factors for heart disease and there are no signs and symptoms of coronary artery disease then we assume this raised result levels to be from some non-cardiac cause.  In such a case I preferably suggest you to go for exercise stress test and if this indicates further investigations then proceed with angiography for cardiac evaluation and to see if there is some issue related to the coronary arteries.  Perhaps you mean that there was left atrial enlargement. It can be due to uncontrolled hypertension and you need to take medications on time. Your doctor did well by adding Aspirin to the regimen as it reduces the risk for blood clot formation inside the enlarged chamber of heart.  We have to keep your blood pressure in limits actually. And if that is fine, then no medications needed until unless proven otherwise after cardiac monitoring with time and some advanced tests as discussed below. 1. Echocardiography. 2. Exercise tolerance test. 3. Angiography. Can be decided on further tests as advised above.

There is a high probability that you would have accidentally injured the ear drum while cleaning. This is a very common thing to happen and you don't have worry too much. The defect in the ear drum interferes with optimum sound transmission to the middle and inner ear and thereby you will have symptoms such as continuous ringing sensations, muffled sounds, echoing of your own voice or any loud sound, intolerance to high frequency sounds, decreased hearing etc. Usually over 4 to 6 weeks this traumatic perforation heals and you will be completely fine. However, you shouldn't let it get infected as it can interfere with the healing process and if proper hygiene is not maintained the perforation might never close.

I got a call today saying that it came back normal. What does this mean? Do I still have hpv? Do I just have low risk hpv? I have never experienced warts.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Icliniq. There is a difference between all the tests you underwent. To make it clear for you I will explain one at a time. 1) Pap smear - it's a test used to screen if a women can be harbouring cancerous or precancerous cells over the mouth of the uterus ( i.e. CERVIX) , so basically a screening test for cervical cancer and it's pre cancerous changes. And as it is just a screening tests, it can not always diagnose if you have any foci of cancer over the cervix. it just give characteristics of the cells which were studied on the smears. So unless they are overtly cancerous looking, we always try to rule that out by doing other tests, So next comes the HPV ( Human Papilloma Virus) testing. 2) HPV testing - It's a test to detect the causative agent of the cervical cancer, that is human Papilloma Virus, it's spread through sexual contact. Based on their genomic sequence, they can be categorised into various types. So warts are caused by the low risk type that is 6 & 11. where as there some 12 high risk types which can cause cervical cancer, so these are detected in the HPV testing ( Depending on your test done - as various tests have different sensitivity & specificity). Of these high risk majority are caused by Type 16 & 18. So once a women starts her sexual activity, almost 70- 80% women may have HPV infection but it gets cleared over 1-2years, so that is why we do not test it for women less than 30yrs ( I see you haven't mentioned your age).So as the HPV is a virus and it coming positive indicates higher risk of having precancerous changes or may be risk of cervical cancer in future, we need to see if any changes have already happened to substantiate the previous tests. So then comes the role of colposcopy. 3) Colposcopy - it's basically a test to visualise the cervix under huge magnification and to see for any deviation from normal, and to look for any changes over the cervix which can hint on being abnormal or precancerous, so that from that particular abnormal sites biopsies canbe taken and subjected to histopathological examination ( where a pathologist sees the tissue under microscope to look for any cancerous cell). So as your colposcopy finding are normal, your gynaec may call you repeat testing after 6-12months for repeat cytology & HPV testing. If the Repeat screening are negative twice then you can just follow the screening protocols routinely as other women. Please share the reports of your HPV & Pap smear so that I can go through & guide you through in case you any further doubts.  Hope the information helps you. Have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

Now I guess, he must have had an ECG and echo, which would give additional assurance to this. Now if according to symptoms, they are again not classical of heart. If they were cardiac then they would have certainly aggravated by activities. So unlikely to be a cardiac issue. Now considering his reflux issue, the first possibility should be considered of acid reflux and secondly of musculoskeletal even if there is no definitive demonstrable tenderness. Omeprazole may not be able to counteract reflux totally. So it is worthwhile to try locally acting agents like syrup Sucralfate and see if it helps. Light meals and some walking after meals. Locally acting agent Diclofenac gel may also be tried. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

So, an impression can be made about the cause of the problem. How long are you facing this problem? How the problem started whether it was sudden in onset or build up slowly over the months or years? What is the frequency of the problem in a week or month? Are you able to have some successful sexual intercourse? In a typical month out of what number of sexual interactions or masturbation do not achieve success? What are the factors that increase the problem? What are the factors that relieve the problem such as thoughts, situations, partner, place, etc? Do you get an early morning erection? If yes, how frequently and how intense? Is your partner very critical and demands sex more than what can you think? Does she feel superior to you or bothers you in some other regards?

After six cycles she was back to normal. Before four months her CA125 levels are 7 and now her CA125 is 350 and she has lesion found on the liver. I am attaching the complete test results including CT scan. We are writing to you to get a second opinion regarding the treatment. The present doctor suggested four cycles of chemotherapy for four months with four weeks interval. We would like to know the present condition and the pros and cons of the treatment suggested. Is the situation too serious? Does the lesion go away with the chemotherapy or surgery is required? What kind of diet should be followed to get well soon during chemotherapy?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the reports. 9attachment removed to protect patient identity). Ovarian cancer recurrence is classified normally as platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant. Since it is more than six months from initial treatment would be classed as platinum sensitive. So the treatment options would be: Carboplatin alone three weekly or Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel three weekly (sometimes four weekly). Since CA125 is a good surrogate marker, you can monitor it every two months and scan after four cycles. 1. Yes, it is serious but it all depends on the degree of response to chemotherapy. 2. Treatment is not curative but to keep cancer under control and to give two years disease-free interval, there is a good chance of response. 3. Surgery is not an option. 4. No specific diets have shown to be beneficial."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, At the time of marriage, my age is 34 and my wife's age is 29. She is having hypothyroidism. Her thyroid level was high. So, we were regulating with medication. Then she gets some stomach pain. Doctor diagnosed her with gallbladder stone. We did laparoscopic cholecystectomy. After one year of time, we planned for a baby. Her HSG report was positive at that time. Then, after two weeks time, she got a miscarriage. Doctor said it may be a chemical pregnancy. Then we tried for natural pregnancy, but not succeded. So, we did a hysterosalpingogram. We found that one of her tube is blocked. We had hope on the other tube and tried again properly. Then, we did laparoscopy for endometriosis. Doctor cofirmed the blocked tube and the other one was also blocked partially. Now we decided to go for ICSI. So, I would like to know the checklist of hormonal tests to be taken prior to ICSI treatment. Please give me the hormonal test check list (all required test names). Which day of the cycle and when (fasting or non-fasting) this test sample to be given?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The decision to go for IVF (in-vitro fertilization) or ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) as per your history seems to be the right decision. As I can see in history, the age of your wife is now 30 plus. Ovarian reserve becomes an important analysis in the age above 30 years, more so when she has endometriosis. AMH (anti-mullerian test) is the test for it, irrespective of the cycle day. Also, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and prolactin test should be done. The other tests may vary from center to center, wherever you decide for treatment. The above-said tests are must along with a good 2D and 3D pelvic USG (ultrasound) and semen analysis. See your doctor in person with these reports."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have had severe tummy cramps, just under the ribs. For about a month some days I cannot keep any food or drink sown, but other days it is tolerable. I have not been doing much bowel movement and feel constipated, but when I do go it is still soft. At first, it was thought to be GERD, but the medication did not help and has lasted over a month now. My doctor has booked me for an endoscopy to check for gall stones or ulcers. I have not had any pain in the last few days and doing more of BM. Does this mean the gallstones have passed? Do I still need the gastroscopy done? I do not want to do any unnecessary tests. The pain has been pretty severe but at the moment it is not too bad. I am confused. I am currently taking Nortriptyline, Seroquel, Lamotrigine, and Metformin.","Doctor":"Hi.  It seems you are suffering from acid peptic disease or acid reflux disease. This usually presents with pain in the upper part of abdomen. However, I would like to rule out any evidence of gall bladder stones that can cause pain. If you have any hunger pains, any fullness of stomach or gaseous distension of the abdomen after taking meals, you should go for: 1. Upper GI endoscopy to rule out peptic ulcers. 2. Ultrasound abdomen to rule out gall bladder stones. I would advise you to take a combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone and to take antiflatulent and antacid syrup like Digene or Gelusil for symptomatic relief. Do not consume any alcohol, as even a small amount of alcohol can precipitate that. There is an infection called H.pylori infection which causes recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcers and such episodes of acidity. So, if during an endoscopy your doctor finds ulcers, he would take a biopsy and rapid urease test done for H.pylori infection and to get it treated. Share my opinion with your doctor before acting upon it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am one week late as of today for my menstrual period. Currently, my cycle is 38 days. I have been having protected sexual intercourse the past month, but just recently (Day 35) of my cycle, the condom of my partner leaked at the base. So I immediately took emergency contraceptive which is four birth control pills at 5 PM, then another four birth control pills at 5 AM the following morning. I started feeling the side effects, but I am worried since my period is a week late already and I just woke up at 2 AM on day 38 unable to sleep with a weird feeling in my stomach and I am extremely constipated, with tender breasts, and feel sick overall. I would like to know if my period will come soon? If there is a possibility I am pregnant, or if I am just feeling all these symptoms due to hormone imbalances? What I should do in this whole situation since I am very worried about it?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, you are right, your period will come soon and that is most likely possibility. Your symptoms can be due to both pregnancy and/or hormones. Because in pregnancy there is increase in amount of hormones and you just take higher dose of hormones. And symptoms you are experiencing is due to the higher level of hormones in your body which can be due to both reasons. But it is more likely that symptoms are due to the pills you had taken.  Because if it is due to pregnancy then pregnancy must be due to earlier intercourse which was protected. So there are very fewer chances of failure in that case. And right now your periods also get extended due to the pills you had taken. Basically, in this situation you should do a urine pregnancy test and see if it comes positive then it is due to the failure of previous precautions. And if it turns to be negative then just wait for seven more days and periods will come. And even after that if your symptoms are increasing in two days then you need to go for a test for confirmation to clear the confusion. Drink more water. And do not take much tension. With your history, it is more likely that it is just delayed menses due to emergency pills and side effects of oral hormones. Your period can be irregular for one or two cycles."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old male. Yesterday I had sex with a guy. We had protected anal sex for one to two minutes only.

He is suffering from swelling of testicle. Before this, he suffered from urine infection from E.coli bacteria and the treatment lasted for one month. Initially, he underwent his treatment in my hometown and later went to the nearby city for treatment. Doctor suggested to take antibiotics for 10 days and wait for 15 days and asked to come for re-checkup. Doctor told us if there is no improvement, then he suggested my father to remove his swelled left testicle. Please find previous reports and the recent one as well. Could you please explain the report and disease and also let us know is it something serious? Should we change our doctor? Is testicle swelling cannot be cured with medicine?

What are his present symptoms? Does he have a fever, pain in the testis or urinary problems? If the symptoms are severe symptoms then it is better to remove the testis. If there are no symptoms then we can wait, but the swelling will take four to six months to resolve. Testis removal is a minor surgery and he can undergo the surgery, no need to worry about. And no need to change the doctor as his treatment is fine.

If a person only had a partial transection of the cervical spinal cord would their final outcome still be a complete cervical spinal cord injury, where they no mobility or sensory function? Or is it possible their final outcome could be an incomplete cervical spinal cord injury where they have some mobility and sensory function? Can a person with a neck fracture die from their cervical spinal cord being compressed because of bleeding and swelling from the fracture compressing against the cord? Can a person with an incomplete cervical spinal cord injury, caused by a traumatic accident, die four days after the accident because of the cervical spinal cord failure to control blood pressure and heart rate, or respiratory failure because of damage done to the cord? Or would they have to have a complete cervical spinal cord injury to die four days after the accident because of the same reason stated above? And lastly, would it be possible for a elderly male, aged 80, who has had a fall, and has either a partially severed his cervical spinal cord, or his cervical spinal cord been injured by being compressed from bleeding and swelling as result of a neck fracture, be physically able to walk roughly 50 meters with someone assisting him? If it is possible, what would their balance be like, for example, if the person assisting the injured man was holding him with one their arms holding him at the waist would be able to walk in a straight line, or would his walking be staggered, unbalanced and uncoordinated?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that the cervical spinal cord is a very delicate part of the spinal cord because in its beginning are located the most important centers which control the heart rate, the pulmonary function, and the blood pressure values. It is true that just after a trauma a man can walk, with or without assistance for 50 meters and this can sound strange. In fact, this can be related to the lack of damage to the spinal cord in that moment (there is only the fracture of the vertebral column, while the central nervous system is intact). While walking, the instability of the damaged vertebral column causes further damage to the spinal cord and the person gets paralyzed. Regarding the partial and complete damage of the spinal cord, it is difficult to judge. All the damages begin as partial, but because of the spinal cord instability, the lack of right immobilization and the bleeding and swelling, the damage may become complete in the next days. The swelling and bleeding tend to spread and the spinal cord is trapped within the vertebral column, and can not expand further, so the swelling and bleeding cause further damage to the spinal cord. It is difficult to judge in the first days of trauma. But, because of the swelling in the first days after the trauma (first week), the person may die because of acute cardio-respiratory arrest, due to the dysfunction of the heart and respiratory function. The swelling tends to spread in the upper cord and the paralysis becomes complete, affecting also the respiration and the heart rhythm. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 71 years old. He having abdominal pain in the middle for the past four to five days. Pain is constant and mild to moderate in intensity. He is not having any issue in passing stools or urine but sometimes complains of burning sensation while passing stools. His appetite is good. No vomiting or diarrhea. No fever. His current medial history includes diabetes and hypertension. He is an Alzheimer patient. Can you please prescribe some medication for his abdominal pain.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand you must be very upset about your father's health. Well, you see the abdominal pain in such age is often an alarming finding, and I urge you to get him some investigations before giving any blanket cover of medicines. Common possibilities in his age are: 1. Mesenteric ischemia, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel supplying the blood to abdominal organs. This can frequently occur in old age with diabetes and hypertension. The pain arises because of lack of blood supply to organs like small bowel, large bowel, and others. 2. The second possibility is pain due to any organ within the abdomen which is inflamed commonly the pancreas (a gland over the back of the tummy), and large bowel. 3. And lastly, since he has a problem with constipation the gas accumulation can also be the reason of his abdominal pain. But remember, we cannot say that it is because of gas distension unless we exclude all other possibilities which are more concerning. I suggest you to get investigations which I write below. Only after the investigation, we can be able to diagnose the problem and treat it appropriately. I really hope this set of investigations will help us to approach the problem correctly. Mesenteric ischemia. Pancreatitis, gall bladder or common bile duct stones. Colitis, colonic neoplasia. Gas, constipation related. Compete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests. Serum lactate level and serum CRP (c-reactive protein). HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin). Lipid profile. Stool for detailed report. Stool for occult blood on consecutive three days. Stool for fecal calprotectin. Capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals. Ispagol husk two tablespoons full with water daily. Follow up after investigation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex last March but took emergency contraceptive afterward. Six days after, I had the bleeding associated with the emergency contraceptive. Two weeks after that, in the first week of April, I had my period for six days (my usual period lasts five to seven days). In May, I had five days of the period although the last two days were only very light bleeding. Now I was due for my period four days ago, but I still have not got it. What are the chances that I am pregnant and if not should I be worried about my late period?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, as you had three episodes of menstrual bleed including the withdrawal bleed post-emergency contraceptive after you had intercourse in March, so it is unlikely that you would be pregnant due to your sexual encounter in March. As you have missed your menses now by four days and if you have been sexually active during this cycle as well, then you must rule out pregnancy first with a home urine pregnancy test kit. If negative, then the delay is most likely stress-induced and you should wait for at least five days to allow menses to start naturally. If not, then you would need an ultrasound pelvis to check for endometrial thickness which if more than 8 mm. You can be offered a withdrawal bleed with progesterones to resume your menses."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old female who has been suffering with episodes of tachycardia and ventricular ectopic beats for 2 years now.

Your reports appear to be fine other than ectopics and probably sinus tachycardia, which are benign (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You should get your thyroid test and hemoglobin level done if not done recently. You should assure yourself that these are benign and will not cause any harm. You need to discuss with your doctor regarding withholding Salmeterol or use it to the minimum. It can cause or aggravate these. Also, coffee intake should be minimized. And if symptoms are too troublesome then you should discuss with your doctor regarding starting Betablockers or Calcium channel blockers, which would subside these, if not contraindicated in you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

First of all, I like to inform you that masturbation is completely harmless process and not associated with any side effects. However, depression is one of the common causes of poor erections and it is possible that there is still some effect of it. In addition, the medication you used for treatment also causes an elevation of prolactin as a side effect. The high prolactin in turn causes loss of libido, erections, sexual desire among other side effects.

It is better if you can provide some more details of your symptoms like any fever, frequency and urgency of urination, any white patches over penis, pus discharge through urethral opening, duration of symptoms. Diabetics are prone for infection and their spread.  You should get urine routine examination and urine culture sensitivity testing.

Afterward, I started ringing bells of unknown homes and simply run around everywhere. I also had delusions. I was given a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and was treated with ECT and Risperidone 4 mg. I returned to being normal without any delusions. Then after a while, I stopped taking my medicines and in a week I was having delusions again. My intellectual capacity was lessened and I was in the hospital again, and I was treated with ECT and Risperidone. Again I went back to normal. Before I took magic mushrooms, I was socially not that talkative but I still I had friends in my class but beyond that, I did not have many connections apart from my three school friends and one other friend. I had failing marks. No one ever said I talked weirdly or has delusions or is abnormal. I still avoid socially but I have friends in my current class. My academics are better and I do not get failing marks. But that is because I got better in managing my computer addiction and to study in my spare time. I am currently taking Risperidone 3 mg. My question is do I have schizophrenia? And I want to discontinue my medications because its side effects are unbearable, can you please help me to do so?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. You consumed magic mushrooms and the symptoms started after that. There was a clear cut relationship between the use of the drug with psychosis as per your history. This was four years back. You responded well to treatment and are doing good in academics, and social domain. Well, if we consider whether the medicines should be continued or not then that depends upon the treating doctor. You developed two episodes of psychosis within a year gap and on stopping the medicines it is positive that you are doing good. So in my opinion, a gradual dose reduction of medicines can be done. You are currently on Risperidone and its doses can be reduced gradually over the next three months and there should be no problem. You have one episode of acute psychosis precipitated after magic mushroom use. But the second episode is pointing towards schizophrenia. The worsening of symptoms post stopping the medicines cannot be explained by acute psychosis. So yes, you might have schizophrenia or psychosis NOS in my opinion. You are yourself seeking treatment and are clear about history which is not very common in schizophrenia. So you can try to reduce the doses gradually and this should help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have chest congestion with heaviness in chest. I also have a constant cough with sputum. I am not taking any medication at present for this. Could this be due to smoking?","Doctor":"Hello. Your cough and chest congestion is probably due to bronchitis (smoking can be the underlying reason however, at the moment you are experiencing a phase of exacerbation due to infection or an allergic reaction). I would like to know about the onset of your symptoms and how long you have been experiencing these productive coughs and chest pain? Nonetheless, CXR (chest x-ray) is the necessary step before prescribing appropriate medications. Your probable diagnosis is bronchitis (likely an allergic one). I recommend using a nasal corticosteroid to subside the symptoms such as Mometazone or Beclomethasone. You will also benefit from using antibiotics such as Azithromycin. Macrolides such as Azithromycin are not only anti-microbial agents but have some anti-inflammatory effects that are quite impressive in bronchitis. Gargling warm saline along with installing a humidifier in your room will be of great importance. Also, a PPD (purified protein derivative) test is always recommended as a primary tool to screen tuberculosis in patients with chronic cough. Do not freak out about it but it is worth the visit since prevention is always far better than treating a late-stage infectious disease. Allergy, infection. PPD, Sputum test, CXR. Infectious bronchitis. Allergic bronchitis. COPD. Tuberculosis. Pneumonia. Bronchitis. Beclomethasone nasal spray, Azithromycin 1 g on the first day then 500 mg for five days, Theophylline-G suspension, one table spoon every night."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I do not feel comfortable speaking to someone because of the bad breath issue. What can I do to eradicate this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Gum bleeding, gum swelling, and bad breath are the signs of gum condition called gingivitis. Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums caused due to constant irritation by tartar or calculus (hardened yellow deposits on the tooth). Food deposits or plaque that settles on the tooth get calcified in the long run and become hardened calculus deposits. Constantly irritated gums become weak and start to bleed when we brush or in the morning time after waking up. A professional scaling and polishing procedure is done by an ultrasonic scaler instrument to remove that calculus. Once removed, the gums take a day to heal and the gum bleeding and gum swelling will resolve the next morning. You will also see an improvement in your bad breath issue. Please visit your dentist and get this procedure done. This procedure can be done once in six months if required. Although we do a proper brushing every day, there are certain spots between teeth where the bristles fail to reach. Hence a professional tooth cleaning is always advised once in a while. There are certain brushing techniques that can be followed to prevent calculus accumulation. Get to know that from your dentist and please do follow them. And you should start cleaning the tongue with a tongue cleaner or by using the back of the brush. This will be effective in reducing the bad breath issue. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female who is turning 20 years old in two months.

I have never had any kind of ticks or repetitive and involuntary movements or sounds. When I was 15, I started to become really hypochondriac (since I have had anxiety since 9) and Tourette syndrome was my nightmare. Every year I would suspect (without symptoms) that I was starting to develop it. Recently, I started to get spasm (face and legs) before falling asleep and those spasms are now in my eyebrows and eyelids as well, including during the day. My eyes feel like blinking (normally, once every 10-15 seconds) without me controlling it. Is it possible that I am developing Tourette?","Doctor":"Hello. Tics are quite common and experienced by many people. Tics happen more prominently when you are worried and stressed. You have been reporting anxiety and particularly worried about Tourettes syndrome. Tourettes syndrome is a severe form of tic disorder where a person has both motor and vocal tics present consistently for more than a year. From your description, you do not appear to have Tourettes syndrome. I can understand you are excessively worried about possible tics which is making your anxiety worse. It will be helpful to try relaxation strategies to manage anxiety. Deep breathing techniques and Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation exercises will help. Tics become less when you are less worried. If anxiety is getting worse, consult a doctor or psychologist for professional support. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Bright red blood is coming from the rectum after using the bathroom. The rectum is also very itchy and no signs of external hemorrhoids. Rectum has been itchy for a while especially when wiping. Every now and again there is a light and spotty bright red blood. There was a little more during my last BM which caused me to be concerned. It may be an anal fissure? I am currently taking Cortizone 10.","Doctor":"Hi. It could be a fissure or internal hemorrhoids or IBD (inflammatory bowel disease). Just to differentiate one from the other if you could help us out by answering these questions: Does it hurt when you pass stools (BM)? Do you have constipation? How much was the blood? Did you felt dizzy? Do anyone have colon cancer in the family? Do you have any weight loss?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a red, swollen and infected ingrown toe nail. It is speeding quickly and painfully. Yesterday I saw Dermatologist for the first time and she wrote me a prescription antibiotic of Ciprofloxacin 500mg/Thrice/day for one week and then do a partial toe nail surgery. Later, my last lab test was done and it was showing that my liver functions (SGPT / ALT (KINETIC) 96.70 U/L) while the normal rate is from 10 to 50 U/L and an ultrasound report on my liver says: \\"Diffuse severe fatty infiltration of the liver.\\" I did not purchase the antibiotic because I am worried for my liver since I am on seven other medications daily. My question is: Can my liver sustain 7 different drugs while taking a 500 mg of antibiotic?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for providing the details in your history. My question is that, is it the first time that the liver fatty infiltration has been discovered? Did you have had a test called FIBROSURE or liver MRI/ biopsy? Cipro is relatively safe with liver disease but honestly it will not be my first choice for treatment of ingrown toe nail infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had an injury to my penis about two and a half weeks ago which caused a blood clot at the base of the penis. The clot has healed within three to four days, however, on one side of my penis there are prominently visible veins. When flaccid that looks irregular and also there seems to be a vein that is harder than the others when I am erect that runs all the way up the side of my penis when erect. I wondered if I could post a before and after photo, and ask you if I need to seek treatment or if everything looks normal. I wanted to know if there is a chance I have sustained a permanent injury to my pens or if these veins might settle over time. I am not experiencing any pain except for the veins.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through your queries. You had an injury over the base of the penis and had a hematoma over there and there are prominent veins at the side of injury. Let me first assure you it was most probably a superficial injury. As you are not having any erectile dysfunction and any deformity after erection the injury has not involved the deep layer of the penis which is also called tunica albuginea. So you need not worry. The veins even if prominent will cause no harm. It will create a few collaterals and drainage will be as fine as before. But if you are still anxious you can undergo a USG (ultrasound) and doppler study of penis. It will tell you regarding the integrity of tunica albuginea, as well as the competence of blood vessels supplying the penis. It is only to assure you. You can also visit the office of your local urologist as you need clinical examination too. But do not worry. I hope everything will be fine soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mom had a heart attack at my house. They did a stunt and then she had some brain bleed and had mini strokes. She was in a coma and recovered, even had a temporary tracheotomy. She went to a rehab facility and was very dehydrated so bad she had to go to the ER. The doctor said her sodium was the highest he had seen. Well, as they slowly dropped it she began to talk again with her voice. Then as the sodium levels got back to normal she had started whispering again. Do you have any answers for this or anything that can help me? She is currently under Synthroid, depression medicines, and anxiety medicines.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that it is quite normal to have high sodium levels due to dehydration. Anyway, there is no reason to lose voice while rehydration, which causes the normalization of sodium levels. Anyway, the changes in concentration of sodium can lead to temporary brain dysfunction, due to swelling of brain cells or their shrinkage, depending on sodium concentrations. This may be a possible explanation of what has happened, as her brain was accustomed to high sodium levels and then the drop in such levels could have lead to a local brain cell swelling in some region of the brain, which is more susceptible (due to previous damage). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

For a week I had a feeling of swallowing issues, where I felt not all of it was sticking to my throat. Now that sensation has more or less gone away, I still do feel like grain in my throat after finishing the meal. I have a lot of dry coughs and my throat feels like irritated constantly. I am not sure if its due to GERD or LPR. I am taking Prevacid 30 mg since last week. I am not sure if that is the reason for my swallowing getting better, but the sensation is still there. Now I am worried that this could be some neurological issue. I am going to see an ENT, but that is a month from now. My question is how is muscle weakness of the throat diagnosed? Is my issue more of an indication of some neurological issues or anxiety and GERD? I also feel like the mucus or the foreign object sometimes interferes with my breathing. When I am tensed or anxious it feels like a ball, when I am calm I do seldom feel it. But when I take a big swallow I feel something in the middle of my throat. I have done an endoscopy, pH and manometry test which does not show much. My doctor diagnosed me with IBS.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The symptoms you are experiencing classically fit into globus pharyngeus. Manometric studies, endoscopy being normal, organic causes are ruled out. Hypo or hypomotility disorders would present in a typical manner and manometric studies would have shown something. Neurological or neuromuscular afflictions would have other symptoms.

A couple of weeks ago, my doctor prescribed Klonopin (Clonazepam) for me, but there are some things I am worried about after googling a bit. Does Klonopin increase the risk of QT prolongation or other serious heart problems? I just do not want to take any risk, because I have been suffering form PVCs every day for over a year. Sometimes I have also bradycardia and every now and then short burst of an accelerated heartbeat with fluttering sensation. They are still under investigation. I have had lots of ECGs, and at one my QT, QTc was 412, 447 at a heart rate of 71 bpm. And I would not like to make my QT any longer. I have also used Oxazepam. Is it a safer option when it comes to the risk of QT prolongation or can I continue taking Klonopin?","Doctor":"Hello. Long term Clonazepam, as well as high dose clonazepam, puts you at a risk for developing acquired long QT, having said that a QTC of 447 msec is within the prescribed i.e < 460 msec limit for women. Oxazepam is safer but if you combine either of these with another QT prolonging drug, the QT may become dangerously prolonged, also avoid a low potassium blood level and diuretics (medications which promote urination). Your description of PVCs leads me to suggest a Holter and ECG just to rule out any pause dependent arrhythmia.

If the lesions still exist and hurt and do not have the typical umbilicated appearance. I recommend taking a biopsy so investigate the pathology. If they do not exist at the moment, plan on taking a biopsy when they reappear. The burning sensation you feel in your palms and soles is due to a different pathology, most likely a neuropathy. Further information needed to put the right diagnosis on these symptoms, most importantly a detailed history of when and how they started? And how long have you been experiencing this burning sensation? Do you have any medical history or family history of diabetes? Nonetheless, these symptoms are not related to HIV infection. All I can recommend for assuring a reliable HIV test result is to repeat the test three months after exposure and see if you are still test negative. (Rarely antibody formation might take longer than usual)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 51 years old with a complaint of bloating, loose stools, burning sensation in the abdomen 15 years back. I managed two years without medicine. I was advised to use Rabeprazole to which my symptoms subsided a little bit. From then I cannot tolerate spicy foods, fruits, caffeinated drinks, and curd. If I take these foods my stomach starts bloating with loose stools, burning sensation in the abdomen. At times, I get pains in the hands and feet, burning sensation and pain in the back of the head and breathlessness. These symptoms subside by passing flatus and belching and on using medication. I was evaluated and diagnosed as a case of IBS. I am uploading my complete details. Please find attachment.","Doctor":"Hi. I reviewed all your medical reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I can say as follows: First of all, you need to be examined with upper endoscopy and colonoscopy plus abdominal ultrasound. Your symptoms may be related with Gerd and hiatal hernia or gastritis, stomach ulcer. In the meantime, I would suggest using PPI's (proton pump inhibitors) and antacid to improve your symptoms. After completing the exams mentioned above I will give you a more accurate opinion regarding your possible diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I would like some help with my blood test results as my doctor has not been able to help. I have a multinodular goiter with six nodules, the largest is 5 cm x 2 cm. I am particularly concerned about the high FT4 (while FT3 is below optimal level), high PTH, low vitamin D, high CRP and ESR, high insulin, and high IgA. Do you have any suggestions on what could cause these results? My symptoms include chronic diarrhea, occasional constipation, abdominal pain, fluid retention, extremely irregular periods, fatigue with trouble sleeping, frequent headaches, occasional dizziness, bone, joint pains, and weight gain. Most of these only showed up in the last few months after goiter was found. My saliva cortisol results are also on the very low end of range. I have attached my blood test results. I am currently taking Tramadol.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and the results that you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It does not seem you have any thyroid disease as of now since your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is normal and your T3 and T4 are at acceptable levels and nothing to worry about that. Some people do have thyroid nodules which should be assessed yearly by ultrasound to make sure they are not increasing in size or texture. My advice for this aspect would be repeat thyroid function tests yearly and do an FNAC i.e an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the thyroid nodule to be sure it is benign. Yes, you do have vitamin D deficiency and when you have this, you automatically have high parathyroid hormone levels that is called secondary hyperparathyroidism and that occurs usually with vitamin D deficiency and gets better when that is treated. My advice is to have sun exposure 30 minutes daily and take vitamin D and calcium supplements. I do not know what type of hyperparathyroidism your niece is having but I assure you that yours is not to be worried about. Your saliva cortisol I do not think we usually worry about salivary cortisol levels. Try doing a serum cortisol levels if you are worried to be sure in the morning particularly. I know your serum CRP (c-reactive protein) and immunoglobulins are high but they are signs of allergy or immune reaction to any food. They could also be the cause behind your bone and joint pains including vitamin D deficiency. What I am concerned about is your high insulin levels as they suggest that you have insulin resistance. That could be due to polycystic ovaries or sedentary lifestyle or impending diabetes or metabolic syndrome. My advice would be to have a pelvic ultrasound since you also have irregular periods and you might benefit from a consultation with the gynecologist. In the meantime try to exercise 45-60 minutes daily and sleep for eight hours and consume low carbohydrate, low-fat diet, and avoid sweet drinks absolutely. Take the help of a nutritionist to lose weight. You might benefit from tablet Metformin 500 mg thrice a day. It will help you with your PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and the metabolic syndrome as well and help with the high insulin levels and also cause slight weight reduction. I hope this helps. Tablet Metformin 500 mg thrice a day. Lifestyle modification."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Just over a week ago, I developed severe swelling and soreness on the left side of my throat, particularly at the base of my tongue. My left ear is also in a lot of pain. Swallowing is extremely difficult and I went to see local urgent care where they prescribed me with Amoxicillin 500 mg and said it was most likely pharyngitis even though I have not had tonsils for many years. My main concern, even though it is a worse case scenario, is esophageal cancer through HPV can occur, as my girlfriend was recently diagnosed with HPV. Again, I know this is the worst case scenario, but since she was diagnosed I really been concerned about HPV-related cancers. From what I read and what I've been told, there are no real tests to check in men for HPV and even though there is the vaccine it is not recommended for men ages 26 to 45 years. I have already been taking Amoxicillin for about four days now and nothing improves. I have also tried taking regular over the counter cough drops and gargling with salt water. This has not helped at all either I have also been told that throat cancer from HPV can usually be spotted unless you have lesions in your oral area. Right now I am at a loss of what I really need to do? Any help or advice would seriously be appreciated. I am also under Amlodipine 5 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. Your problem can be due to pharyngitis. It is possible that Amoxicillin is not effective enough in your case. You may need some other antibiotics. I want to see your throat myself. Can you send me a picture of your throat? (I should be able to see posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsils). We can think of HPV-related problems only after ruling out other infections. Did you lose your weight? Are you having any swelling in the neck (lymph node enlargement)? The only way of ruling out HPV-related oral cancers is by taking an oral biopsy. Before concluding anything please send me a picture of your throat. I will be able to guide you in a better way."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My sister is going through psychiatric treatment for depression. She had a miscarriage 10 years back and childless after that. Since the last six years, she is in depression and unable to mingle with society. Doctor asked for routine blood tests and her TSH level are above normal. She advised her to visit an endocrinologist. She is lacking energy in her day to day work and always complains of body aches like in waist area and in back. She is very silent and only responds to any query after knocking her two to three times. She cannot walk for more than 500 meters at a stretch and feels tired always. She also complains about constipation and less sleep. She is 41 years old and her weight is 44 kg with a height of 161 cm. Blood pressure is normal 110 / 80 mmHg. I have uploaded her reports and her medications are tablet Arpizol 15 mg, Nexito 5 mg, Neuro D3 60K, and Optineuron. Please advise for her TSH levels and vitamin D levels (it is low). Iron and calcium levels are low as well. I would request you to upload a prescription if possible so that I can buy the medicines from local shops or online.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and the detailed reports about your sister (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Well, the TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is not that high as to require a treatment currently. Usually, it so happens when the patient is already under some physical ailment and this is often temporary. I suggest no treatment for her subclinical hypothyroidism at this stage. Although, I would advise to repeat just her TSH, T3 and T4 after three months and then regularly at six months twice and then once yearly to rule out any future thyroid disorder. Regarding her vitamin D levels, I saw the prescription which said it does contain 60,000 IU of vitamin D so no need for anything from that aspect from me as well. Although it is better to give her sun exposure regularly early in the morning daily for 30 minutes both for vitamin D deficiency and her depression as it helps for both conditions. Rest all her symptoms are due to her psychological disorder and not due to thyroid as of now. I hope this helps. Thyroid function test after three months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a prostate congestion issue that comes and goes from 2 years. Lately I am having a slower urine stream even slower than the times I had my prostate congestion before, also I am having uncomfortable feeling above my anus, itchy or uncofortable feeling at the tip of my penis, and some discharge from my penis. I had my tests done. Urine and semen culture, swab from the tip of my penis, and C/S for my urine and semen. Before the results doctors been telling me that I might have an STI and they gave me a one time injection with 4 tablests of antibiotics. When the results came it showed no sign of any bacteria in all my tests, the swab is clean no STD. I only had a higher WBC count in semen culture which was around 10-15, where the normal reading was 0-5. My doctor told me thay I have an infection in my prostate or inflammation. He gave me anti-biotics for 10 days and an alpha blocker medicine. He did not do physical check or ultra sound. I need a second opinion, I am afraid I have a cancer, it does not make sense to have an infection without bacteria discovered in all the tests?","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like prostatitis, chronic (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Often in this condition, diagnosis is clinical, most tests are negative. On rectal exam, sometimes prostate can feel tender. sonography can show swollen prostate. Uroflow may be reduced. There may be bacteria or WBC in semen. Also, post-prostatic massage urine culture may be positive. Even if all these are normal and there is clinical suspicion, you may be given treatment for prostatitis. Usual course is for 1.5 to 2 months. Symptoms can recur but usually are less severe than first attack. People get prostate cancer after age 50."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 35 years old. I am married for last 4 years and having a kid. I led a sedentary lifestyle. My fasting blood sugar was 257 and PP was 353. My HbA1c was 11.3. I was diagnosed to have diabetes. I consulted my friend with is a doctor and under his guidance, I changed my diet and started the exercise. I reduced my weight from 103 kg to 91.2 kg. After three months, my fasting was 117 and PP 153 with HbA1c 6.5. My lipid profile is normal. For the past one week, when I check my glucose level in glucometer at home, it is less than 110. I am not in diabetes medicine. I think I have ED. What are the test that needs to be done to diagnose the same?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that there is no test which alone can tell you whether you have ED (erectile dysfunction) or not other than the history and proper physical examination. This is the thing which are done by the doctor when you present yourself in his or her office. Based on the observation doctor decides whether the testes are required or not. In case required he only decides what are the tests required based on the available history details and clinical examination. I mean to say that you need to see a properly trained sexologist to determine the number of tests required. This is because the presence of abnormal test does not mean the test abnormality is the cause of the problem and similarly, the presence of normal test result does not rule out the problem. However, in routine practice, we order normal biochemistry (blood sugar, GTT - glucose tolerance test, HbA1c, lipid profile, LFT - liver function test, and thyroid profile), hormonal profile (free and total testosterone, prolactin, LH - luteinizing hormone, and FSH - follicle-stimulating hormone), USG abdomen and pelvis, and penile Doppler study among others. These are often a minimal requirement and the number of tests can change as per the need of the individual patients. I hope this helps you. Feel free to write back to me if you have more questions."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was seen at Emergency Care and diagnosed with a sinus infection.

This infection has made the tinnitus louder and much more intrusive. Should I hang on for a while longer, or do I need to be seen by my ENT doctor immediately?","Doctor":"Hi. Since you had sinusitis,it is very likely that the infection has spread to your ear which is causing the blocking sensation. I would also like to know whether you are suffering from tinnitus for long? Have you had age-related hearing loss earlier as well? Do you have ear pain? Either it can be just the infection in resolving stage which will take around two to three weeks after the infection subsides or it is possible that you are getting sensorineural hearing loss.

Everyday I just try to survive. My appetite sucks, I have trouble falling asleep and have frequent nightmares, I am exhausted all the time. I finally decided to get help. I saw a psychiatrist today, who concluded I do not fit any diagnosis, and with therapy I can learn to deal with the situation that causes these things. But there is no situation? How can someone be in so much pain for so long and the answer is basically that I am just too weak to handle life?

I would beg to differ with the psychiatrist who you have consulted and all the symptoms you have mentioned are depressive symptoms which do need treatment with medicines. Therapy can only help increase the effect of medicines, it is not a replacement . I would prefer that a psychiatrist or a doctor should prescribe you a standard dose of an SSRI such as Sertraline 50 mg, and add low dose mood stabilizer such as Divalproex sodium 250 mg. Major depressive disorder secondary to a stress in past along with a probable personality disorder , will need further history to arrive at a diagnosis.

The report to me is normal with normal size uterus and also the ovarian size even though it mentions bulky ovaries (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

The presence of small multiple subcenterimetric follicles indicate developing follicles and cannot be labelled as polycystic ovaries unless the criteria for clinical hyperandogenism like acne, hirsutism, acanthosis nigerians and oligomenorrhoea is met. The presence of frequent urination points towards possibility of a urinary tract infection which can be ruled out with a urine routine microscopy test.

As initial management, you might require analgesics like Ibuprofen or Sumatriptan for headache. 3. To prevent further attacks you may require a long term drug-like Flunarizine.

Then at the beginning of this month, I started getting pain in the upper left side of my abdomen (just under my bottom rib). I am still feeling rough, the pains are still happening and as well as being in the front it is also in my back now as well. I am hardly eating as it is making the pain a lot worse, I have now lost just over two stones since last month. My stomach also bloats out and looks swollen on the left side, it is also incredibly tender to touch. I am being sick even though I am on anti-sickness tablets. I have seen a doctor and I was sent for blood tests on three different occasions, all three tests have shown inflammation. Currently, I am waiting for a referral to a gastro doctor but I have been told it is a very long wait. My doctor thinks possible inflammatory bowel disease. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. By looking at history, it seems like chronic pancreatitis for me. Pain after eating, tenderness, loss of weight, bloating sensation are highly suggestive. Mesenteric ischemia also presents in a similar way but is usually seen in the elderly with a history of cardiac disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is another possibility which presents more or less like this. I wanted to know your bowel habits to come closer to the diagnosis. If loose stools and constipation are seen alternatively, probably it is inflammatory bowel disease. If it is a small amount of mucus or sticky kind of stool probably it is chronic pancreatitis. In any case, get an ultrasound abdomen done at the earliest which can lead to some diagnosis before you visit your gastroenterologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 28 years old. I tried using a penis pump for around 10-12 days, 15 minutes each to gain size. I used a vacuum to keep the penis enlarged. Maybe I was trying too hard, and vacuum it till it started to ache. I had no pain after thouse procedures though, ever. I was also masturbating around two to three times a day during that period (usually it was once a day). Now, I feel my penis has grown softer instead, flaccid or erect both ways. I cannot feel hard enough to penetrate. Even if I try to masturbate, it still feels squishy, and not hard. My sex drive is also diminished. I have not had a wet dream in 10-12 days, still I do not feel high as I used to earlier without sex or masturbation for a day or two. I do not feel any kind of pain, during penetration, or otherwise. I of course have stopped both pump and masturbation. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to know that you are facing a problem with the hardness of penis following the use of penis pump to enlarge the penis size. It is foolish to believe that the penis pump enhances penis size as it is a scam rather than anything. However, we cannot correct the past and need to look for the reasons for the loosening of penile tissue. In my opinion, there is a tear over the blood vessel or sphincter leading to leakage of blood during erection resulting in inadequate tightness. However, I must assure you that the presence of erection (although poor) and stoppage of further damage should be enough to allow the recovery of proper erection in a few weeks. At this stage, it is important to manage your stress as it is unlikely to help you in any regard. At the same time, it is recommended to get penile doppler to assess the damage at the earliest level.

I just googled what could be cause for the same. It says it could be because of viral infections including HIV/AIDS. I am worried now. I am scared to consult a doctor at the moment. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. Monocytes may increase or decrease, it hardly matters. One of the cause is viral disease. Not only HIV virus may cause this, but there are also many other viruses like cytomegala virus which can cause this. Flu is also caused by virus. Nowadays, fever is also called as viral fever, which takes a prolonged time to recover. If you are suffering from a common cold, or sneezing it is also viral. Nowadays in any disease one of the causes is viral. Monocytes are not so important except for in leukemia (blood cancer) which can be detected by peripheral blood film in which monocytes are highly increased. But in your case, the values are a little bit deranged. Have you noticed any symptoms? In the case of HIV infection, various types of symptoms appears even joint pain, sore throat, ulcers in oral cavity, rashes, and itching are common. Advise:- Take a healthy homemade diet (both vegetarian and nonvegetarian). Maintain proper oral hygiene of oral cavity and genitalia. Undergarments should be washed properly and soaked with Dettol or Savlon.  Add citrus fruits like lemon, orange, kiwi, and blueberry in your diet. It increases immunity and overall physical fitness.

In your report, four main abnormal values are present such as lymphocytosis, vitamin D deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and homocysteine borderline high. Lymphocytosis can be from temporary viral infection. As no other symptoms related I do not think further workup for lymphocytosis needed just now. For vitamin D deficiency, Cholecalciferol sachet (50000 or 60000 IU) can be prescribed which is taken once a week with milk for six weeks. For low vitamin B12, Cyanocobalamine injections can be prescribed 1000 mcg intramuscular per week for six weeks. Folic acid level also should be checked. If needed folic acid tablet is also prescribed. Repeat CBC (complete blood count) after one week. With the correction of vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiency, your tiredness will be resolved.

It is not the first time I was stung by a bee, but this time 30 minutes after it happened, I got swelling under my eyes, on my cheeks and it was getting bigger as time passed. I went to ER and they gave me Corticosteroids IV. Now, I was wondering if this means I am allergic to bee stings and if in future I get stung by a bee again does it mean anaphylacic attack can develop?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, that is correct. It seems you are allergic to bee sting. For an allergic reaction to develop, initial exposure must occur in order for your body to create an immune response to it. This might have happened a few months ago when you were stung before. Since there was already an exposure and established immune response, subsequent exposure may result in allergic reaction. Severe allergic reaction resulting in anaphylaxis may occur but most of the time allergic reaction is mild and not life threatening. Symptoms such as excessive skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin, low blood pressure, constriction of your airways and a swollen tongue or throat, difficulty breathing, weak and rapid pulse, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and dizziness or fainting warrants immediate consult.

I take more water and there is no sign of blood. What is the problem?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Nothing to worry at present. There is no relation with the cricket ball hit. It might be related to dehydration or gym exercises which also can cause dehydration, both of which cause dark urine. Just get basic tests done to confirm it is blood or just dark yellow urine. Drink plenty of water. Get done your urine routine, ultrasound abdomen and pelvis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

The chest x-ray shows a prominent right hilar area most likely due to rotation.

It appears that the paleo diet does not have anything much for vegetarians. I want to follow a paleo vegetarian diet to lose about 15-20 kg of weight. I am a thyroid patient and taking Thyronorm 50 mcg for the past 15 years. I also have high BP and taking Telma 40 after breakfast and Amlogard 5 mg after dinner. I was affected by Vitiligo about 10 years back and currently not taking any allopathy medication for this. I am taking one ayurvedic tonic called Lukoskin. I have highly irregular periods recently hence taking Ovral L to get periods on time. A few months I stopped taking the medicine and did not get the periods for the past three months. I have started the medicine again for the past 10 days.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to Icliniq.com. Well, paleo diet is good in a sense of restricting your diet, but as you said you have irregular periods too. That means sufficient amount of nutrition might not be reaching your body. So better have some non-vegetarian food products which are excellent source of protein for your body. Fish and egg are good. It sometimes becomes quite impossible to remain away from protein-rich food items. Following a paleo diet with a twist of nonvegetarian foods involved might help. Include non-veg like two pieces of chicken with cabbage or other leafy vegetables and make a salad add olive oil and have it thrice a week. You can follow the same paleo diet the other days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is it bad if my heart rate jumps up to very high bpm very quickly during even moderate exercises? I am a 26-year-old male. My height is 5' 11\\" and weighs about 190 lbs who has always been in good shape. I lift every day and usually during the summers, I run about two miles a day at around a six minutes pace. I have a resting heart rate of 58 bpm and no matter what I do my heart rate always jumps up during even the most minor activity. Two days ago, I went for a 20 minutes leisure walk with my wife and my heart rate averaged 120 bpm and got there in about 10 seconds. If I run at a pace any faster than 9 minutes a mile, my heart rate will jump to above 185 bpm in under 30 seconds and at my fastest, it stays around 200 bpm for as many miles as I run. Now, it has been like this for as long as I can remember and I never feel extra winded or take long to recover I just know it is not normal. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. The problem you are having is called palpitations. Your baseline heart rate is 58 beats/minute and your maximum heart rate is around 200 beats per minute that is almost three times the baseline heart rate. Heart rate as high as 200 beats per minute can even lead to sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrest. This should be taken very seriously and some of the baseline tests of cardiology are to be done to rule out the cause. 24-hour Holter monitoring is most important for you as it will record the nature of your palpitations, whether they are arrhythmia or just simple supraventricular tachycardia. 2D echo and treadmill test to rule out cardiac functions as your arrhythmia is precipitated only during exercise."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, From my late teens to now (I am thirty), I started becoming very insecure about my face, especially my side profile.

My upper back has been hurting. It feels like it starts from the middle up to the upper back. It is not a sharp pain, but it is like a tension. We are supposed to wear steel toe shoes. I just recently changed to tennis shoes since I work nights. I want to see if it is the shoes or long hours. Can you advise as to what it could be? I feel stressed out and I am very prone to it. The tension just does not go away at all.","Doctor":"Hi.  I have reviewed your question. I am sorry you are experiencing upper back pain. In your question, you said you recently started working 12 hours shift and since then, your upper back has been hurting. It is not a sharp pain but feels like tension.  Most likely, you experience muscle fatigue and at some times, muscle spasms. I would like to know what your job entails.  Many police officers have upper and middle back pain and have something call upper cross syndrome. This is were the pectoral muscle are tight and pull the shoulders forward while the muscles of the back are weak. It is a stabilization problem usually attributed to wearing the heavy vest all day. Same thing in your case. Many students who study with their head down all day or text a lot experience similar pain in their upper and middle back. If you were my patient, I would perform a chiropractic examination and recommend several home exercises as well as chiropractic adjustments. Since I am unable to confirm my suspicion, I recommend that you go see a local chiropractor for a proper examination. If they believe you are a candidate for chiropractic care, they will most likely recommend a trial of care as well as a series of home exercises to determine how you will respond to treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with a left branch bundle block a few years back. I have been under the care of a cardiologist to make sure my heart is fine since then. I have done stress echos yearly or every two years since and have been told my heart is otherwise fine. I just had to switch the other doctor because of insurance and my new doctor says old stress echos are irrelevant, that only chemical or nuclear echos work in patients with lbbb. Is this true? I have a strong family history of heart disease, my father survived two heart attacks, mother survived double bypass and my maternal uncle died from a heart attack, all were smokers with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am a former smoker. I am a 43-year-old female. I have been exercising six days per week for over 20 years. My cholesterol is high 213 but HDL is 140 and triglycerides are low. I am a little put off by a nuclear stress echo and would prefer the regular exercise. But I want to know what this new doctor says is true? Then I guess I will have to go nuclear. I am currently taking Spironolactone 100 mg for acne, Omeprazole, and multivitamins. I just had an ultrasound of heart and EKG past monday. Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com  Treadmill test is not very informative in case of lbbb patient, however, stress echo either exercise or nuclear is valid. Stress thallium is the best test to be done in you. I guess you did not have any symptoms like chest pain or heaviness during stress test and if so it will still suggest the absence of significant heart disease.  In my opinion, there is not much difference between exercise echo and chemical stress echo and not invalid, but nuclear scans like stress thallium is certainly a better test. I would advise for a nuclear scan as it would be more informative. Anyhow, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have a low salt diet and monitor your blood pressure regularly. Do regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and fish once or twice a week. Avoid meat, smoking, and alcohol if any. There should not be any abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

I am so scared about having this done as I panic when a lot of people get around me. I was in a serious car several years ago and it took for the medical personnel an hour to get me out.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. As far as anesthesia is concerned in your case, the eyelid surgery may be done under general anesthesia which does require securing your airway safely. Prior to securing the airway, you will be given injectable medications to make you fall asleep so that you do not remember and also you are not aware of the procedure when it is being done. So I would suggest you not to worry. As general anesthesia is a safe procedure when given by an experienced anesthetist. Now let me tell you about either of two tubes that may be used for the procedure are laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and endotracheal tube. LMA has advantages over endotracheal tube of less postoperative sore throat and lesser intraoperative rise in blood pressure and heart rate. This insertion and removal of airway tubes are safely done while you are unconscious so you are not aware of the procedure. So please do not worry. General anesthesia is given meticulously nowadays and patient safety is a primary concern."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a woman, 23. I am 5'2\\" 137 pds. I am currently taking Cetirizine.

Although, when it gets really cold, I cough phlegm and other times a dry cough. I would like to have a second opinion on what I should do because I am tired of coughing.","Doctor":"Hello. In addition to Cetirizine you need to take a bronchodilator medicine that will help bring out the phlegm better. Salbutamol (Albuterol) is an excellent drug that helps widen the small airway passages and bring out the mucus. It is available in the form of inhalers. Take 2 puffs thrice daily and gradually taper over a period of 2 weeks. Whenever the climate changes or you start coughing start on the inhaler. Second, when there is excessive mucus, in addition to the inhaler take ambroxol hydrochloride medicine also. It is available in syrup and tablet formulations. You require 30 mg. If the phlegm is green in color and tastes bad, you may require a short course of antibiotic. It is also advisable you wear masks when you go outside, avoid cold air in the mornings and late evenings, take plenty of warm fluids (adequate hydration), use a multivitamin temporarily, have healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruits. Taking garlic is helpful as it is known to have ingredients that help relieve asthma and associated bronchoconstriction."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30 years old, male. No smoker.

Firstly, likelihood of any malignant cancer is less likely because you do not have risk factors, no symptoms, young age and CTurogram in normal. Within three months period cancer would have increased in size and became detectable. So you are probably having some benign cause and most probably some arteriovenous malformations, venous lesions or small mucosal bleeds, calcium and uric acid in urine. Next step is your 24 hour urinary calcium and uric acid levels, and also urethroscopy and cystoscopy which will complete the evaluation and usually yields the diagnosis in most cases.

I visited a nearby Andrology specialist, he did some tests and found that below values. He stated that LH is very high. Is there any relation of sperm count and ED when we have high value of LH. Is it curable? My LH value is 8.6. Please help me, I am planning for a kid.","Doctor":"Hi. ED can have many causes. One of them is low testosterone. Whenever the testosterone levels are low, our pituitary gland tries to stimulate testosterone production by producing more LH. I saw your test reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Testosterone levels are just below normal and LH levels are just above normal reference ranges. This might be due to diurnal variation. Normally testosterone levels peak during day time around 10 AM. This is called circadian rhythm. It is important to consider this while evaluating borderline variations. Low testerone can lead to reduced sperm counts. Since you are also planning for a child, do get a semen analysis done after 3 days of sexual abstinence. Repeat testosterone and LH levels at morning between 9-11 AM before deciding on treatment.

Weakness of gums and bone creates more gaps which attract food deposits. These deposits irritate the gums constantly leading to gum and bone infection. This condition is called Periodontitis. Pain, swelling, and spaces between the teeth getting wider are the signs of periodontitis. Once those gums and bone get infected, those teeth will start to shake and become loose in no time. Please visit your nearby dentist and get a scaling and polishing procedure done to remove those calculus deposits. This cleaning procedure should be done once in six to eight months if required, for maintaining healthy gums. And please do try and quit the habit because more than the calculus, your teeth picking habit causes major damage to your gums and teeth. It may even cause multiple teeth decays. To start with, you can try discarding toothpicks and sharp objects from your sight to stop this habit. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My partner and I have not had sex for quite a few weeks. I have talked to him about it around three times and each time he tells me that he wants sex and wants to have more of it and that he will try to push away the thoughts of the stress he is going through that keep him from getting an erection. I can understand but why he cannot? I have needs too. I am currently taking Mono-Linyah.","Doctor":"Hello. Libido can be decreased if a person is undergoing stress and can affect sexual performance. I would recommend that he should either visit a psychiatrist and take some medicines if his stress is affecting his personal, social, and occupational life. The doctor will place him on some medicines which should help with the stress part. In addition to that, you can give him some medicines like Sildenafil 50 mg or Tadalafil 10 mg to take one hour prior to having sex, provided his blood pressure is fine. This will help him achieve an erection. Stress. Erectile dysfunction secondary to anxiety or stress. Tadalafil 10 mg or Sildenafil 50 mg one hour prior to sex upto a maximum of twice a week. Discontinue in case of headache, chest pain, or dizziness. Also do an internet search and start doing Kegel's exercises which will help improve the muscles at the base of the penis and improve the strength of the erection. Can follow up after one month if needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My partner missed her period. We have done home pregnancy tests which showed negative. She does not have any pregnancy symptoms either. What may be the reason of her missed period?","Doctor":"Hello.

Does she have any medical illness like fever in last week? Any stress? Any thyroid problem? Any mild bleeding per vaginum? So kindly answer above questions so that I can help you more."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently fell off a roof. After ER visit w/ct scans and X-rays I received 7 staples in my head and was discharged. Prescribed Cephalexin and Percocet I went home for recovery. Two days ago while coughing I felt an excruciating pain what seemed to be under and behind my lowest rib on my right side. This pain continued only when I strain myself such as with a cough or sneeze, etc. Since beginning this pain has gotten more intense with each involuntary strain.","Doctor":"Hello. Have you undergone any chest X-ray? While coughing is there any sputum? Have you feeling any pain in the abdomen? Is there any blood in urine? Did you land on head or abdomen during fall? If possible, answer above questions please."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 9 years old. He is 4 feet and 11 inches and weighs about 107 lbs. I checked his BMI, it said he was obese in the 95th percentile. He is active. Should I worry about his weight? And if so, how can I help him with it?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Your son has good height and for the same reason, his weight is not worrisome. But definitely he is on 95th centile for his height as well as for his age. Also, his BMI (body mass index) is 22.4 which puts him in the category of obese.   Let him have a lot of outdoor activity, avoid sitting for a long time in front of the computer or tv, and avoid junk foods. Swimming is the best activity for this age and swimming for at least 30-45 minutes daily or at least five days a week will help him. Let him have a good balanced home food with less fat.  Child Obesity at this age has higher chances for him to be obese as an adult with all its other consequences. So it is better to have some precautions but no need for a dieting regime at this age as he is a growing boy and needs more calories from proteins for his overall growth.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?
