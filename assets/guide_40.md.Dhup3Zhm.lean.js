Some one recomended me using Elovera to make the face moisturized. Appreciate your thoughts on this. Regards, Mukesh","Doctor":"Hi! Thank you for your question.

Has anyone previous in your family experienced any kind of eczema or psoriasis?if you have nothing of the symptoms that I mentioned above there is absolutely no need to worry, it will fade on it\`s own.Meanwhile you can take an emollient agent, such as Excipial and a Hidrocortisone 0.1% twice daily for 1-2 weeks, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.I hope this helps.

Now I c my skin have craked all over,& lightly started peeling. What all changes can I notice further & when should I do next peel to get rid of cracked skin? Thank you","Doctor":"Thank you for your question!It is normal to have a recovery/downtime after a chemical peel which depends on the aggressiveness of the peel. Usually superficial to medium depth peels can take anywhere from 4-10 days to resolve, and after that you will notice that your concerned area will bee smoother and lighter. In order to get rid of the cracked skin faster it is very important that you wash your skin with a soothing agent and use a good moisturiser soon after, that probably you doctor or your aestetician has told you. During this time it is a \`\`must\`\` that you wear a sunscreen at least SPF 20, if your legs with be exposed to sun, so that you don\`t risk to get more hyperpigmentation.You can do the next peel after 3 weeks-1 month from your previous peel. For best results a series of 6-8 peels are needed always depending on the chemical peel and the results of the patients.

So I suggest you do an examination for fungi or bacteria if you also see other lesions on your hands.I would reccommend washing your hands not very often which means twice or 3 times per day with a mild solution designed for atopic skin or o soap with emollients such as Avene cold cream bar soap, Exipial or Eucerin 2-3 times a day. If the situation is complicated you should talk to your physician for a prescription of Hydrocortisone cream 0,1% 2 times a day for 2 weeks.I hope this helps.

I am hopefully going to the emerge tomorrow as this has been ongoing for a week now.","Doctor":"HI. Welcome to HCMFrom your description and the location of the rashes, you seem to have seborrheic dermatitis, affecting the oily areas of your body, similar to dandruff on the scalp. Even if you do not generally have dandruff, oiliness of scalp and hair could have caused the rashes on back and chest. Change in climate, sweating, certain hair products etc, can aggravate the problem.Dry skin and rashes on the arms, elbows etc can indicate an eczema or allergic nature, often seen along with seborrheic dermatitis.For your hair try using an antidandruff ketoconazole shampoo twice a week and a similar soap for the body which will reduce the problem. Do not apply oil, gels etc for long periods of time. As for rashes on your arms and severe rashes on your body use a steroid cream lightly,like mometasone for 7-10 days. Always keep your skin moisturized immediately after bath or shower with a good lotion like cetaphil, or nivea. Your skin type is prone to dryness and allergies, so keep it free from harsh chemicals, fragrances. Use mild glycerin or syndet based soap bar for bath over these areas.Start with these treatment for a week or so. If you notice no change, or increase in rashes be sure to consult a dermatologist and get a confirmed diagnosis. they can also rule out fungal infections, or do tests required to check for specific allergies, etc.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hey ok so on my life hand my middle finger on the right side of the nail i have really rough skin and it wont go away i have used wart removale but it didnt work and now it has spred to another finger on my right hand so could tell me what the problem might be? is it a wart or dry skin what needs specail medication?","Doctor":"Hi, This is easily treated.

As you have suffered from angular cheilitis previously and feel like it happening again, it might as well be start of angular cheilitis.To stop it from developing further and heal the skin area, you should start with multivitamin supplements containing Vitamin B12 such as B-Folcin once a day for a month at least. In addition, to keep the area moist, you should apply oil or vaseline frequently over the area. If it does not stop from progressing further or does not heal in a month, I would advise that you consult a dentist for clinical examination of the area and further treatment.I hope this information helps you.

When I rub my tongue on my bottom lip there seems to be a like a rough kinda sandpaper feeling on the inside of my lip . It has become a habit to constantly bite or chew at it. I asked a dentist about it a month ago and they said try not to bite it. I went maybe a day without biting and the patch just felt drier and more flaky .this has also developed on my upper lip but not as bad. This is just really bothersome and I want my inside of my lip yo feel normal like the inside of my cheek","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Your problem seems to be due to constant biting on the inside of the lips. Mucosa or skin inside the lips is very thin and fragile. When you constantly keep biting on it, the skin forms fibrosis making skin harder and rough. When you stop biting, the harder skin peels off giving way to the underneath softer skin. Thus, the solution to your problem is to stop biting the lips. If you find that you are unable to quit the habit, go to the dentist and ask him/her to make a bite guard for you. With wearing bite guard, you will not be able to bit on the lips.Once you will stop biting, the old mucosa will peel off and new mucosa will be like the skin as that of inside the cheeks. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. Take care.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"I am 12 years of age.

Along with that, in long standing conditions it can also cause a mild swelling and puffiness of skin over a period of time. 7-8 days swelling maybe too short to be caused by thyroid disorder and could be due to an allergic/irritant reaction.

This predisposes to a rough skin that is easily prone for irritation from external sources.  The more you scratch, the itch continues due to irritation of nerves in the dry skin. When itching goes severe, it incites a reaction in your skin resulting redness and swelling. This is medical terms is called dermatitis. So it is important to treat the dry skin which is the root cause of all the problems you are having. If you were my patient, I would prescribe a course of antibiotics and topical steroids depending on the severity of present dermatitis.

There is no permanent cure for genetic ichthyosis.Treatment includes topical urea, lactic acid, salicylic acid based moisturizers.Oral treatment is with Oral retinoids e.g acitretin for thick keratotic involvement of skin.There is a lot of research particularly gene based research  that is going on  and it may be possible in future to correct the genetic defect responsible in ichthyosis.regards"},{"Patient":"I have circular dry patches on my legs.

Thank you for writing to usSkin under the eye is sensitive/ delicate and can easily become dry/ irritated to cosmetics that one may be using.Soaps and face washes that are too harsh and drying can also lead to this presentation, specially in those who have inherently dry skin.You may use a bland moisturizer e.g light liquid paraffin and white soft paraffin for face.Specifically for the patch of skin under eye I would suggest you to use an OTC topical steroid e.g cortisone cream, twice daily for 3-5 days.Avoid soaps.

Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also do a AMH level.  A semen analysis of your husband should be done.  If anything is abnormal, you can take treatment for that. Also you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  If it doesn't work then you can go for IUI.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  Hope I have answered your question.

Psoriasis and discoid dermatitis are the most likely possibilities.Psoriatic involvement commonly presents as scaly, red patches on shins.Other body sites like scalp, elbows may also be involved with similar patches in psoriasis and are a clue to diagnosis.Discoid eczema/ dermatitis can also present as an itchy, scaly coin sized patches on legs, more common in those who have underlying dry skin and atopic diathesis.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a moisturizer twice daily.A potent topical steroid e.g clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream Or halobetasol propionate 0.05% cream can be used specifically for the patches, over and above the moisturizer.These are prescription steroids therefore I suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as for the needful.An OTC oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once daily will provide you symptomatic relief from itching.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello I have a lot of lines on my palms.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicI will have to keep a few possibilities because it difficult to know what exactly it is without visualizing the skin lesion.Dry scaly patch on upper lip could be either Pityriasis alba Or else it could be Tinea faciei/ fungal infection.A KOH wet preparation made from a small amount of scale scraped from the surface of patch can be visualized under the microscope for fungal elements.If KOH is positive, one of the topical antifungal agents e.g sertaconazole, bifonazole, luliconazole etc may be chosen and used twice daily for 2-4 weeks.Most likely KOH would turn up as negative and would then be suggestive of Pityriasis alba.Pityriasis alba is nothing but a dry scaly patch of skin which is light in color as compared to surrounding skin due to post-inflammatory hypopigmentation.Treatment of P. alba is treatment of underlying dryness with a moisturizer, twice daily.Specifically for the dry, scaly patch you may use an OTC topical steroid e.g cortisone cream, twice daily, over and above the moisturizer.Use a gentle cleanser for face wash, twice daily and avoid soaps etc.Regards"},{"Patient":"Assalam O Alikum   I have a disease prurio simplex from 6-7 month and my skin is very dry...

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicDandruff or seborrheic dermatitis is quite common and is a common cause of scalp itching.Since dandruff is bound to recur, therefore rather than using a regular shampoo, you should use an antidandruff shampoo to keep dandruff under check.My choice for an antidandruff shampoo is 2% ketoconazole shampoo, thrice weekly OR even daily, for 2-4 weeks.Nizoral is a ketoconazole based shampoo and is available OTC. It is marketed by Johnson & Johnson.However sometimes a shampoo alone is insufficient in taking complete control of dandruff.In such a case dermatologists may choose to prescribe a topical steroid lotion (Mometasone lotion 0.1%), to be applied once daily at night, at the scalp skin for 2 weeks.Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive condition.Topical steroid lotion is a prescription product and a dermatologist would normally prescribe it for difficult to treat dandruff.The topical steroid lotion may be stopped once the dandruff is well controlled and thereafter the improvement can be sustained with just an anti-dandruff lotion/shampoo, twice weekly.You may try the shampoo first, it that seems insufficient you may visit a dermatologist in your region for the needful.Hope this information helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... below my penile side my both sides of skin becomes dry and become very senstive i apply itch card the itching cream but it is not working its become very senstive and my skin colour change into red and black kindly tell me what is the problem","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicMost likely it is a fungal infection; fungal infections are common at sites such as groin folds because the fungus gets a chance to proliferate in the moist, humid conditions that prevail in the folds, specially in hot and humid weather conditions like tropical countries.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical cream containing antifungals like either Sertaconazole Or Luliconazole Or Bifonazole, twice daily for 4-6 weeks.I normally also ask my patients to take an oral antifungal because the condition may not respond adequately to just topical antifungal creams. Oral antifungals like Fluconazole, Itraconazole are faster acting and therefore rapidly effective in this condition.An OTC oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once daily will provide you symptomatic relief from itching.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription.Regards"},{"Patient":"Dear Ask The Doctor: I had surgery on a hiatal hernia about 3 years ago and have Crohns Disease. I am thinking about doing invitro fertilization as a result of unrelated issues regarding my husbands sperm. My question is if you think that I will have a harder pregnancy than a woman without these problems. I did get the hernia fixed but I do feel pain there if pressure is put on it and I get a lot of gas pressure and pain that settles in there. I also have very painful periods. When it is my time of the month I am usually very sick, sometimes even limited to laying in my bed as a result of Crohns flair-ups and gas buildup making me sick.

Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also a semen analysis of your husband should be done.  You can also do a HSG to see the tubes patency.If everything is fine, you can try naturally for 6 months.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  If it doesn't work then you can go for some medicines for growth of your follicles.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicThe white patches are most likely due to pityriasis alba. The patches are common on dry skin. They can be somewhat scaly as well, thus giving a rough appearance to the skin.Pityriasis alba patches are light colored (lighter than the surrounding skin); the light color being actually due to post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. I usually recommend a good moisturizer, twice daily. You may use an OTC moisturising lotion like Vaseline, once or twice daily depending on the severity of dryness.For the patches you may also use an OTC topical steroid e.g 1% Hydrocortisone twice daily for the patches, over and above the moisturizer. That should help fade away the patches in 2-3 weeks.Tanning could be the reason behind your dark complexion. Stay away from sun during peak hours (i.e 10AM to 3 PM).Use a broad spectrum sunscreen whenever outdoors. Reapply every 2-3 hours.At night you may use a kojic acid based cream to gradually fade away the tan.These are prescription products and I suggest you to visit a dermatologist in your vicinity for more details and the needful.

Investigations may be done to rule out internal disease.Antihistaminic like levocetirizine may be taken. If needed,steroids in tappering doses may be taken. Moisturising cream and mild steroid cream may be applied.Avoid soap bath. You may use dettol for bath.

Oiling your scalp worsens dandruff. Dandruff is caused by a yeast like fungus which grows well using the oil in the skin secretions. Oiling your scalp will further promote its growth. You could apply oil only before bathing and wash it off completely with a shampoo.The small pimples which you have described are called as folliculitis. It is an infection of the hair follicles which also could be due to excessive oiling.Use an antibiotic cream with 2 % mupirocin twice a day for 5 days.If this also does not help, you could consider a course of oral antifungal called itraconazole.

In commonly seen condition of the patients it is not bothersome and self resolving condition which most of the times gets better by itself.

It moisturizes the skin and causes retention of water to maintain the skin texture on the better of the side.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicThese patches could either be Discoid dermatitis Or Fungal Infection/Tinea.The distribution of the patches however goes more in favor of Discoid dermatitis rather than fungal infection.Outer thighs are a relatively common site for these patches because this area is dry; Tinea is common in the inner thigh area.A KOH examination would prove to be conclusive in that regard. Topical OTC antifungals e.g clotrimazole 1% cream may be tried if KOH is positive for fungal elements.On the other hand if it is negative for fungal elements treatment would eb along lines of discoid dermatitis.Since underlying dryness is the predisposing factor in Discoid dermatitis, therefore I would suggest an OTC intensive moisturizer over the whole affected area.Specifically for the patches, I would suggest a topical potent steroid cream e.g clobetasol propionate cream, twice daily for 2-4 weeks.Topical steroids are prescription products.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicThe dryness/scaling and redness involving the skin of nasal folds is nothing but most likely seborrheic dermatitis involving the face.Seborrheic dermatitis is an inflammatory condition of the skin which classically involves areas rich in sebaceous glands like scalp, face (eyebrows, glabella, nasolabial folds, chin etc) and chest/pre-sternal area.Itching is usually a symptom.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to apply a mild to moderately potent topical steroid e.g desonide 0.05%, twice daily for a few days.Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive condition and steroids bring immense improvement in this condition.Since seborrheic dematitis can recur therefore it is important to be on a maintenance regime to sustain the improvement achieved with topical steroid.Topical immunomodulators such as tacrolimus Or pimecrolimus are effective in maintaining the improvement achieved with topical steroids. This is all the more important because steroids cannot be used on face for ever I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis.

Also, any wash prescribed by both the doctor and the dermatologist gave me no relief at all (I actually felt them make my skin burn more). I have also used a very weak permanganate solution as a wash but that didn’t offer me any relief and using water on its own seemed / felt better. Currently, the skin in my anal region is dry, pinkish/reddish and is constantly burning. I have been constantly suffering immensely for 2 months now and I would like to know if you can recommend some other form of treatment as anything that has been prescribed to date has either not worked at all or made the condition worse. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicJudging from the history and the treatments tried, which seems to benefit the condition only temporarily; I would keep a possibility of \\"Intertrigo\\", which is inflammation of the body folds (red and sore folds).Closely opposing body folds can trap moisture and therefore make the area prone to Inflammation from rubbing against each other.Candidal infection may superimpose (Candidal Intertrigo) thus exacerbating the inflammation (redness and soreness) and itching.Clinically intertrigo Or candidal intertrigo presents as red, moist, scaly patches of skin on closely opposed body folds.If I was the treating doctor I would have started you on oral antifungals e.g Oral Fluconazole, in addition to the topical (antifungals+steroids) creams that you have been using already.Oral antifungals are faster acting and much better in controlling candidal superinfection. Oral antifungals are prescription drugs.Once the condition improves significantly (usually within 2-4 weeks), what I do in my patients of Intertrigo is, I then ask them to use an antifungal dusting powder e.g clotrimazole dusting powder in the folds, twice daily, for maintenance of improvement.An antifungal dusting powder not only keep the area dry but also inhibits the growth of fungus/yeast thus preventing recurrence/exacerbation of Intertrigo.It would be better if you present yourself for examination to a dermatologist. Your dermatologist would tell you more about this condition and prescribe accordingly.Hope this helpsTake care"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Samuel,I just got back from vacation a few weeks ago in Haiti. (had a wonderful time by the way) but now my skin is peeling like crazy. It started on my legs now my arms are peeling also. I don t have any blisters or itch, just dry flaky skin. Could this be a form of sunburnThank you","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicI will keep a possibility of post-inflammatory desquamation; most likely it is happening because you might have got a mild sunburn during your recent vacation, which is now resolving and the dead skin is now peeling off.I would suggest you to use a moisturizing cream twice daily for a few days. That should take care of the flaking/chaffing. Since prolonged sun exposure, specially during a beach holiday, can cause the skin to burn and subsequently de-squamate, therefore, it is always better to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day and reapply every 2-3 hours, specially on a beach vacation.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, how can I get rid of hard thickened skin just below my knees.  it does not itch and is not really discoloured and is only slightly rough to the touch.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicMost likely it is a fungal infection. Fungal infection are common at sites of body folds like upper inner thighs, axilla, submammary folds etc. Chaffing/scaling is a feature of fungal infections. Itching is usually a feature too but it is subjective in individuals.Being overweight adds to the possibility of fungal infection.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal cream. Clotrimazole 1% cream is available OTC and you may use this for 4-6 weeks.Oral antifungals e.g fluconazole are more effective in controlling the symptoms and are usually prescribed once a week for 4-6 weeks. However, oral antifungals are prescription drugs.An OTC oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once daily would provide you symptomatic relief from itching.Once the condition resolves, you may use an antifungal dusting powder in the groin folds regularly, twice daily.Antifungal dusting powder would not only keep the folds dry but also be inhibitory to fungal growth, thereby preventing recurrence.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi i have dry itchy flaky skin on the back of my neck just below my hair line and that area has a dark tint to it. i that it was just dry skin because i use hot water when i shower and because of the cold weather.

The fact that you always need to be induced to get a period makes me think that you are probably not ovulating naturally. A proper clinical evaluation is needed before initiating medication, more so, as you developed ovarian hyperstimulation with induction. Also, it is important to stay with one doctor whom you find comfortable. Else, your treatment gets haphazard. Metformin is often used before trying induction to see if natural ovulation is possible thus avoiding unnecessary OHSS. You are overweight and need to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Taking progesterone in the latter half of the cycle in micronized form is safe. A maximum of six cycles with proper monitoring is given for induction of ovulation. Gonadotropin or hCG is the medication given to facilitate ovulation. Follicles in different stages of maturity can be seen but cannot be differentiated if they are from a previous cycle.

When I get it, it s bumpy, inflamed, and weeping but the last time I went to the doctor for this (two years ago) I was prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide cream (0.1%). I mention this because the cream helps me with my current problem. Now I m having issues with my right ring finger. The skin is red, dry and cracked and will bleed if I don t put the Tri cream on it with a band-aid sealing it off. The cream, when used on my face, usually makes the eczema disappear in two days if I catch it right away and apply it twice a day (in the morning and before I go to bed). I ve used the cream on my finger because I thought it was another type of eczema, but the cream doesn t heal it completely. It heals the damage and makes it so the worst of it is gone and there s no more completely cracked and bleeding skin, but if I stop applying it it becomes dry and cracked again. I used the cream in tandem with Cetaphil (also recommended by my doctor for the eczema) for nearly two weeks, twice a day, and it looked as though it had healed completely, but after a day or two the problem came back with the same intensity as before. Is this eczema? Should I keep trying the Tri cream and Cetaphil? Do I need a higher dosage of the cream (0.5% instead of 0.1%)?","Doctor":"hi...most likely you have got Hand eczema.You should apply betamethasone 0.05% ointment on your affected area...twice a day..for around 15 to 20 days..then gradually taper by applying once at night for 10 days...gradually decreasing   frequency...until u just apply on weekends or when it flares up....also most important that u keep your skin hydrated,by applying petroleum jelly,,3 to 4 times a day..you should be careful about using detergents,paints,antiseptic soaps,gardening....as these are important factors in flaring eczema...Take care.Happy to help."},{"Patient":"im an 18 year old femal & i have this huge pink dry area on my upper and lower lips. ive had them for about a year now. & it seems that they have some sort of small cute in the center. ive been trying everything from different chaptsticks to polysporin. but nothing makes it go away. it will sometimes get really light and you cant notice it, but i can still feel it. & at night while i sleep, it gets extremely dry and develops some sort of crust on it where i have to wake up during all hours and use water to get rid of it. i want my normal skin back. & this, whatever it is has become unbearable. pleeeeeaaaassseeee help meee :(","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMIn my opinion the lesion that you have on lips can be treated with Mometasone cream, if this does not vanish then just live it like that and watch for any changes, if you found something abnormal then this need to be clinically examined, else this would come around, take care."},{"Patient":"I noticed a red dry spot located on my left hand.

I went to a walkin clinic and the doctor didn't know so he just gave me a few samples of cream to put on once a day. It doesn't seem to be working, any suggestions?","Doctor":"A scar is the body's response to an incision or laceration in which a collagen matrix is laid down to close or fill in the gap created by the injury.  \\"Scar Tissue\\" is histologically different from normal skin because it will generally not have sweat glands, hair follicles, sebaceous glands etc (adnexal structures).  Therefore, a thin scar after incisional surgery is desirable because scar tissue looks different to the naked eye than normal, untouched skin.  Safe, well performed skin resurfacing should not produce what we define as \\"Scar Tissue\\".  Medium to Deep skin resurfacing, as is performed in laser skin resurfacing, chemical peels, or Dermabrasion removes the epidermis and a variable amount of dermis, allowing the surface of the skin to regenerate from adnexal structures. However, the skin that is regenerated still has the important and desirable adnexal structures, differentiating it from scar.  The neo-dermis has thicker and more tightly bound collagen bundles, causing effacement of lines and wrinkles, but still looks like normal skin to the naked eye.try massage with olive oil."},{"Patient":"Hi i am charel,Me and my bf had sex once.

Moreover since the itching and vaginal discharge has subsided on treatment given for yeast infection, however, the cuts and pain has persisted, which goes in favor of another possibility other than that of yeast infection, i.e herpes genitalis.I would suggest that you seek another appointment with your gynecologist or a dermatologist, regarding confirmation of diagnosis.Herpes usually presents as discrete, well defined, erosions/cuts with pain and burning sensation.Treatment of a confirmed herpes infection is by oral antivirals like acyclovir or famciclovir or valacyclovir.Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"hiya doctor; 19 years male; i am having an extreme dandruff problem in my hair; i have scaly patches in my hair;the dandruff problems only occur if i havent showered with a shampoo within 3 daysontop of that i am wanting to grow my hair long; i went to a doctor and got consulted with a cream called sebco it was to treat stuff like seboheirc dermatitis; but that makes it worser; is there any type of medication that can be used every day; or should i stick to a normal 2 day shower routine as now; anther thing is can i still grow my hair long; my doctor said that longer hair is more prone to itchiness and dryness; help im confused","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for posting on HCM.It seems you are suffering from Seborrheic dermatitis,which secondarily leads to hairfall and thus its important to treat it first hand.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. First of all do not panic. As you have history of irregular cycles, please get USG done to rule out PCOS - polycystic ovaries.  As you might be aware that PCOS is a lifestyle disorder, and it can be corrected by following a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Secondly, please get your boyfriend's semen analysis done to know about the quality and quantity of sperms.  I will suggest you to get post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography done, to know bout tubal patency. With these reports in normal range, you can get ovulation study on USG done from day 10 of the cycle. This will help you to know about the day of ovulation. You can simply opt for unprotected sex on and around the day of ovulation. or else you can opt for IUI - intrauterine insemination, on the day of ovulation. This will help to get pregnant.

Dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis is an important cause of scalp itching and increased hair shedding. Dandruff is bound to recur again, therefore people with dandruff should use an antidandruff shampoo to keep the dandruff under check, rather than using a regular shampoo.If I was your treating doctor I would have asked you to use an antidandruff lotion/shampoo. My choice is 2% ketoconazole shampoo, thrice weekly for 2-4 weeks followed by once or twice weekly for maintenance. It is available OTC as Nizral 2% solution.However sometimes a shampoo alone seems insufficient. In such a case one should always see a dermatologist to rule out scalp psoriasis as it can present as resistant dandruff. Your dermatologist might choose to prescribe a coal tar+salicylic acid based shampoo for resistant/persistent dandruff. Your dermatologist might also prescribe you a topical steroid lotion(clobetasol or mometasone lotion), to be applied twice daily for 2 weeks.The topical steroid lotion can be stopped once the dandruff is well controlled and thereafter the improvement can be sustained with just an anti-dandruff lotion/shampoo.regards"},{"Patient":"Hi I have small white patches on my inner thigh and it itches when I walk..my legs are necessarily rubbing together though.....when I scratch it becomes flakey when im sitting iot sort of itches but not as much when I walk im a small girl about 128lbs","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicI would keep a possibility of fungal infection.

Etaze AF cream contains topical terbinafine+mometasone. I would rather prefer a plain antifungal like clotrimazole/sertaconazole/luliconazole because mometasone if used for too long can cause side effects like skin atrophy and striaeSince you are already using an Oral antifungal e.g oral terbinafine once daily.

It was just a spot treatment only and not applied on my entire face. I was told to use elovera cream at night to moisturize my dry skin brought about by the peel. I just noticed that after over a week of use, my skin is still dry, itchy and pores are dilated. Is this possibly due to elovera cream? Im also using tea tree soap but i started with it for over a month already. So my regimen is as follow:Morning - wash face with tee tree soapEvening - was face with tee tree soap and apply elovera cream after 40 mins Should i discontinue using elovera cream?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to us.Salicylic peels can cause dry irritated skin for few days after peels. Elovera cream is a very mild cream and as such does not lead to irritation of skin. Open pores are basically diated openings of oil glands. Peels or elovera cream cannot cause open pores. People with pimple prone skin usually have open pores due to excess sebum or oil production and continoues inflammation of the gland.Though tea tree oil is good for acne prone skin but after peels it has the potential to irritate skin further that is why after peels we advise mild face cleansers and moisturisers.Right now I would advise you to stop tea tree face wash as well as elovera cream for few days. USe a mild steroid cream like desonide cream(eumosone,atonide or desowen etc) twice in a day for few days. The irrtiation and dryness should settle in few days. Once it settles, you may reintroduce your face wash. As you have acne prone skin, do not use creams rather use lotions as it would be more suitable to your skin type.Hope that helped.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi!

The itch can last for hours, it lasts longer if i can not resist scratching or massaging it. The palm can swell up and causes numbness of the fingers, especially at night.

Besides antihistamines, you may use systemic corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, montelukast, chloroquine, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and omalizumab.Consult a dermatologist or allergist for evaluation for other causes of urticaria.I hope you might be satisfied with my answer.Regards.Dr. Ilyas Patel MD"},{"Patient":"Hi.

What you are suffering from is quite common condition in people with sensitive skin condition which some times behaves both as dry skin and oily at places.The very first thing you should do is avoiding direct sunlight exposure to the skin. Even if you are avoiding the same then also there is exposure of UV radiations from computers and other artificial light sources, so should also take care of the same. the best avoidance is never at all by sunscreen but is by personal protection by clothes and umbrellas.Contact with Cell phone on facial skin (because of radiation and heat )also make the skin sensitive.Secondly you should start up your day drinking water and make it a routine to drink more than 10-15 glasses of liquids/day.Start eating a lot of Vitamin C and A containing fruits ( all yellow and sour fruits will do).Avoid waking till late night, take good sleep of 8-9 hours.Finally what you are using is fine, the only thing is don't rub your face wash excessively and  more than 3 times a day. Use your moisturizing cream immediately after washing your face when it is still wet in minimum possible amount otherwise it will lead to eruptions on the face in this summer season. Your sunscreen is fine. Try to avoid touching your face bare minimum as give dark patches because of irritation and avoid stress.By following above things slowly your skin will follow a normal course in few weeks of time.Best of luck for your marriage.With best regards,Dr Sanjay Kanodia"},{"Patient":"Hi.

I also had a red rash on penis/ and can be slightly flakey which i had seen my local GP about and was given cream for both issues but the cream given for my eyes didnt help! DO you have any suggestions at all? And can both problems be down to same thing?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health care Magic What was the diagnosis of the penile and eye rash and what was the cream given? It is unlikely that both rash is the same. Dry itchy skin around eye could be a contact dermatitis. Skin around the eyes are very sensitive. Have you started using any new face washes or cosmetics? skin around eyes are also prone for air borne contact allergies. Air borne allergens like pollens, cement, dust etc can cause the rash. It is better to consult a dermatologist as you don't seem to improve with the creams prescribed by GP. Keep washing your face regularly and frequent application of moisturiser after wash will help. Hope this helped Take care"},{"Patient":"My stomachgets very dry im wondering what causes this no im not pregnant and i have tryed four diffrent body washes and nothing has changed and i did not change my body wash to something diffrent when it started it started in about the middle of my regular bodywash. I dont belive it being the body wash as that is the only really dry area on my body","Doctor":"hi, you seem to have developed excessive dryness of skin over the stomach region. Well in case you dont have any associated itching or redness over the same area, then you need not worry...But if there is any redness or itching ,then it can be a sign of a fungal infection or any eczematous condition. In that case you will have to consult a skin specialist for proper assessment and diagnosis....But if there is no associated complaint, then you need not worry. Just keep your skin adequately moisturised.. apply plenty of moisturising lotions and preferably use some oil also once a day ( something like olve oil or almond oil )... hope it helps Dr Geetika Paul"},{"Patient":"hi i have leathery dry skin i have melasma on the corners of my mouth its epidermal because it keeps coming back and i control this witha steriod called betnovate its only tempory i am so distressed as i have tried bleaching prroduct of evry sort and nothing works this steriod has thinned out my skin has given me uneven skin colour and spider veins and also i have pores al over my skin my skin is smooth to touch but dry this is what its done to my skin its so leathery and dry at the same time i do not knw wot to do help me plz its spread to my uper lip now what can i do","Doctor":"hi, First of all, you seem to be really stressed because of your condition..please dont be so...Melasma is a common problem and one of the known etiological agents is stress..so you have to stop worrying firstly... Now as i can make out, you have been using too many steroids over your face because of which your skin has thinned down and you have developed telangiectasis.. so most importantly,,stop using topical steroids,,they are doing more harm to your skin,, Steroids when used as a lightening agent , only cause some degree of temporary improvement. so they are not of any permanent help.. As you have dry and leathery skin, i would recommend that you should use plenty of emmolients (moisturizing creams) over your face. another thing is that you should always use a sunscreen atleast half an hour before going out in the sun..preferably use a lotion or cream formulation as you have dry skin then certain non steroidal agents like kojic acid and vitamin C formulations have been found to be effective in controlling hyperpigmentation in patients who develop side effects due to excess steroid use. and lastly , try to improve your diet,,,take plenty of fresh fruits and salads..especially citrus fruits as these are a good source of Vitamins and antioxidants and so are very good for skin.....

Benzamycin contains both benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin; these are anti-acne medications and in many people, skin gets drier on repeated use.Do you still have pimples? If not, you can stop this completely. You can use Clindamycin gel occassioanaly if you have few eruptions. For a regular care of the dry skin you have, you can use Cetaphil cleanser for dry/sensitive skin. After washing face, you should apply a non comedogenic ,oil free moisturizer ,which are available with many pharmaceutical companies OTC in most countries.U might need to repeat applications of the moisturizer according to the nature of your skin.Finally, a sunscreen should be applied 20 mins before sun exposure and repeated 4-5hourly.The sunscreen should be non Comedogenic as well. hope this helps..take care!"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am having very dry skin and so I was suffering from sun burn and rashes when exposed to sun .So I consulted a skin specialist and as per the instructions given to me , I started using momate lotion .

Seborrheic dermatitis is characterised by dry flaky skin over eyelids, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, behind ear, scalp, upper chest, back , groin, limbs ( flexors) etc. To treat the same use an anti dandruff shampoo containing ketoconazole three days in a week To treat dry skin over face, use cetaphil cleanser and moisturiser and apply a mild steroid antifungal cream( you may mix and apply hydrocortisone and clotrimazole cream) for not more than a week. As steroid can exacerbate rosacea if used for too long. With the above suggestions, your skin would be better. To take care of rosacea, use of sunscreen daily is mandatory. Avoid spicy, hot food, alcohol etc. Vascular form of rosacea responds best to IPL. You may also try applying Azelaic acid cream to reduce redness and swelling.

It will reduce dryness, itchiness and redness of your lips. Once you feel that your lips have become normal, stop fluticasone and continue with lip balm only. Use lip balms with good SPF.Continue with proper water intake and nutritious diet. Also do not forget to consult a dermatologist so that underlying cause of cheilitis could be elicited. Take care."},{"Patient":"I started having dry and itchy skin, and when it begins to itch it looks like theres another layer of skin on top of it and it has a pink pigmented color (this happens on some areas on both of my arms,hands, and around my eyes) and on my face the area around my mouth gets dry and itchy too but the color of it is blackish brown color","Doctor":"Hi Sara, The underlying cause for the pigmentation and itching of skin is extreme dryness. Use a good hydrating soap bar like cetaphil while bathing and apply moisturising lotion meant for very dry skin immediately after bath to lock in the moisture. Use a Luke warm water to bath as hot water rips of the moisture from skin. Moisturising lotions containing lactic acid or urea are good for dry skin. As your skin seems a bit sensitive too cetaphil restoraderm is a good choice as a moisturising lotion. Moisturise your skin twice in a day. If there is too much of itching or redness on face, mild steroid like fluticasone can be used for few days along with moisturisers. Once the proper skin hydration is achieved, treatment can be taken to reduce pigmentation. Take care."},{"Patient":"hello Dr. Prasad I am Sumit. I am an average looking guy of 24+ yrs.

You seem to have developed xerotic dermatitis. A good moisturizer with shea butter and and liquid paraffin will help you . A single daily application of betamethasone like steroid will also help.

Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  The problem in pcos is with ovulation. So, you have to take medicines for ovulation.  Bigomet alone will not help.  Hope I have answered your question.

I have like 2 on the right side of my back and 3 at the middle of my back. I started having this things last year. The other thing is that it doesn t get itchy. I m woundering if its due to dry skin , cause I dnt always use lotion. Or due to dandruff? Cause I have dandruff, but Ive never heard u can get dandruff on your back. I ve heard u can get it on your eyebrows, ears, and forehead .. Thank god I don t have dandruff anywhere besides my hair. Well anyways I really need some answers first before I go ahead and see my doctor. I want to know if I can cure this myself first. So thank you for taking your time and reading this:))","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the query. From your description, there's a possibility of it being a fungal infection. Try to apply any anti fungal cream without steroids, about 5 to 6 times a day over the oval areas. Continue for about 10 days. There should be some improvement. If there is no change, you can consult a dermatologist. They will also suggest a suitable remedy for your dandruff.Dandruff also is commonly caused by a type of fungus and you will benefit by the use of a special medicated shampoo like selsun. Hope you are reassured. Bye"},{"Patient":"I m 14 and I m slow behind on puberty , I know that s normal and it s not my question, just an fyi.

They are less than a milimeter in diameter and have not risen abouve the skin (Not bumpy). I have very dry skin and have never had acne spots before. Can you tell me what these dots are? please Also, there are about 15 of them in each place, not just one dot. A bunch. You can barely see them unless you look closely though.","Doctor":"Hi Jonathon, You might be having a combination skin(dry with oily t zone). To keep your skin well hydrated use a mild face wash and a moisturiser well suited to your skin type. The black spots that you have mentioned might be black heads. Comedones and acne are quite common in adolescence. So don't worry. You can get them extracted and can apply anti acne gel to prevent further occurrence( like application of adapalene gel at concerned areas in night). Hope that solves your query.

The circles on my feet are slightly deeper, smaller, and far greater in number. If you know what this might be please let me know!

It is just not nice to look at. Lotion does not help. The whole are is actually lighter in color than the rest of my legs. Is this some sort of fungal infection? If so, what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi there, It seems like you are having Intertrigo ( inflammation of the skin in between the body folds due to friction ), once there is a break in the superficial layer of the skin then the Yeast which is the normal resident in the area due to moisture and heat favourable for them causes fungal infection. So I would suggest to apply Lamisil cream two times a day for 14 days. 2:Zeasorb Af Powder sprinkled in the groins to reduce further friction while having a walk for te same duration.

As you have mentioned that you have already been treated for scabies with no help and also that you have very dry skin so two things that i can think of right now are Xerotic Eczema( a type of eczema which is related to a very dry skin) Allergic Contact Dermatitis and the allergen could be anything in the food,clothings,cosmetics or sometghing in the environment. So the bottom line is that you have to see your dermatologist or at least your GP so that he/she can examine you fully and asses you further.

It can also be due to some allergy. The spot needs to be examined by a dermatologist to find the exact cause. Try not to remove it by yourself, as it can get infected more.

There is no obvious cure for the dry skin - what can not be cured has to be endured. There are a few similar creams or lotions - the basic constituent is propylene glycol...   Each company adds some component like lactic acid, liquid paraffin and so on.

It came on 4 years ago when my washing machine broke and I hand washed my clothes for about a year. the soap was very drying and contained a bleach product in it. Now I have been using udder cream and my hands have become soft but the dry skin bubbles are still there and the whenever I wash dishes for a long period of time they become more pronounced. My feet don t have much of these bubbles and I try to scrub the dry skin pocket off whenever get a pedicure , but they keep coming back in the same place.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome! I would be pleased to answer your question . From the description of the lesions they seem to be either a hand eczema or contact dermatitis. Which has become chronic at the moment . The Allergy can be due to external or internal allergic agent. The response to the agent results in an 'itch scratch cycle'. As in the more one scratches the more the area itches and so on. The first step in treatment is to break this cycle by giving relief from itching and instructing the patient to avoid scratching as much as possible. It can occur localised as in your case. Here is what will help: 1. Clobetasol propionate cream + Mupirocin cream: Mix and apply over the affected area on the right shoulder twice a day for 14 days then switch to Fluticasone propionate cream once at night for 2-4 weeks. In the groin/upper inner thigh use Fluticasone in place of Clobetasol from the beginning. The specialist to see will be a dermatologist and he or she can prescribe these for you. Nothing over the counter will help much, the only product with some benefit is 1% Cortizone cream. 2. Tab Claritin 10 mg twice a day for 14 days, then once a day for 6-8 weeks. Initially the dose can be increased to 2 tablets taken twice a day if there is insufficient relief in itching. 3. Sarna sensitive lotion can be used 2-3 times a day to give further relief from itching. This can be continued even when the above creams have been stopped. 4. Avoid scratching the affected areas as much as possible. This is most important. Whenever it is not bearable soak a towel in ice cold water and keep it on the affected areas or apply the Sarna sensitive lotion. Lastly keep the affected areas as well moisturized as possible with a moisturizer of your choice. NOTE: 1% Cortizone cream, Claritin and Sarna lotion can be bought without a prescription.

Will any of these actions I ve started to take help with my skin?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is true that iron deficiency anemia can make you look unhealthy but it should not typically be leading to the the complaints that you have. This is particularly so as you have only borderline iron deficiency. Further, to get the skin you want, I would suggest thee following: a. Have a healthy and balanced diet. Typically, your diet should have 50-55% carbohydrates, 15-25% protein and 20-30% fat. You should also be drinking 3-4 litres of water and be consuming 5-6 servings of vegetables in a day. b. Avoid junk food. It is unhealthy, makes you gain weight and is bad for your skin c. Try and consume 5-6 meals daily. Eat every 3-4 hours. Have an early dinner d. Exercise everyday for atleast 50 minutes. e. Sleep for 7-8 hours a day f. Wash your face twice a day with a soap free facewash. Always use a sunblock before stepping out. Please do not take iron supplements without seeing a physician. Then can damage the liver when taken in excessive amounts or over a long period of time. You can take Centrum but its more important to have a proper lifestyle in the long run"},{"Patient":"I have rough dry patches on my knuckles. most of the times it is confined to the pinky finger knuckles but sometimes it is on my other if not all of the other knuckles.

I don t typically use lotion when I masturbate and when my skin gets dry, this happens from time to time. I typically stop masturbating for a few days, lotion the spot, and allow it to heal. Last week, I was having sex with my girlfriend and afterwards, the dry skin cracked and, over the last week, has formed into 3 small open sores. I put a bandaid over it with antibiotic ointment and the bandaid choked off the air supply (and I am mildly allergic to the adhesive in the bandaids) and the skin turned white and the sores got slightly worse. Yesterday, I noticed 4 little tiny popped zits on the head of my penis. They weren t really painful but they did pop open. Today, I had 3 more single spots lower on the shaft of my penis. 2 of them are side by side and have dark centers. They almost look like a spider bite . I squeezed them and they popped and are sore now. I ve been treating this with a combination of neosporin and lotramin wrapped in gauze around my penis. I let it breath for a couple hours when I shower in the evening. I ve been with the same girl for quite a while and I don t suspect that she has anything.

From your description you seem to be having a condition known as Icthyosis. It is important to know if you've had this since childhood or has it appeared recently?

In the meanwhile you can take the following skin care measures. Use moisturising creams imeediately after bath. Apply two to three times and see that the skin doesn't get dry. If there are any cracks or cuts in the skin you can use over the counter antibiotic creams. keep the skin clean.

In such cases better is to de-worm the patient by giving him albendazole tablets.Along with this you would also require a long course of anti allergic medicines ,since it is difficult to find the exact cause of allergy.You should also rule any tooth decay and thyroid problem.It is at times associated with thyroid disease.

I'm a 19 old male that is experiencing transient hair thinning, but mostly in the frontal portion of my scalp.  For short periods of time, the quality of my hair changes drastically.  My hair sometimes looks terrible in the morning and then a whole lot better in the afternoon.  It is so strange.  I'm studying medicine and have absolutely no idea what the cause can be.I have tried the following:  Very stict diet (Cutting out diary, all sugars and breads) - this help a little.  I have used DHT blockers for 2 years. A natural remedy to slow my thyroid down ever so slightly, not that it's way to active.  I drink a lot of vites, especially B-complex. I drank milk thistle - doesn't work. I don't wash my hair too often and use a high quality shampoo and conditioner.  I don't experience excessive stress.  I even resorted to trying a laser comb to no relief. Now I'm even trying horse shampoo.My doctor claims that my testosterone levels are way too low, I contradict this statement - levels are above 400. Other hormones seem to be in a harmonic balance, proving hypopituitarism isn't a differential diagnosis. There is no chemical or heat strain on my hair.I eat healthy, exercise a lot and am in good shape.  I've tried all many oils (coconut, carrot and jojoba), but to no avail.

I went for an Ayurveda treatment program for 1 week in Thailand. The treatment involved applying an oil mix to the hair/scalp. The oil mix was made of the following oils: Bergamot, Coconut, Grapeseed, Wheatgerm, Lavender, Rosewood, Sweet Almond, Sesame and Sunflower oils. The oils were applied on a daily basis for 6 days. I have noticed my hair started falling at an usual rate almost immediately after the second or third time of applying these oils however since the doctor explained that these oils are actually good for my hair I continued with the program unfortunately. I stayed for an additional 2 weeks in Thailand and I was washing my hair almost everyday for the whole duration of the trip because of the hot weather and humidity. By the end of the trip I noticed my hair thinned (I have naturally good volume hair). When I got back home, my hair was falling on a daily basis simply by running my hand through it and I had an itchy scalp at the top of my head. I waited for the symptoms to go away and for my hair to recover to its natural state (which is not falling above normal). I tried using some natural remedies like applying lemon juice, the itching and redness stopped but hair falling continued for an additional 3 to 4 weeks. I then booked an appointment with a dermatologist and explained the above, she asked me to do the following blood tests: CBC, Ca, Mg, Fe, Vitamin B12, Prolactin, Zinc, FT4, TSH, Vitamin D & Vitamin B6. The results came out normal, nothing was below normal levels. She prescribed Ducray Neoptide for women, Ducray Anaphese Stimulating Shampoo, Iron pills (1/day), Zinc pills (2/day) and Novophane pills (2/day) and she said to continue using them for 3 months. My hair stopped falling after 10 days approximately of starting treatment and I believe the Ducray neoptide spray is the reason why. However I have noticed that the baby hair coming out is rather thin and not like my usual thick hair. My question is what do you think about what happened to my hair and why did it happen? And is the treatment effective in terms of my hair returning to its normal state and volume? Also what are the side effects of using Ducray products for a long time (3 months) and can the hair become dependant on them? Will my hair return to its normal state after finishing this treatment (I have lost a lot of hair during the trip and before starting the treatment so during a period of approximately a month and 3 weeks which is what I regret most .... not starting the treatment earlier to avoid this loss).

In the last 6-8 weeks, I have noticed my usually thick and plentiful hair is thinning, especially in the front and top of my head.  Also, in the last couple of weeks, I have felt a small dip/depression at the top of my skull at the spot where I have a patch of hair loss.  One doctor calls it alapecia caused by stress but wasn't concerned about the depression in the skull.  The Dermatologist didn't seem to have an answer for the hair loss but prescribed a cortisone type lotion for the chronic itching of my scalp, which seems to help.  However, I think the depression in the skull is getting larger and I am wondering if you have any idea what is causing that.  I have had three once-a-year infusions of Aclasta (the Canadian term for Reclast) for my advanced osteoporosis and am thinking that might be the culprit for the hair thinning and patches of hair loss.  I've been dying my hair for a number of years with no apparent allergic reactions.  My hairdresser has been using environmentally friendly (\\"green\\") products in the last few years, but I can't say if that's what causes the itching or the hair loss.

Have had scabs/pimples on scalp for weeks at a time randomly through this time.  Easily go away by washing hair more often or by using fluocinide for a couple days (only have been using it for about 5 months)  Bloodwork shows TSH around 2.6, ferritin was kind of low at 12, so I've been taking iron for the past year religiously with vitamin C, but hair hasn't grown, also vitamin D was low, and I've been taking D3 for it regularly for 10 months and it hasn't helped.  Also take 5000 mgs of bioitin, a multivitamin, and occasionally melatonin at night.  All these vitamins I started about a year ago.  I also eat either salmon or avocado or flax seed daily, lots of veggies and fruits, and I eat red meat every day (for iron).  I'm 5 ft 6 and weigh between 135 to 145.  I have a pretty sedentary life style.  I don't work out, but I used to work out like crazy from age 12 to 19 and it didn't help my hair at all- still lost it then.  My testosterone comes back normal, but I have a lot of facial and neck hair.  My scalp always feels itchy or tingly or this weird crawly feeling.  I don't know what to do or how to stop my hair loss.  All the females on both sides of my family have thick hair, only some of the men on my dad's side have the horse shoe balding pattern.

I have been to the doctors with various symptoms always to be told its stress or they dont know or its normal. I feel like they think im looking for things that are wrong with me but im truthfully not. 4 years ago I attempted to take my own life as I felt hugely depressed, literally for no real reason and since then I have tried not to think about any symptoms. Only now 4 years later my partner has asked me to go to the doctors as we are both sure there is something fundamentally wrong that is causing the issues I have now lived with for 10 years. Im very worried I will recieve the same response and have put together a simple list of past and current symptoms. Im wondering if you can look over and give me any clue what it might be. Personally I think it may be a liver issue, I think taking large quantities of Creatine caused my alopecia universalis although never proved. My hair has never grown back since. Here is the list.. Symptoms around same time as getting Alopecia that has got worse. ·     Overheating to stage where intense pins and needles over scalp, chest and upper back. ·     Bad digestion of food, unable to handle fatty foods. ·     Experience low blood sugars - blurred vision, humming in ears, feeling like going to pass out, told this may be hypoglycaemia - control with eating sugary snacks. Symptoms that appeared or worsened around 4 years ago. ·     Massive mood swings, depression, suicidle. ·     Intolerance to noise – more than 3 noises at same time makes me feel like im completely overloaded and have to remove myself from the source of the noise. Tend to just swtich off and don’t take anything in. ·     Very irritable. ·     White specks in vision, fuzzyness. ·     Heart palpatations, heart pounding despite doing nothing - just lying down. (not as often now) ·     Lumps in legs where veins seem to intersect - told this is normal? Symptoms that appeared or worsened around 3 years ago. ·     Foggy headed, unable to concentrate, easily annoyed. ·     Intolerance to alcohol - Eaily become intoxicated, very bad hangover after a very small amount of alcohol. ·     Weakness - no strength in muscles, joints very dry. Symptoms that have become worse recently ·     Weakness - No strength in muscles especially lower body strength, simply walking can lead to shakes in my legs. Carrying something a short time leads to bad pain the following day in the arms. Holding limb for a short period of time in the same place causes it to seize (feels like the ligament itself) very painful to ease back into position. ·     Tiredness - Worse in the mornings but never feel fully awake. By 7pm am completely worn out and ready to sleep. ·     Dizzyness - Often feel light headed, white specks in vision, total Intolerance to the cold - makes me feel very weak and very tired. ·     Unable to gain weight - despite a very healthy and full diet watching calorie intake etc cannot gain any weight. ·     Often have a bad stomach leading to either constipation or diarreah. ·     Bleeding gums, yellowing of tongue ( I do smoke but not much, around 6 a day) ·     Sweating a great deal after very little excercise, has odour of urine and strong smelling. ·     Irritation of skin around neck and face, itching and dryness. Tried moisturisers and keep my skin very clean. ·     Irritable - very, nothing to be stressed about but easily annoyed. ·     Vivid dreams - very realistic strange dreams, often bad. ·     Pain in lower back - more like an ache that comes suddenly, normally when lying flat on my back, becomes unbearable and have to move for it to go. Previously… Been to doctors several times regarding various symptoms. Told often it is stress despite nothing being stressful in my life. Seen a therapist on recommendation, did not help or do anything as there were no issues. One doctor suspected problem with brain as I become fuzzy headed and sent to hospital for tests which all came back ok. Tried various diets and supplements to no avail.

But some hair loss is permanent. If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. But also, 2 medications are used for treatment and include minoxidil and Finasteride.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 will suggest you to get morning's  first sample of urine tested for pregnancy. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. If pregnancy test results are negative, then please seek prescription support from your treating doctor for getting progesterone tablets for withdrawal bleeding. He will guide you further about the doses and withdrawal bleeding of the same. Once you have withdrawal bleeding, please get FSH, LH, PROLACTIN, AMH blood levels done on the second day of the cycle. As far as your age is concerned, your reports need to be assessed for the ovarian reserve and chances of natural conception or need to go ahead with IVF technique. Also get a diagnostic laparoscopy and hysteroscopy done. If your reproductive system is structurally and functionally within normal range , then you stand good chance of getting pregnant. Please be positive. Have a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. All things will be fine in the due course of time. May God bless you with a bundle of joy. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

Lately my hair is coming out a LOT on a day to day basis.  I am always finding long strands on my shirt and shoulders.  When griping my hair (dry) at the nape of my neck then sliding my hand down to the bottom, I am left holding about 10 strands, which happens almost everytime I do it, after a couple of hours from doing it last.  I had cleaned out my hair brush a few days ago and after I brushed my hair about 6 strokes, the brush was somewhat filled with long strands again.  Before dying my hair I would only find about 2 or 3 strands on a clean brush.

Actually the problem in PCO is with ovulation.  So, you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks  like susten or duphaston.  These are better than norgest.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. As you have stopped taking depo injections and also you have started getting regular cycles, it is for sure that you have resumed your fertile ability. As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of cycle. If you have unprotected sex act in the fertile period of cycle, then you stand chance to get pregnant.  At least try to have unprotected sex act on alternate days in this period. If you happen to get your cycles after following this advice then please get post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography done, to know the patency of the fallopian tubes. Husband's semen analysis after 4 days of abstinence period, to know about quality and quantity of sperms. You can get ovulation study on USG from day 10 of the cycle , to know about the day of ovulation.  You can simply opt for unprotected sex act on and around the day of ovulation, or opt for IUI - intrauterine insemination, on the day of ovulation. Please opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Start on Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant. This helps to prevent  many problems during pregnancy and delivery. Please be patient. Think positive. All things will be fine in the due course of time. May God bless you with a bundle of joy. I hope this answer helps you. . Thanks. Dr. Purushottam Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"i have recently changed pill to microgynon 30.

There may be many causes for the disease..like anemia, nutritional deficiencies, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, thyroid dysfunction, internal diseases, stress, tension, etc. Blood tests may be done by your treating dermatologist and then accordingly he may treat you. I would recommend you to take tablet biotin daily for long time. Capsule of vitamin E and multivitamin capsule may be added. Apply hair serum containing vitamin B3, arginin, aloe vera extract, D penthenol, biotin, etc.  daily on the dry scalp. If there is dandruff, do shampoo with ketoconazole containing shampoo. Apply almond oil on hairs after drying the hairs alternate days. Keep yourself tension free. Do exercise and yoga.  Improve diet taking all the food stuffs. Also take dietary supplements.You may get good result after 6 months. Maintenance of treatment is needed for few years. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
