I've been having more trouble sleeping, and feeling increasingly like I did before I began taking it (extreme anger, impulsive, hyperactive, and extremely hostile). Does this  mean the medication has stopped working or that I should increase the dosage?","Doctor":"Hi,The dose of Seroquel that you are taking is low for the symptoms you have mentioned. You may be needing a dose hike but the best judge can only be your doctor as it needs to be seen what caused the present aggravation of symptoms. The extent of dose hike needed would also have to be decided as the dose range varies from 100 to 800 mg per day, with some people requiring even higher dosages. Your past history would also need to be taken into consideration. In my opinion, it will be better to discuss this issue with your doctor and not hike the dose yourself.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I have been crying I believe for good reason.

My main problem is anxiety about sleeping, eg. that I am not going to get to sleep, I am just going to lie awake all night etc. It has reached a point now where I am extremely anxious about going to bed. As each hour passes towards bed-time, the fear grows, to the point that when I get into bed I am in a terrible state and cannot relax. I was just wondering if there was any advice on dealing with this.","Doctor":"Greetings !Well you can make use of two remedies to manage your insomnia and anxiety which are -- 1) Drug therapy such as starting on a sleep aid drug which also lessens anxiety like clonazepam at dose of 0.5 mg to be taken half hour before bedtime and continue to take the same for 1 week continuously and then stopping the drug, this will ensure quick relief of your anxiety and insomnia.2) Proper sleep hygiene needs to be practiced daily so as to help you to maintain good sleep in the long run. Sleep hygiene entails following important points --1) Adhering to a fixed sleep in and wake up time.2) wearing loose cotton clothes at night for sleeping.3) Keeping the room dimly lit and well ventilated.4) Avoiding stimulant substances in the late evening or night such as coffee, alcoholic beverages, etc5) Changing room or bed temporarily.6) Avoid watching television or listening to music late at night or when not able to sleep but instead read a book when not able to be sleep.7) Avoid eating heavy, oil rich , fried meals late in the evening and at night. Take small frequent meals at regular intervals and dinner at 8 pm with good time between dinner and sleeping.8) If not getting sleep for 15 minutes get up and take a warm bath and drink a cup of warm milk.9) exercise regularly.10) Avoid taking stress and do yoga / meditation for tranquility.I hope these two remedies shall help your cause.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi im a 31 year old male, and for the last few years I have gradually started to feel tireder and tireder I every now and then have a heart issue were my heart seems to go really fast for a few seconds and then back to normal this is normally when laying on my back in bed.

Im so sorry to hear about your grandchild. My name is Vinay. Let me see if I can help you understand what is going on here. Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a developmental problem with the CNS. Most of the time we don't really know what causes it. But many a time it is associated with certain kinds of Brain malformations that developed from birth (we call them cortical dysplasias), hypoxic injury at birth (not enough oxygen to the brain at birth), infections, trauma and a rare disease called Tuberous Sclerosis. Any case of Symptomatic LGS that I have come across has come into the really \\"tough to treat\\" category. The seizures are resistant to Anti Epileptic drugs and alot of the time we end up having to give a lot of steroid medications (like prednisone) to control the seizures. Unfortunately it takes a lot of 'Trial & Error' to figure out that perfect combination of drugs that controls the symptoms and most of the time the patient and me have to settle for something that is far short of perfect control of the seizures. Given that these seizures are a part of life for these children.. the statistics on mortality are staggering.. most of them die of accidents... secondary to the seizures..That makes me believe that the family has to adopt a kind of \\"ready for anything\\" stance. You have to evaluate the home and make sure that if she DOES have an witnessed seizure.. there is nothing around that she can hurt herself on and she will be found relatively quickly.. The School and School Bus environments are important to look into as well. The more accidents you can prevent, then better her overall prognosis. All her caregivers and all regular visitors to the home have to know how to deal with a witnessed seizure and should know basic first aid.I don't want to address the different medications she is on for this problem as that is an issue that can ONLY be dealt with on the ground by her Neurologist with an ability to examine her and look at her lab reports. Suffice it to say. I expect that these meds will be changing on a regular basis until the seizures are controlled.I do so hope this information helps.

To minimize the chances of developing Depakote withdrawal symptoms, you may wean you off of the medication slowly.Even if you are switching to another depressant medication, we may still recommend stopping divalproex medication slowly.Some common side effects are Drowsiness, Diarrhea, Nausea and/or vomiting , Fatigue/weakness, tremor (at high doses), Headache, Asthenia, Indigestion, ,Stomach cramps, Slurred speech, Insomnia, nervousness. AS you are taking divalproex for many years, my suggestion is switch to other newer antidepressant medication with fewer side effects.Thus please consult a psychiatrist and switch to other drug.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"what causes dyskinesia?

The fact that it all started when you were a 12 year old just shows the age of onset of this condition but it cannot be defined as PTSD as the emotional trauma that you were exposed to was not that catastrophic and unprecedented that is usually associated with PTSD.I will suggest you to seek CBT ( Cognitive Behavior Therapy) from a clinical psychologist to work on your situational anxiety.I hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Nala & I am having terrible Flashbacks of the past, and I don't know how to handle them, but to cry and feel worthless .

Im 24 and i was diagnosed in 2012 with Schizoaffective disorder as a result of my attempted suicide. I had problems for years(since around 6 years of age) with it but it was very few and far between. Though 2011-2012 it began effecting me more often. The confusing part of it is prior to having any of these issues i was having issues with my gender. I was born in a males body but i feel and have always felt as i was a female. The feeling of being trapped led to anxiety and depression. I tried medication for the depression but never told anyone how i felt inside. So the meds didn t have any effect, and the doctors were left confused. i found my own solution when i hit high school age and began wearing women s clothes under mine. It was a small thing but it gave me happiness and hope. I then got my ears pierced and this too was a booster to my outlook, and emotions. But it was short lived as it made me realize i was still having to hide myself. I struggled to fit in with others in school but i wasn t able to fully be myself. I couldn t add to conversation with other girls, but i wasn t able to talk with guys as most of the conversation was about sex. I am ready to come clean and be open with everyone, and i ve had success with telling my family and a few friends and they support me. Which was very surprising to me as i had lost a lot of my friends after being diagnosed as Schizoaffective. As i opened up to my family I ve haven t had any issues at all regarding mental he all besides the ever-present depression of not looking how i feel on the inside. Its been 2 years since I ve fully opened up and had no problems. Which brings me to my question, because of the fact I m already diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder; am i able to get my letter from a psychiatrist for Hormone Replacement Therapy, and Sex Reassignment Surgery? And if so, what steps do i need to take in doing so and finding a psychiatrist who can help me with the process? I do apologize for the length of this but i felt it would help to have some background so i could get an answer that would apply to me. Thank you for your time. I really do appreciate it.","Doctor":"hithanks fr using healthcare magicIf i was ur treating psychiatrist u would have diagnosed u as a case of gender identity disorder.

Both are good choices. Flunil can be prescribed upto 60mg and clomipramine-150 mg.

What can I do?","Doctor":"Greetings!Well it seems like this person that you are talking about has developed Depression and anxiety as a result of the stress of loosing his job and as it usually happens in these conditions he is not being able to counter these on his own and slipping deeper and deeper in them.So I suggest that he needs to be shown to a psychiatrist and started on an anti depressant drug such as Escitalopram at dose of 10-20 mg / day or sertraline at dose of 25-100 mg / day starting first on a lower dose and then titrating up the dose. Along with the anti depressant drug he also needs to be put on an  anti anxiety drug like clonazepam at dose of 0.25 mg twice a day. So to summarize his conditions of anxiety + depression need to be assessed by a psychiatrist and thereafter he needs to be put on a combination of 1 anti depressant and 1 anti anxiety drug for a period of at least 4-6 months for full relapse free recovery although it may so happen that he shall recover within 2-3 months of use of these drugs but still full course as mentioned above needs to be completed to prevent relapse of the symptoms which is quite common an occurrence if the complete treatment is not done.I hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have been using lexilium to aid me sleep during the night on regular basis for the last couple of weeks, however, I have been scheduled for surgery that will take place after 2 days and would like to know whether I may use lexilium to aid me sleep during these anxious nights knowing that I will have the surgery that would most likely require general anethstesia?

Since April 2013 (age 26) I have been unable to stop my underarms and upper back from sweating. This is without any physical activity or movement. The change happened without any noticeable build-up (changed in one day), however it seems to have gotten worse since it first occurred. Anxious situations are guaranteed to make my symptoms worse, but calm situations also bring on sweating. I do not sweat during the night. During my teens and until I was 23, I did not sweat a large amount. I remember I was typically cold, and did not overheat even when exercising. I traveled extensively in South East Asian countries and did not have any issues with sweating, even while working outside. During 2010 (age 23), I suddenly began to sweat profusely when exercising and sometimes while eating. (not spicy foods) There was also no build-up to this condition, however I blamed it on recently starting Finasteride. The symptoms did not change once I ceased taking the medication. This was manageable and not a large concern to me, although I did seek medical advice in case there was something serious. Nothing was found. Since 2010, my sweating was maintained at a manageable level until April 2013 when it suddenly and greatly worsened. I have regularly seen a GP and tests have not shown anything wrong. I have tried various forms of antiperspirants (with 15% Aluminium Chloride), Propranolol HCL 40mg, and Oxybutynin Chloride Ta 5mg. Both medications seemed to work for a week before my sweating returned. I have always been very fit, and obesity is not an issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated. The sweating has very much reduced my standard of life since it manifested itself, and I am desperate to seek a permanent solution to this problem.","Doctor":"hello thanks for choosing healthcare magicgetting sweat is body's normal response. if u r getting excessive sweating, first get ur thyroid profile or other endocrinological tests like corticosteroids,  growth hormone etc done. it would give some idea about the problems. if all test come normal then it could be due stress.

This is a little long, sorry.Maybe once or twice a month sometimes even more rarely I would suddenly without much of any warning feel an intense feeling of impending doom. Very pronounced, an extreme sensation like I was about to die, and thoughts of impending doom. Difficult to describe the sensation other than that it comes along with an extreme feeling of anxiety. Then within about 2-4 minutes after having this sensation I would pass out. I don t ever remember passing out. My father once saw me when this happened and he said I stand up straight and then slump down to the ground. After I wake up which I think is usually almost immediately or a few minutes after losing consciousness I feel intensely sick, like I m about to die. I have temporary amnesia. I don t know who or what I am or where I am, and I usually can t see for a few minutes. This memory loss goes away in a few minutes as well as my ability to see. The other very apparent symptom is intense and sudden sweating. I m literary drenched with sweat. Also, I feel incredibly weak, slightly nauseous and intensely sick like I am dieing. I can t even get off the floor. Eventually these feeling fade within about 30-40 minutes after which time I feel still very sick but have enough energy to stand up. Then it might take 1-2 hours to feel normal again although sometimes when I have a really bad attack it can take 24 hours before I feel normal again. I ve seen a few doctors for this and one doctor said he thinks it was syncope. The other doctors just ran quite a few tests said their results were normal and never really got back to me. It didn t seem like they really new what was going on. I ve had ecocardiograms done and mri, both came back normal. I ended up just living with it for some several years until when I was about 27 one day for no real reason I bought some raw barley that I saw in the supermarket. It was just an impulse buy as I never noticed it before and thought it would be interesting to cook it like rice. I liked it a lot, but that day I became intensely sick maybe several hours after eating it. I had extreme diarrhea, repeated vomiting, and a general feeling of being sick. At the time I thought I had a stomach virus so I thought I would just stay at home and rest, but it kept getting worse and worse so I went to the doctor. The doctor thought I might have a stomach parasite since one of the blood tests indicated elevated eosinophil count but the stool test showed no parasite. She sent me to a hematologist, who ran more blood tests which showed nothing wrong and the eosinophil count dropping down to normal. By that time I was feeling better. That doctor just recommended contacting him again if symptoms return. They didn t for a long time until after several months I decided to finish eating the rest of the barley I had. The same symptoms returned. I haven t asked any doctor about it since but was just assuming that it was some strange allergic reaction. At about that same time I began noticing that I was beginning to feeling slightly itchy whenever I at spicy foods which I ate alot. I decided to stop eating barley and spicy foods and I noticed that my fainting spells stopped. I hadn t eaten spicy foods for a year and I haven t fainted since. About a year ago I decided to try to test it out for sure so I ate spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce and a few days later I had a fainting episode with the same symptoms. I assumed it was an allergic reaction and after having read a bit more I was assuming that all the time I was going into anaphylaxis. The only two symptoms I don t seem to have is swelling of my throat and hands as well as any rash or itching. The itching comes immediately after eating spicy foods and the anaphylaxis maybe a few days or several hours later. My question is the following, is this the likely diagnosis? And is there a simple definitive test to diagnose this? What type of doctor should I see? I ve also noticed a few years ago that I seem to also be allergic to tylenol after never having been before. I had pretty standard allergic reaction symptoms. My lips swelled up, I felt itchy, and difficulty breathing. It lasted for only a few minutes and went away. Since then I have been staying clear of barley, cayenne pepper, and tylenol and it seems to work although I haven t seen a doctor about this allergic reaction guess for my past problems. The reason why I am asking now is because a few days ago I stupidly ate something with cayenne pepper in it and had another fainting spell without having had any problems for a long time. I noticed that the symptoms were the same but extremely intense this time around and a few hours later I noticed that my right eye felt itchy. When I rubbed it slightly I felt a sudden burning sensation that quickly went away. I immediately rushed to the bathroom mirror and noticed that the skin surrounding my eye was pitch black, as if I had a really bad black eye. I don t remember having hit my face as my face didn t feel sore after i fainted. The after affects after the faint lasted all day this time and out of curiosity I took my temperature and it read 95.2 degrees F (oral). Thinking this low I decided to have a hot bath. After sitting in the bath for about a few minutes the nausea suddenly intensified and I spontaneously began to vomit multiple times. For some reason the bath made me really sick. Anyway I m committed to stay clear of cayenne pepper and be more careful in the future, but the reason why I wanted to ask a doctor about this now was because I wanted to know if you think I should have an epipen on hand. I was a little afraid as to how much more intense the symptoms were after having not had them for so long. I was wondering if you think I should get checked out again or if there is really no way to definitively confirm such an allergy. Also, from what I read barley, cayenne pepper, and tylenol allergies are rare and also I don t experience every common allergy symptom. So I was wondering if you think I was wrong about this being an allergy or if this is indicative of some other type of unusual condition. I just didn t want to waste my time and money seeing another doctor about this again since I wasn t sure if there was going to be anything also they could test or do for me other than to advice staying clear of those foods for which I already know.","Doctor":"hi...thanks for using healthcare magic..i have noticed two problem  in you...one panic disorder which lead to anxiety symptoms and second allergy to barley, tylenol and cayenne pepper. for panic disorder u have to consult a psychiatrist and for allergy related problem better to consult gastro-enterologist.  there are few allergy test which help to find out the list of things to whom u have allergy. for that u have to give ur blood sample to lab who deal to these testing."},{"Patient":"hi my age is 26.i just got married last month.from 18 i masturbate daily very hard because of that my penis have no much power.i know before that its get very hard.i don't know what to do know i m just taking Viagra for erect properly during sex time which can do some side effect.how can i recover power during the sex without taking sex pills. my wife is not happy from me that's why i am getting stressed..i don't want to lose her.i think i damaged my penis veins.please help somehow and explain briefly. thanks","Doctor":"Hello, Masturbation cannot loosen your penis power.

I had 1.5 beers about two hours ago and was wondering if it would be wise for me to take a Xanax right now. (I wasn t anticipating needing to take Xanax tonight but had an unexpectedly stressful even arise.) Thanks","Doctor":"Greetings !Well you see alcohol and Xanax both act at the same receptors and tend to lead to severe CNS ( Central Nervous System ) depression thereby resulting in excessive drowsiness , at times  stupor to the extent of extreme seriousness. So ideally taking these two together is discouraged not even 6 hours apart however some doctors may allow the two to be taken 6-8 hours apart but in your case it is too soon to take Xanax since not enough time has elapsed since you took alcoholic beverage so keeping in mind the perils of this cocktail kindly refrain yourself from taking it now after 2 hours. Instead try to distract yourself by indulging in some task or errand or try to meditate to calm your nerves.I hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"my husband has severe depression and I wanted to know about it and the side effects. My husband has had many anti-depressants with no success. This new one has been given to him in the hospital as of 3 days ago. This is likely his last chance for help. He is also sucidle","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I am sure that you are much worried and request you to be calm. Suicidal tendency is part of Depressive disorder. Anti depressive drugs help to reduce the depression and they do not cure the root cause of depression. Depression is a habit of the mind. Negative thinking habit. The neurons are habituated to think negatively. We have to change this habit.To change the habit, we need to identify the root cause of the problem. A psychologist can help you in this aspect. After identifying the problem and the understanding depth of  the problem, he will suggest a series of psychotherapy techniques which are to be followed strictly. Then your husband could be saved from this disorder. Believe me. it is effective.For life style counseling, mental counseling, health counseling, psychotherapy treatment and anxiety disorder treatment please visit  this answers your query.

Perhaps once upon a time, I did love them and gradually the love waned away. I do not know. I haven't had any head trauma recently, or ever. Nor do I think my apathy towards my parents is an instance of teenage angst or rebellion. I do not hate my parents. I dislike them, find them tiresome and annoying, but in general, I feel nothing for them. I know this lack of feeling is not right. I feel strangely guilty and uncomfortable when I see interaction between my friends and their own parents. Like I am abnormal because I do not feel that.My parents are not abusive or cruel or mean. I suppose that they love me— they are rather ordinary people and parental love is supposedly unconditional, after all. It’s just that I feel that they never quite understand me and don’t know how to treat me because of that-- they dislike anything they don't understand. And when they think they have me figured out—which they never really have—they must be smug and make it seem as if they have defeated me somehow. And then I must make it a point to behave in a manner contrary to their conjecture. But this cannot be a purely teenage thing—I have been this way as long as I can remember. . I am a whole different person outside of family. Superficially, I am that girl, the perfect girl—friendly, kind, caring, straight A’s without trying, piano prodigy, passably pretty, generally popular. But I feel that my personality in public is not an act, that I am genuinely that person. I just cannot be that person with my parents. I live in a fairly stable household, punctuated by brief bouts of fighting between my parents, which is fairly normal I suppose. I remember a particularly big fight between my parents when I was around six or seven years old in Texas. The fight was so big that my mother bought a ticket to Seoul. Either that or she was just being melodramatic, as usual. My mother was sobbing and screaming and my father was trying to calm her. I feel that any other child would be crying in this situation. But I was strangely fascinated, entertained even, by the drama. It was exhilarating, exciting. I remembered reading about how Peter Hatcher’s best friend’s parents were divorced in my favorite book at the time, Judy Blume’s Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. I told my mother that she should move to Vermont, because Jimmy’s mother had in the book. It is rather comical, thinking about it now, but I can’t shake the feeling that my excitement was wrong.I remember another fight, one that has taken place within the last year. This time, my mother took the minivan and left. She did not come home for lunch or dinner. My siblings cried and crawled in bed with me while my father called my mom’s cell phone repeatedly. All that I could think of was that I would have to take the bus in the morning to school instead of having my father drive me because someone had to stay home with the kids. And that we were out of eggs and that the only thing I knew how to cook were omelets. Fights of this scale are not an ordinary part of my life. And yet I felt nothing.In my free time, I try to calculate my parents’ expenses to raise me—braces and private music lessons included. Then I imagine becoming a successful surgeon and writing them a big check, wash my hands clean of them. I would never have to bothered with phone calls or Christmas dinners or writing phony, sentimental mush on Mother’s/Father’s Day. Not one of my friends do that.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you calculate too much and worry unnecessarily. I do not know your cultural back ground. But I can show you a path. God cannot be with everyone, everywhere to help everyone in the world. So created mother and told her to give love and affection to the child as is given by the god himself. God created father to provide life teachings and to give guidance to the child as the god himself. God then created teacher to provide value education and guidance as is given by god himself. Then he thought, what is necessity of me for a child? According to god, mother, father and teacher are marvelous creations and he asked everyone to respect these three, because they act as god in absence.Hope you understood. Love and do your duty towards your parents, in any case and every case. You shall be peaceful throughout your life.Hope this answers your query.

That is why, her doctors are doing so many tests to find the cause for the pathology. Such behavior is not very common in motor neuron disease, which is typically characterized by muscle weakness, spasms, pain and difficulty in making movements. Regressed behavior can also be due to some psychiatric disorders, though I am sure her doctor must have already assessed her for the same and ruled them out.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My daughter-in-law, 28, had first child (5 mos old) very healthy, and healthy eater, mostly vegan, just had what seemed to be mild virus, low temp, achy, no appetite, came in from CO for Christmas and could not visit due to flu symptoms.

Since brain imaging, spinal tap and blood tests are all normal, it is unlikely that her present symptoms are due to any medical illness. Please have a talk with her psychiatrist regarding her symptoms and possible diagnosis. The doctors who are currently treating her will be the best placed to decide if a neurological consultation is needed or not and whether any other investigations are needed or not.

I didn't worry as much as I used to, etc.  However, I have been experiencing a great deal of stress in my life lately.  Recently I started having dizzy spells and it has me worried.  I have had quite a number of tests done and will still get tests to rule out any physical cause.  But, my husband and I are believing this is stress related and I've also talked to a couple of doctors and they feel it could be too.  My question is would adding Celexa to the wellbutrin be a good combination for my anxiety??  Would this help with the dizziness?

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and !I have read your question carefully and it say that you have been keeping well on Wellbutrin from long time but developed dizziness recently. All of your test are normal and both your doctor and you suspect it is due to anxiety, and you have some ongoing stress.firstly, regarding Wellbutrin, you gave not mentioned the dosage , but it is better not to increase it beyond 300 mg daily , as otherwise the risk of seizures increase significantly with it.Secondly, adding citalopram is a good option, the two drugs are form different category and will behave in different ways in controlling the illness.##Thirdly, if I had been treating you, I would have gone with changing to one single  (different medication). it is always better to take one medicine rather than going for combinations. poly pharmacy should be avoided when ever possible. So, I might have gone for something like paroxetine, or Venlafaxine, and gradually taken out Wellbutrin. With such regimn, one builds up new drugs and  gradually taper and  stop old ones. ( monitoring the response all the way ).This should not look like much to you,a s you have been taking the drug regularly. You may trying doing this with celexa too. I would strongly advice that you should try out and see if you can remail well on one medicine.It looks possible in your case as your illness has been under control for long time. Your doctor would know very well how to go about.

However, the way you have written in the question ( that she might harm herself), I would definitely like to confirm the diagnosis - I suspect that the patients may be having psychosis and not just anxiety. it is commonly seen that -at this old age, after a bout of serious illness, the patient develops psychosis more commonly compared to anxiety.

From what you wrote and from my clinical experience , I can say that you have symptoms of lethargy, depression , breathing problems ( most probably due to anxiety), visual problems. You used to be anemic but now fine. now, according to me - you have  two sets of problems ---1. psychological and 2. organic. The psychological or psychiatric illness looks like combination of anxiety  and depression. Youa have been on desvenalafaxine ( prestiq) but looking at your symptom profile , I must say that it is not working at all. Had I been treating you, I would have gone for some other drug....there are many better and effective choices available, which also donot carry any major side effect.Second peoblem is organic / physical problem. It looks like that you have postural hypotension, as you feel almost black out, dizziness occasionally, and weak. Every time you get up, you take few minutes to gain some balance.You need to get some test done like- blood pressure reading both sitting and lying down position, thyroid, hemoglobin.   they would check the cause behind this symptom. Your breathing difficulty and heart aches is actually due to psychiatric problems, as your doctor says. I can understand that you really problem in breathing  and you feel choked,  but it has a psychological basis rather than physical one. Such breathing problems are frequently seen in such patients in our clinic. With proper medicine this will certainly go away.  You could not proceed with medication as it needs a silent state of mind and it is not concentrating on something.....meditation is relaxing....when you have so many issues, you have breathing difficulty, etc., how can you relax? this result in strained meditation and there is headache....ok, so first get better with drugs  and then enjoy meditation.

For me it was induced by reading philosophical books and putting them into practice for a long time, basically saying that You are not your social identity, you are not who you think you are, you are not your mind or your thoughts... Bottom line I need my old self back, the one that I stupidly let go by brainwashing myself and meditating a lot. I try to get my old thinking patterns back, but the new reality I m stuck in keeps crawling back hard and I can t get rid of it. A friend of mine saw a psychiatrist specialized in Depersonalization, he was prescribed a combination of SSRI + Antipsychosis, and is doing somewhat better. I am very scared that the use of strong medications can give me even LESS control over my brain, and I already have very little control. I am also scared of the side effects, especially from CIpralex, which I am considering taking. Do you have any experience with this disease? And what do you advise me, thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,welcome to Healthcare Magic.Depersonalization is an anomaly of self-awareness.

Lorazepam seems to work pretty well without all the side effects  although it is not much help with with depression or mood swings it is good for a short term fix and it does help me     to eat, I have also tried Clonzepam this seems stronger than Lorazepam and just makes go to sleep, my doctor seems hesitant to prescribe Lorazepam. What is your advise? Also  I have been diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa .Thank You for you time.","Doctor":"!I have read your question carefully and from that it appers that you have bipod disorder, have been on several medicines for that, but had one or other side effect and prefer lorazepam. your doctor does not agree to give you much of lorazepam, and you have asked what should you go for?From my clinical experience I can say that your doctor is right in hesistating in giving you lorazepam or may be clonazepam, because-1. they are just symptomatic managers and will not help in taking care of the disorder 2. both have good addiction potential 3. if taken for long time irrelevantly, can lead to multiple body problems, like liver disorders4. they just relieve anxiety or help sleep, nothing more,.I can understand that you have had varied side effect with bipolar medicines, but there are still good choices yet to be tried and one has to try out drugs till he finds something which suits his body most.  It is seen many time that the psychiatrist have to change the main drug 2-3 times, due to uneasy side effects. But it is required that both the doctor and patient should be persistent and maintain calm during this period. If the patient start loosing Hope and trust in doctor, the it becomes difficult to control the disease and find the best suitable medicine. The medicine of psychiatric illnesses, one like BPAD goes on for many years, so, it is a necessity that we choose what is best for you, even though it takes time, and some side effect are encountered. There are still few mood stabilizers which can be tried in your case, may be second line, (as there are disturbing side effects with lithium, quetiapine, or soduim valporate).Your second diagnosis, anorexia nervous a can be handled along with it,  plus an additional anti depressant may be required.I think that treating bipolar will automatically help in managing anorexia.

The hot flushes and the mood swings that yo0u are describing are the same. It may be not be related to the depression. Hence you may continue taking your usual antidepressants. With the patches already in action it may take 2-3 weeks for the hormonal symptoms to settle down.

Her OCPD symptoms are very minor and only on the basis of hygiene and sanitation. she does not do any repetitive rituals but has a fear of hygiene she would never use a toothbrush more than once or twice, she will never eat or drink from someone else's home. when she visits a doctor she will always stop at a pharmacy to buy gloves, needles and injections to give to her doctor, she would never use equipment provided my a hospital or doctor. she is also the same with her 9 month old child she never allows anyone to hold the baby and there was an incident the child fell on a very cushioned carpet yet she was convinced the baby had internal bleeding and rushed her to hospital. could you please advise me of what this may mean. she also shows traits of narcissism, she speaks of her self more often than normal she believes she is superior to you and needs to be admired. She can not handle criticism, an incident was she became very aggressive and violent towards me psychically removing me from her house. when questioned about this behavior she replied because you didn't like my cooking or you never cleaned the blender properly before making that smoothy.

The cloths were hanging to dry and she showed me and said look at how i washed these cloths look at how white and unstained they are and admired here efforts as if she built an empire and expected me to admire them as well. she speaks to her husband in a very ill manner makes comments like why are you not talking, why are you pulling a face like that, why are you not laughing?  but other times she can be so normal she is a very caring, loving and charming person.

It is uaually to see such patients in clinical practice. first and the most important thing is that --- maintain strict vigilance of your patient as she tried committing suicide a week back, which is very dangerous. This attempt may be repeated again, so donot leave her alone. ---Moreover, try to keep sharp object, ropes and knives, chemical and any medicine away from her. ---Accompany her all the time as far as possible.Secondly, it was really irresponsible of the family to listen to anyone apart form the treating psychiatrist regarding the treatment, espically when she was getting better with medicines and stop them altogether. The medicines looks to be ok as far as I can understand the case from the details provided in the query.Thirdly, when you started removing the medicine slowly, you have seen that she was deteriorating , then you should have not done so any further without consulting the psychiatrist. Im not against stopping the drugs, but at the same time one needs to see the patients response during tapering the drugs. if the patients condition worsens, we donot taper further, or may be change to the medicine with lesser side effects.You have not mentioned why you were stopping the treatment in query. If your patients had clots after the fall,  she may need Divaod for a very long time, may be life long.

I was a fine human being and was a very good husband. Sidney is morbidly inconsiderate of others and her husband of thirteen especialy me because of close quarter living and never showed remorse but would blame me for verbal abuse when I was angry with a just cause. She was a chronic blamer with constant excuses for her behavior, she lied through omisson , lied for no reason, had a mask,or fascasde ,front, act, lived in denial, extremely defensive, even with mild criticism, nerver could hold her self accountable or take responsibility, manipulative in ways that were suttle unforgiving,bring petty little things from a long ago past,remembering things that I repented and redeemed myself of before before I was repentive talk the talk,uncoperative, arrogant, defiant, mocking insolent,Very knowledgeable of Bible Road Less Traveled and never applied any of it. As her husband and a good one, she is absolutely shameless about her 5 divorces and I was nowhere on her priority list. She could be very sweet and angelic to the public and performed excellent as a hopice nurse and was a a workaholic and entirely unavailable . Her Father was a violent Alcoholic that she was terrified of and had an unloving mother. Her Father divorced 5 more times. I have OCD; what is wrong with Sidney? My OCD has been in remission for many years. Thank you Greg","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for this query.I am so sorry to hear about this. It can be so overwhelming to have a wife who potrays all these characteristics. I can only imagine how difficult she is to deal with. Having gone through 5 divorces, there must be something fundamentally wrong with her attitude that needs to be addressed. I cannot think all the 5different men are the problem.Well, I think she needs some serious counseling. Look for someone that she really respects and identifies with to try and address these issues with her. However, if she has not seen them as being wrong and is totally dismissive of all the claims, then getting it addressed would be very difficult. Unless she sees it as a problem, so would not even entertain any discussion and try to find a solution to this.The honest truth is that we choose our husbands and wives. If you think you cannot put up with her, then please walk away. There are many different personalities out there. Some blend with ours and others do not. Simply see it that way and continue looking for someone that you would feel more comfortable with. She would also find a man that would be able to fit her profile.I hope you find the above information helpful.I wish you we.

For a year now he is moody, very short tempered to the stage yelling and screaming at friends and family.Extremely prickly if questioned and gets very angry if plans have been made and then change, even if it is the slightlist change as in street direction or maybe lets go to the eatery next door instead.  Did this come from his relationship break up or is his diabetes developing into something else.  I feel he is depressed and hope it is not bipolar. He is very slim, and exercises a lot, probably not wholly following a good insulin plan.  After being very angry with me he will phone and ask he we want to go out for coffee or lunch the following day,  I see signs of the son I used to have.    Am I overreacting?  My plan if I can get him on the good day is to take him to a Diabetes specialist for a start and maybe some antidepressants for a kick start in the mornings, what do you think? Jacky","Doctor":"!Jacky I really appreciate your efforts for the treatment for your son, and you are not overreacting at all.From what you have said in question I can say from my clinical experience that your son is having some autistic features ( as he strictly follows the same routine and throws tantrums when routine is changed). His mood swings might be related to such events as I can guess otherwise he would talk to you normally.You have not mentioned so, but such people are also strict about their dietary habits and may go to extremes patterns to follow it.The point which is against autism is that he developed this pattern just an year back and not from childhood. Such features are also seen in a condition called OCD. You have said that he looks depressed, which can be seen in OCD (comorbid depression).You have mentioned mood fluctuations in which one side is that -- he gets angry  and yells and screams but the other side is not reflective of manic features, so, I donot think that he is bipolar. however, making a correct diagnosis the psychiatrist must interview the patient herself. One thing is definite that your son needs help and I'm sure that medicines will help him a lot, more than you may even think of. So, I would suggest that you must make a visit to a psychiatrist with him. When medicine will start showing effect his diet will also improve apart from his behaviour, this will help in managing diabetes as well.You have asked if these symptoms are related to diabetes or not. Well, I have not gone across any such research work till now where diabetes itself is a cause for such symptoms in any patient. So, it looks unlikely to be so. As you have mentioned that he had a breakup, which can be taken as a stressor, I think it might be related to his current condition to some extent.Hope the reply is useful for youFeel free to ask more questionsDr. Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"I did a semen analysis and my results were : 6ml volume liqui less than 15min and total count of sperms 30million , my grade where 0% grade 4, 0percent grade 3, 5 percent grade 3 and 95percent grade 1(immotile)i got 70percent of abnormal forms and 6-8PUS and 3-4RBCs and 1-2 Spermatogenic cells.

He thought at that time it was safe. More data and unintended effects have been reported, some fairly dangerous. I am 60 yo, and have been taking 20 mg of zolpidem off and on for 15 years. I have tried the cognigitive therapy, etc. Have a new sleep study in December. I know as i get older, I should probably cut back on zolpidem. And better yet, get off of it. Any recommendations or options? Not that it matters that much, but I have a high pressure executive job, and if I do not sleep, I do not function well at all.

I fully realize one disease process is likely not responsible for all of this. Coronary arteries and carotid arteries are completely clear. Sleep issues, fatigue, muscle pain, and lack of concentratation seem to be my mayor issues. MRI showed 2 areas of decreased circulation in the brain, but those could have been from previous injuries. At this rate, I feel like I could live to 100 but will feel terrible every day. Ruled out depression early in the process. I am accomplished in my job, and I think that is how I cope.

Whilst it never started as a body issue, it was a huge preoccupation with food and how much of it I would allow myself. It got to the point where I lived off of coffee for 5 days straight. I am now 19 and struggling off and on throughout the years. I don t want this for myself, these feelings of hate and loss of self-control but all it ever takes is one comment against my weight (i have broad shoulders but weigh now 62 kilos at about 5 5) and it can dawn on me until I reach breaking point again. And there is honestly nothing I can do to stop myself from feeling that way, even if it s up to me. I want to feel happy and confident and i can t do that if I am unhappy with the way I look. At a point this year I was living off of fruit and vegetables and dropped around 7 kilos, but then i got warned from a close friend and it is also that little push from someone who cares to get me eating and happy again, obviously not straight away. But once I begin to eat, I find it hard to go back. And so this ridiculous cycle continues. Right in this moment, I am so very unhappy with myself, as I know I have gained that weight back and even through fitness - which I am often too tired from work, I cannot seem to lose any of it again. I don t know why I can t stay slim, I don t eat much for breakfast if at all. I am also a vegetarian and mostly dairy-free. Basically, I have no one to trust with all of this information, I feel silly, as if I can handle traveling across the world but not to look after myself. And I am so confused, I don t know what answers I am looking for, I suppose venting frustration helps to clean it from my mind for just one night of peaceful sleep. I am not underweight, not at all. But once I become in one of these moments shall I call them, I can get very fussy and particular and I look very ill very quickly as I get so tired and weak and pale and all I want in entire honesty is to be happy and healthy, yet I can t bring myself to do that! I still cut my food up into four if I can, I don t eat things if they are mixed with two kinds of foods and have before used laxatives and attempted vomiting. it s not as if you could notice if I hadn t of told you though, so does it really matter?

He was absolutely fine till last month, infact during the past couple of years, he was much more sensible than before and very creative and sharp in his ideas. He was shining in his official life too. But suddenly over some months he was not taking the tablets regularly thinking that he is normal and all is well. Then came back the symptoms. Again we had visited the doctor and he is under medication. My Questions: 1. Whether he has to take medication life long? 2. Is it true, that this illness is controllable and not curable? 3. Whether by taking Sizodon 1mg regularly, he can lead a normal life throughout his life span? Thanks, Anita","Doctor":"hi,Answer to your question:1. He may have to take medication Life long. If there is no symptoms after 1 year of discontinuation of medicine, then it can be stopped.2. Yes it is controllable, till now no evidence of its cure.3. He may require to change the medicine in near future as it is associated with high risk of death. Clozapine may be started but it has its own side effects.Hope i answered your queries.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have a a medium lump on the outside of my scotum, its on the skin on the outside not in , and it came in like 5 minutes, i think i just got bit by a bug down there or something.

Possibly, you should also have a specialist neurological consultation if your problem persists.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

I did not discuss it with anyone except the psychiatric team I was assigned to because I had the misfortune of discussing in detail what I would like to do to the couple who robbed me, stalked me and beat me up. For that outburst, months after the event the doctor I told this to stated he had to report me as a 5150. I was angry because I was now the bad guy, I was constantly told I had poor coping mechanisms and labeled Child Interrupted because I would not attend sessions. I was started on Seroquel 125mg and by the end of 1 year I was taking 400mg per night. I took it willingly because it made me sleep and helped with the panic attacks I often had at night. I realized after a year I was using the Seroquel for sleep and quit taking it. Within a few weeks I noticed my hands would shake uncontrollably which I thought was an escalation of the panic attacks. When I consulted with my doctor on this she was very outraged and again reiterated my unwillingness to come to terms with what had happened and fired me as a patient. I did my own research and learned I likely had Akathesia. I was put on Valium 5-10mg 3 times a day and was given Restoril for sleep. I have sensed moved to another state and the symptoms are under control with the treatment I am now on. I am now concerned how this will be viewed by a potential new employer and am curious if Restoril and Valiun are in the same drug category.. Thank you for any information you may give me.","Doctor":"Hi,Temazepam and Diazepam are both benzodiazepines and both will cause a positive test on any drug screen that tests for benzodiazepines. If that will be a problem in getting a new job, then you can see a doctor in the city where you are now and get yourself assessed again. If it is indeed panic attacks that you are suffering from, then taking an SSRI (Zoloft, Paxil etc) would be a better option as it will give you very good control over your symptoms without any risk of testing positive on drug screens. You are also likely to have difficulty in getting prescriptions for temazepam and diazepam for long, while you not face any such problem with an SSRI.Hope this helps you. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am a 33 year old female who has bipolar. I take a few medications to keep my mood stable which include tegretol, seroquel xr, seroquel, lithium and lamictal. I have a good relationship with my psychiatrist and am responsible about my health. I had been on trileptal which did well for a few years but then I went high and needed something stronger. My doctor put me on tegretol and it has helped with my moods. However for months I wasn t able to experience an orgasm. Then I felt almost over sensitised and sore in the outer genital area and still orgasms really weren t and aren t to this day possible. Might this change? Is there any herb that might help? I have tried many meds over the years and it is best that I stay on Tegretol as others I have tried (apart from the ones I am on now) had side effects that were intolerable or were in some way not a fit. If anyone could shed any light on this it would be great. Thank you for your time and care. Sorcha","Doctor":"Hi,Tegretol has only rarely been known to cause anorgasmia. In my opinion, you should first get your blood tested for serum prolactin levels to rule out hyperprolactinemia which is common in people on psychotropic medicines and causes inhibited orgasms. If you are found to have hyperprolactinemia, then the more likely causes would be antipsychotics like Seroquel. It can be treated with medicines and would not be a problem if you do not wish to change your treatment regimen. If there is no hyperprolactinemia, you will have to try reducing the dose of your medicines one at a time to identify the offending agent. Once you are sure that this is due to Tegretol or any other agent, you can consider changing it.Hope this helps you. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My son was killed in the line of duty in 2004. (police officer) At that time I went on Ambien in order to sleep. As time went on, mainly in the last two years I was taking one at night, one during an early nap in the afternoon and sometimes more than that. My family bugged me to get off so in July I told myself I could get off. I am was having alot of pain in my legs if I sat in a car or straight chair. Anyways my doctor recommended I take seroquel to help me get off Ambien. It seemed to help me get sleepy but lately has not helped me sleep for 6-7 hours. I teacher 2nd grade so have to be ready for combat duty (ha) I talked to my doctor yesterday and said I wanted to go back to Ambien but she said she would rather I did not and thought it would be better if I try something else. She prescribed trazodone 50 mg and I can take two a night. I took two and it made me sleepy but that was and hour and a half ago and I am wide awake. I am 62 and with working full tiime and teaching two nights on top of that, I need my sleep. That s all I want to do is sleep. Please let me know what you would suggest. I noticed I already had a bottle of trazodone in the cabinet so it probably did not help me sleep before. It was dated about 2 years ago. Help if you can. F Sawyers","Doctor":"Hi,In my opinion, you should combine non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep with your medicines (either Seroquel or trazodone) to get the best possible results without needing to overdose. Try simple techniques of improving sleep hygiene like avoiding naps in daytime, avoiding coffee or stimulants from evening onwards, eating your last meal at least two hours before bedtime, cutting down on alcohol etc. Also practice relaxation exercises like yoga or progressive muscular relaxation exercises to help your body relax and get good sleep. Taking only medicines will not solve your problem.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a graduate professor and teaching my counseling and marriage and family therapy students about different manifestations of depression (and DSM 5). I remembered that Seroquel is a recommended med. for agitated depression. Will most treatment protocols start with just the anti -d. and wait for 6 weeks before suggesting addition of an antipsychotic or antianxiety medication? Which is usually preferred additional med. (anti-d. or anxiolytic?) Thanks, Susan Goldman, Psy.D. Assistant professor at LIU graduate programs in counseling and drpsychotherapy","Doctor":"Greetings !Welcome to the site.Well you see the first drug of choice for agitated depression will be an anti depressant but since an anti depressant will take around 2-3 weeks at least to reach steady state plasma levels and start producing it's controlling action over agitated depression therefore quite often an anxiolytic drug like a benzodiazepine such as clonazepam or lorazepam shall be added right from the start because these drugs have faster onset of action against agitation as they shall bring in the calming effect within 1 week of their use thereby allowing the chief anti depressant drug to take it's time to settle down in the body system and bring out it's action. Once the anti depressant starts producing it's action , say after 2-3 weeks then you may start to bring the person off the anxiolytic drug since they are used only for a short period.So anti depressant is the first line drug in this condition where as one has to choose between an anxiolytic or seroquel as an add on drug and between these two due to faster onset of action an anxiolytic like benzodiazepine shall be the first choice.I hope this helps.Wish you all the best.Regards"},{"Patient":"I am postmenopausal and use Anafranil for depression and was told by the doctor I will probably have to take it for the rest of my life after trying to stop it gradually every once in awhile I was told not to stop all at once and to ween off gradually.

Several months ago, after several suicide attempts, self harm, homicidal thoughts, bouts of rapid anger that led me to scream at people over nothing and once or twice to randomly start strangling and animal, stop and not even know why I did what I just did, panic attacks,mood swings and several other things, my parents decided to takd me to the doctor.I was diagnosed as bipolar and the doctor gave me a mood stabilizer.what didn t really make the depression or mood swings go away, it did help to stabalize my mood.next time I saw the pschiatrist, my parents told him that they had noticed not only changes in my mood but also changes in my personality. I was more social and outgoing and talked more as well as changes in humor sense conversation style and several other changes in my personality. They thought the changes were good and they didn t notice any major changes. According to them, the aspects of my personality that had changed were all just symptoms of a disorder and the medicine fixed them, so that their going away was a sign that I was getting better and becoming who I really am. Up until then, I had no idea I had changed. I didn t like the idea that I had changed because it means that I m no longer the real me in my eyes. I m who the medicine has made me and I m now a different person than who I really am. Those aspects of my personality were a part of what made me me and I hate that a medicine changed me without me even knowing. Now to the actual question. I used to hear voices a lot. They told me to kill myself and others as well as other things, but they went away. Recently, they ve come back so now, my doctor has given me Risperidone, a medicine he says will make the voices go away and stay away. I m worried that the antipschotic he gave me will change my personality even more and I ll endd up as another person who is completely different than myself. So, could antipschotics change me? Will they?

Then I managed to land a job in a place where the upper level manager is an emotional abuser.  I sensed it from the moment that I had an interview with him as if he did not want me to work there.  I reported directly to this other supervisor who did some questionable things like always being critical of my one co worker.  He eventually fell ill and had a long term medical leave.  I started to stress out as soon as he was gone.  Then I learned of many different individuals that had come and gone within this particular group within a short frame of time.  My supervisor eventually quit without another job lined up just like a few other individuals.  Then I started getting blind sided by this upper level manager because we had no manager in between.  I feel numb,  still a bit bitter by his put downs because it was like I was his punching bag on an emotional level.  I feel frozen about finding another job but I don't want to make the mistake of landing in another rough environment like the one that I had come from.  He was borderline stalking me even while I ended up in the hospital.I was just invited to 1 week of free endless fitness training courses for kickboxing.

This stressful job ended up landing me in the hospital.","Doctor":"hello there, there seems to be a problem in confidence and overall fear of the unknown. this is surely an anxiety problem. diversion is one of the best way to overcome this. however, in your case you tend to gi back to your worries. the past job could have caused you to go down in this type of situation and getting another job should do the trick. follow your instinct on seeking another type of work or envirenment. it is just like hiiting two birds with one stone. having a new job will recover your confidence and self integrity. and having a new job would let you forget your previous bad job experience. put this in your mind and you will face the interview with enthusiasm. just set your mind to make good in this interview and that you badly need this job so that you will appear focused and firm on getting this new job. it is all in your will actually. you can do it. you will surely feel better after this interview. feel free to give us feedback after this. thank you dr. eric"},{"Patient":"I m a doctor anaesthetist.

Please help","Doctor":"Welcome to health care magic!I have gone through your question and from that it looks like she needs medicines, along with counselling. For counselling sessions to be successful the patient and caretakers, all have to do their homework and follow advices given in therapy. I don't think that your wife is able to carry them adequately. In mood swings patient also cannot control her/ his behaviour....moreover, with so much disturbance in mood, it is more likey that with medicines, it can be controlled, and later she can accept therapy sessions easily.Please see a psychiatrist, a detailed interview and may be some psychological tests will clear her diagnosis. If she takes counselling sessions, I think with some efforts she might agree to take medicines also.medicines do help a lot and are not addicting .... the details provided are not enough to pinpoint the diagnosis but looks like may be a case of bipolar disorder! or personality problem or some paranoid state???Both of you are reputed doctors, I can understand your problem but I think she really needs to see a psychiatrist and take treatment. I can say that with proper medicines she will definitely improve, we see such cases getting better everyday. Donot loose Hope.Feel free to ask more questions related to this.

As you said that the family atmosphere is disturbed and there is marital discord between parents, you must help her by taking an early appointment with a doctor. It is almost sure that without treatment things will not improve but may actually worsen.You said that she tried to kill herself ten times, which is quite a big number, and indicates a CRY for help....Please help her by convincing her to meet a psychiatrist.

This can be managed by adhering to and practicing proper sleep hygiene and taking a sleep aid drug at night so that till morning you can get a refreshing uninterrupted sleep which shall correct this sleep-wake cycle disturbance.You shall ask your family doctor to place you on a sleep aid drug called as zopidem at dose of 5mg to be taken at night half to one hour before sleep  for at least 2 weeks which will bring back the normal sleep pattern . Alongside use of this drug you shall practice below mentioned sleep hygiene.1) fix a  time for sleep and waking up and rigorously adhere to that to establish discipline.2) wear loose clothes , sleep in a well ventilated room which is dimly lighted.3) Avoid heavy meals and coffee or aerated drinks at night.4) Avoid watching television or listening to music late at night instead read a book or novel if not getting sleep at the desired time.5) Do regular exercises and yoga along with maintenance of a healthy diet schedule.6) change your sleeping room or bed for a few days so as to try a new environment for sleeping which can re-establish sleep at the desired time.7) Avoid taking alcoholic beverages at night time.So you shall apply this sleep hygiene in combination with zolpidem and hopefully this will take care of your underlying problem.As soon your normal sleep returns your stomach condition shall improve.I hope this helps.Wish you all the best.Regards"},{"Patient":"Im 85 years old and i live with my 62 year old daugter,She is very stressed and always stressed, she denighs it and says Im always doing every thing wrong'She says I make her sick and wont let me talk to any one about it,she saysI make her sick, Shes here because my kids say I cant live alone and they all work and my only problem is I cant drive any more,She wont let me,I dont know what to do about it,","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your description.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by E K G & ECHO  of heart.3 Tension and anxiety develops acute pain behind sternum due to esophagitis .Diagnosis can be confirmed by clinical as well history of illness by a physician.In my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion.Good luck.

It can be dangerous and may lead to seizures also.   If you don't want to see a doctor for detoxification, then go for gradual reduction in alprax dosage, may be one- two tablets in a day initially. one would a so give him good multi vitamins. It will be good if you start reducing the morning and afternoon doses initially and then the night ones. One may need to add an antipsychotic if he continues to be fearful or suspicious.When you say that patient talks out of context, it needs to be checked if he develops \\"delirium\\".

My therapist gave me the test but did not really explain the results because I was looking to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. But I am having trouble finding a one. So I looked up the test online and looked at what the numbers meant. If I understand the basic outline of each number then I feel like I am pretty much out of luck. The numbers are not related, the condition each correlates to is not a progressive stage of one condition. So how exactly do I go about fixing things, when nothing seems to make sense? Both of my children have ADHD. Now having experience with the symptoms, I am pretty sure I have it as well, and the therapist agrees. But the other issues make me feel like I am fighting a losing battle to be normal . Do you have any suggestions? And any suggestions on finding a psychiatrist?","Doctor":"Welcome to Health care magic and thank you for asking the question.First I would like to say that scores on the MMPI are indicative of personality traits and not disorder. Scoring high on certain scales indicates that you have increased traits corresponding to that scale but it does not mean that you have suffering from that disorder. To make the diagnosis you need to consult the psychiatrist. Now the scores:  (As you have not mentioned the scale names, I am considering the scale number according to the 'Total Code by Welsh'.)Scale 4- The Psychopathic Deviate scale. - High scores indicate that you have absence of deep emotional response. Such individual have episodes of abnormal behaviour but generally remain normal and lead a normal life.Scale 7 - The Psychasthenia Scale - It indicates that you have phobias and compulsive behaviour. The degree can vary from not disabling to disabling. If you can do your routine work nothing to worry.Scale 8 - The Schizophrenia Scale- High scores do not diagnose schizophrenia so do not worry. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder and need detailed assessment before commenting on it. Anyways high scores only indicate that you may have unusual thoughts coming into your mind. Again I will say high score does not mean that you have schizophrenia so do not worry.Scale 9 - The Hypomania Scale- High scores indicate that you have overproductiviy of thoughts and actions.In my opinion if you are having trouble with some features of any of the scales you need counselling and behavior therapy to modify the troubling behavior.

Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I have a very specific kind of nightmare that I have swallowed a metal coin like a quarter. I wake feeling the coin in my throat, or in my esophagus. I try to stop my swallowing because I am convinced that if I swallow, I will choke. some times I run to get a glass of water. I can happen several times on the same night.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry too much.  The condition you are in could be termed as illusion or delusion in psychological language. Several people do have such problems of imagining problems and so many different happenings. Someone might think that someone is always watching him, others that they hear someone talking, someone sing etc, others cannot experience it.This is not necessarily from past experiences. They include current experiences also. therefore, instead worrying about the past, concentrate on present and future. Everyone has negative experiences in the past. They have come out of the negative thoughts of that incident. Not to worry always about it. You should try to divert your thoughts about the choking coin into more creative hobbies. You need psychotherapy and other cognitive behavioral therapies. I can help you through telephone if you desire so. Please do contact me through customer care of www.healthcaremagic.com for a telephonic consultation session. Hope you understand the situation.

So how do I stop them because my doctor told me it's dangerous to do so.","Doctor":"Hi, No need to panic much. The first thing is Anti depressants work in such a way that there is individual variation in their action which means each anti-depressant has different action on each individual and different is effective on different person. So, if sertra doesn't work on you, other drug might work better. Consult a Psychiatrist so that he can advise a right drug for you.Second thing, definitely sertra can be stopped but not abruptly. Your doctor[Psychiatrist] will suggest a right alternative for you and tapper the dose of sertra gradually in order avoid withdrawl symptoms. Consult the psychiatrist as soon as possible.Hope this might help."},{"Patient":"I am on a lot of meds. I was put on Lyrica and mt doise of wellbutrin was raised from 300 to 450.

I dont know what to do.Sorry, am on a stipend of actually 750 a month and cant afford ur service","Doctor":"HelloLyrica is pregabalin and wellbutrin is bupropion. Bupropion is a good anti-depressant drug and it is commonly used in mild depression cases and some anxiety conditions. Pregabalin is also used in anxiety disorders. Wellbutrin is usually used in 150-300 mg doses. The increase in dose from 300 to 450 has resulted in increased anxiety and severe restlessness. As per my opinion you should decrease the dose to 300 mg again and then see your psychiatrist.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello I am a RN helping my niece with information gathering.  She was on Lupron in the past and side effects were horrific but did perserve thru it to no avail.  Still having severe pain and she is awaiting a consult with a Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis clinic.  In the mean time her Gyne doc gave her a RX for Visanne.  She has hx of depression is on zoloft.  Can you shed any light on the the similarities with Lupron and this new med.","Doctor":"HelloLupron is luperolide and it is a drug that is mainly used in various conditions like endometriosis. The drug act on pituitary gland and thus suppresses the GnRH, a hormone of pituitary. Zoloft is sertaline and this is an antidepressant and anti anxiety drug of SSRI group. Both these drugs are different in mechanisms of action and are of different groups.Visanne is a drug that is introduced recently for long term management of endometriosis. It is a progesterone derivative that is free of serious side effects and it has some androgen action also. It is different from lupron if we consider mechanism of action.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I'm a 35 yr old female who has abused opiates on and off for 10 years.

Currently you are having severe anxiety, panic attacks, depressive symptoms and bipolar disorder. See opium cause dependence in terms of both physical and psychological domains. The long term effect of opiate withdrawal even last for 6 months to 1 years in form of anxiety attacks, craving of drug and other behavioral symptoms. But they don't occur continuously. These type of symptoms are also called as protracted withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms will decrease in severity with time.

They are used most commonly for depression and anxiety. These drugs would be more effective for your anxiety than either ativan or xanax.Xanax and ativan are benzodiazepines and are no longer first line for anxiety because of the possibility of sedation, addictive potential and tolerance.If you are experiencing difficulty sleeping, you may want to continue the cipralex as prescribed and also use the xanax or ativan for a short period.It is usually best not to use them for a long period of time.You may want to speak to your doctor about definitive treatment for the fibromyagia.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My mother is 91 years of age and suffers from dementia and has suddenly begun to sleep almost all day and night, is having hallucinations, has a decrease in appetite and seems very disoriented at times - she doesn't want any medical care even though it has been offered - is this something that is part of the aging process or is this a sudden acute problem.","Doctor":"Hi,The sudden change in her mental state, especially the excessive sleep, disorientation and hallucinations suggest that she might be in delirium.

I don't think the Lexapro I am on is working but I don't have a clue as what I need to be on. My doctor is leaving it up to me but I don't know what to do. Help.","Doctor":"Hi,Lexapro and other SSRIs can take around six to eight weeks to show their full response. So I feel that you need to be on 20 mg Lexapro for a few more weeks to be able to say that it is not working. While 20 mg is an adequate dose for Lexapro, for Effexor the dose that you tried was just the starting dose and should have been built up to around 150 to 300 mg per day. If Lexapro shows no response even after a few more weeks, there are many strategies to augment the effect of Lexapro. Addition of bupropion, buspirone, thyroxine, lithium etc are well known measures. Psychotherapy is also a good option. Please do not worry. If you have not consulted a psychiatrist so far, then please do so as it is possible that your family physician may be finding it difficult to manage your depression now.Hope this helps you.

I have been in and out of therapy twice, the first for abuse and the second for self-harm. I just stopped going 10 months ago I think and even though another appointment was scheduled, i never went back. she asked me if I wanted meds and i think they were keeping important stuff from me because i know im not right. i started to self-harm again and i make it look like accidents but they sting and i feel guilty and ashamed about it but not really. im mostly fine with it and just do it out of boredom now. i did it out of depression the other day though but i do it worse when im bored. I feel like im always being watched and talked about and i hear people say my name when no ones there or they say they never said it. i hear people or things follow me but when i turn around or look towards them, they aren't there. i hear knocks on the walls when no one makes them and i am home alone. i get angry a lot and confused and ive got memory spots that are these like gaps between stuff. i remember getting kicked and sexual abuse but theres other things that went on that mom says i forgot. she wont tell me what happened. i know stuff without being told like when i randomly asked out of the blue if my dad had abused my mom. no one ever told me but i said it and it was true. i forget things on purpose sometimes but then i cant remember. mom says i \\"switch\\" sometimes. she says sometimes ill act like a little girl and sometimes an adult. sometimes i act like a boy but then i act like me. i just started getting insomnia but im really tired. im scared of the nightmares im scared of how vulnerable i am when i am sleeping. im afraid someone will come and kill me. i have nightmares of it and im never able to scream. no one comes to save me. no one can save me. sometimes im affection and like hugs and scream and run and sometimes i want to be left alone but not alone alone. i dont want to be alone but i dont want to talk or have physical contact. i get angry sometimes, a rage that makes me want to scream and fight the source but im smart i learned not to. if i do i get yelled at and i dont want to get yelled at. every time i do i cry and my mom scream at me that im faking but im not. i learned fast. ive always been like this but not really this bad. i get empty where i cant even feel love for my special person i think hes not right either and he is so important because he listens and knows not to yell and tried his best but hes in severe depression with many health problems and he doesnt need me to make it worse. ive been alone for a long time and i dont want to lose him. he constantly reassures me that hes not going to hurt me but i cant shake the feeling. my concentration is slipping away and i have to be doing a lot of things to make me concentrate, like listening to music, drawing and answering the question. I move, i dont like still. the first therapist tested me for ADD but she said i didnt have it. she didnt like me. she always blamed me for everything. she said me mom was the victim and i was the bad thing. i didnt like her. the other one was nice and she really tried. but i dont think she knew what she was doing plus it make me uncomfortable to do therapy in a church with all the bad things i did. ive been told i might go blind when i grow up and i like to draw. its my life and being blind would end everything for me. im scared of it and people never believe me or listen so they cant help how i feel. i think theres more stuff but i cant think of it right now. since im scared to ask for help i wanted to ask behind my screen. do you think theres something wrong? or are you like everyone else?","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, there indeed is something wrong and should be treated well. The problems that you have described make me feel that you need to be assessed for borderline personality disorder with possibly a co-morbid depressive episode and it will be good if you could see a psychiatrist or a trained therapist. Since you mention that you liked your second therapist better, you can discuss this possibility with her and see what her views are. Ask her if she would be willing to see you in a place other than the church, as you do not feel comfortable there. You have not mentioned why you expect to go blind in future, but if you think that it will be a punishment for all the mistakes you made, just get rid of the notion. All human beings make mistakes, but God is very forgiving. Please do not feel uncomfortable about being in a church. It is a place of love and not punishment.Hope you get better soon.

Probably this is why you are still in pain in spite of being on such a high dose of opioids.

In my opinion, you should try alternative methods of pain relief like nerve blocks, acupuncture etc. Even if these bring only some relief, you will at least be in a better position than now.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I was taking Prozac for over a decade.

From your description, it appears that you are suffering from Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) with anxious ruminations along with some components of Major Depressive Disorder. However, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), a disease characterised by repetitive, intrusive, distressing, irrational thoughts, images or impulses (regarded as products of patient's own mind), needs to be ruled out before making a final diagnosis in your case.If I would a seen a patient with your complaints, I would have first confirmed the diagnosis by a detailed work up including thorough history taking and mental status and physical examination. If confirmed, I would have started with an SSRI (antidepressant) like Sertraline or Paroxetine or Escitalopram along with a benzodiazepine like Clonazepam or Etizolam to decrease the anxiety and induce sleep. Over weeks, I would have escalated the dose of SSRI and deescalated the   dose of benzodiazepine. I would have also suugested a behavior therapy, like biofeedback, as means of non pharmacologic treatment to aid the management.Please remember that GAD is a very common disorder encountered in clinical practice, and most cases are manageable with 6- 8 months of compliant therapy. Therefore, I would request you not to lose hope, and to consult a competent psychiatrist near you for detailed evaluation and management of your problem. Moreover, I would also suggest you for an evaluation of your daughter for any anxiety disorder or depression, as these are quite common in children and need a detailed evaluation and treatment as soon as possible.Hope I've been able to satisfy your query.

I have a successful proffessional carrier but they hate me,put me down criticise me all time.........","Doctor":"Hi,You have been through a very difficult life and you did your best for your sons. I guess they both are adults now and you should stop feeling responsible for them now. Next time they blame you for their problems, tell them clearly and assertively without raising your voice that you did what you did your best and if that was not good enough, then you cannot do anything else. Do not let them make you feel guilty and put you on the defensive. Children often take their parents for granted, knowing that they can get away with anything. But limit setting is necessary. If they know that you will inform the police if they hit you, then obviously they will never hit you again. What I mean to say is that it should be conveyed to them very clearly that you are not weak and will not tolerate any misbehavior. It certainly will not be easy to do so for you, but there is no other way out. It is good that your husband is supportive and you can take his help in dealing with your children.Hope this helps you.

Since last 3 1/2 years she is taking anti-depressants. During that tenure, thrice she was on the verge of coming out of medication but treatment was re-started after she again started showing depression symptoms. The most recent symptoms shown before re-starting medicine were constant pain of left side of head and anxieties and crying. Currently she is taking Nexito Forte. I have two questions? Currently, she is putting on more weight than required... can it be because of this medicine and will it harm baby?.  and secondly, being on anti-depressants for so long ....will it impact my wife's health in long-term and will she ever come out of taking anti-depressants?","Doctor":"Hi,I do not feel that the excess weight gain is due to Nexito Forte as all SSRIs, including escitalopram which is the main ingredient in Nexito Forte, are known to cause weight loss. In my opinion, you must check her thyroid status as hypothyroidism can cause both weight gain and recurrent depression. Please also see if she is taking a diet too rich in fats. Regarding your second question, being on antidepressants for a long time is not expected to have any deleterious effect on her health in the long term. Most patients are able to discontinue antidepressants and I expect she too will be able to do so, provided it is done properly and at the right time.Hope this helps you.

But recently, he had started telling that the neighbours are following him. So the doc gave him schizoril. But he doesnt want to take the schizoril. what to do? Also as a sister, ( i am married, I do not stay with him), how can I help him to get cured? Dialy i call him, and try to push him to a job. But all in vain.","Doctor":"Hi,Skizoril (clozapine) is a very effective medicine but is usually prescribed only when other antipsychotics have failed, because of the serious side effects and need for regular blood monitoring. If he was missing the doses of Rispond plus intermittently, then it is possible that the appearance of new symptoms was due to non-compliance and not because the drug was ineffective for him. If this is so, then he may not need to be given Skizoril. Use of depot injections of antipsychotics can solve your problem as he will just need to take one injection every two to three weeks. Please discuss this option with your doctor. Do not push him to get a job at present as he is not mentally fit now and is unlikely to be able to hold on to the job if he joins one.Hope this helps you.

Murmurs are extra sounds, heard by the doctor through the stethoscope, that are produced as blood flows through an opening changed by disease or birth defect. Echocardiography records these blood flow measurements and converts them into pressure gradients, the difference in pressure between one side of the opening (at a valve, for example) and the other side, thus telling the doctor how severe the damage is. With the help of this test, the physician can determine how leaky or narrowed the valve is and identify which patients might benefit from medicines or corrective surgery.So you need not get worried because medicines are there for minor heart problems and if necessary it can be cured by surgery.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My parents and adult children have told me I am anorexic and I am wondering if I tell you what is going on if you could tell me if they are correct?

I feel that your family is right in saying that this could be anorexia nervosa. Many times this may be brought on by stressful events like the one you suffered. Please ensure that your psychiatrist is aware of your abnormal eating pattern and laxative use, so that he or she can assess you and treat you better. You also need to be evaluated for co-morbid depressive and anxiety disorders which are common in such conditions and make treatment difficult.Hope this helps you. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My sister has been having visual disturbances x3 years and has been examined by many specialists.  She recently had a head CT to R/O any tumors, etc.. with normal findings.  I checked her meds and found out a s/e for  Lopressor which causes hallucination, both auditory & visual.  How you every had a patient on Lopressor that has experienced this type of problem?","Doctor":"Hi,While none of my patients have reported hallucinations with metoprolol (Lopressor), hallucinations with metoprolol are well known and have been described in literature. You can read the case series by Goldner ( published last year in a reputed journal for more information. If, on reading this, you feel that your sister's symptoms are also similar, please request her doctor to consider changing metoprolol to another agent and see if her visual disturbance improves. If it does, then it proves that metoprolol was the culprit.I hope this is of help to you.

Two weeks later I had an MRI done which came back normal except for total blockage in my sinuses, I was given steroids and antibiotics but my condition did not improve. I have had a an abdominal and pelvic CT scan and everything was normal. My blood work was normal except for elevated white blood count, elevated proteins , low vitamin D . This past summer I was diagnosed with gastroparesis , non alcoholic fatty liver disease and polycystic ovary disease, I have not had a period in 5 years. I recently had an EEG done by a neurologist and it was abnormal, he said I had diffused slowing and spikes in the background. He thinks I may have had an acute case of bacterial meningitis due to my severe sinusitis and these are the after effects. His final diagnosis was metabolic encephalopathy, he scheduled a follow up sleep deprived EEG to rule out a seizure disorder. I m afraid it something worse like Creutzefeld Jacob Disease. I have no family history of neurological illness. I still have the sinusitis and am taking estradiol and progesterone.","Doctor":"In addition to the advise by neurologist, in my opinion, you need to consult an endocrinologist who will estimate your hormonal profile like thyroid level, estrogen, progesterone FSH etcAlso, important to consult psychiatristContinue taking vit D till it comes to normal level or as advised by doctorCreutzefild jacob disease, to me seems less likely"},{"Patient":"sir,i was full of cheer and lead a happy life until june this year.suddenly something happened.it started to feel like there's a big hole some where.i started to think to figure out what it is and continued to think.nothing was there to make me sad.i have everything.but yet im very much sad and i think alot.when it comes to thinking i cant stop my self from that.as a result i even failed one of my exams.the thing is i always tend to think about negative things in life and the negative ways the life would be.there s no way for me to stop my self from thinking like that.i would be really pleased if you could figure out what my problem could be.thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,These problems could indicate that you are depressed.

It gives protection more than 95% against unwanted pregnancy when it is taken within first 24hrs with proper dose.Next, you got withdrawal bleeding after 7 days due to effect of the pill and it is quite common & normal phenomena. Other possibility is implantation bleeding in the failure of ECP which can occur 1 week prior to period due date.Early pregnancy test is not significant.

There have been only a few case reports describing this. In addition to Endep, stress could also have contributed to some extent to the rise in your blood pressure.

You know that 'YOU' as a person started existing in this world as a single celled organism in your mother's womb when the half cell of your father in the form of sperm and half cell of your mother in the form of ovum got united. Your present structure of your body was there in the single cell in a miniature form. You know that your present mind also originated from that single cell. If your body and mind took their origin from that primordial single cell, your health also should have its origin from your parents. Then what about your ill health? It also should have its origin definitely from your parents. We call this genetic science in Homoeopathy the theory of Miasms. This simply means your health and disease are decided by your genetics. Your environments influence you positively or negatively to precipitate your inborn genetic tendencies in the form of various diseases. Now coming back to your panic attacks. You have agreed that you are hypersensitive physically to smell, food items etc. Similarly your mind also is hypersensitive to the extent of producing panic attacks. Till date you have not got any curative treatment because conventional medicine does not have at present a genetic and constitutional treatment method to help you and that is why your doctors explained it away as electrical. The reasons you mention are only triggering factors and till this day you are not cured.I am a Homoeopath and therefore I can confidently say that Homoeopathy can cure you because Homoeopathy is the only method today that considers your genetics and constitution to find your curative individualistic remedy. In Homoeopathy there are 37 remedies to cure your sudden fear or panic. Out of them which remedy will cure you can be decided by an expert Homoeopathic physician only.Therefore you are advised to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest.

These are usually more than required at that moment or for that situation. It also looks that you do later feel guilt about the same but unable to control it. You need to tell me that what is your general overall mood and what is the duration of these ups and downs. Your condition can be due to some personality factors in which person has extreme positive and extreme negative moods but nothing in \\"grey\\" zone. They also have difficulty in making long term relationships. The condition is usually from a long duration. It can also be due to a condition called \\"bipolar disorder\\" in which mood fluctuates between very low to very high with or without any external event. However, usually the duration of either mood change lasts for weeks or months. I have seen such cases and from my experience I can say that it can be aggravated due to your current conditions: 1. not in studies actively; 2. No work to keep you busy; 3. have limited friend circle who are free to accompany you.If I were in your place I would -1. visit a psychiatrist and talk about my condition in detail2. keep myself busy with some kind of job, even part-time would help3. go for walks, do work-outs, as it would keep me in better physical and mental health4. talk to some one close regarding my feelings openlyHope this answer helps you, please feel free to ask further if you need.Dr. Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"hello, i'am 26 yrs old female. recently found i have vertigo and my doctor suggested tablet vertin and a sleeping dose. for past 20 days im having these tablets but only 30 % of the problem is solved. i'am bit overweight and was doing tredmil but i'am not able to continue doing it because of my giddiness. this causes more stress and depression in me since i have my wedding on jan, and before that i wanted to reduce my weight, what should i do?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your problem descriptions.

You could consider using walking sticks for the short-term to aid mobility which may take some of the effort and strain out of moving.I wish you a speedy recovery.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB  FRCA"},{"Patient":"What are some initial signs/symptoms of aging?  I have a close friend that I am noticing changes in that are causing us concerns.  He is 66  Previously he was quick witted; could solve mathematical problems before everyone.  Now he seems somewhat dull, slow and frequently responds with I don't know when asked everyday questions.","Doctor":"Thank you for asking on HCM.In my opinion your friend may be suffering from severe depression or dementia.In aging decline occurs in virtually all the body systems including cognition but 66 years old people are generally able to perform the day to day activities, calculations and lead a normal life.If there is low mood, lack of interest in life activities, episodes of crying, feeling of guilt, lack of energy to do routine things, feelings of worthlessness, consider depression. In severe depression, ability to do simple calculations can also get impaired. The patient can also forget things in depression.If he is forgetting route to his home, his address, has tendency of getting lost, has impaired memory then consider dementia.I would suggest you to get him evaluated from a Psychiatrist so that proper diagnosis is made and treatment started in the right direction.I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi, first - sorry for my english, I'm from Czech republic.

However, as you had surgery in the testicles, probably you had un-descended testicles, therefore you should do scrotal ultrasound to know the exact cause of this problem.

I do not have any pain with it. Generally I am in good health. I am however, tired from a very busy life and do get breathless in the middle of the night when I am asleep. I am told that the latter is anxiety related. Therefore I am wondering if (or hoping that) perhaps this  twitchy artery is also stress related as I am in pretty good health. I also have other tics and shrugs - think I probably have a mild form of Tourettes  which manifests itself again when I am busy and have a lot going on.","Doctor":"Thank you for asking on HCM.In my opinion your twitchy/pulsating artery in the left temple with no other associated symptoms is not indicative of any disease process. It is a part of the physical symptoms of anxiety and stress that you are experiencing like breathlessness at night. You need to worry about the pulsating feelings of the artery and seek treatment for your anxiety.I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I am a certified holistic RN and I do healing work on all levels. I have an 11 YO client with diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. What is the best medication for him to be on while his brain chemistry is being balanced thru more natural healing work?Would enhancing his seratonin and dopamine levels help?What is the role of norepinephrine in his brain chemistry?","Doctor":"Greetings !Well first of all it is wrong to diagnose a person with both Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia at the same time since both these conditions are mutually exclusive of each other. However a positive thing in providing treatment for both of these conditions is that an anti psychotic medication like olanzapine or quetiapine or aripiprazole works very effectively in both the conditions by lowering the dopamine levels in the brain since excessive dopamine levels in the brain have been considered to have been associated with either of these conditions. So practically speaking use of an anti psychotic drug shall help your client irrespective if he is schizophrenia or bipolar disorder but more importantly i will urge you to get a revision of your diagnosis of the patient since first he is too young to have a diagnosis such as these and secondly the diagnosis is not correct since both these conditions cannot be labelled in the person simultaneously.Role of norepinephrine and serotonin is limited in such a patient, drugs which may increase their levels in the brain may help in treating depression ( if the person is bipolar disorder) or negative symptoms ( if the person is schizophrenic).I hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"mysix year old granddaughter is telling authorites that she is chocked abused and that we put our hands over babies mouths when they cry this is not true the chidren have been removed pending an investigatrion she does this every time she is diaplined last time she wrote letters to her worker and counsler what can be done to help her tell the truth she also has a habit of stealing we do not know what to do for her or the situation","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt would be best to seek the assistance of a child psychologist or psychiatrist for assistance.

They should NOT be taken for long durations unless thoughtfully prescribed by a doctor for that duration (which are done in very few cases- tension not being one of them). They have addictive properties and give a lot of trouble during stoppage of the drug. The problems being faced by your husband is either withdrawal due to stoppage of lonazep (but since he was maintaining well for an year without any medications, it is less likely) or the underlying disorder has surfaced up again. For the latter, there are many options to treat anxiety with safer drugs like selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs). Kindly visit your psychiatrist and discuss the same. Also, therapies like cognitive behavior therapy will be very helpful to overcome the problem. Hope this helps,Dr A Rao"},{"Patient":"Yes. My younger sister is on the following drugs:  Zoloft, Lamictal, Klonipin, Seroquel, Remeron, and Lunesta.  She had a major depressive episode 7 years ago when her daughter's boyfriend committed suicide and she was drinking after that and got in an accident and lost her driver's license. She is constantly sleepy and in a zombie like stupor. She has not touched alcohol since the accident. She wants to get her driver's license again, get a job and get her life back. She has had fainting spells, breathing difficulties, heart problems and a multitude of other things. She called me for help since I spoke to her psyc dr and got him to change her meds once before.  She asked him herself but he wouldn't consider it. I think she should change docs. What should we do? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to us, I have gone through the provided history. Whether the drugs are right for her or not depends on how much improvement she has shown so far. She is currently on two antidepressants ( Zoloft and Remeron), two sleeping pills/sedatives ( Klonipin and Lunesta), one mood stabilizer (Lamictal)  and an antipsychotic (Seroquel). Firstly, get her evaluated for the physical problems she has by a general physician and if necessary, get the required treatment and rule out depressive illness to be a cause of these problems (yes depressive illness can present with such complaints). Secondly, a second antidepressant is added only after the first antidepressant is optimally tried for sufficient duration. You have not mentioned those details hence i would not be able to comment on that. And in my opinion there is no need for two types of sedatives and taking it only at night would avoid the drowsiness she experiences. If these drugs have been used for a long duration then they should not be stopped abruptly, especially klonopin. It has dependent or addictive properties due to which it is prescribed only for a short duration. Also, Remeron has sedative properties. The benefits of this drug needs to be weighed against the sedative side effect. Kindly talk to her psychiatrist regarding this. It is better if a family member accompanies the patient to a psychiatrist because he/she can get more reliable history about the patient.

His level of frustration and anxiety are high due to his short term memory loss. Thank you so much in advance for your help!","Doctor":"Hello friend,To diagnose the condition of your friend as alcohol related dementia is not right. If he had the diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome 8 years back, he must have been drinking heavily for several years now. You are under the impression that he is sick because he is alcoholic. As a Homoeopath, I should say that he drinks heavily because he is sick. Alcoholism is a destructive habit and this destructive tendency is in his constitution or to be more specific, in his genes. To conclude, he is born with destructive tendencies. This must have been evident in all his mental and physical make ups. As friends, you might have observed that this destructive process was manifested through his thoughts, deeds and actions of his past history. The dementia now you are talking about is again another destructive process originated from his genes. The same destruction is taking place in all his cells, tissues, organs and systems. Why I am telling this is to make you convinced that any amount of chemical drugs under the banner \\"anti\\" like anti psychotic or anti Alzeimer's is not going to help him. They may \\"control\\" some of his symptoms like frustration or anxiety thereby speeding up his -sorry to say -end. What he should have got from his early childhood or at an early age and what he did not get so far is a genetic and constitutional treatment. All his symptoms were suppressed till date and you friends are even now thinking about suppressive treatment further. I am not finding fault with you because you do not know that there exists a newer system of treatment called Homoeopathy where his genetics, constitution, individualisation, peculiar personalized symptoms are considered as very important in treatment . To conclude, you can take your friend to an expert Homoeopathic physician at the earliest. He will enjoy better health than his present state and can survive in a better  condition. You can also contact me by asking a premium follow up question . I can help you to prepare his case by sending a case receiving format on request. Please avoid chemo drugs any more. If he is on them, try to taper them gradually and finally stop them altogether . He will be in a better condition by that. With Best Wishes,Dr C. J.

I do not like being down with pain and don't want to spend my life on demirol!!","Doctor":"Hi and tank you so much for this query.I am so soryy to hear about your recent diagnosis with pancreatitis. Stress is not a known cause of pancreatitis. However, alcohol, heavy fatty meals and smoking are the major risk factors for acute pancreatitis. Even without risk factors, you can still develop pancreatitis!I am happy you are considering modifying your taking. also, demirol and good fluid intake would help you recover soon. Unless it gets complicated, acute pancreatitis would not require that you stay on drugs all your life for pain control. Stay positive and hope for a complete healing from this. Rest would also be a great addition to recovering quick fro this.I hope this answers your query fully. I wish you well, a complete healing and thanks for using our services. Feel free to ask for clarifications if need be.Dr. Ditah, MD"},{"Patient":"I am 37, female, I have general anxiety disorder with panic attacks. For about 2 years now after my gall bladder removal surgery , I have been experiencing frequent, loose bowel movements after all of my meals. As of about 4 months ago I developed a dull achy abdomenal pain in my lower left side. Sometimes I feel faint when this occurs. Would really like to know whats going on...","Doctor":"Hi Dear Welcome to the Health Care Magic.Irritable bowel syndrome is the most accurate possible diagnosis for the such symptomatology. Stool routine and microscopic examination and stool culture are the investigations to rule out the infectious etiology of the dull achy pain in the lower left side. For this Amoebiasis is the near probable diagnosis which can easily be treated with a course of metronidazole, and with some antimicrobial according to the culture report.Hope the query is answered.Thanks"},{"Patient":"my husband was just prescribed Prednisone, 60mg, once daily for 3 days to help fight the fatigue he is experiencing.  He is a 3 year Stage IV Lung Cancer survivor, and we are not sure if the fatigue is from the cancer, the Xalkori, the recent whole brain radiation, or just because he hasn't been active in a few months.  How will the prednisone help the fatigue?","Doctor":"Hi, Prednisone is a corticosteroid drug. It is converted into prednisolone in our body by the liver's specific enzymes; thus, it can be active. Usually, corticosteroids mimic the cortisol, the natural corticosteroid produced in our body. Therefore, prednisone has many effects in our body. In cases of cancer (as your husband), prednisone is used to lower the body's immune response and as a potent inflammation reducer. With regards to being fatigued, all the factors you mentioned (Xalkori, brain radiation, being inactive for months) and especially cancer (with cancerous cells taking all the nutrients to your husband), all of them make him fell fatigued. To suppress his immune system (which is currently fighting against cancer with the help of Xalkori and radiation), your doctors have prescribed prednisone. Hope it helped! All the best to your husband and all of you!"},{"Patient":"I am very discuraged I have seen several doctors and I have been diognosed with bipolar depression .

We should try to wash away all the memories which they both have spent together.We should support them. We should stand beside them. We should encourage them in everything rather then discouraging, as even 1 word of discouragement can again take them back to their past, as they will feel that they are hopeless cases.We should show them that there are still people alive who loves them a lot and to whom they mean a lot.We should always make them feel that we are with them no matter what the circumstances might be.

Her memory has declined even more when an additional 30 mg of Cymbalta was added for a total of 60 mg Cymbalta. She is having severe memory loss now, crying episodes which are uncontrollable, hallucinations of events that never happened. Could the Cymbalta be causing these symptoms or is it just a progression of dementia?","Doctor":"Hello,Dementia is unlikely if the symptoms you have mentioned appeared recently specially after increasing the dose of Cymbalta.Considering her age, 90 mg of Cymbalta per day can be considered to be a very high dose for her in my view. Many a  times, antidepressant like Cymbalta can also destabilize the mood of patients resulting in symptoms like uncontrollable crying, irritability, insomnia, memory loss, hallucinations etc and in such cases, the  antidepressant need to be discontinued and or replaced by a mood stabilizer.You should discuss with her doctor about reducing the dose of Cymbalta to 60 mg per day or less and see if this helps.Kind regardsVikas"},{"Patient":"Hello.  my son just turned 19.

I as a person with a history in social justice activism and I am told even my mainstream psychiatric employees that the reason the CDC stopped studying this and implied it was delusional is simply that no money is to be made ( at this time in the search for etiology) from this odd type of immune system disease which is (mostly) treated with immune supports ( herbs), topical treatments, stress reduction to reduce outbreaks on the skin and stress on the organs, sleep and exercise to again reduce stress.  What ethical doctors are out there who give a damn about this situation? I now have very \\"atypical\\" mood swings, depression and anxiety extreme fatigue, memory loss and the famous black effoliations and other Morgellon's symotoims. Anyoine who takes a logic course can demonstrate why the external symptoms are not a producto f somatic delusion or a statistics class on the improbability of so many co-occuring delusions. Who are the eithicl MD's who actually will give me the anti-biotics which help this ( I don't know if it cures it, but it helps). I took Bacerium once and it helped for infected lesions. Among the MD's I've heard of : Brad Gould of Millennium Health in Atlanta, Georgia- Raphel Stricker of San Francisco, CA- Dr. Kanjaroo - Los Gatos , CA ..I have NO CLUE who is an opportunist and who is a real or ethical MD..Can someone help..my degree is in law not medicine and I am in trouble here.Kim Nemirow YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your detailed problem description and am very much surprised to see that you know so many things about your illnessess even though you are not a physician and you are a lawyer.But I sincerely believe that your knowledge is your problem. Every MD has their own way of treatment and way of diagnosis and way of assessment. Once you become typecast, or over expectant, you are bound to undermine them. Means disbelief. Means firther dissatisfation. Dissatisfaction leads to further doubts. Belief in a doctor, is key. If your current doctors are not believable, find someone who is believable and stick to them.Also you should go for yoga and meditation to streamline your thought process and metabolism. They should help you immensely.Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.Good luck."},{"Patient":"I am guardian and grandmother of a 22 year old female.

About 3 years ago I was living with a few friends in a house. I was a frequent smoker of marijuana at the time. I went over to a friends and hit his pipe once and got really tingly feeling. I got inside of his vehicle, for him to take me back home (told him I wasn't feeling right) when he turned on his sub woofers my arms locked up, my legs kicked up and my heart was going a mile a minute. Ever since that day I've had an anxious feeling and get nervous in large crowds. I went to a football game and once I got to my seat I immediately rushed back down and walked about 5miles home...When I go to interviews my mind is not stopping and I can't stop fidgeting with my neck or fingers or anything. what would you consider this to be? Anxiety?","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, I feel this is an anxiety disorder and has possibly been brought on by marijuana. Marijuana is well known to cause anxiety disorder and less commonly psychosis. If abstaining from marijuana has not helped much, then I suggest that you see a psychiatrist and get yourself evaluated and treated. In my opinion, you will benefit from a medication of the SSRI class, like sertraline or escitalopram. Please stay off marijuana as it will worsen your problem.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I am a 42 year old female.

I consuted my family Doctor he prescribed me Clonotril 0.5 mg 1/2 - 1/2 - 1 per day. He also prescribed some sleeping dose but I didnt take it due to fear of addictionj to it and also the side effects. But i took the clonotril as prescribed . I still have sleep problems and some palpitations in the morning. I am also having severe gastric problems . Can you help me and advise me on what medication to follow. I am now taking Rabeprazole sodium for gastric morning and night and clonotril night dose. Kindly advise me I am very worried about side effects. I also want to become my normal self and regain my courage.","Doctor":"HelloClonotril being a benzodiazepine is a very effective medicine for controlling anxiety symptoms and can be taken for 4-12 weeks but not more than that to avoid developing dependence on it.SSRI antidepressant like Sertraline or Escitalopram are currently the first line medicines for controlling anxiety symptoms however they can cause gastric side effects like nausea, constipation, diarrhea initially as a side effects therefore in your case, you can discuss with your doctor about trying Mirtazapine which is a sedating antidepressant and a good antianxiety medicine too. It can help in sleeping and you won't be needing any other sleeping pill once you start taking Mirtazapine. It does not cause gastrointestinal side effects and can be  a good option in your cases in my view. Clonotril can be taken on as and when needed basis if you are much worried about developing dependence on it.Kind regardsVikas"},{"Patient":"Hello I am a 21 year old male about over a year ago I got my heart checked out by a cardiologist thinking that I had a heart problem because I would get chest pains like burning sensation that started by one day after using cocaine which I only used cocaine for about 6moths on and off .

You must not take alcohol on daily basis, however once in a while a limited amount of alcohol in social setting is ok but never alone or excessive amount.Since you describe your investigations are normal its more likely that you may be having alcohol withdrawal if you are taking alcohol regularly and stopped it, if yes see a psychiatrist for it.And if you do not consume alcohol daily then you may be having panic attacks and anxiety symptoms. See a psychiatrist for it, for therapy and drugs to get better.Feel free to ask if you need any more help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I was given a prescription for Citalopram 10 mg..

The drug resperidone is very effective in controlling the psychotic symptoms but the side effects like sedation, movements in body, tremors and in his case excessive salivation are really bothersome.

I have been noticing this in the last several months. I never heard her do this in the past or when I was younger. I have read that it could be early signs of dementia. Is this true? She does have some health issues but she’s able bound and has a keen mind and she’s physically active. She does have a lung problem but no need for oxygen.

Spasmo proxyvon contains dextropropoxyphane, an opioid analgesic (similar, but less potent than morphine). It appears that you have opioid dependence, and since you have stopped taking the substance, you are currently suffering from withdrawal symptoms ( lacrimation, yawning, vomiting, pupilary dilation, goose skin, sweating, fluctuating blood pressure, irritability, agitation, low mood etc). The patients who come to me with this condition, I usually admit him and treat him with a gradually decreasing schedule of low potency opioid drugs like tramadol, or sometimes spasmo proxyvon itself (in much lower doses than the patient's usual dose) with regular monitoring of his vitals and withdrawal symptoms. It may take up to one to two weeks to detoxify him. after that, i usually put him on a very low dose maintenance regime(on a case by case basis) and / or put him for psychotherapy, behavior therapy and motivation enhancement therapy. substance abuse is a chronic relapsing disorder, and the current goal of treatment is to maximize the gap between relapse, and minimize the time taken to seek help after a person relapses, thereby, decreasing the period of illness.i would suggest you to consult a psychiatrist urgently, for proper management of your symptoms.

Is a casual marijuna user. Concerned about him taking anti-depressant Ativan and side & long term effects. Praying he isn't looking for the next 'high' after pot. As i understand it an Rx for Adivan is in same category as Xanax, which I understand to be addicting? Thank you.","Doctor":"thank you for your query. anxiety symptoms or panic attacks (characterised by flushing, palpitation, sweating, shortness of breath, sweating, tremulousness etc) can be a normal phenomenon in certain circumstances (like when missing a train or flight). however, if its occuring regularly, or without any reason, it may be a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, like phobia,panic disorder, anxiety, depression, etc. It may also be caused by any substance of abuse, like alcohol, marijuana, opioids etc.Moreover, ativan contains lorazepam, benzodiazepine (sedative, not an antidepressant), which has roughly the same effects in brain as alcohol. It also may give rise to dependence and tolerance, and chronic use is harmful for the liver.As I understand your problem, it appears that firstly, you have to find out about the frequency and quantity of his use of substances like marijuana, ativan etc. and decide if it needs treatment. Secondly you have to identify any underlying psychiatric disorder, that may be responsible for his panic attacks and/or his substance use (sometimes teenagers use substances to self medicate for an underlying psychiatric problem, which they themselves are often unaware of). I would suggest you to visit a psychiatrist for the proper evaluation, diagnosis and management of the above conditions. I would advice you not to be alarmed at this very moment, as these situations are very common in most teenage households, however, it would be a good idea to take help now from a professional to nip the problem in the bud thus preventing it from snowballing.hope i've been able to answer your question. please feel to contact me for any further queries. best of luck."},{"Patient":"Well I have mental health issues and I feel bad and cheated.

The symptoms that you have described are unlikely to be that of Oppositional Defiant Disorder, but are more suggestive of either borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder.

Zoloft (Sertraline) is an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) regularly prescribed for treatment of depression and or anxiety. however, during initiation of treatment, it can paradoxically worsen anxiety, also cause some Gastro intestinal disturbance like dyspepsia, nausea etc. which passes away within one to two weeks on its own. Moreover, it takes around two to four weeks for the onset of action of Zoloft, as the actions are brought about by causing structural changes at a genetic and molecular level in the brain. Usually, most Psychiatrists prescribe a sedative hypnotic or anxiolytic (like Imovane-Zopiclone, Stilnoct-Zolpidem etc or a benzodiazepine like clonazepam) together with Zoloft in the initial phase during treatment to cover for these events.If a patient with your complaints would have come to me, I would have reassured her that there is nothing to worry, and these effects will pass of in a week or too. Also, I would have prescribed her a benzodiapzepine anxiolytic/ sedative (like Clonazepam or Etizolam) instead of of Stilnoct(Zolpidem, a Z drug) for the time being for better anxiolysis.hope i've been able to satisfy your query. please feel free to contact me for any further clarifications if needed. best of luck."},{"Patient":"I need a referral to a good psychiatrit or health professional for my severe panic disrder.

Dementia is a chronic progressive illness, in which a person gradually starts losing his memory (particularly recent memory, that associated with his day to day life) along with atleast one other higher mental function like judgement/ planning/ executive functions etc. gradually there is change in personality and behavior, with the person becoming incapable of maintaining his activities of daily living by himself in later stages.popular medications to manage dementia are Donepezil (Acetyl Cholinesterase inhibitors), Memantine (NMDA antagonist) etc, given formanaging memory and gognitive symptoms. also sometimes atypical antipsychotics like Quetiapine, Olanzapine, Risperidone etc are given to manage aggression and behavioral problems.Among these, Donepezil can cause itching. the restlessness (moving head, arms, legs constantly) can be due to a condition called akathisia, caused by mostly antipsychotics. the facial grimaces may be due to a condition called 'Tardive dyskinesia', another side effect of antipsychotics. the exact cause of the given symptoms, can however, only be clarified after a thorough assessment of the exact medications that he is having, both prescription and OTC, and their duration of use.

I will catch him talking back to them, threatening to kill them and their families when he finds them. Should I worry for my own safety? I dont want to put him in hospital. I dont want to leave him alone. Im afraid he might do something terrible. I do not know how to deal with this. Im already depressed and his ranting and inability to even listen to me because he cant hear me over the voices. He is getting to point he cant function. What do I do?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to us, The symptoms you report in your husband of hearing voices, fear of being persecuted by means of radio-frequencies etc are most likely symptoms and signs of Schizophrenia. This disorder can take various courses of continuing for years or subsiding after a short while only to return again. The patients usually believe so deeply about what they hear or think and is unshakable even with reasoning and logic argument. They hence become unpredictable. They may cause harm to their loved ones or themselves. If risperidone is not effective in him, it warrants a trial of another antipsychotic medication. You have to take him to a psychiatrist/hospital at the earliest. Even if he is admitted it will not be for more than a month or two. It would be better if he returns back in a better functioning state in a month than not getting him treated right now. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi.....I have been on Xanax for twenty years for extreme anxiety/panic , initially  prescribed .5 mgm at bedtime it worked very well and I felt great all the next day, but now I have Xanax tolerance and rebound anxiety when it wears off and I've been very shaky and trembling which makes me not want to leave the house for fear of having an epispde. it's made me very self conscious, I've tried most of the SSRI's with not much success.

I have been advised to reduce to 60mg a day for a week then 30mg for a week, then stop. I am experiencing severe agitation, crying for no reason, overly sensitive and overall fatigue and just feel horrible and more depressed. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Greetings !Welcome to the site.Well, no this is not normal as it seems like you are still reeling under the depressive cognition and Cymbalta after 1 year long use has become ineffective owing to increased tolerance/ resistance that your body must have developed against it.So while I support the idea of bringing you off Cymbalta but the weaning strategy can be improved by first bringing you down to 60 mg dose and after 1 week further down to 40 mg dose / day and then after 1 week down to 20 mg / day dose and then after 1 week taking 20 mg dose every alternate day for another week and then stopping the drug completely. This slow tapering of the dose is essential to prevent development of withdrawal syndrome which can further worsen the condition.Also alongside the withdrawal of Cymbalta there is a need to replace it with another anti depressant which can be done by introducing Lexapro ( generic name -- escitalopram ) at dose of 5 mg / day in the morning when you have reduced Cymbalta to 20 mg / day regular dosing. This process of introducing a new drug while discontinuing the older one is called as Cross- titration, kindly discuss about this with your doctor.After 1 week of being on 5 mg dose / day the dose can raised to 10 mg and then after 2 weeks further up the dose to 20 mg /day as per the discretion of your doctor.I am hopeful that such sort of replacement of the current Cymbalta with Lexapro will prove to be useful in bringing you out of the clutches of depression which is present at the moment.I hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"respected sir, my son aged 32 has not been able to get employment inspite of getting B.Tech> and very brillient mind.that has drawn him to alcohal. he behaves as if he is superior than all others and so insults everibody at the first oppoturnity becomes hostile. i think i have analasied his condition well and seek your advice and treatment.","Doctor":"Hello,Your son's alcohol is probably the result of depression which he has because despite good education and ability he is not getting a good job.

But having less frequency does not point out towards any specific disorder especially when it is not associated with any problem with sexual performance (Erectile Dysfunction/ Premature Ejaculation) or other depressive/anxiety features (decreased interest in pleasurable activities/sadness of mood, hopelessness, death wishes).Its a possibility that he may be stressed out and not yet ready for kids therefore not going for intercourse. You need to talk to him and be open about your desires of sexual gratification so as you two can sort this out to resume your healthy sexual life. You may have to let him see the woman in you so as he should be attracted to you sexually more frequently.The reason for his lack of sexual desire if persists despite that may be depression, low testosterone (male sex hormone) levels, or other medical conditions such as diabetes or thyroid problem which decreases the libido.Since the reason for your depression is lack of sexual gratification by your husband, that is the treatment for you.

A few manage doing  so themselves but many require professional help. The presence of depression  has to be ruled out by a psychiatric evaluation since it is commonly seen. If your symptoms are at a syndromal level (as judged by the psychiatrist) you may need medications, else you can benefit with psychotherapies like cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation techniques etc. I urge you to see a psychiatrist at the earliest. Also, revisit the psychiatrist who is treating your husband regarding the anger outbursts that he is suffering from. It may be difficult to treat but there are alternatives that can be tried.

A person can have deviant personality traits which make them more vulnerable to problems like addiction or excessive usage of things like the internet and mobile phones to an extent of neglect of routine activities, seeking fulfillment of emotional needs from strangers, especially of the opposite gender or confabulating or manipulating by making up stories in order to get what they want. Firstly it would be advisable to get a detailed psychiatric evaluation at this point to rule out the possibility of any underlying mental illness. To make sure she does not truly believe the stories she has been telling people. You also need to make sure she is not having any genuine adjustment problems in the hostel. If this happens to be her way of manipulating you into getting her out of hostel then it would be advisable to keep her in the hostel till she gets used to it eventually. Get in touch with her hostel authorities and try to be aware of her behavior and also see if they can help you out by keeping her constantly engaged in some activities by making a schedule for her daily activities till late in the evening, by including sports, studies, projects, monitoring etc. This would help her a great deal.

I am a mother of a 3 year old which is very challenging.  I try to let things slide, but when I feel he is truly misbehaving I yell loudly and if need be for his actions I will spank.  I think I need medication.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to us, You report Irritability and mood swings (?duration) which increases when your son misbehaves. If these symptoms have begun from a specific period of time and is associated with any other symptom and any change in sleep or appetite or interest in maintaining personal hygiene then you may need to see a psychiatrist to rule out the possibility of an illness which may require medications. If the symptoms are solely related to being impatient while caring for your son (which is quite common) then it is unlikely to be an illness and will not require medications. In that case if you are unable to manage by yourself then you can consult a psychologist for anger management. You probably feel guilty about not being able to control your anger towards your son and hence feel frustrated. Visit to a psychologist/therapist ( which would be more beneficial than a family practitioner) would alleviate a lot of your problems.

Infact sometimes it may become a bit dicey to differentiate Bipolar Disorder, borderline personality disorder and ADHD. It is a matter of detailed history taking and reviewing the information from as many sources as possible.Now the effect of ageing. Yes, Bipolar Disorder tend to get worse with age esp if left untreated . No,it will not change to be a different diagnosis, as they say-once a bipolar, always a bipolar.

I am down to taking only .37mg of Lorazapam daily after a year of continuing a slow & gradual trimming down program to stop taking this drug. Within the past two weeks, I had a very traumatic and stressful confrontation with someone which caused high anxiety and stress.  4 days after this event, I experienced my 1st ever very fast heart palpatations which came on without thinking anything negative and which lasted 20 minutes, or so. I had an EKG which was normal.  3 days after this event, I started to feel light headed with a dazed, spacy feeling and my brain feels a bit foggy.  This daily feeling has been on-going for approximately one week.  I am taking it easy, continuing my 2-3 times per week exercising at the gym and doing brisk walks twice per week, and doing breathing & muscle relaxing exercises. My blood pressure is within the normal range.  My question is, how much longer will these described symptoms last before I return to normal?","Doctor":"hiIt is difficult to understand why you were prescribed lorazepam , not SSRI , for your anxiety in the first place. Lorazepam is such a habit forming drug, where as SSRI are safe , extremely effective and drug of choice. What you experienced 4 days back was probable a panic attack , followed by followup anxiety. Your physical activity programme is very good and continue it. The only thing is you have to start on a SSRI like Sertraline, Fluoxetine , Paroxetine immediatelyIt is very very difficult to guess how long your symptoms will last. The longer they stay unchallenged in brain (by medicines), the more permanent and significant changes occur in brain which is not goodTake CareDR SAATIISH JHUNTRRAA"},{"Patient":"Our neighbour lost his wife 18 months ago and has gone downhill and has been drinking heavily and smoking dope ever since.

We had just spent a great week together in NYC where i was working for a while, she had returned home to europe. A few days later get a message 'don't worry but i am on way to hospital,i told her i would get on a plane that night, she told me to stay, in three days i had a contract to do,that they did not know what it was at the time,that i would not be able to stay with her,her mum was on the way-though two days later i found out she told her also not to come,explaining to me on Skype that 'mum would be too much to handle in her studio,that she only liked me in such close quarters,. I stayed, i hated to stay but it would have been chaos if i backed out of job. If she had said 'come', i would have walked there if i had to.Jump forward six days, she goes to spend weekend with her family(another country), i tell her i am on the way,i have ticket booked, again she says no stay,you need to be there,  i was due back to her for a long weekend in two weeks time, so i stayed,i'd rather have been looking after her,but she was looking positive and feeling much better,now around family,it was her brothers birthday,he was arriving in morning... Bur from the next day,i heard nothing,not for two days,then all of a sudden i am dirt, i should have known to come, that no does mean yes,she will not believe i can be relied upon. In amongst hysterically screaming is interspersed words of 'you should have been back by now,' You told me you would be here by now'I must add.. we had a problem once before,and i jumped on a plane and flew there against her wishes,to which i got a lot of angst for a long time.. this time i listened- was i wrong?Now that was the simple version.Through out our time, if ever there is issue it is usually my fault and i think i do agree ,it is. I can be quite moody,introspective, work is something i want to change it is unpredictable,involves a lot of time away, causes many problems with us,she wants me out of it too. I let frustrations get at me,i have trouble with emotions,she feels i don't show her enough love, i've always had issues with expression from childhood(dysfunctional family),but i do listen to her, even if it takes a day for it to sink in,i do change.I made a point to always tell her i love her,we held hands all the time,we mould together when we are at home with ease,she would constantly comment on it, we both slept the best together,apart was hard,but much harder on her, Distance has been a problem. I always put my moods down to low sugar levels,when i eat i always feel better,almost immediately, i am in very fit condition,always have been. My father was the same till mid 30's he said. I'm passed that. While all this was going on over last two months, i started a few vitamins i had not taken before.. b6,b9,b12 and niacin-which i had taken years before,as a sports supplement,i have felt a huge lift in my moods, my brain seems clearer, i should be very very down over this, i am, i cannot get it out of my head, but i am also present if that makes sense. I am present enough that i realised the difference,started to look into it(google).. from what i am reading i may have a problem. Is it a deficiency . She told me i was a downer to be around,that my energy brought her down that i was moody all the time.. I've tried telling her via mail of how much  wanted to be there, also of what i seemed to have found out, about my moods, she does not answer. We are in separate countries, i am being told stay away, yet i do believe she loves me, i love her,but should i go there.. and in her words 'force myself on her' , arriving against her will.A note... my girl is an over the top genius /perfectionist .. no joke.. we both come from rough childhoods i guess.. she was abused by dad-who is out of picture now.. mine was my mother,and emotional abuser- also out of picture.She had started to see psychiatrist just before the holiday with me, second session after hospital was about me. She is holding me responsible for much of her stress.I think i have just asked multiple questions..I wonder if i have done right? Should i have just gone there? Am i really a depressive moody person?I know i am moody, are those vitamins really good? how do i convince her to see me,i think all would be fine if we just saw each other-is that selfish?

She had several manic episodes followed by severe depression & attempted several severe suicide attempts. She lived a horrible and sad life for 10 ten years before succeeding in taking her life.  I spend most of those 10 years with her daily.  She passed away 10 years ago. During that time, I was also taking care of my parents both who had several serious health issues. They too have passed away.  Neither of them suffered from depression.As soon as my twin died I became depressed and still feel like I am grieving the loss of my family and the huge effect it  has had on my life.  My first diagnosis was Vicarious trauma , then chronic depression. I have had a lot of stressors since my mother died a few years ago.  At that time my relationship I was in ended. (i found out he was seeing someone else at the same time I was burying my mother.)I did not  go into depression until a year later when he was forcing the sell of our own house.At this time I was is a severe car accident.  Although I was not severely injured, I had chest injuries from the inpact of the vehicles airbags, my hands would swell and I couldn't open anything, the fridge door, the front door,etc. my x-husband also cut off the utility services and he cancelled my cell phone.  He sent his friend who was the Realtor almost every day.  That is when I ended up majorly stressed and ended up needing to be hospitalized.  Our house was then sold.I ended up in  a new relationship with a man I had know for years and we move in together in May 2011.  I was feeling good so I came off my medication after a couple of months (AUG). I  only continued to take my thyroid medication. We went to Seattle for 3 days (Nov 2011) and then unexpectedly we needed to go to Arizona. That was suppose to be a short trip but we ended up there for 2 months mid Jan 2012). I felt good the whole time I was gone and for another couple of months, until mid March  2012) a total of about 7 mos. I had a lot of stress as soon as I got back .  I had a lot of dental work done in a week. Also the estate I thought was finished turned out to be a problem because my sister was refusing to sign the release. So then that came down to her lawyer & my lawyer until it was settled.  After that was dragged out, It had brought up all the upsetting information surrounding my twin's death, and my parents. And the lack of her involvement during that time.  I went into depression and ended up being hospitalized.We moved to a different city,and am seeing a new Phsychiatrist.  I am still depressed. having problems I have been asked if I am Bipolar?  I don't know.  I have never had  mania or psychosis. This time I have been in severe depression now for 10 mos. During this time I was dealing with my mothers estate, selling her house, and dealing with a lot of stress and pressure from my estranged sister. Then one day and for no reason, when i woke up I was completely out of my depression.(however for those previous 10 mos. I had overwhelming thoughts of giving up and the night before I felt suicidal, feelings complete hopeless etc.  and the inability to feel joy.  That good feeling lasted for the entire  month of March.2013 and then I slipped back into depression. The beginning of April 2013, my psychiatrist  sent me to Creest (a short stay medical centre for people with mental illness in place of a hospital.  AS soon as I walked in the doors, I immediately snapped out of depression. I stayed their for 2 weeks (without havinga a medication change which was going to be to Welbrutrin).  After leaving their I continued feeling good for the rest of the month of April, this too lasted only 1 month. The beginning of in May I could actually feel my good mood slipping away (like a wave going through my head LIKE A MIGRAINE WITH NO PAIN).  I went to my doctor out of desperation but within 3 days ONCE again I\\"m in severe depression.  My psychiatrist wants to know if I'm Bipolar.  I have newer as far as I know been in a state of Mania  and never have suffered from psychosis .  However, when I do come out of depression I am excited to do all the things I haven't been able to do.  I don't over spend, but I do notice that when I'm going into depression, I can no longer bear anything to do with death or dying, therefore I can't watch almost anything on tv.  Music becomes annoying.  And all I want to do is sleep.  I don.t really know anybody where I live, and really my circle of support people have died (being my family). I have children who are busy with their hectic lives and 2 grandchildren, They really don.t understand my illness, I have a fiance who has been my biggest support ,he is very kind and he tries the best to understand.  I'm trying my hardest to understand but honestly I don't feel I can get  through this,  I'm so afraid of being Bipolar and terrified of all medications especially SSRI which triggered her Bipolar.

He was diagnosed with PTSD around',95 and now receives disability payments.  It seems to me the PTSD may have been a misdiagnosis conjured by attorney who helped him with disability re-application.  My question is: would his original hematoma be implicated in his current behavioral problems?","Doctor":"The current scenario depicted by you appears to be a part of mood disorder (likely to be Bipolar Disorder late onset type) where mood fluctuations do occur between depression and mania. Hematoma sustained at age of 16 is unlikely to implicate current symptoms directly however there could be a possibility that he also had some neuronal damage like concussion or minor intracerebral bleed which can manifest later. sometimes Personality changes are seen in cases with head injury which develop within a year or two of the damage. Here in your description it is not clear whether these behavioral problems started gradually after injury or has been noticed only off late?

He has been prescribed Klonopin.  Recently (past year to 6 months) he's become more paranoid with odd things (drones tracking him, etc.) In the past month this has gotten worse and he's quit taking his meds as well as missed his last two months appointments.  He feels the meds are part of consiracy, too. Bizzare behavior has increased (climbing on roof to look for drones, thinking neighbors are NSA, counterfiet money). He's lived in our house alone this winter (we have a second house) and I returned because of this.  I fnally got him to the hospital, where they talked to him  and said he needed to take his presribed meds.  He agreed and he was discards.  Now he won't take the meds., wouldn't go see the pschologist today, and said he can tell I'm lying through his \\"eye\\" that sees everything.  He won't even eat food I make, thinking it might have drugs in it.  He was tested for illegal drugs and had none in his system at the hospital. So, suggestions? See if he'll go see someone else? Continue to try to get him to take the meds? Wait until another shoe drops and I can get him into the hospital? I had to call 911 and have the police meet me in the parking lot of the hospital.  It took a lot of convincing.  He won't do that again.  Does this just continue to get worse? Or will it clear up eventually? He hadn't been eating or sleeping before I got home.  He's a little better now about eating and sleeping, but still displays odd behavior.","Doctor":"Paranoid symptoms such as those you have described - drones tracking him/ attacking him - are symptoms of psychosis. Klonopin (clonzepam)  ay have been prescribed to reduce his anxiety and to help him get sleep, but the doctor would have prescribed an anti-psychotic medication (haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, etc.) along with it. Has he been taking an anti-psychotic regularly?It is important that you meet your psychiatrist and describe these symptoms to him. He will also interview your son and find out what will help him best. These symptoms, when treated early can improve to a large extent in more than half the patients. Some patients may not respond to the first medication tried, and may need another trial. Do consult a psychiatrist as he will also look for any medical disorders that may be contributing to the illness.

Thoughts?","Doctor":"Your may be suffering from blood-injection phobia. It is a highly inheritable anxiety disorder as you yourself have pointed out (multiple family members have this problem). It occurs almost as a reflex - seeing blood or injury makes the parasympathetic system (vagus nerve) active and leads to drop in heart rate and blood pressure, cold sweats and fainting. Logic may not help as much as it is a reflex happening. You may try to deliberately tighten your hands and calf muscles (may help a little) but the best way to avoid it is to avoid seeing the blood being drawn."},{"Patient":"Hi I take suboxone daily, Effexor for depression, and Xanax prn.

Both obesity and schizoaffective disorder are reasonably treatable. So do not pay much heed to what others say.Now weight gain is a common side effect of a number of medications used in schizoaffective disorder, and they might lead to the development of insuli resistance and metabolic syndrome. So this must be taken care of and considered.There are a number of proven and scientifically established methods for dealing with obesity, as well as drugs with least effect on weight which will manage schizoaffective disorder as well.Please consider these with your psychiatrist. Going holistic might help you deal with the stresses you describe, but the efficacy with the main disorder that you have is not described. There are chances the schizoaffective disorder deteriorates if you leave medicines without supervision.Hope this helpsDr A Rao Kavoor"},{"Patient":"Jst curious, I had a complete hysterectomy 2 years ago.

From what i could gather, your husband has been a teacher for last 30 years and was fine until about 4 months back when he started getting more fatigued, forgetful and indecisive.

A more sinister development at this age might be some organic lesion of the brain like cerebro-vascular disorders or dementia, though 58 is a little early for dementia, which at the initial stages might present like this.At the initial stages, these findings might be missed by a physician who is not sufficiently trained in eliciting these disorders, particularly the subtle signs.

That means there is no inflammation or other abnormality with your intestines but they are a little overactive. Such a condition is likely to be seen if you are anxious or having stress. This is the reason, you were first asked to relax by yourself. You may try yoga or psychotherapy to help you relax and tolerate the stresses in life. An alternative way is to take medications like escitalopram (rexipra) and dothiepin (prothiaden). You may consult your psychiatrist for further dosing adjustments and see if one of these medications work."},{"Patient":"I am 52 and have GAD and constant panic attacks all my life. I have been on meds off and on throughout the years and have been under a tremondous amount of stress for the last year. I take very low doses of everything as I'm med sensitive. I have AVNRT and take a low dose of Sotalol AF for that. The psych doc put me on 10mg Lexapro in December along with .5 mg Klonopin for sleep and to calm the rolling panic attacks. Worked well for about 3-4 months, then I suddenly started gaining weight like crazy (always been skinny), and had no sex drive whatsoever (almost the thought makes me ill). I had a hormone workup that showed everything as normal, just needed a little progesterone. The panic subsided for awhile with the meds. In the last month or so now it's as though my eyes and brain want to sleep 24/7 but I cannot stay still; I'm very restless. I can't think straight. He titrated me down to start on Viibryd last week. I only took 2.5mg of the viibryd one day (his orders) and couldn't stand it. Two days later I still feel 'off'! The brain fog is terrible! Can you recommend something else that I may inquire about at my next visit?","Doctor":"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is often a long standing condition, as you say 'all your life' you have faced it. Medications like Buspirone, Escitalopram may be helpful in your case. You also have a lot of side-effects with medications. This is partly because people with anxiety disorder are sensitive to side-effects of all medications in general. They are more alert and aware and even the slightest side-effect causes more anxiety. It is understandable. You may ask your psychiatrist if you can be given benzodiazepines like diazepam for the initial few weeks or months till such time as the other medications can work. You have been on clonazepam (Klonopin) and it worked. However, it is not preferred for the long term. You may also consider Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in addition to medications."},{"Patient":"I have several symtoms which suggest cyclical hyper thyroidism but blood tests do not confirm this diagnosis (symptons: hair thinning, weight gain, odd attacks which occur every 28 days - these are not really panic attacks, but a feeling of detachment which last about 30 seconds and continue for about half a day). I am due to have a MRI scan shortly.","Doctor":"Thinning of hair and weight loss might suggest hyperthyroidism. Weight gain is usually seen in hypothyroidism. However, you have mentioned that blood tests (including thyroid functions) are normal. Your feelings of detachment lasting 30 seconds may be an epileptic phenomenon and an EEG will be more useful than an MRI. Do these monthly episodes occur around the time of menses? You may consult a neurologist or neuropsychiatrist for your symptoms to make sure these are not panic attacks. Further investigations will be advised by him."},{"Patient":"every other month or so I get sweaty cold hands and feet for a couple days.i also excess saliva at corners of mouth.my legs and arms are weak and sometimes tingle.im fatigued all the time. I also have depression and some anxiety.my base of neck sometimes gets really hot feeling and sore at times.also have lower back pain if stand for too long.","Doctor":"Sudden onset of a set of symptoms like sweating, cold hands & feet, tingling/ numbness, anxiety may be a panic attack. They typically occur suddenly without a warning and will settle in 15 to 20 minutes time. This may lead to depression and a fear of having another attack at any time. During the attack you may also feel like you will lose control of yourself or you may be getting a fear that it is a heart attack. You may consult a psychiatrist for these symptoms. Panic disorder is a highly treatable condition. Your psychiatrist may also prescribe tests to rule out medical conditions that  may cause panic, such as hypertension, hyperthyroidism, etc. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I had a hysterectomy when I was 38 I am now 43 year old I have no sex drive is there any I can take to improve my sex life?

However, they will also be more severe than post-menopausal symptoms because of the sudden withdrawal of hormone levels after the surgery. In post-menopausal state, the transition is more gradual and hence bearable in many women. These symptoms can be in various domains:1) Physical: Fatigue/ tiredness; low libido/ sex drive; sweating episodes, flushing2) Mental: Mood swings, panic attacks, sadness of mood, occasionally psychosisIt is ideal to replace with hormones if the symptoms are severe and unbearable as they are more likely to address all symptoms. This benefit has to be weighed against the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. You may take your Gynecologists advice for this decision. As I see you are not able to tolerate hormone replacement therapy. You may consult a psychiatrist for the mental symptoms which can be treated and handled well with the use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline. They will help you regardless of your taking estrogen pills or not. Alternative Medicines like phytoestrogen supplements/ soya based supplements may also be tried from a practitioner of this system. They may have the advantage of having less side-effects but may work as effectively as hormone replacement. The phytoestrogens are compounds which are similar in action to estrogens, but are derived from plants. They may still have similar side-effects as estrogens, but at a lower risk probably. You may decide on which of these options suits you the best. You have to consult a Gynecologist or Alternative Medicine expert for the first and the third options."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. \\"AAA\\".....No pun intendeded I'm sure, however this WEB site is giving me \\"grief\\" trying to log on,.... anyway, I digress....My question to you is how do you know if you have \\"dysthymic Depression\\".

Please advise us.vinod YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello, Often we see men are coming to us with abnormal semen analysis report showing very low (\\"Oligospermia\\") or absent (\\"Azoospermia\\") sperm count or very poor \\"motility\\" (ability to move) of the sperms. Naturally, they are very much worried and want to know whether medicines can be helpful. Two things must be remembered: 1) Semen Report must be REPEATED from an AUTHENTIC LABORATORY after ABSTINENCE of 3-5 days. This is important, as the sperm count varies day to day. It takes almost 3 months to produce the sperms. therefore, if today you wear very tight underwear or you have high fever, your sperm count (checked after 3 months from today) will be low. As a result, a SINGLE ABNORMAL SEMEN ANALYSIS report does NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANCE. You need to repeat it. 2) Both Male and Woman should be seen together. What treatment is required, actually depends on the reports of both the partners, their age and duration of infertility. Moreover, the pregnancy will ultimately happen on the woman. That's why, we need to see both together. What medicines should I take if the second semen analysis report is also abnormal? It all depends on how abnormal the report is. In case of mild abnormalities, we give medicines called \\"Antioxidants\\" (special types of minerals and vitamins that act on the sperms) for 2-3 months and ask to repeat the test again to see if there is any imporvement. At the same time, some life-style changes are advised. These include avoidance of smoking and alcohol, reducing weight, avoidance of using tight underwear, prolonged sitting and driving. However, if the problem is severe, you can take antioxidants. But it is more IMPORTANT to do some tests to FIND OUT THE CAUSE. Sometimes, we can find the cause like diabetes, which if controlled, can improve your sperm count without any other treatment. What tests are required? You may need physical examination of your genital organs by the doctor. You may be advised some blood tests for hormones (Testosterone, FSH, LH, Sugar etc). Some ultrasound examination of your testicles or prostate gland may be advised. In severe cases, some genetic testing (blood test to see if there is any chromosomal problem) may be needed. Can any medicines help if there is severe problem? In most of the cases, medicines cannot help. You can take antioxidants but SHOULD NOT RELY solely on it. In most cases, you will require IUI or IVF. However, there is ONLY ONE CASE where medicines can ACT DRAMATICALLY. That is if there is problem in the pituitary gland (situated in the brain). In that case, taking gonadotrophin injections for 3-6 months will significantly improve your sperm count. What's the problem if medicines are taken for long time? As such, medicines will not harm. But if you take medicines despite the fact that your sperm count is not improving, you can land up in azoospermia. This is because, in male having severe oligospermia, there is a tendency that sperm count may further decrease over time. therefore, relying on medicine will INDIRECTLY HARM you. Rather, you should think of IUI or IVF. Can Testosterone be taken? Even if your testosterone is low, if you start taking tablet/ injection of testosterone from outside, your SPERM COUNT WILL DECLINE FURTHER. Therefore, under any circumstances, if you want to become father, you SHOULD NOT TAKE TESTOSTERONE. Sometimes, after hormonal tests, we can advise tablets like Letrozole, which can help to improve the testosterone level, indirectly. IUI or IVF- What to do? If the sperm count is mildly/ moderately low, IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) can be tried. however, if its severely low, you should go for special type of IVF (in vitro fertilization), called ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection). All of these will be done using your sperms only. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Is is very disturbing in social situations. What can I do to solve this problem? Thanks","Doctor":"Blushing is a common reaction. it may be a part of social anxiety disorder or social phobia. If blushing, sweating, along with possibly tremors or stuttering occur when you are in a social situation; you may seek the help of a psychiatrist. The other features of social phobia which you may be having are:1) Fear that people will evaluate you/ judge you in a negative way when you are in a social situation. Such fears are more likely in public speaking, talking to a crowd, or meeting many people at a party or social gathering.2) Many people have symptoms described in 1) above. But they should be severe enough to cause limitations in your functioning. Or you find the anxiety so severe that you avoid situations completely. This then leads to further social problems.3) You think this fear is excessive, but seem to have no control over it. There are medications as well as Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT) for dealing with social anxiety. The disorder is sometimes almost a part of your personality, that it stays throughout life. However, medications or psychotherapy will help you deal effectively with the symptoms. Do seek a psychiatrist's opinion on it."},{"Patient":"my boy friend is 58 years old he had a stroke 10 months ago went in a depression stop therapy and now has gone back too therapy and is doing very well when not at therapy e is walking the hall ways in his condo he seems too be really fighting to get back too where he was it affected his left side I know he is really worried about or if he will be able too have sex again e just says  too me its soggy he didn't even talk too me for 8 months now he is giving it his all im afraid of him getting into another depression if their is no way he will be able too have inter course again thank you","Doctor":"HI Thank for choosing HCM, of course he can do it, if he wants, the sex drive is directly related with the hypothalamus of the human being, and the second area is spinal cord from where the impulses runs towards the penis for erection purpose , and in case of cerebral stroke ( If my guess is right, because you did not mentioned it clearly what stroke) these areas remain intact, motivate him, convenience him, make him understand, that he can do it, make him sure, bring his confidence back it is not heard,,, have good day"},{"Patient":"I want to share with you about the problem of my sister.

He joined a Catholic Church during Easter celebration and even though our Church offers gluten free host, he would be going to other churches during the week and would receive a regular gluten host there. He was doing that for about 2 months once a week and then he would go to Church every day for 3 weeks and receive gluten every day except on Sundays. He became more spiritual than ever during that time. About a week and a half ago he started having visions and torments. First five days were terrible. He says God works on him and now all he can do is to wait for an answer.....He had to stop working obviously.

It may be possible that gluten sensitivity is causing hallucinations or delusions but it is hard to establish it.

I have been very stressed, can't sleep, and exhausted for about 4 months, was very stressed one night and started getting a loud, fast beating on the left side of my head, about 190 beats per second.  This went on all night and left the next day.  The diastolic blood pressure reading ranges around 95 when that happens.  This goes on every night and is so loud and fast that I very rarely get more than maybe 3 hours sleep a night.  This has been going on for over a month and it started last night at 8PM and is still going today at 5PM.  I had a cat scan and an ultrasound on the carotid arteries in my neck and they are okay.  Any suggestions?","Doctor":"You are suffering from severe headache at present as I understand from the history you provide. It is important to rule out serious neurological diseases in your case. As you seem to suggest, your CT scan of the head was normal. Your heart rate of 195 per minute (hope it is checked accurately) is very high. Such high headaches along with diastolic BP of 195 mmHg require investigation into the cause of headache. Hyperthyroidism, high BP itself, pheochromocytoma (rare tumour of adrenal gland) can cause such a condition as you are now suffering. You must consult a general physician (internal medicine) for detailed evaluation. Finally, severe attacks of migraine can cause severe headaches.If you have had migraine in the past or if any of your family members have migraine, this is likely to be migraine (provided you have ruled out other causes mentioned above). Internal Medicine specialist is the best doctor to consult for your problems. If the doctor also finds no serious disease causing headaches or if he says it is related to stress or depression, you may then consult a psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"I always get angry very soon.

They live in reno Nevada","Doctor":"Hi, Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder are three different disorders. Borderline PD can be present with either Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, but not all in one patient.Alprazolam (xanax) is a sedative most likely given to aid her with sleep or to reduce agitation. There are psychotherapies (or counselling) available for these disorders but the effectiveness of these will depend on the severity of the disorder and the precise diagnosis. They will be most effective with medications.A psychiatrist can guide you with the right treatment and clinical psychologists can administer the therapies. Hope this helps,Dr A Rao"},{"Patient":"Hello, In October of 2002, I had a trans abdominal, left appendectomy. There was a tumor the size of a grapefruit engulfing the gland, so the gland had to be removed along with the tumor. Until recovery, I had never experienced anxiety or panic attacks, and I was an avid user of Marijuana and occasional user of psychedelics. In my entire life I had never had a panic attack or anxiety attack. After the surgery, I developed SEVERE panic disorder, but not until I stopped using the prescribed pain killers I was on. 11 hours to the hour of stopping my pain medication intake, I had my first post-surgical panic attack. It sent me to the hospital. I may point out that I may have had an adrenal spike 1 week into my 2 week surgery window, which ramped up my schedule by 1 week. I blacked out, and awoke several seconds later in convulsions,  making it very difficult to walk or even raise my arms, it was as if I had no strength at all. Yet, upon arriving at (yes, I went to the ER), they found nothing wrong with me. Then surgery, then recovery, which included an epidural and anesthesia, followed by an 8-day morphine drip (I had never been put under nor taken morphine), and then 1 month of Hydrocodone for pain. It was not until after stopping my Hydrocodone intake that I developed CONSTANT symptoms, that have not gone away to this day. After many trials of antidepressants, none of which alleviated symptoms, I was prescribed xanax, which works. I now take 4mg's a day to keep symptoms at bay. This has been my life for 11 years now. I am also a marijuana smoker, but I find it increasingly harder to smoke it as it now agitates my symtoms. Any ideas as to why the SUDDEN change from no history of symptoms, to surgery, to MASSIVE attacks? I am 6'6\\" tall, no stranger to trauma, I have a strong stomach, Ive had multiple compound fractures with bone sticking out of my skin by inches and not been bothered by it. I am a lifelong martial artist, so why the flip? I do not believe this is a psychological condition but has definitely created psychological dependance on my 2 medications, xanax and metoprolol tartrate (beta blocker for tachycardia). Am I nuts or have I been miss-diagnosed? I may also point out that I have constant heart palpitations without the beta blocker. My surgeon suggested that I may have a damaged beta receptor on my heart. Funny, it was not there before, and upon consulting a cardiologist and wearing a 30-day event monitor, all of my readings were considered normal....I don't think so, normal people do not have palpitations every 3-5 seconds and major arrhythmia every other minute. Any insight would be appreciated. I am not expecting much on this but thought I'd give it a shot, I stumbled upon this site...thank you.","Doctor":"You have mentioned your symptoms and clinical history in great detail. I understand that you developed panic attacks only after your surgery and not before that. Did you have abdominal cramps, churning sensations or diarrhoea as part of your panic attacks or did these occur even prior to the surgery? How was the tumour around your appendix suspected or why did you get investigated in the first place and how did the tumour come to be diagnosed? What symptoms did the tumour cause? I am asking these questions because there are certain rare tumours (carcinoid) that arise around the appendix and can cause panic attacks especially with abdominal symptoms and diarrhoea. The reason for your current symptoms can be:1) Use of alprazolam. Alprazolam is a wonderful drug for panic attacks. However, it is very short acting. Once its effects wear out after 4 to 6 hours, the panic attacks come back with even greater severity. This leads to an increasing use of alprazolam over the years. (You might have started with 0.25 to 0.5 mg per day and now you are using 4 mg). It does not help the root cause of panic attacks - which need other types of drugs. 2) A more serious concern however is you may be having some more tumours lurking in your body. The group of neuro-endocrine tumours are a set of rare tumours. They are usually small (I suggest you look back at the surgery notes and biopsy report of the surgery you have undergone and have a consultation with an endocrinologist to rule out this possibility. Meanwhile you can also consult a psychiatrist who will help you get off alprazolam with another drug that is easier to taper and stop. If the above medical possibilities and hyperthyroidism are ruled out by your endocrinologist, you may be having panic disorder which is a treatable condition."},{"Patient":"Im brand new to this...actually all substance abuse community's!

Thank you in advance...I know the time these questions must take from your schedule! ;)","Doctor":"Hi, Yes it would feel new and different after the long battle. But it is great that you were successful thus far. Make sure it remains this way. Feeling low on energy and motivation, some irritability during the initial phase is expected because of the long term psychological dependence that you had. If these symptoms are severe and hampers your daily functioning then this may need to be taken care of, by a professional. You also report disturbed sleep in the past 7 days apart from ideas of hopelessness. Get yourself evaluated by a psychiatrist for these complaints. You will have to be patient till you can revert back to your old self again. 10 years is a long time and you will need to give your body time, there is no short cut. The longer your body is free of the drug the better your chances are to get back. To aid with preventing any relapse there are anti-craving agents that may be used under supervision apart from psychological management like 'relapse prevention therapy' (administered by a clinical psychologist). You can contact your psychiatrist regarding this.

NOt sure of what is going on??","Doctor":"Zanaflex (tizanidine) can cause hallucinations. It is especially likely to occur in certain situations like having very severe pain and also when you exceed the recommended dose. Since you took 3 tablets at once, it is possible that it caused the hallucinations. You can ask for alternative pain killers if the pain is severe. You also have good insight into your experience, which again  indicates that it is a drug side-effect. You may consult your psychiatrist if the hallucinations persist or are very severe or if they recur after resolving for a few days. You may allow a period of 1 to 2 days for it to settle. It should be reversible in all likelihood."},{"Patient":"can your depression and anxiety mess with your health like I have been having pain in my stomach , was just in the hospital for 2 days and they couldn't find out anything had blood work done a scat  scan done  but I am still feeling like crap it kinda comes and goes I really don't want to be alone, crying all the time just wanting to feel better and to find out what is going on can you please help me","Doctor":"If you have had a severe bout of abdominal pain, that has required hospital admission and treatment, you must make sure that all physical ailments are ruled out.

First of all, you have to begin counselling with the school psychologist. There is no alternative to this. At the same time, you might want to start your life anew with the discarding of your old baggage. There is no point in claiming to be a victim of circumstances, or cry about your past. Your past is just that: it is your past. Nothing more, nothing less. You must start looking for the solution to the future ... you have a kind and understanding boy friend, but if you won't start on the right path now, the relationship is doomed. You got to get a hold of yourself. Start by listing on a paper all the good things life has given you. Perhaps you can begin with this beautiful life itself. Then, may be your parents have been loving. Your sibs? Your best friends with whom you can still share secrets? Once you make a list of the good things that have happened to you, the bad things will recede. Perhaps forever. The counselling must continue for as long as needed, till you are out of the woods. The counsellor may suggest a visit to the psychiatrist, and if so, please go through with it, and if medications are given, please take them.Hope you find your right path with a mix of positive thinking, shedding of the past baggage, good counselling and a belief in yourself.Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"father had dementia (18 months) had accident  (hit by vehicle but wanted to go home) ended up in hospital, had aggressive outbursts when family weren't around (he also has epilspsey) was given  risperdone, then higher then normal dose of clonzapam and halpidol then went on to olanzapine for one year with really no effect to the aggression 10mg a day though I think it went up to 20mg after 6 month.

They are so scary that you make an ER visit only to find that nothing is wrong with the heart. During the attacks you may feel that you are going to die, or that you will lose control over yourself and go mad. However, rest assured that a panic attack is non-fatal and lasts only 5 to 10 minutes.The good news is that panic disorder is one of the most treatable conditions in psychiatric practice. If you are having these attacks too often, they may be disabling and discouraging. They can start restricting your lifestyle. You should go ahead and seek the consultation of a psychiatrist who can prescribe you medications that can cure this condition. You will be free of panic attacks within 6 weeks of starting medications. You may also need blood tests to rule out certain medical disorders like hyperthyroidism.

Here apart from suffering from depressive symptoms the patient can episodically have symptoms like increased activity, talkativeness, elevated or irritable mood, aggression, extreme moodiness etc. That is what your mother is likely going through right now. The right medication are mood stabilizers that she is on currently i.e carbamazepine (tegretol ?dose) and lamotrigine (epitec 50). Carbamazepine can cause side effects of dizziness. Your doctor will be able to help out with that. You have not mentioned details of when the drug was started and over how many days or the dosage here. If she is much worse then she is acutely symptomatic and she needs to be taken to her psychiatrist before worsening of symptoms. She will get mad about it since she is ill and has no insight into it. You will have to take up that responsibility to take her for treatment. I hope this helps,Dr A Rao"},{"Patient":"I have been taking Prozac 10 mg x 3 yrs,  I wanted to stop taking it.  When I told my physician about it he strongly advised me against doing this.  He then increased the dosage 1o 15 mg.  I do not feel any better, in fact, I feel worse. I still cannot sleep at night without chemically inducing my sleep. My doctor then advised me to take Melatonin po  qhs.  This puts me to sleep but I still do not feel less depressed at all. Could the increase in dosage agitate my sleeping even moreso, and supress my appetite, make me feel nauseated and off balance.  I have only been taking the increase dosage x 1 week.  Please advise.  thank you...","Doctor":"You haven't mentioned which part of the day you take tablet prozac. In case you have been taking it in evenings/night time, you may consider it switching to morning time after breakfast as this medicine can cause sleep disturbances in few patients if taken during night time. In case you are already taking morning dose then wait nd watch for improvement. However if you have persistent side effect or feel no improvement with higher doses then consult your psychiatrist. A further escalation in doses or change in molecule may help. Meanwhile a normal routine with physical exercise, and a optimistic thinking in any aspect of life is surely advisable.

These symptoms alone are not sufficient to diagnose the illness because it is seen as a part of many disorders. Apart from getting routine tests done to rule out any possible medical illness, depressive illness has to be ruled out in her. You also mention that her husband does not give her enough time and loneliness can lead to depressive illness. You also say that she is on Risperidone from the past one year. This drug  belongs to the class of antipsychotics and has various indications in psychiatry for use. You also say that there seems to be no response. In that case the diagnosis for which the drug was prescribed has to be reconsidered, or if any new symptoms have developed after prescribing the drug, it needs to be reported to the treating doctor. Right treatment when given usually helps control symptoms of a mental illness.

In these patients, the psychiatric symptoms (like hallucinations and catatonia) are usually seen along with the acute attacks, while in between attacks patients are normal and free of any psychiatric manifestations.

There can also be a chronic form of disorder where there is a background of few symptoms on top of which acute attacks occur intermittently. So in these cases it can be difficult to differentiate.

Also I am on xanax 1mg three times a day and just wondering if that is a high dose to be on?  I suffered with very bad acid and nausia for over 6 weeks and got hospitalized with it which was very difficult as I have a 4 month old baby.  My partner works away a month at a time so told them I can't keep feeling so ill.  It was worse in the mornings but still had it all day.  I would only ever be sick with acid never any food would come up.  I told my doctor I have suffered with anxiety and stress for quite awhile after I lost my first child when she was 4 years old.

Alprazolam (xanax) is a sedative that has a potential to cause side effects in your baby while he is breastfeeding like sedation or symptoms of withdrawal as well. Paracetamol (pandol) and Ibuprofen (nurofen) both are given for the same purpose so any one of it will suffice provided there is a necessity for both (under supervision).

I am her live-in, full time caregiver, bt in the last month she has become obsessive, (lost her sunglasses a month ago and I discuss it 15 hours a day with her). She gets agitated easily and angry with me, she knows I'm doing everything to help her but think the restaurant she was at a month ago has them. I've driven her there three times, she's sure that they call her every night and wants me to pick them up. She's driving these poor people nuts. I go through it about firty times a day, she wakes me at midnight, I hide in the am until I'm ready to start another day in paradise. It's the rapid increase in the dementia that  is my concern. Had her at a neurologist last week twice, she doesn't want to see any more drs. She had o'd on Aricept in March(?) after 5 days on it, was hospitalized four day later because I had been counting them, much to her dismay, lost all her electrolytes and was very sick. They put her on a low dose Exelon patch which I used for two months but she just kept getting worse. Theneurologit put her on Namenda last week an will treat her for Parkinsons after she is established on the Namenda. I'd prefer giving her Atavan or something to calm her down. The depression is a new symptom and she hates living this way.  She wants to maintain control over herself and I understand, I help if she asks while I sit there quietly. I'm living in hell with her and her body is much stronger than mine.

I went through a lot of upset in my early teens and by 16 was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder including phobias (which come and go - planes, tunnels bridges etc).At 19 I began drinking excessively and using illegal drugs - all stimulants, cocaine and speed etc. The whole time I was taking 40mg daily arropax for the anxiety disorder from 20 years to 30. At 30 years i realised I was an addict and sought help. I am now 33 and have been clean and sober for 3 years. In this 3 year period I have suffered quite a lot. up and down. I was prescribed epilim on top of my arropax (200mg daily) as i was having severe panic attacks, often collapsing and 4 times had fits. They calmed down, but as the years have gone on this dose has now increased to 800mg Epilim + 60mg Arropax. I am yet to be given a diagnosis as my biggest fear is that I have bipolar. Perhaps this is why we have not discussed it. What do you think is wrong with me? Could I have bipolar? or just be an extreme worry wart who frets and then gets run down and has a cry every few weeks?  Uncertainty is sending me mad. Whilst I am more racing thoughts and stressful minded \\"pressured\\" perhaps, i don't suffer much depression, only after weeks where my work load is full and my lifestyle is jam packed. I.e less sleep, too many social and work obligations. I just get chaotic and unman gable, but certainly don't do crazy stuff like sleep with a million people or spend millions of dollars on my credit card. I have also been told a racing head full of thoughts and crazy mind is in fact a symptom of addiction in itself. \\"the diseased mind\\"! Oh god i don't know.  I just feel like suddenly Im on a lot of meds for a supposed anxious girl. Feeling very confused and not sure I'll cope if I'm told i have bipolar","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsWhy are you worrying about Bipolar? You came to this situation just with the help of unnecessary anxiety. Anxiety then developed in panic attacks and then further deteriorated. I should say that you yourself worsened your condition by not taking proper advice from experts. No,Iam notblaming any of your doctors including psychiatrists. But it is well known fact that anxiety and panic attacks cannot be cured only with the help of medication. But it can be well managed with the help of meditation, yoga and psychotherapy. Meditation and yoga can streamline your metabolism and thought process and psychotherapy streamlines your living style and condition.Consult a psychologist and get well soon.

The feeling of being chased, is a part of what is called a delusion, where in one harbours false beliefs. It can be present in many psychiatric disorders.

The thought processes that a person with BPD has is quite different from that of a person without the disorder, and it makes it difficult for the person to cope with day to day stresses that every human being faces in their life. Patients with BPD tend to suffer from complications involving mental health with the slightest of stress. And as you mention, what you have gone through is much more than usual. Coming to your query, why cant this be a normal reaction? Now, if a person without BPD or with no vulnerability happens to go through these experiences then the outcome would depend on his coping skills. Excellent coping skills --> Brief period to recover and no illness. Poor coping skills --> mental illness. The symptoms of loss of interest inability to feel joy and low mood for many years is a sign of a mental illness. But it is great that you want to come out of it. There are many ways. Medications being one of them. Adequate medications usually help control these symptoms. There are additional treatments that can benefit you which is psychotherapy that involves, building a positive outlook and personality transformation etc. This helps in building coping skills as well.Trained psychologists administer them. They are known to be useful in cases of BPD apart from medication.It takes a minimum of 2 weeks to determine whether a drug is effective or not. I do not know the reason for switching your antidepressant but if the recent drug you are unable to tolerate due to side effects then you should consult your treating psychiatrist. Do you have to take medications for life? You have to understand that you need medications till your symptoms last and after that it helps in preventing a reccurence which is very common.

Although Trazodone is an effective medication for sleep problems, you need to optimize the dose for yourself.  This medication can be effective to help induce sleep and may be having a side effect of making you drowsy when you wake up.  If you believe that you are not getting the right effect from the medication it might be as well to try a different medication to help with sleep.  There are many other medications that are as effective but not with the side effects that you are experiencing.  I hope this helps.  Please consult your psychiatrist for medications that may be helpful alternatives.Take care and have a lovely day!"},{"Patient":"hi, i'm a female 34 years old.

However trileptal or oxcarbazepine, in addition to being an anti-epileptic drug (AED) is also a mood stabilizer.

I have now been using Fluoxetine for four days and have been having such severe brain shocks and huge emotional meltdowns, anxiety and overreactions.   My question is :  shall I persevere or return to Paroxetine.  How long before the Fluoxetine kicks in ?","Doctor":"Hi there ~I understand your concerns. It is not uncommon to have withdrawal reactions from switching from paroxetine to fluoxetine.  One way of decreasing if not entirely eliminating these withdrawals is to reintroduce paroxetine and to go down on the dose in a very very gradual manner.  Gradually titrating down the dose of paroxetine would be the answer to your problem.  Fluoxetine can be used when the taper happens over a period of 2-3 weeks, when the action of fluoxetine usually sets in and its dose may be titrated up at that time.

What natural things will help.  He was on only 5 mg of olanzopine for a couple of years, a couple of years ago and was able to hold down a full time job and had a sex drive.  After his previous girlfriend broke up with him and he stopped taking any medication and lost his job, he had a major psychotic incident and attempted suicide, he was put on 20mg of olanzapine.  He slept most of the time and could't get off the couch due to depression and fatigue.  When we started going out he started getting up and doing volunteer work for the few hous a day he wasn't sleeping.  He wants to start his own business so he is not dependent on social assistance, but is far too sedated.

He is still sleeping far too much (from abou 11pm to 4pm, with only a small time when he can work on his business.  His doctor doesn't seem to care as long as he does not need to be hospitalized.

These are two different diseases. He is currently on Olanzapine, Qutiapine for psychotic features and Fluoxetine (?) and Sodium Valporate for mood symptoms. Olanzapine, Qutiapine and Sodium Valporate all causes sedation as side effect. These medicines are the reason of excess sleepiness in him. He has poor sexual drive. Due to chronic mental illness the patient develops apathy and anhedonia. Probably he lost sexual interest because of his Psychopathology. He is also on Fluoxetine which is a SSRI drug. It also causes sexual side effects, anorgasmia, poor libido, delayed ejeculation etc. So I will advise you to visit his doctor and consult regarding these side effects.

This behavor has never happed to him before. He is 22. He started crying and hitting his head like he was trying not to think of something, during this two day stint he did not sleep. he kept making sure that myself and his sisters were ok. He would ask all to stay in the same room at night.  If we  would fall asleep he would wake up and ask if we were ok. He kept looking out the window( kept them shut) he would pace around, stop look at us.  Talk to himself.  I tried to take him to the emergancy and he wouldn't get out the car.  At night he would turn on EVERY light in the house-even the rooms we were sleeping in.  by the 3rd he stop crying as much and was sleeping and not pacing as much.   I asked him once why he keep asking if  I was ok and he said the voices tell him to ask.  He would tell me to stop talking and I hadn't said anything.  Days later, he would get slightly upset and tell me to stop it . That he could here me talking about him.  Again I never said a word.  He would stare at me, like he didn't know WHAT I was.    During this time, he would carry anything Bible related.  Jump ahead about a month  now , he seems his normal self now.

I have been having loss of memory issues for about (?) a year.  Nothing horrible like getting lost, forgetting to take my Rxs , or how to get through my day.  My recall of incidents is lacking strength. My  husband forgets nothing which makes my lousy memory seem even more exaggerated and exasperating.  I have had various degrees of anxiety since my early 20's\\". I get in an \\"overload\\" status quite easily depending on my environment at that time (does that make sense to you?) A houseful of my kids, their spouses and my grandchildren does not overwhelm me. But what is upsetting is  constant anxiety over my husband's Hep C contracted from blood transfusions due to a spontaneous ruptured esophagus occurring @17 yrs.ago although his only symptom is he tires easily; he has had several liver biopsies which indicate no cancer  - he has been on 3 treatment plans, the first 2 lowered his liver viral load count to 0 but he is a \\"reactor, not a sustainer\\";  shortly after going off  2 treatments the viral load goes up again; the 3rd & last treatment was intolerable and he had to come off it.  Now he has a cyst on one kidney discovered during a cat scan and they're pretty sure it's cancerous and will be operated on quite soon. No sign of cancer spreading as far as they can tell now. I feel like I can't be strong for him anymore and I'm always stressed inside. When someone (spouse or kids) say things like \\"remember when we did such & such or  why can't you remember we had a whole conversation about this or that. ?\\" That's when I feel like something is wrong in my head; and they do not mind sharing their disbelief that I've forgotten whatever it is. \\"You need to see someone about your memory\\" is an often response. They don't beat me up about it and are well-meaning because they care about me, but I can sense that they are all getting more concerned.  I went to a neurologist and everything came out age-related  normal and  that I should get cognitive remediation therapy. I do not have any dementia or any sign of early onset Alzheimer's. I've been searching the internet to find a therapist  in my area (Frederick or Montgomery County Maryland) who deals with C.R.T. /memory function and anxiety issues as stated above.

Am 32 years old and its been 4 years  since I knew am suffering from OCD . I am not following any treatment since my parents are not supportive and they only scold me for doing repetitive tasks or taking too much time to do something which for them is something simple. The ocd was a new term for me and while reading on the internet I came to know that am suffering from it. As a child, I was suffering from this and used to get negative thoughts.Then, I used to cry whenever I felt irritated by the thoughts. I started to have phobias while being in buses or vehicles that move too quick. I behave foolishly and want the vehicle to stop. But what keeps me more worried is that I fear those negative thoughts might happen. I know OCD people have thoughts that are not real, but since I read the book the secret in which was stated that repetitive thoughts about something can make it real and can make it happen, I am much more worried. I think this book has made my OCD worst. I am always afraid that these thoughts that I do not want to happen may occur like said in the book.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are extremely distressed by your symptoms. These intrusive violent or aggressive thoughts / images could be part of a psychiatric disorder called obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The important features of 'obsessions' in OCD is that the person is able to realize that these thoughts are unwanted and intrusive, but despite attempts to stop these thoughts, they keep coming repetitively, leaving the person very distressed.However, you need a detailed psychological assessment in order to confirm this diagnosis, as well as rule out any other psychiatric disorder such as a psychotic disorder.

Always thought I was sitting wrong as right testicle would always be pushed up do it was uncomfortable. then the pain travelled from right groin up to rib cage. Just below waist line is tender all around groin and right testicle. Had an ultrasound of the area just below waist for possible hernia. Results were negative. I haven't moved in any way that would cause injury","Doctor":"Hi there ~I understand your concerns.  Pain in the testicles and groin area are related.  If the ultrasound was negative for hernia you should be tested for or screened for sexually transmitted diseases.  Pain in the rib cage seems like an entirely different issue.  I think you should see a surgeon to have the region checked out and find out if you have a varicocoele or the testicular veins.  I also think that a urinalysis should be necessary.I hope this helped.

After reading your post, it seems that you are having your symptoms seems to be due to excessive straining of neck muscles while studying. This can be due to wrong posture while studying. Following precautions will be helpful :- 1. You should not bend your neck too much while reading. 2. Have adequate light in your room while reading. 3. Give rest in between to your body when sitting for long durations. 4. Doing yoga and meditation in fresh air in the morning will help to get relief from examination stress. 5. Take care of diet and water intake. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I dont have a health query.. Rather i guess its a mental  problem.

He has studied at university, is very talented musicically , and is very athletic and physically fit,  but has shown some extremes .He is 28 yrs and had been working  with GNS Science in field of Geo Physics. He seemed at times disorientated in the latter 6mths out of his working for 2yrs there.  We were very concerned and made inquiries  after concerns where our son was doing bizarre things like running  for hours late at night  or deciding to experiment with physics problems etc to excessive hours etc or seemed apprehensive . Also  lacking insight in some situations where things are appropiate or inappropriate.    In the past he had always been very courteous, responsible, sensitive to needs and people's situations. So this was quite out of character and most unlike him, and made us realize something wasn't right with him. After making iquiries at his workplace we also  realized he had had treatment Larium  ( Malaria innoculation ) by his GNS Science Co as part of a prerequisite in case of posting in Indonesia.  We wondered if this could have triggered some of the behaviours now evident which point to possible Schizoprenia  especially Catatonic symtoms ( stationary in one position for lengthy periods) social withdrawal at times,explosive reactions, fear of cellphones , Internet, and not wanting to communicate or enter into any decisionmaking.  We have observed a deterioration and isolation, intolerance to light , curtains always drawn, repetitiveness and routine etc,   Because of the Privacy Act  we are not informed by his Dr or Psychologist and so we asked for a referral to privately have an assessment of his Mental state.   He is receiving some help from Psychological counsellors but we would like to see someone who could advise us on how to help our son recognize his need for specialist medical help as we also want to minimize areas of inaccurate diagnosis. We are his  parents and have been supporting him and caring for him but feel very shut out in helping for his recovery plan. It seems that the System is happy to allow his condition to continue for years  while we know that the longer this situation is left untreated the greater the damage can be to our son's health.  Please can you advise  what we should do . and possible harmful side effects","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsFirst of all let me assure you that there is nothing wrong if a man who is wholeheartedly doing his studies and is so concentrating that he is mistaken as catatonic. Visit any professional colleges and you will find at least 10% students like your son and they would be toppers. It is also common that parents don;t like these. They want their child to be active, social, lovable etc. Second. Have you talked to your son about this? If not talk now. If yes,what is the outcome. Let me know.I consider this as normal now. Mind you, You cannot judge your son as schizophrenic or catatonic because you are not trained in that area. Now a days people sit and play video games hours together without interruptions. Will you call them out of world?Please take your time to assess the situation."},{"Patient":"Sir / Madam,I am 35 Years Old and 73Kg weight.

All blood tests, xrays, ct's, urine tests, and cultures etc have come back normal. He gets very shaky and has chills and tremors when his fever starts. He is usually healthy, but has had a history of sinus problems and had surgery on nose and sinuses 2-3 years ago to fix a deviated septum.  He has been getting weaker daily as his fever persists, huge lack of energy and tires quickly, has had a loss of appetite since the fever began and has lost 20 lbs or more from eating so little.  He's been going to the doctor and hospital for weeks, but the tests show nothing. His mom has sarcoidosis (sp?), an autoimmune disease I believe. He has occasional cough (not bad and stops quickly but not usual for him) and has had an stomach upset lately (bloating, heartburn, constipation), and he no longer wakes up sneezing 50 times every morning, as he has EVERY morning since his sinus surgery.  Not sure it's at all relevant, but he's had a very low sex drive for 15 years, which to me is extremely unusual.  After his late teens, he has had little interest in sex and often goes months without interest.  While single from 20-33 he went years without being sexually active at all.  He is the total opposite of any man I know this way, just placing a very low importance on anything related to sex, although he can be aroused and perform normally when he does occasionally feel obligated to force himself to get \\"in the mood\\".

Where can he turn next for help? His family doctor and hospital doctors have no idea, and keep telling him to come back every couple days if fever persists, but it has and he is desperate for help.

He has in talking mentioned performing a hysteroectomy and leaving the overies. I am meeting with my doctor tomorrow for another 3 month follow up Pap test, and I have really decided that I am ready to be done with all of this. I think it is time to get it over with. My hormonal history is another story it is a disaster, a battle with severe depression, cystic acne, horible PMS ever since my teens, mood swings that my family is just suffering from and I have been treated with medications for anger, irritability to the extreme. My point is this:  Why should it be my doctors decision whether or not I have a hysterecotmy? I have been through over 20 years of this and am out of my child bearing years. I have already had a LEEP procedure that has not worked?? This has gone on long enough? Here is my other question: Why does he have the say so whether or not I keep my ovaries? He told me that I am young and that I need them. I want them gone! I have decided that they are fighting against me. I am already on Bio-identical hormones and we are having a hard time even getting those regulated, because of what my BODY is producing. I am still naturally extremely high estrogen, and it seems to me that with all of the other hormonal issues mentioned above that it may just be easier adjusting hormone supplementation going in from the OPPOSITE DIRECTION?? Without ovaries?? Isn't that my decision? If I am going to have a hysteroectomy? If anyone has any advice I would gladly appreciate it. I am just walking around with HPV and a hormonal disaster, I feel like I don't have the untimate say so. Thank You and I greatly appreciate your knowledge on this subject. emails are fine also!","Doctor":"Hi there ~I understand your concerns and I believe after reading your brief history that getting a hysterectomy would be a good choice for you.  I am glad that you are consulting a psychiatrist for your mental health issues and I believe they will get better after the surgery, as that would be one big thing to worry about less.  About the ovaries, it is upto you to keep them, since your oestrogens and progesterones are produced by the ovaries and you might experience premature menopausal symptoms if you decide to have them removed.  However you should consult your gynecologist who will perform your hysterectomy about this.  Take care of yourself and have a lovely day!"},{"Patient":"hi, i just had a very unusual bizzare weird 6 month live in relationship with a 56 yoear old male. He has a brother diagnozed with sczitophrenia, a nephew with aspergers. on the first meet he wanted coffee at my place, i reluctantly said yes. whilst making coffee he slyly quietly came behind me unanounced and engaged in physical sex. that made me feel overwhelmed in shock in  the safety of my own home. being adult to adult i didnot feel threatend, he acted ina quiet way. Whilst living in my home i slowly noticed unusual signs and symptoms that i havent seen before in any other relationships. He was very routine oriented with waking at 5 am, shower 5.30  breakefast 5  45gym  6 am, ironing 7 am , bus to work 730, home 5 30 pm, cooking together at 6pm eating 7pm whilst he slowly introduced alchol into the equation with 4 beers and i bottle wine and with me sharing a glassor two or three. He was asleep onbthe the couch by 730 awake 830 the  to bed  by 9pm withonly cuddles from behind, he would cover my face withthe sheets. cuddles early morning before getting outof bed. sex only from behind very rarely in middle of night. e constANTLY spoke of previous relationships in a critisising way except with bragging about fantastic sex with previous partner, he stated that didnt work out as it was about sex and not real communicaiton or interpersonal relations. stated this time bonding without sex may be longer lasting first, then the physical component next. he was reluctanct to engage in going out to dinner, other social activities. over time, there was a bike ride once a fortnight only with his daughter , he was reluctant to do anything together just with the two of us except get a haircut or quickly in and out of the market for groceries for that nights meal. His left hand flapped about without me drawing attnetion to it as to reduce his possible embarassment. He stated he has a high IQ, but reluctantly showed evidence of that. He stated he could easy mess with my mind and that i could easily  be brainwashed. He was a gunna person.he didnt contribute to utiltiy costs and avoid transport costs.He prefered me to pick him up from worki in my car using my petrol with a direct bus at the front of his work to drop off at home. i thought it was a romantic thing to do but got annoyed he took advantage of my mother type picking him up.He always go t me to pay for a bottle of wine and said pay you back later, never did, he used my face moisturizer, took care of his body well with good food and exercise at the gym. H e stated everyone thought he was 45 years old and could get any girl he wanted. but chose me as he like me and we got along good with him dominating the routine . I changed my diet wake up time and some of my social activities to include him inmy home as he state he lost all he had in bad business deal. He went from woman to woman with his charismatic stoic use of few words monotone dialogue. if any interjection, he would say hear  me out, so my input would be minimal and feedback would be non existence. He had unusual theories on aliens altering our dna which caused our imperfections and short life span. he also had a tic with flapping his nose. if he notice me noticing he would reduce that behaviour. he was clumsy footed and would trip over a small obstical like a pair of shoes inthe way and reluctantly would walk down a small slope of dirt and stone ground, yet could easily ride his mountain bike down a much steeper slope. he can drive cars and motorbikes well and fast. appeared to have no fear with some things. he wouldnt go outside inthe dark to turn the hot water service back on and got quiet agitated with the hot water being off which altered his structure routine and agressively demanded that i get a plumber to fix the hot water. he wouldnt have a shower at the gym AS it wouldnt be hygenically clean enough so he went to his ex girlfriends place. this was followed withan  apology. he would walk in the dark for anight walk , but eventually did with walking along the side that was well lit. he stated he hated his mother and father as he stated he was abuse as a child.in the early stage or first meet he drew attention to detail with noticing and my hands with a critical type comment. he made other criitisims to my physical appearance , the way i walked, the way i spoke, the way i kiss (like a turtle). he said he wanted to find out what made me tic. he got agitated and agressive when i asked him to turn the radiostationto quiiete relaxint music whilst trying to get to sleep. he suddenly jumped out of bed yelling he has no where to go and called me spinner. i refused to engage in dialogue and said im not talking im going tosleep. this made him feel anoyed. he finally calmed down. this made me feel frightend. Another time he was angry about catching the bus home as it was getting dark and he said there were no buses. i said i can pick himl up fromthe bus stop he said hell catch a taxi, i said no just wait. he caught the bust then went to catch ataxi to further the journey. i was in contact reassuring and trying to allay his fears and agression. i continued to calmly reasure him when i collected him in the car, he still contiunued his verabal diatribe. i suddenlty had enough of his lack of gratitude that i came half an hour away in the dark wet rainy conditions through 2 traffice accidents, so i stomped onthe brakes and yelled get out. he would so i droveoff in a calm quiet but fast driving way that scared him. i calmly yet sternly assertively said i was a rally car driver and a police officer in my attempt of believable humour to aliviate my stress. finally things calmed down over a beer. he later used this and said i have anger managermnent ssues. Every weekend he would revisit his ex girlfriend for a coffee, i was not invited. he said he was getting his mail and checking his things that he left there so he wouldnt haveto pay. then every 3 weekends he would disappear without tellingme and late rang or txted he was at mates.  Later i discovered the mate was a female, his response was that there was nothinghappening,that it was a safe house. he kept saying to me are you still for the journey , ready for the challenge, push the boundaries, up the anti. he did nice things for me, made me cup of tea in bed withhheey. it felt like i was trapped in my own home like a mililtary camp witha few bonuses thrown at me and a few carrot danglers of gunna have good fun together, good life together, yes hell go to paris with me , go camping together and make some planned structure expectations and boundaries to further the relationship. he then took me and bought me a frendship ring a cheap 50 dollar ring very nice, and it was the thought to me from a second hand store. then the next weekend he got ex drunk and abused me with words like go back to your husband, no one wants utc. then that weekend he took of to his safe house as my gut feeling new he was there , so i waited for him there and drove up behind him when he went into the other womans house and i jmped out and said over and put my hand lup andt then ran off inthe car. ifelt mortifiied my whole lifes experiences cavingin ontop of me.what do think an how do you see this situation. is it a combinationof naricissm, aspergers, liar, cheater, alcholism, contrtol and co dependecy.","Doctor":"Hi there ~After reading your entire story, it seems to me like you are both in a relationship that feeds off of each other emotionally, psychologically, mentally and physically.  It might not be the best relationship for your or for him, but there might be no alternatives, since you do not seem to be leaving him nor is he in the decisive phase of leaving you.  The family histories do not matter here, since you only describe hi family history and not yours.  A good psychologist would be able to work out your relationships and guide you through the inconsistencies that you have had to face since meeting this person.  However, setting boundaries and having rules might work in you and your other half's case.  Substance use should be discouraged as it just complicates matters of the mind.  I hope this helps and you also seek the expert help of a psychiatrist for medications.Take care and have a lovely day!"},{"Patient":"Hello, 3 months ago my friend had a showdown at work and as a result of a lot of stress.

I,ve had this for a couple of months now. This started when I was under stress a while ago but I am no longer stressed and haven't been for a few months now.I drink 3-4 nights a week and have done for the last 10 years.  I seem to get this after I drink for a few days and it gradually disappears when I don't drink for a few days. It then returns when I drink again.What causes this?","Doctor":"Pins & Needle Sensation & Tingling Sensation in different part of body can be manifestation of both psychiatric & medical diseases. One example is Peripheral Neuropathy, again the cause of this peripheral neuropathy can be elevated blood sugar level or long term abuse of alcohol. Peripheral vascular diseases leading to low blood supply in particular part of body can also lead to tingling. If this is the cause in your case, you need proper investigation to rule out the underlying cause.Among psychiatric illnesses, of course tingling &  pins & needles sensation can be manifestation of Depression, Anxiety spells, Panic Attacks, Somatization Disorder etc. In psychiatric causes for these symptom, not a particular part of the body is affected [As you have mentioned left foot & left arm is only recurrently suffers tingling], instead it is non specific & also the location is not fixed.To best of my guess, I think you need to be evaluated for alcohol habit as well as blood sugar level measurement. Alcohol abuse and Diabetes are known causes of peripheral neuropathy leading to tingling affecting limbs. You also need to be evaluated for peripheral vascular disease, as atherosclerosis can also lead to tingling & pins & needle sensationThank youDr Satyajeet Kumar SinghMD Psychiatry, MBBS[Viewer Rating Awaited]"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor!

We started her medication 3 years back with Sizodon and later moved to Risnia as prescribed. Within this medication she got married and things were all normal. But last year she had a daily argument with her husband and hence we had to bring her back. We took her for check up in a dedicated psychatry dept of a reputed hospital where doc's kept her on observation and changed the medicine to Arpizole 15 mg.  They kept her there for 21 days and all this time she showed good signs of recovery. Since the start of her problem she was reluctant to take medicine by her own and once back from hospital again she showed annoyance on being asked to take medicine. Anyhow my mother gave her medicine in juice or food without my sister's knowledge. Recently my sis wants to go to her husband's place and even he is ready to take her but he asked her to commit for medicine. She agreed instantly for that but could not keep her promise even for a day. She hasn't gone there yet, and is showing a real rude and aggressive behavior. Now she even knows that medicine is indirectly given to her so she has stopped taking anything cooked or served by my mom.

Medication is used for prevention and/or immediate alleviation of symptoms and is usually the main line of treatment. In addition, psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation, and/or meditation are often used to help relax the body and relieve anxiety.If you're in the middle of a panic attack, immediate relief of anxiety symptoms can come from sedative type anti-anxiety medications such as Xanax, Klonopin, and Ativan. These drugs are provided at least in the beginning of medical therapy, but are not for long-term use.Antidepressants often help prevent anxiety and reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks, but are not used for immediate relief during an attack. Frequently used antidepressants are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, such as Prozac, Paxil, Celexa, Lexapro, and Zoloft). This group of medications is often considered the first line of treatment for panic disorders.For preventive or maintenance care, psychotherapy offers support and helps minimize fear. In some cases, psychotherapy alone can clear up the disorder.Cognitive-behavioral therapy helps people learn to deal with panic symptoms, using techniques like muscle and breathing relaxation. Patients also gain reassurance that panic will not lead to the catastrophic events they fear, since many people fear they are having a heart attack or going crazy.   I hope this helps.

Am i fighting psychological problem?","Doctor":"HelloFailure in life or carrier at any time may result in decrease in motivation for subsequent attempts. This is the time which determines that whether one will achieve success or not. If any individual continue to try despite the failure he becomes successful. You are 23 and failed only once and it is not a big thing, continue to try again and again and dont loose your zeal. Realize your potential. Due to failure you have started blaming or projecting others in form of unconscious anger and irritability. Try to relax your self and spend your time in studies and watching good programs on television. Control your episodic anger outbursts as they will just decrease your energy only. If symptoms persist then visit a Psychiatrist.ThanksDr. Seikhoo Bishnoi, MD"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor! I'm 22 years old, smoking for quite many years now. And I seem to have a receding of hairline appearing recently. I've had a considerable amount of stress at one point last year and ever since, and I have always been suggestive to stress previously, resulting in constant psychosomatic tension in areas of my back, abdomen, pelvic area and head (inside and on the skin) that has increased since last year. Now I started noticing that my hairline has receded in front, in those corners of the forehead, you know. I associate it with constant tension I've been experiencing in that area of the head on the surface like skin tension and under the skull too.

So I want to know will it be safe for me to take paxidep for such a long duration...as this drug show some side effects like sextual dysfunction of achiving orgasim. and some cramping pain in lower abdomin at afternoon after having lunch.","Doctor":"HelloPaxidep is paroxetine and it is a SSRI drug. It is very effective in anxiety disorders like OCD as well as in panic disorder. It is safe to use this drug in long term basis as therapy of OCD requires long term treatment. It has potential to cause sexual side effects in some susceptible individuals but the side effects are reversible and are not so serious. Zapiz is clonazepam and it can be used on SOS basis but continuous long term use is not advised because of risk of dependence and tolerance. You can take the drugs without any worry. Cramping pain in abdomen is most likely not due to paroxetine because you are taking it since long time and there are very less chances that it can cause cramping pain in you. It can cause mild constipation and to proven it you can increase the fibres in diet.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I got off prednisone 3/14/13 and almost immediately began experiencing coldness in my upper arms, upper legs and sometimes my feet.

The symptoms you are having as easy fatiguability, shortness of breath, fainting episodes, headaches etc are most likely due to normal grief reaction.

I really feel the sensations and feel weak and disoriented with loss of immediate memory. Recently I have this delusional thought and I was on zyprexa in the past for maintenance. I noticed that one time when I had the delusional episode I was prescribed risperdal and the feelings went away but I developed anxiety disorders and panic attack. I still think that maybe the people that are trying to harm me might have just taken away the toxins or devices that were trying to harm me after they knew that I was on medication. I tried to take zyprexa 7.5 mg for a couple of days but the sensations are still there. Do you think if I took risperdal like I did in the past is the right thing to do since the zyprexa does not work, I also have stuffy nose from the risperdal but it is tolerable. I am afraid that I might have the panic attacks again and the  zyprexa controls that well.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for using healthcare magic.Zprexa is good anti psychotic medicine as like risperdal.Before starting any medication yourself on the basis of past experience, you must consult your psychiatrist.

So I finally went to ER and they put me on Seroquel for 2 months, it was awful. Starting seeing phsychiatrist and was put on Remeron and some lorazapem for depression and sleep. But the sensation in my head has subsided somewhat but won't go away. Always there....feels like a cool numbness on the top left side of my head...what could this be?","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. the numbness in you head upon rising could be related to sleep inadequacy (insomnia). Insomnia happens when somebody's depression has been managed incompletely or if she has some degrees of anxiety left which has not been addressed with antidepressant. On the other hand if you are obese and you are in menopause, you may have some degrees of sleep apnea. It is a common problem, especially in overweight people.

Before taking these medications, she excelled in school and in sports, being selected as a top basketball players inher province. In November, she came to me ( her mother) saying she was having suicidal thoughts, but no plan to hurt herself. Since this time she stated on Celexa 10 mg - no effect on her sadness, but she noticed it was harder to concentrate at school. After one month, she was switched to 20 mg - still no positive effect on sadness. Her marks at school were starting to drop and she had increased nausea and difficulty sleeping. The dr. Then added Welbutrin, this was not good for her, within days she was having severe nausea, vomiting, stomach pain ad very irritable. The Welbutrin was discontinued. She was then switched to citaloprex in early April- this med was not helping her sadness either. Two days ago, she experienced an episode ode increased depression and asked me to take her to the hospital as she didn't trust herself. We saw the dr.

Today, she is experiencing flu-like symptoms such as cough, stuffy nose, severe aches starting at lower back and extending to legs and a burning sensation in throat and heart area. I am not sure if she has the flu or if these are side effects from the new medication. She had the cough and stuffy nose two days before she started taking the new mess. Not sure if we try to ride out the symptoms or if these symptoms merit the attention of a medical doctor.","Doctor":"Hello  Depression is pervasive sadness of mood with low energy and lack of interest in day to day routine along with a lot of other somatic symptoms. Antidepressant such as Escitalopram or citalopram usually takes about 4-6 weeks to show full effect. They don't work if taken as SOS basis. She has been recently started on Fluoxetine and Methylphenidate and both are good drugs. Fluoxetine is good antidepressant and it also don't cause sedation so it will help in improving concentration. Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug and it improves concentration. As she is experiencing the symptoms as flu like illness and restlessness along with aches most likely these are due to Methylphenidate. The symptoms will go in a week or two.

For a month and a half now I have not felt well. Whilst studying at my desk I would experience episodes of dizziness that are relieved when I have an aspirin, but after experiencing a tingling sensation I was advised by father to stop taking it in fear that I may be allergic.

Unexplained tiredness, fatigue and a lack of motivation can be indicative of depression. Sometimes, depression can manifest with predominantly physical or somatic symptoms, with only minimal psychological symptoms. Certain medical problems like hypothyroidism, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, etc. can also present with tiredness and fatique. I would advise you to see a doctor for a detailed evaluation in order to ascertain a likely cause for your symptoms. further treatment has to be planned according to the cause identified. You also seem to be in the midst of a stressful time - with the pressure of college, the recent passing away of your grandfather, etc. So, I would suggest that you try some destressors to try and take off the pressure. You can try relaxation techniques or talking to someone close to you to offload your burdens. Activity sheduling and planning can also help in regaining your motivation. If you feel that you are finding it difficult to cope or handle things, please don't hesitate to seek professional help. Wish you all the best.

You are dealing with depression and it seems to me that you have also had a rough childhood which might fit you into what we call as dysthymia.  I hope you can see a psychiatrist in your country.  I also feel that you might benefit from neuropsychiatric medications.  Masturbation is a normal process and the urge to do so is physiological though it may be restricted in certain communities due to religious reasons.  However, this is the least of your concerns.  I also thing that you may need to see a psychiatrist due to the fact that you may have some problems with socialization and a therapist may be helpful in having you deal with the same.

I feel that these are only helping for 1 day i.e. the day i take the medicine and internally it is making me weak. An example of this is the following effects the next day once i miss the dose on night: Stomach upset. Strain in Head. wet eyes. uncontrollable anger. Mental Unrest. Diverted Concentration. Muscle Pain. I want to be slowly getting rid of these medicines and all my weaknesses including anxiety and depression are covered up.  Thank you so much doctors for your expert view but i think i should add more details:  I have been on rexipra for more than 3 years and before that on other anti depressants for as long as 6-7 years. and in touch with psychiatrist. So what is it that is stopping me to get alright .And also a major thing i want to ask is currently i am taking the medicines at night ,should i take them during the day time?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for choosing health care magic for posting your query. From the medications that you have stated it appears that you are having a depressive episode. Now depression takes 3-4 weeks to get better and another 4-6 months of therapy for prevention of further episodes. The symptoms you develop after discontinuation are not those of depression but are infact withdrawal symptoms of the drugs that you are on. If you taper them gradually under the guidance of the psychiatrist you will not have these kind of symptoms. With depression certain areas of your brain reduce in size. antidepressants that you are on , bring those areas to normal size. Hence its not taking the medications that will make you weak, not taking the medications. Hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.

Previously it was rare that it would happen and was very minor, just like a cold shiver when I layed down so thought nothing of it. But in the past 2 weeks its got alot more violent and scary. I will lay down either on the sofa or to go to sleep and will violently shake ( appearing like a fit) but am completely conscious and aware. The past couple of days I have woken myself up almost every 10 minutes with this shaking as well as shouting and sometimes crying. Occassionally I hear noises like bells ringing or scratching but this is no where near as common. I really hope you can help as it has got quite scary. Thank-you","Doctor":"Hi there ~ I understand your  concern and feel like you might need neuropsychiatric intervention.

The poor concentration is affecting your personal and social life. This has resulted in poor sleep, sadness, feeling of running out of home, crying spells. There are following main modalities of treatment you can follow- - Divert your attention completely from the bad memories. If that is not possible then try to keep yourself busy in work, studies. It is the work or study which can only help you to move on. - Second thing is Behavior Therapy. Behavior Therapy is a Psychosocial modality of treatment. It is a complex method and used in a lot of disorders - Consultation from a good Psychiatrist for evaluation for depression. As due to bad memories depressive episode is common. Medicines for depression will improve your symptoms. One thing I would like to advise you that don't ever take sleeping pills without consultation of psychiatrist as they are having high abuse potential and may cause dependence which will ultimately harm you.

Otherwise, you have a very common problem of erectile dysfunction and / or premature ejaculation and it can be easily treated with medications available during this time. The class of medication is called phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5Inh) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and it also helps with decreased libido which is a result of depression if you are going through one. I advise you to consult with a qualified psychiatrist who might be able to help in this regard. I hope this helps.
