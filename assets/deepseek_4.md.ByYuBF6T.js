I am in desperate need of care for VINA. My urogynocologist(sp?)is not someone who specializes in this particular area and wanted to have me see a Vulva Specialist. I do have VIN and I am heading towards this medical condition based upon, she is leaning towards that, but with very little, if any, experience at all. With my history, having terrible IC (HPV, bladder,kidney, etc.) issues trying treatments such as many nerve blocks including botox injections, PT, topical creams and medications that seem to have it, let s just say it s just masking the issue at hand. I know there is no cure for many of these listed, and I have to adopt to my new self (thank you therapist, whatever). I was hoping for some sort of guidelines as to what I should do next, I am assuming as I said at the beginning, a specialist, or other ways to handle this situation.

He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins B-cell mediastinal lymphoma. The tumor begins at the base of his diaphragm and extended into his neck, compressing on his neck in several places causing him to feel as if he were being strangled. He also has SVC syndrome with the SVC being 95% occluded. His left arm and chest were greatly swollen with swelling in both legs as well, but less severe than in his left chest and arm. He was given one round of chemo using the R-CHOP, but in less than 48 hours he started feeling a tightness and pain in his left chest. He was given pain medicine and a CT was done. Cardiologist, Pulmonologist, and Radiologist were consulted. Multiple PEs were found in the lungs and a DVT was found near his left ankle. Previous testing before R-CHOP showed heart to have no problems. After chemo, PEs, and DVT, testing showed right side of his heart was enlarged due to PEs, entire body, including face swelled tremendously -- his face was unrecognizable for several days. Doctor started heparin for PEs and DVT. Also, his neck became swollen and had what we called a doughnut around it -- it eventually resolved along with the choking sensation. Within a day or two of the heparin being started, he developed a bleed in his back, near T-10 -- as if the pain in his chest went straight through to his back. This caused him tremendous pain. As the pain increased in his back, it decreased in his chest. Before the second round of R-CHOP two weeks later, my husband expressed his concern that if he were given the chemo before the hematoma in his back resolved that he would bleed again expanding the bleed. The doctor said he did not think that would be a problem, but that if it did, he would give zinecard to avoid muscle damage. The morning following the second round of chemo (a Sunday), my husband had a severe burning pain in his back (he was still on pain meds due to the pain in his chest) and he felt and we could see a huge mass in his left lower back that was very warm to the touch. Dr. on call said zinecard would not be helpful and refused to give it and only authorized increased frequency of pain medicine. This, of course, did nothing for shrinking the mass and did little for the pain. The blood began tracking down his back and a new bleed started down low, just above his backside crack and then began spreading below that onto his bottom. His entire lower back was black, blue, and deep red and then it started tracking to both sides. He felt like he was on fire. Nothing else was being done for him. We were horrified and aghast and no one had any answers for us, but they wanted to do chemo again in two weeks. Needless to say, my husband was NOT agreeable to that as he feared he would bleed again. His red blood count numbers dropped to 6.4 and 18. In the hospital, we put large hospital ice packs on his back and sides -- it took 12 of them and we had to keep refilling them about every 5 to 6 hours. The cold would bring on muscle spasms, so he was given a muscle relaxer as well. That was 6 weeks ago -- the mass in his back is still the same size and my husband is still in terrible pain. Some of the swelling has gone down in his left arm and chest and tremendously in his feet and legs. He has not received any other treatment and the doctors seem to have no clue as to what caused the bleed in his back or how to proceed. After the second round of chemo, we were told that the tumor shrunk by 30% and that the SVC had opened up some, but no one knows why he is still swollen or why the huge hematoma is not resolving. The tracked blood in his back has mostly resolved, but the area is darkened where the blood had been. The lung has created new pathways through the PEs and there is no word on the DVT. After 32 days in the hospital, my husband was released and is still on large doses of pain medicine, Zofran, and Lovenox. He is nauseated, in terrible pain, and is not eating. Four weeks ago, his blood tests showed that he has low protein and low albumen. Nothing is being done about this and my husband now has hanging skin from losing too much weight too quickly. I have brought this to the doctor s attention several times, but he has done nothing about it. My husband has dropped almost 30 kg in 2 months and the doctor has not adjusted his Lovenox dose, which is weight based, and he has not even gotten a weight on him. Our last visit was 3 weeks ago. My husband lies in bed all day feeling sick and in pain. He was once a very strong man who endured lots of pain without a word of complaint. In 30 years of knowing him, he used pain medicine only when his wisdom tooth was extracted years ago and when he broke his RIGHT (NOT LEFT) ankle 25 years ago. He says that it is a burning, searing pain in his back and he and I believe that the chemo is in his muscle and affecting his nerves as well. It is very difficult for him to walk because he can t lift his legs. I have to physically help him move his legs. Can somebody please tell us what to do BEFORE he becomes paralyzed and the tumor starts growing again from lack of treatment. We are getting NO HELP from the doctors. The doctor now wants him to do radiation and we have an appointment scheduled for Thursday with the Radiation Oncologist. I doubt that he will even be able to get out of bed to get there. For the last 2 weeks, he has become incredibly nauseated and for no apparent reason, he has started losing his hair again -- it is all over his pillow. This seems to us to indicate that he still has that chemo sitting in his body. He also has lost all of the hair under his left arm (which is the side that is still quite swollen). His bowel became impacted last week and our doctor told us to go to the ER and said that my husband would get a neuro work-up while he was there. He indicated that my husband would be admitted because he asked us to go to a different hospital than the one we wanted to go to because he preferred the Oncology service there -- there is no Oncology in the ER, only on the Oncology/Hematology floor of the hospital. After spending 15 hours in the ER with no water given to my husband (even though I had requested that the nurse give him some as he could not urinate for them to test it and he was losing a ton of fluid through his bowel), the ER released him with only running an MRI, but he was NOT admitted nor was any neuro testing such as a nerve-conduction study done or recommended. My husband was taken out of our vehicle when we arrived at the ER directly onto a bed because he is so incredibley weak and wasted. We were told that the MRI showed no change and I asked no change from what because my husband had never had an MRI before. The nurse could not answer the question. My husband now has no control over his bowel --his stools are liquid and just runs out of him. He is wearing diapers to be on the safe side. We fear that the chemo has damaged his bowel, which we wonder is what maybe caused the impaction in the first place. He has lost all sensation in his left arm, hand, and fingers and his chest and arm are still swollen on that side. He has lost the sensation in his right arm, hand and 3 fingers on his right hand. He has lost sensation in both of his legs and feet. He feels numb and has tingling sensations in all arms, hands, legs, and feet. We feel he is becoming permantently paralyzed. We also fear him getting radiation because we do not know if he still has chemo agents still in that swollen mass and muscle in his back. Is it safe to have radiation if chemo is still in the body? Is radiation 5 days a week for 5 weeks straight safe or usual? Also, since chemo was injected directly into his vein and was carried through the blood and the bleed in his back restarted within hours of the second round of chemo and chemo was still in his blood, can you please explain why the doctor insists that there was no chemo leaking into my husband s back? Does it somehow magically disappear? We fear that my husband has been chemically burned on the inside and that his muscles and nerves and maybe tissues have been and are still being destroyed by the chemo. Is there anyway to get that stuff out of his back at this point? Is there an expert out there that can help us? We are so DESPERATE!! He needs to be seen by someone who can help him!! He feels like he is slowly dying. PLEASE, PLEASE HELP US!! We still have children at home and we do NOT want them growing up without a Daddy (like both of us had to).

She was 8.5 years old at that time. She underwent initial treatment at TMH in Mumbai . She underwent rest of the treatment at Bhopal Cancer Hospital under DM Oncologist . Protocol 841 was followed. She completed the initial Induction successfully in 2006 end itself and started the consolidation phase in 2007 . During the consolidation and induction phases she had 4-5 packed RBC transfusions and 8-10 platelet transfusions .She completed the entire consolidation phase medication including spinal taps except the last leg of ARAC . At this time her platelets had dropped down to levels of 30,000 to 40,000 and were not recovering .This was around June of 2007. We were advised to wait and watch for the marrow to recover. At this time , my daughter underwent a 2 month course of ayurvedic medication given by Dr (Vaidya) balendu Prakash of Dehradun and in a month her platelets came back to normal levels . This medication was stopped then. At this time, her local oncologist then advised us to let her stabilize and after a month start maintenance phase under Protocol 841. We started this in September 2007 and the maintenance medication ended on 1st June 2009. It is now 1 year and six months since she is off oral chemo and she has completed 4 years from diagnosis in November 2010. During the last 18 months she has had her share of Cough/cold and virals like any child and has been treated with appropriate antibiotics under guidance of her oncologist. She is now 12 years old and full of energy like any school going child. She has been having CBC done every month in the last 18 months and her reading span is as below ( tables also appended below) • Platelets – 1.7 Lacs to 3 lacs - Recent ones are between 2.1 lacs to 3 Lacs • WBC – 10000 – 13500 - Neutrophils and Lymphocytes are in normal ranges unless she has a infection or fever. • HBG – 11.5 – 12 .5 The area I needed advise on was the range of WBC – You can see from the chart below that it is almost constantly above 10000 and has even gone up to 13400 after which it has again come down. Most of the time she has had no fever. Even the last reading which you see of 13800 wbc, she has had only cough and cold with no fever.I have personally spoken to the pathologist who confirmed he has examined peripherals and smear carefully and morphology of cells Is absolutely normal.

My dad has been diagnosed with Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma. 3 weeks ago he went thru surgery to take out an enormous mass under his left arm and in his back.

They want to just amputate and follow with trmts of radiation and chemotherapy. Without he will surely die, with it he still can die if it goes to his lungs. His doctors talk of a guy in San Francisco who has developed a new pill/med that fights metastatic basal cell carcinoma but I haven t recieved much more info on that.

Diagnosis 1- Metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. 2- History of hemorrhagic stroke with left hemi paresis. 3- Sick sinus syndrome, status post pacemaker insertion. 4- Diabetes mellitus. 5- Essential hypertension. Of a 77 Y.O. male patient was admitted to hospital on January 10th, 2010 with higher upper quadrant pain associated with fever of 39.5 degrees C. he reported no respiratory symptoms. He had no hematemesis of Melina. The patient reported that he had been feeling week for several months and lost about 09 KGS. From 80 Kg A year ago to 71Kg. He reported extreme weakness from being fully ambulatory till several weeks before presentation to being bed bound and poorly responsive now. The patient did not have any new reparatory symptoms. He is an ex smoker. He quit almost 50 years ago. Since admission, the patient has had a workup that showed multiple liver masses with multiple abdominal lymphadenopathy mostly in the porta hapatis and gastro esophageal junction area. Examination revealed an elderly male who looked very week. He had no cervical, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy. His chest showed good air entry interiorly. His abdomen was soft with mid right upper quadrant tenderness. the liver was palpable, mostly in the epigastria region, about 5 cm. Genitalia showed no masses. Significant Investigation; Hemoglobin was 11g/dt. LDH 725 and alkaline phosphates 139. ALT and AST were normal. CEA was increased to 9.6 and CA19-9 was 70. Alpha-fetoprotein and PSA were normal. CT of the chest showed a small right pleural effusion. There was severe bilateral central labural emphysema. There was basilar sub-segmental atelectasis. CT of the abdomen showed multiple enhancing liver lesions, The largest two involved the anterior segment of the right liver lobe and the medial segment of the left liver lobe, and measured 8.7 x 6.7 cm and 7.7 X 7.2cm respectively. The interior vena cave was severely compressed by the right anterior liver lobe segment lesion, however it resumes it s normal caliber in the suprahepatic inferior vena cave level. There were multible sub-centemeter lymph nodes just below the level of the gastro esophageal junction with an average size of 1.2 x 0.8cm. However, there are larger lymph nodes measuring 1.2cm in the shortest axis, mainly in the peri-celiac an porta hepatis region where multiple enlarged lymph nodes are also present. There were also multiple sub-centimeter peri-aortic lymph nodes. The prostate was significantly enlarged and heterogeneous, likely due to heterogeneous enhancement. The maximum obtained diameters are 6.5 x 8 x 8.7cm in the AP. transverse and sagittal diameters respectively. A CT-guided liver biopsy showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Recommendation Palliative care was recommended. Please revert back with your best possible recommendation to treat my father in-law.

Summery is as below. 60 Yrs. Male, known case of DMT2, Plasma cell myeloma with paraplegia on chemotherapy. Patient had presented with complaints of severe low back pain, radiate to both lower limb. He was hospitalized on 13/08/2013. His MRI L.S. spine was done which was suggestive of insular lesion L1 extending B/L neural foramina with hyper intense signal D5, D7, L4, S1 and right Acetabulam- under evaluation. Bone marrow biopsy taken on 22/08/2013 which was suggestive of plasma cell myeloma, blood investigation- Light Chain Myeloma stage III and newly detected DM-T2. Heamato-oncologist opinion was taken, who advised chemotherapy ( Dose- 30 GY/10, Site- Dorsolumbar spine ( D10 to L3 Vertebrae, position-supine with orfit cast for immobilization ,No of fields-2 field with subfields, technique-palliative 2 D RT with 6MV photon on linear accelerator, Duration -2 weeks.

He investigated urine for bence jones protein was negative and MRI LS SPINE was done, which revealed multiple scattered well defined altered marrow lesions of varying sizes are seen in vertebral bodies of spine at multiple levels, few of the lesion are showing involvement of posterior elements as well. Similar lesions are seen in bones of pelvis and upper thigh as well. The lesion are causing erosion/lysis of affected bones. The most prominent of these lesions is seen in the L1 body resulting in its mild collapse. In addition abnormal enchancing posterior and lateral epidural soft tissue is seen from D4 to D8 levels causing moderate cord compression anteriorly mainly at D5, D6 and D7 levels. Overall findings appear consistent with multiple myeloma. In comparison with previous latest MRI the lesions appear better defind with prominent fatty changes in rest of marrow of spine. Previously seen epidural soft tissue at D11 to L1 is almost completely regressed however there is new appearance of epidural soft tissue from D4 to D8 with moderate cord compression. Suggest correlation with other relevant parameters and SOS follow up. Hence 1 cycle of chemotherapy given on 26/10/2013 (INJ- BORTEZOMIB 2.5 mg) and Radiotherapy on 23/10/2013 and 24/10/2013.

All my hormonal levels were fine back then only prolactin was slightly high which the doc said I didnt need to worry about much. I suffered from acne at that time as well and had skipped 2 menstrual cycles. A few months before the diagnosis, my hair volume had decreased drastically. I suffered from tremendous hair loss. Initially I had thick, straight hair with a lot of volume but now it has become incredibly thin and brittle. I still suffer from hair loss. I got treatment done for pcod (glycomet 500mg, ovacare forte for 1 year), acne (4 months of tretiva 10 mg, some topical creams and 15 day antibiotic course each month) and hair ( 2 months minoxidil 5% then next 2 months 2%, 4 months dietary supplements and one month biotin). I got this treatment for acne n hair from jan-april 2013. My hair fall stopped and acne cleared up completely. Again after 2 months, from june onwards, hairfall began and terrible acne started popping on my cheeks n chin and later spread onto my nose forehead. These started as huge painful red bumps underneath my skin. Each acne took at least 2-3 weeks to go away. I didn t want to start on Tretiva all over again cause it has many side effects including hair fall. I can t hav contraceptive pills cause of family cancer history. So I sought natural home remedies n none of them worked for me. I visited another dermatologist. She diagnosed me with female pattern thinning which caused a great deal of sadness to me. My dad went bald at the age of 26 and thinking about me losing my hair and getting bald spots just made me terribly upset. I went to another dermatologist for consult n he said I don t hav anything like that but I was still losing hair. He told me to apply foltene solution to my hair which I did for 2 months and that reduced my hair fall to some extent but upon leaving it...hair fall started all over again. From October onwards I just stuck to oiling my hair regularly which didnt help of course. Then I came across another doc in dec 2013 n she told me get a dht test done. The result was incredibly shocking. My dht level was 600 when it should b less than around 350. Yet the doctor said that I would need to go an extensive course of isotretinoin cause the previous doctor had not completed my entire dosage according to body weight. I should hav had 7200 mg but the previous doc had given only 1200mg in 4months. The new doc told me to cover this much dosage which would take 8-9 months and she assured me that there r no side effects of it at all. I wasn t ready to believe that. She also said I don t hav female pattern thinning. She told me that it was because of my low ferritin levels n high dht. She also prescribed minoxidil and dietary supplements including an iron supplement. I am really confused with my problems and not sure what treatment to follow because I had already done the same treatment which was useless.","Doctor":"You can opt for Homoeopathic mode of management.As Homoeopathy is side effectless and very mild to act in oncological cases where immunity gets very heavily deranged.Homoeopathy treatment needs a thorough Case taking to select proper Medicine which needs thorough detailed Case history and reports."},{"Patient":"Hi, my father is 64 years old, he is suffering the leg vasoconstriction which will easily get muscle cramps while sleeping and easily tired while walking, feel quite week.

One year ago, he starts feel his legs week, and easily get muscle cramps, quite painful, probably due to the medicine s side effect, so would you please advise how to deal with it? is there any medicine to treat it? Please let me know, thanks very much for your help in advance.","Doctor":"Hi there,I'm sorry to hear about the medical problems your father is having.  When I hear the symptoms that your father is having, the first thing that comes to my mind is claudication. Claudication is pain while walking due to arterial insufficiency- basically, the muscles in the legs don't get enough blood flow when they are being used, and they start to ache.  This is caused by peripheral vascular disease and is common in smokers, diabetics, and patients with high cholesterol levels.  These patients will often have a history of coronary artery disease and sometimes renal problems as well.  The first thing I would recommend is for your father to start a waking regiment and walk consistently every day.  He should aim to walk for about 30 minutes a day. If he can't do 30 minutes, he should do as much as he can, and then try to do a little more each day.  The most important thing is daily consistency - he has to do it every day, not just one or two times a week. I'd also recommend he check his cholesterol levels, and if they are high a statin such as lipitor (atorvastatin) can help lower his levels and prevent further damage. Finally, if he continues to have problems with walking after 6 months of a dedicated walking problem, then he should see a vascular surgeon and have his arterial vessels looked at in his leg with ultrasound.

Also she is a dialysis patient 3 days a week my questions is oral medication ok because there no place to place the port due to moving it from place to place during dialysis. YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi there,I'm sorry to hear about your sister. She is lucky to have someone concerned about her to ask questions on her behalf. First of all, stage III rectal cancer is typically treated with both chemotherapy and radiation. Short-course radiation therapy is commonly used in Europe, but longer duration combination therapy is still preferred in the United States. Initial studies demonstrating its effect were undertaken in the adjuvant setting, in which 5-FU–based chemotherapy with concomitant irradiation proved better than irradiation or surgery alone in preventing both local and distant recurrences. Prolonged infusional 5-FU and twice-daily oral capecitabine are considered equivalent in terms of radiosensitization, although no trial data are available to compare the two. The appropriate sequencing of therapy was assessed in a large German study, in which patients were randomly assigned to receive standard, infusional 5-FU plus irradiation either before or after definitive TME. Preoperative combined modality therapy resulted in a lower rate of local recurrence (6% vs 13% at 5 years), a lower toxicity rate (acute and chronic), and a higher rate of sphincter preservation than did postoperative therapy. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has thus become the standard of care for patients with stages II and III rectal cancer.(Source - André T, Boni C, Navarro M, et al.: Improved overall survival with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as adjuvant treatment in stage II or III colon cancer in the MOSAIC trial. J Clin Oncol. 27 (19):3109-3116 2009 19451431)So basically, to answer your question, oral chemotherapy can be used, but IV chemo should also be used in order to maximize her chance of a cure. She will still need surgical excision, but this will be done after her chemotherapy and radiation is complete.  If her dialysis access is a catheter, it is possible that they can use the catheter for chemotherapy infusion.  I hope this is helpful.

My questions to you: 1-What are there benefits/concerns with neoadjuvant therapy vs adjuvant therapy (having the surgery now and determining the exact stage of the cancer to establish the appropriate treatment)? 2-If she proceeds with the neoadjuvant therapy, should she have a lymph node biopsy now? If not, when? 3-Her pathology report shows HER-2 Negative. From what I read this is a good thing. How accurate is the process of determining HER2 positive or negative in a pathology report vs the fish test? 4-Can you tell me if an Oncotype DX test is important?

Last night I took stool softeners and this morning I took stool softeners too. I was still unable to go, so I took an enema and had some success but not much. This afternoon I took a laxative because I was still in a lot of pain. I was finally able to go, and it was runny just like it always is (sorry for the details). I am still having severe pains in the lower left part of my abdomen or gut area. I haven't had any recent surgery, I haven't changed my diet or done anything strenuous. If I don't move the pain is just kind of throbbing or a kind of bloated cramping feeling kind of like menstrual cramps only more targeted to my left side. When I move however it is a sharp almost tearing feeling on the left side. When I cough, or blow my nose it has a sharp sudden pain too, though when I sneeze it isn't as painful as the cough. I hope this is enough details for you. I am thinking I will have to go to the clinic tomorrow when it opens. I just don't want to go and have them say that I just really need to poo. Thank you for your help","Doctor":"Hello dear,The causes of constipation can be:1. Any pathology/ sub acute obstruction in the Gastrointestinal tract2. Irritable bowel syndrome- constipation predominant type.3. Functional cause- due to decreased gastric motility4. Inadequate intake of fluids and fiber rich diet.5. Hormonal & Metabolic causes, etc.Though symptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of Laxatives, their regular use is not advised.And as long as the underlying cause is not treated, symptoms will keep recurring.So, kindly consult a Gastroenterologist & get a proper physical examination done.Investigations like complete blood count, Ultrasound scan of abdomen, Colonoscopy & contrast studies will be helpful to rule out any pathological cause for your symptoms.There is no need to worry, you will be fine.Till then, maintain adequate hydration & proper nutrition status.Take care."},{"Patient":"what is the cost of treatment for cancer in adayar cancer hospital in chennai?my mother in law is suffering from uterus cancer she has undergone uterus removal surgery now dr there says she has to do 50 sittings of radiation therapy.what is the cost of one radiation therapy per sititng there?","Doctor":"Hello Dear.

So in conclusion, your doctor's recommendation sounds OK if your weight is close to 88Kgr. Since your TSH was so low, serious reduction in dosage was required anyway. In any case the ideal dosage can be found with trial and error...I hope it helps!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hello 3 years ago I found cancer in the lymph nodes on the left side of by neck.

Stage IV cancers which spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body cause serious complications and spread usually involves bones, liver, and lungs.

Is Glucerna suitable for liver cancer because of its sweety taste and sugar components. Please answer my question. I am looking forward to receiving your reply. Wishing you have a good day. Sincerely, Nilar","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.Gčucerna is a nutritional supplement used when some patient has poor appetite or feel that diet is lacking, It contains a variety of nutrients you need for good health, and of course that it can be used in people with any form of cancer or other serious diseases and in cahexic conditions. However, you need to be aware that this is not cure or medication and it will not affect tumor progression or have any significant effect on prognosis. It just replaces food that patient usually can take in sufficient amounts.So my answer is, that Glucerna can be taken in these patients especially if there is rapid weight loss and poor apetite, but conventional methids for cancer fight should be followed.Hope this answers your question.

I think that at this point there are no many factors which are suggestive of pancreatic cancer,however you should do some other tests, at least bilirubin levels and CA 19-9 markers which is marker of pancreas cancer. Amylase and Lipsae are enzymes which are elevated in any other pancreatic disease including inflammation, cyst, chronic pancreatitis or some rare intestinal disorders. Most commonly we see it in chronic pancreatitis. This is treated by alcohol avoidance  and you should eat less fatty food, less sugar and more vegetables and boiled food.I suggest to repeat blood tests in 4 weeks and do Ca19-9 and repeat abdominal ultrasound, not CT.

I am a 33 year old female. I was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the bartholin gland 2 years ago, and had a hemi-vulvectomy and lymph node removal from my left groin. The cancer was removed successfully and no radiation was required. Since the surgery, I have had severe pain in my perineal area (my oncologist kept on telling me that the pain was probably due to scar tissue, and to wait it out and see if it would get any better.) I have decided to stop seeing that oncologist...I think I have a very high thresh hold for pain- I ve given birth to 2 children without pain medication). My concern is that the pain I am experiencing is a recurrence, as the tender area seems to be getting larger. It feels like a very deep bruise and it is more in my left butt cheek then near my vagina. I have an appointment with my gyno in 2 weeks. Do you think I should be worried?

I just had my follow-up bloodwork and am on 125 Synthroid 8x/week. My Tg was 6.3, down from 23.7 and my TSH is 0.77. I was told that the Tg is still high, since it should be 0 and this means there still could be residual tumors although invisible on US. Why do I need to have lower than normal thyroid levels to suppress the tumor growth?","Doctor":"Hello,TG or thyreoglubuline is a glucoproteine, so a prteine, produced in your thyroid gland. So when your thyroid gland is completely removed (total thyroidectomy) or destroyed by radioactive jodium, the TG level should in theory be zero as there is no thyroid tissue level left.In cases of some thyroid cancer like papillary cancer the TG level is a parameter to follow up the disease. So if the TG level is increasing, that might be a sign that the cancer has come back. So after removing the lymph nodes it's a good sign that the level of TG is going down, but I agree that the level is still to high. So it's not a question of suppressing , it's rather a question of follow up of your cancer. The difficult part is when levels are still high and there's nothing to see on the ultrasound , where are there still cancer cells? So a Ct scan of the neck  and chest might give information as well as a nuclear scan.Hope this answered your question"},{"Patient":"hello there i would love you to help me as i am about out of my mind with stress over this . about 6 weeks ago i started with a sharp pain in my left pelvic area its there most of the day on and off dose not hurt if i work out at the gym or with movment ,it dose hurt a little if i open my bowels or push down ,hurts more when i am sitting also. i am so scared to get a scan done as i am sure its going to be ovarian cancer i cant think of anything else. i have had 2 days now were i feel the pain is a little better and just hurts more when i went to the toilet today.i have been told i may gave ibs i do have a lot of strange noise in my tummy a while after eating and i have to somtime run fast to the toilet more so on a morning. i am 33 mom of 2 children 1 i lost 11 years ago due to strep b,also in my pregnanct i have a very large ovarian cyst taken away also on the left side ,all was ok when that was taken away thanks so much mrs burlinson","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic.

I received a stem cell transplant in June of 2004 and have been in remission since. Due to radiation I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in April of 2004 and have been on meds since. Prior to this I was one that could manage my weight with proper diet and exercise although I still eat properly and exercise (when my meds are optimum and not tired) I can t maintain a healthy weight. Is the HCG diet an option for me? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It is good that you are conscious regarding your weight gain and want to maintain your weight in a healthy way, but I would not advise you to go for HCG diet for several reasons.Firstly, HCG diet is a very low calorie diet which allows intake of as low as 500 calories per day. These calories are very less to provide necessary proteins, vitamins and minerals in a person. Even if doctors recommend very low calorie diets to obese patients, they advise intake of at least 100 calories per day, that too under doctor's observation.Secondly, you are suffering from Hodgkin's Lymphoma. You do need adequate nutritional supplements in order to maintain enough strength in your body to survive the lymphoma itself and the treatment modalities it offers. Deficiency of essential vitamins, minerals and protein will not help and will only raise complications regarding your health. Lastly, HCG diet is not even approved by FDA. It has nothing to do with the HCG hormone associated with pregnancy. I would not advise anyone to follow this diet, especially a person suffering from a disorder as serious as Hodgkin's Lymphoma.Even if it may seem hard to you and requires lot of patience and hard work, I would recommend healthy diet and exercise along with healthy lifestyle changes in order to reduce gained extra weight. There is no good and healthy shortcut for this purpose.I hope this answer guides you well. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish you feel better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had an Hyperplasia complex with focal atypia regressed 2 years ago , I want to do the hcg diet and my doctor told me I can t , before he told me the only way I will not have the hyperplasia coming back is 1- need to loose weight 2- taking progesterone pills 3- getting pregnant and my question is while a women is pregnant she developes thousands of ius of the hcg hormone why I can t have much less ius of the hormone to do the diet????","Doctor":"hi,I am not sure how this site allows doctors to see reports, Because i see no options to see any reportsHowever , it appears that you want to loose weight and is inclined to use hcg diet for the same.

She had a small nodule that she was able to feel on her neck region since 2007 but left unattended. By November 2009, she had under gone left radial neck dissection for total thyroidectomy. The biopsy report also said metastasis to Level II and III neck nodes and left mediastinal nodes and left recurrent laryngeal nodes (08/34) with no perinodal tumor infiltration. The TNM classification was : pT3pN1bcMx and the grouping was : stage I. The medication that was advised includes – 200mg thyroxin daily and 500mg x2 daily. Following thyroidectomy remnant thyroid tissues were ablated with oral suspension of 4181MBq I-131. Ablation was performed on Dec 2009. Post therapy, significant uptake was seen in the thyroid bed (as expected). A new focal uptake was also seen in the left Humerus. Six months later in July 2010, a 4mCi I-131 solution was administered and scaned. Complete ablation of the residual thyroid tissue was observed but persistence of tracer uptake in the left Humerus alone was also observed. Additionally, thyroglubulin levels (Tg) was 209 ng/ml, TSH was 100ulU/ml and Tg antibodies were 0.76IU/ml. In order to analyse the foci on the left shoulder a CT scan was advised by the doctor as the patient was also complaining of occasional but intense pain. The CT report showed the presence of a well define lytic lesion (11x 12mm) in the neck of the Humerus with sclerotic borders. The image suggested the possibility of osteoblastoma and osteoid osteoma. Later an MRI scan with contrast was advices, but the conclusions are pointing to a benign etiology. Against this background, the specific questions include: 1)     Is there a possibility that the shoulder lesion is a spread of the cancer. In that case, what would be the technique adviced by the doctor to diagnose the same. 2)     Can benign tumors will also produce Tg ? Or, if the shoulder lesion is benign, then what may be reason for the high Tg levels? 3)     Can any other organ be involved in the spread…..that has been left unnoticed? (under the backdrop of high Tg levels). 4)     What are the other suggested imaging techniques or clinical diagnostic methods to rule out metastasis? 5)     What is the approximate expected longevity of this patient?","Doctor":"hello,With the background history of thyroid cancer there is high chances that the  bone lesion could me spread of disease. Hence Tg could be high for the same reason. the possibilty of other organ spread can not be ruled out at this time.She should undergo A PETCT as a part of metastatic workup if Tc99 scan is not readily available. It is too early to say about longevity until nature of this lesion is proved.

In most cases, they are left without treatment if they do not cause discomfort to the patient and are not infected. There are many cysts which are benign and may have stone-like calcified structures within it. Having stone in cyst does not mean it is cancerous. So do not worry about it just because they found calcified structures within cyst.The confirmation of presence of cancer in any area of the body is based on the biopsy of the area and lesion involved. You have failed to mention what part of your body is involved.

Since somedays Im having Gastritis and I am showing Dr.Harshal gadhikar for that who is giving treatment of Razo20, lesuride25mg for 1 month, i have completed that course but still lot of burning sensation in stomach and womiting sensation. My toungue develops white coating everyday with some red spots for which I had shown to a skin specialist who had given me Mucopain gel, Tantum oral rinse and Ginicast oral paste which i had applied but did not get any relief, is it because i had mouth contact with prostitute who was having pan masala and should get tested for oral cancer, could you please tell me who are the good oral cancer doctors in Pune and what are the tests to be done for oral cancer. I am attaching my photos of the tounge, kindly suggest. As i have read about Hiv in articles it is said that the symptoms may develop in 2 or 3 years depending on the immunity of the body, so do i have symptoms which are the signs of the disease but may take time to come out in the Elisa Hiv test reports. I get lot of sweating in the legs and in hands, since some time I remain in confused state of mind and forget things. Is it possible to get an Hiv test done through the saliva or from the toungue, kindly suggest some tests. I would like to take appointment from you if possible to explain and show my reports.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. I have a few question for you that can help you in deciding if the lesion can be cancerous or not. Firstly, can you scrape the white lesion off the tongue leaving red areas beneath? If you can scrape it, then it is either tongue coating due to plaque or fungal infection called candidiasis. If you are not able to scrape off the white part of the lesion, then it can be pre-cancerous condition called Leukoplakia. The test to confirm if you have oral cancer is biopsy of the white lesion of the tongue. It can be done by an oral surgeon. To answer your other question, the blood test that identifies HIV antibodies is the best test to confirm presence of HIV infection in your body. It is more sensitive and reliable than saliva or other tests. The test can be done in a week after suspected infection of the virus. If it comes out negative, then it has to repeated after 3 months as HIV antibodies can reach detectable level in blood as late as 86 days after infection. If that test comes negative, then there are 97% chances that you are not having HIV infection. In case of negative tests for oral cancer and HIV infection, you should contact a physician for investigations regarding general physical health of you. I am afraid we cannot provide you with any reference of a doctor in your area. You can ask your family physician to refer you to one. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

He has prostate cancer but the cause of his illness has been MRSA, kidney failure, and various respitory infections including Fungal Pneumonia. I have notice that his tongue, mouth and gums are turning orange. What would cause this?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. I can think of several possibilities for the orange discoloration of tongue, gums and teeth of your father.Firstly, as he is in hospital for 3 months for various diseases, it is understandable that his oral hygiene will be compromised. Regular toothbrushing, flossing and gargles would have been neglected for 3 months. This may cause accumulation of food particles, debris, plaque etc. on the teeth, gums and tongue surfaces causing them to appear orange. If his oral hygiene can be improved by use of power toothbrush, mouthwash etc., this problem can be solved.Secondly, as he is taking many antibiotics for a chronic period of time and he is also suffering from fungal pneumonia, there are chances that he is having fungal/yeast growth in mouth causing orange appearance. Ask the doctor if fungal pneumonia is being treated with systemic antifungal medications that can cover fungal infection of oral cavity and the growth with stop and disappear. In addition, there are some antibiotics given to treat MRSA, kidney disease and respiratory infections that have side effects of changing the normal bacterial flora of mouth and causing orange discoloration. You can ask your treating doctor about this too. I can assure you that none of these causes are too severe and should not be worried about. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HCM.

This is an infection of the gut usually caused by bacteria or a virus . Gastroenteritis also causes diarrhoea.  ,can be rectified by modifying foods and life style .The most important thing you can do when vomiting is to keep taking small sips of fluid so that  you don't become dehydrated. Drink water sip by sips , lemon juice with salt and honey , diluted fruit juice or butter  milk. A sweet drink can be useful for replacing lost sugar . You may find that ginger helps to relieve  nausea and vomiting. Try drinking fresh ginger stewed in a mug of hot water. Aroma of crushed Coriander and mint leaves and taken orally with little salt and few drops of lemon juice  arouse appetite and is good for stomach Your immune system will usually fight off the infection after a few days.To strengthen your immune system  you need to modify your life style and food habits ,Eating the right kinds of foods before, during, and after cancer treatment can help the patient feel better and stay stronger. A healthy diet includes eating and drinking enough of the foods and liquids that have the essential  nutrients (vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, fat, and antioxidants  in natural form  - fiber , veges , fruit , ginger ,garlic , bitter gourd , amla , aloe vera &  coconut water etc ) the body needs .Physical activity  as Walk , exercise - stretching , will provide added advantage in way of enhancing  fast recovery , Yoga  ,  Pranayam , Meditation if done with in  physical capacity  , under expert guidance will provide added advantage in way of enhancing  fast recovery .  Avoid  Deep fried, grilled, barbequed, baked meats since subjecting animal protein to high heat creates carcinogenic byproducts . Excessive intake of salt, sugar, and oily foods.

Pain is the most common and agnosing complication after cancer detection and treatment as it is also a side effect of all the treatment modalities including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

It has shown success in inflammation of the oral mucosa following cancer treatment and irritation caused by surgical lesion. I am sorry to inform you that there is no way we can provide you with samples of the molecule for trial.

So let us understand first the mechanism of breathing.respiratory system is the only source of providing oxygen to the body as, oxygen is the fuel need for the human life to survive. Also, due to smoking the respiratory system has become weak and there is no such medicine to make it strong or recover again. What can heal with medicine is the symptomatic help for removal of secretions or infection. Since you been smoking also, an added disadvantage has occurred to the respiratory system by weakening the alveoli. Alveoli is the place where the exchange of gases between the respiratory system and blood takes place. In short, it's the place to purify the blood. Also, as you are 64, your muscles of the respiratory system has also got weaker.What need to provide the best help to the respiratory system is to improve the capacity of the lungs which will help you avoid breathless and also improve the quality of blood in the body.I will advice you to do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the strength in the respiratory muscles and the lung tissues. Also doing meditation will help control the brain activity as brain regulates the involuntary control of the respiration. for making the ease of the respiratory system it is advised to perform regular breathing exercise to keep the functionality of the lung to the optimumregardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"my father had an oral cancer surgery on 29th jan 2014.he is ok with that.he was prescribed with cremaffin syrup.suddenly for the first time he bleeded profusely instead of stool.he came home last wednesday and we gave one dosage of cremaffin.the very nxt day he started bleeding again.colonoscopy is done and they could nt find the source of bleeding yet but bleeding has stopped probably they gave some medicines.can u suggest anything in this situation?","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question.

Thanks."},{"Patient":"My Mother in law has been battleing Ovarian Cancer this year and now she is sick again and stomach bloated and hard having a hard time breathing she spent 5 days in hospital and they sent her home............they will not tell us anything......she is 85 years old .........sounds to me her cancer has spread .......so weak she cannot get out of bed or set up","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your mother's situation and problem. Chemotherapeutic drugs are known to cause gastritis, vomiting and bloating. So side effects from the cancer drugs can be the cause for her symptoms. Another possibility is metastases to stomach and intestine. So better to get done 1. Upper GI (gastrointestinal) scopy. 2. CT scan of abdomen. If both these are negative for metastases then possibility of gastritis and related symptoms is more. So she will improve with proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. So consult her treating doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.

I am 40 years old and was diagnosed with Leukemia in Feb 2010. I had treatment and a bone transfer and is now clear since end 2010. They did a bone scan and found that I have osteopenia. I also have early menopause. I am currently on Premique to help with my bones. Is there anything natural I can use instead of Premique/hormone tablets? Thanks Marlene","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Osteopenia is decreased calcium in the bones. Most common cause for this is poor oral intake of calcium. So you should take food which is having high quantity of calcium. Foods like milk, milk products like (cheese, cottage cheese), green leafy vegetables, fruits, eggs, liver oil etc are rich in calcium. So start these natural supplements for Osteopenia. You should also start oral tablet with combination of calcium and vitamin d 3. This will help in increasing body calcium and improve your Osteopenia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I had a petuitary sac tumour removed in April, 2014. Doctors put me on Solupred, Eltroxin and Crestor...

If you have had chemotherapy sessions with medicine that can cause damage to the brain and nerves then having a gait problem can be explained due to chemotherapy.The damage is slow and 78 sessions of chemotherapy is significant when we talk about side effects of the medicine. The nerves might have developed paraesthesia and this causes you to have abnormal sensations. It is also important to know if you are getting your regular supply of vitamins and this can also cause nerve related symptoms. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello - almost two weeks ago (it will be two weeks on Sunday) I banged my head (temple area) into the sharp corner of a coffee table and almost immediately had what you would call a goose egg. I started the process of icing it. The swelling went down, and about 12 hours later there was purple bruising, particularly near my eye where the blood must have migrated to. It has just about healed (turned about yellow, then went away, all within a matter of days) and I have no more pain, but I do still have a slight bump in that area which I would compare in size and feel to a pimple or mosquito bite. It s not even visible, but I can feel it. I know it s still probably just healing but I was wondering if that is likely hematoma and if there is anything I can do to help that alleviate it. Should I continue with icing or should I switch to warm compresses and/or massaging the area?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You might have had a scalp swelling after your injury which caused the goose egg appearance. This can happen when there is slight injury and bleeding in to the skin. This injury is restricted to the scalp and does not cause any bleeding in the brain. If there is worsening pain, dizziness, vomiting and nausea, difficulty to maintain gait then a brain problem would have been thought of.Icing might not help much and you can start warm compresses to feel better. Hematoma can occur under the scalp but it usually maintains its size. Your injury does not look like hematoma. It has healed in 2 weeks and should heal more over next 2 weeks. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"iam complain from enlargement of left lacrimal gland it presents for three years ago I used anti inflammatory and anti biotic drops it not increase n size but it causes dificlt in moving lid and droping in lid and also dryness of eye I asking if may grow cancer in this place and what is treatment","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The lacrimal gland apparatus is located in the eye to help in keeping the surface moist and lubricates the eyes. It is important to do a clinical examination to know the exact nature of your problem. I hope your doctor has done lacrimal syringing to know if the lacrimal ducts are patent. Many times the small ducts can develop blocks and then cause infection. While most infections are acute and people recover from it in a few days, some proceed to have a chronic infection which can become difficult to treat.The moving of eyelid can happen due to the formation of healing tissue in the lacrimal gland region. A cancer is not common in lacrimal glands but this should be confirmed with your doctor. The lacrimal gland contains secreting cells and a cancer is suspected if there is a non healing wound or rapidly growing lump in the region. Early detected cancers are easily cured with minimum surgery. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I had thyroid cancer and thyroid was removed in March this year.

I feel like my heart beats funny--fast or slow??? Just funny. kinda feels like its shaky...I talked to the dr today and she acted like I was nuts. She did take blood and said she call me next week. Should I be on calcium and vitamin B as well?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are many causes for a fluttering heart beat and it is possible that the synthroid 200 might be causing it in you. The extreme cold feeling and hot and sweaty at times can be from thyroid imbalance. This is to be evaluated after doing thyroid function test and then knowing any abnormal values.Calcium is a natural ion required in our food and women over 50 years need more calcium because there is a tendency to develop osteoporosis after menopause. Therefore taking calcium is beneficial for you and in the recommended dose it will keep you in good health.Vitamin B in many types is required for functioning of cells and nerves. This is a water soluble vitamin and essential micro nutrient. Please take plenty of fruits and vegetables which are natural sources of vitamin B. You can take supplement which is available.

DBS( deep brain stimulation) is approved in treatment of parkinson and essential tremor. There is also the potential for neuropsychiatric side-effects, including apathy, hallucinations, compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, cognitive dysfunction, and depression.

Had lost sight in left eye than in right. Right eye had improved for a while but just 2 days ago both eyes seemed to have some activity and now the right eye has gone to black. Have you heard of the vision getting worse before better?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chemotherapy for Neuromyelitis optica can have different responses in different patients and variable responses in the same patient under different circumstances. It looks like the chemotherapy is showing variable response in your case. The improvement and worsening of vision depends on the recovery of the optic nerves and the swelling around it.When chemotherapy is given then there can be some initial swelling of optic nerve sheath and this can cause temporary worsening of vision. This can then improve slowly with time as the chemotherapy response gets better. Therefore the initial worsening can be due to the swelling of the nerves and with continued treatment this will improve. However since vision is an important area therefore please discuss in detail with your doctor. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am 55 years old & it has been 3 years since my complete hysterectomy due to stage 1 uterine cancer.

In prostate cancer there is proliferation of cancerous cells from the prostate gland. It is important to know the stage of cancer you are having and any infiltration of the cancer to the adjacent organs.Any approach to the prostate during TURP is from the urethra which is the urinary passage connecting the urinary bladder to the outside. The urethra is a delicate tube and it is possible to have it damaged during surgery and investigations. The bleeding you experienced can be from an injury to the urethra. It is also probable that there is recurrent cancer and infiltration of the urethra after your surgery. In this situation please consult your doctor immediately and get investigated and treated if the bleeding continues. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"my brother has a recurrent pitutary tumour which has now protruded to teh right eye orbit and teh lower portion of the eye has come out of the eye lids , He has removed the tumour in2008 but has grown after that , need a suitable doctor who can treat him","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is probable that your brother has a recurrent pituitary tumor which has grown after surgery. It is 7 years after his surgery and therefore the tumor has been growing steadily to cause his eye to get protruded. It is important to see his pre operative MRI scan and and interval scans to know the extent of the tumor and the pressure it is causing on the adjacent structures. If the tumor has grown slowly in few years then it is possible to assess the condition and suggest a surgery.You should consult doctors in head and neck oncology and a neurosurgeon at a specialist cancer institute in your location. They will do imaging evaluation and know which approach of treatment is better for your brother. There might be a requirement of radiation treatment, chemotherapy and surgery which needs to be carefully planned. Many doctors can handle such cases and it is important to get urgent consultation because if the optic nerve gets damaged then vision will get affected. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My husband had what looked like a fatty tumor on his elbow for years. Recently grew larger & painful. So he opened it & squeezed it. Got 11/2 T.

Still feels sl hard spot & wants to open it up, thinks it s tissue in there still. A 5,000 deductible brought this on. I m a retired RN. What to do? Let him? Help him? At this point he won t see a Dr! Any advice? I won t hold you responsible (LOL) for ANY advise! Thank You, Paula","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A draining tumor like area requires medical attention. It is probably a chronic condition of the skin which has developed recent inflammation and pus formation. If it is in the elbow area then it should be examined by a doctor and if required then imaging investigations are to be done.Many times an infection slowly grows under the skin and can end up infiltrating to the bones and joints after months to years. Since he is unable to go to a doctor then you can take a chance to remove all the pus being a RN and can see that there is healthy tissue in the floor of the wound or ulcer then you can pack it with an antiseptic ointment and observe for slow healing. He must protect the wound from contamination. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"While in the Navy, I had two incisional  mesh hernia repairs. The second repair was to fix the first repair.  I do not recall if they were inguinal, or hiatal.  Both surgeries occurred within a 9 month period about 13 years ago.  Almost immediately, after the second surgery, I have had non stop issues with frequent urination.  Is this a common problem related to hernia repairs? Is there anything that can be done to remedy the problem? I also have permanent numbness around the incision is this also normal?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,Numbness in the area after surgery could imply some trauma to the nerves around this area. The nerves that supply this particular area have common branches originating from the whole genital region, called the urogenital nerve. Frequent urinating could imply problems with the bladder innervation. Depending on when you started experiencing these symptom, it might be necessary to exclude other common causes of such symptoms. Diabetes and a urinary tract infection should also be checked for.

He may also do frequent gargles as much as possible with a pinch of sodium bicarbonate and a pinch of common salt.For pus secretion, you may have to take broad spectrum antibiotics like ciprofloxacin. If pus is persistent a pus culture should be done to determine the antibiotic which is susceptible. Clean the wound area with warm saline or betadine solution. apply neosporin powder."},{"Patient":"After reading symptoms of pancreatic cancer and having some of the symptoms, like the oily/greasy stools that are off-color, pain in stomach/back, and fatigue....... is it unreasonable for me to ask to have this checked out? The doc knows I have these symptoms and is checking other things....celiac, etc.","Doctor":"Yes pancreátic cancer can present with symptoms of abdominal discomfort , pain dull aching radiating to back with indigestion, pale stools due to obstructive jaundice. So there will be icterus (yellow sclera or eyes). vomiting and nausea. severe weight loss is important. patient will be cachexic.But these symptoms are seen in malabsorption syndrome like coeliac disease and sprue. Imaging of abdomen like ultrasound is basic. followed by CT with contrast and Oral gastroduodenoscopy (passing the scope to look interior if your bowel). A simple blood test like CA19-9 and CEA  could point to malignancy in pancreas or GIT. They are called tumour markers. I suggest you to do these tumour markers in a nearby good lab.That can help relieve your state of undecisiveness."},{"Patient":"My mother had been diabetic for more than a decade and she is 74 yrs of age & live in Philippines.

You are taking treatment for that. Symptoms of throat cancer varies from location and size.  Difficulties in swallowing, pain at time of swallowing, anorexia, weight loss,  growth are the common symptoms. Exact diagnosis is made by esophageal biopsy. Generally it is not visible.

Previously I had awoken one night with sweating, weakness, nausea and was very pale, I was so weak I just climbed back in bed and the next day I could not climb the stairs without resting. I wondered if I had the flu or something but the weakness persisted. When I had bloodwork done was diagnosed with severe iron deficiency (which I found unusual because I had sinus surgery in Nov and I was fine then). I am in menopause for 7 years. There was no occult blood in tests. The treatment I received was 7 iron injections. But I wanted to know the reason for the deficiency. The reason given at the time was that my pernicious anemia (PA for 15 years with monthly injections) was causing the iron to not be absorbed. However continued blood tests showed iron absorbtion from diet alone. I persevered with the Dr and he finally sent me to an internist who in turn ordered a Gastroscopy and a Colonoscopy. The results showed Negative on H. Pylori and tests for antiparietal cells postive. There are no ulcers or tumours or polyps present. Some metaplastic (sp?) cell changes probably due to a chemical bleed. (Chemical Bleed?!!) Dr said it was probably due to nsaid ingestion. I have randomly taken nsaids but never in excess or more than directed. Could a casual use of nsaid cause such a bleed and if that wasn t the cause what else could it be? Am I at risk of another bleed? Are the metaplastic cells pre-cancerous? I m confused and wanting to prevent further bleeds or catch anything possibly ominous sooner than later.","Doctor":"HI... sometimes NASID causes bleeding When its continuous use espicially when taking before food ...but in gastroscopy i should find many small bleeding or not bleeding ulcers ..and you should have  complaints of Heartburn and Lower gastrointestinal bleeding which you do not have .H pylori has been implicated as a major cause of metaplastic (negative in your case) .. Biopsy in gastroscopy should  be from sites that show the typical appearance of whitish plaques, patches, or homogeneous discolouration(gastroscopy is normal in your case!!!!). there is something wrong .. I advise you to do endoscopy again or take the biopsy to another lab.in the end :metaplastic in the stomach has a high cancer risk and is therefore defined as a precancerous condition.. be sure from diagnoses"},{"Patient":"A person who was infected from cancer disease in 2007 The effected part was below part of knee,a doctor remove his leg to prevent from spreading of viruses.he was suffering from the problem of Malignant tumor.Is there any possibility to spread viruses in other parts of his body in future?","Doctor":"Welcome to HealthCareMagic. Your query has been assigned to me and I am happy to assist you today for the health issues you raised.No there is no possibility of spread of that primary cancer from knee to other areas of the body.

He was hospitalized in November with the swine flu and a viral pneumonia and was on a vent for quite a while.  Over the last few months or so, his gum overgrowth has gotten a lot worse. Specifically, the roof of his mouth seems like it has overgrown so much it is down to the bottom of his top teeth. I have asked the ped neuro (we've seen him for 18 years) if any of his seizure meds can cause overgrowth and he says no.  He is not on Dilantin or any of the ones that typically cause the overgrowth. Still, I am very concerned about the thickening of the roof of his mouth. I am making an appointment to see a specialty dentist but I am curious to know if he could have a tumor or anything? He has never had a cavity in 18 years and I take good care of his teeth.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query. I have gone through your query.The over growth in the roof of the mouth can be because of the gingival enlargement secondary to the use of antiepileptic drugs. The other possible cause can be because of the chronic irritation secondary to the deposits over the teeth. Nothing to be panic, consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. If it is a gingival enlargement then it has to be treated surgically and the drug has to be substituted by some other drug.I hope i have answered your query.

Newer CT machines will not cause many side effects. However there is a slight possibility of radiation induced pneumonitis.

It is imperative to exclude an acute infection or inflammation at the level of the abdomen. An abdominal ulttrasound, plain film of the abdomen and a clinical review are important to exclude serious surgical or medical emergences like appendicitis, peritonitis, acute gastritis.

He is being very closed mouth about the whole thing. What would be the benefits of this since he is in stage 4 and believes he is dying.

Periods were always like clock work but quite heavy. tomorrow I go in to get the decision of the team.....I m pretty sure it will be to have radiation from my clavicula up the side of the neck. That is what the oncologist said Friday when I turned in all my films and lab. oh ya. lab. great lab. no markers out of wack etc. my question....Why would radiation help something that maybe is floating around in all my body at this point....The abcess process was over a year and the lipoma another year nearly. If everything is clear then why go thru the traumatic radiation..... might the diets....vegetarian type, no sugar, chocolate, junk etc be as useful? Will I not have to continue to go in for checkups from time to time with or without the radiation anyway? We do not have insurance here. We have been doing some school teaching....but there are no benifits there either. well, I should have just sent you my diary I guess.....didn t know the novel-itis was lurking in my finger tips.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  You have mass in sipra clavicular region.  As you say it is cancer. Treatment depends on type of cancer whether it is lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma or metastatic carcinoma.  You should go forbbiopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly.  If you have already gone through biopsy then send me that report. Yoir other clinical conditions or diet has no relation with that. Radiation treatment or chemotherapy or surgery can be done depending on type and stage of cancer. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer.

Getting infected with HPV virus makes a person more prone to cancer of cervix uteri although it goes through stages from precancerous condition i.e developing CIN 1,2,3 to frank invasive cervix cancer. CIN 1 can become normal or develop into 2 over a time period of few years. CIN 2, 3 has got higher chances to develop into carcinoma (over 5-20 years some time). But any person tested positive for HPV Should consult their gynaecologist to discuss whether any frank growth present or suspicious area which needs to be confirmed with biopsy. Treatment in case of CIN 2 and 3 is suggested based on patient's age, family completed or future pregnancy is planned, patient can come for regular followup or not. In your case you should definitely consult your gynaecologist for biopsy and to discuss other issues. Thanks for posting.

I am wondering if there is a general guideline as to how long a person should wait after cancer to get a tattoo. For example, how long after chemo should one wait? (It s been 5.5 months) How long after radiation? (2.5 months) How high should the WBC count be? (... I forgot(: ) I will definitely be asking my oncologist before I committ to any inking, but I was unable to ask him this during my previous appointments because my (overprotective) father has always been lurking. I am treated at a Children s hospital so it is difficult to get around their tendency to include family members, especially since I have usually been so open in the past.

I recently spent 1 1/2 months with her after she had a benign tumor removed from her spine in the T3 region. She has been very Independent, not wanting anyone involved in her business. What I found in the time I was there is that her house had not been cleaned for some time and she hadn t thrown away a lot of unnecessary paperwork since the 1990 s when she was determined disabled. While cleaning her house and going thru the paperwork, I found some diagnostic comments from her neurologist for which I can use further understanding. They are: 1) cerebral vascular disease, severe; 2) cerebral ataxia secondary to MS; 3) mild bilateral middle cerebral artery stenosis; and 4) vascular risks include chronic smoking. Based on the fact that she didn t smoke while in the hospital and rehab which was over a month and the fact that she started again as soon as she got home, it isn t realistic to expect her to quit even though I wish she would and encouraged it every chance I got. Can you shed light on the diagnosis comments and what can be expected in the future, especially since she continues to smoke?","Doctor":"Well Multiple scelorsis (MS) is the dymylienating disorder of the nervous system which can lead to cerebral ataxia as well. Cerebral vascular disease / middle cerebral artery stenosis and other vascular risk are associted with the smoking.Cerebral vascular accident may happen if someone continue to smoke which can lead to irreversible neurological deficit.Counselling and medication are two effective modality for quit smoking."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I can say that tramadol is a medicine that relieve severe pains for a short time.

Urine test.2. Kidney ultrasound for finding if you suffer from kidney stone that can cause pain.3. Blood test.The results of the tests will determine the diagnose and the needed treatment, so after that you wont need to use tramadol anymore.

You can show it to surgeon and consider for biopsy. Biopsy is small surgical procedure which can be done in OPD and requires no admission. Biopsy does not spread cancer. It helps in differentiating benign versus malignant tumor. if tumor is benign and not causing any trouble no treatment is required. if its malignant then depending on type further treatment is indicated. All tumors does not require surgery. For example mycosis fungoides can be managed with steroids, PUVA therapy, local radiation or topical chemotherapy. Hope this answers your query.

Ultrasonography and Ct scans gave the impression that the mass may be extrapancreatic or related to the uncinate process. The mass was also indenting the IVC but was not infiltrating it. He had no jaundice and was of reasonable body status. Guided FNAC was done and suggested undifferentiated adenocarcinoma as the pathology. Bearing in mind that there was a solitary liver lesion at segment VI, Limited exploration was performed with the hope that this lesion me be GIST tumour and the possibility of having the primary resected may help the patient. Unfortunately the tumour was found to be purely pancreatic invoving part of the head and encroaching on duodenal lumen and inseparable from IVC. In view of the previous findings only anterior gastrojujenostomy was performed to the patient to avoid future duodenal obstruction. His recovery was smooth apart from attacks of bilious vomiting probably related to the gastrojujenostomy. He has severe anorexia probaly related to his malignancy. He is now suffering from severe anorexia + cachixia+Regular vomiting (Fluid therapy is applied regularly) The surgeon is advising to perform another surgery to make a tube outside the body to give him food through it. kINDLY GIVE THE ADVICE REGARDING THIS OPERATION NB.Doctores did not decide to give him any kind of chemotherapy","Doctor":"Hello dear. I have gone through the details. Si it seems an unresectable pancreatic cancer with a suspicious liver lesion. approach would be to do an FNAC of the liver lesion if it is metastasis then do aliiative therapy. If no then do initial chemo or radiochemo to shrink the tumor and make it resectable. Since pancreatic tumors cause severe cachexia and loss of appetite and also patient is vomiting, it is a good approach to do a feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy to provide adequate nutrition. You can go for this operation. REst of the approach i have mentioned. Hope it is clear.

So somebody freaked out I think and then they put him on Zytiga , psa in jan 2014 was 115, march 139, late march was 171, april it is now 22p, they did a scan and his cancer to the bone has spread everywhere.

Radium 223 shots once a month for 6 months. I feel he has maybe 2 months, he is very frail. The side effect of the last drug Zytiga had side effects of his hands and a few others, Why would they say to stay on a drug that didn t work and spread his cancer all over?

Since I have a history of cancer in my family members  [my mother died of Gall bladder cancer at the age of 65 yrs and now my elder brother (55 Yrs) is having stomach cancer], I was advised endoscopy. The endoscopy report dated 7.10.10 suggests in the impression three things – (a) tongue like projection seen proximal to Z line in esophagus, Sample taken and sent for biopsy to rule out Barret’s Esophagus, (b) mild hiatal hernia, and (c) GERD. But I don’t have symptom of stomach pain/ acidity at present. Two years back  (first time) and six months back (second time) I had acute stomach pain. USG done (in Feb’10, June’10 and Aug’10) indicated gall stone, for which I took ursodil 300 mg twice daily, along with pantocid, for 4 months, without any improvement. Now I have stopped medication for past one month and made up my mind for surgical removal of gall bladder. At present I am taking medication for cholesterol ( Atorva 10 mg). I don’t have any symptom of acidity or heart burning. Sometimes, occasionally, I have acidity after reach food. In 1998, I had hear burn and hiccup problems.

It was treated and I was OK within 1.5 months of medication. I am worried about the findings of the current endoscopy. Please guide me how to go about it.

It is a functional problem , meaning that it arises mainly due to some abnormalities in contraction of intestines. There are moments when can experience either very strong or very weak contractions with corresponding consequences on digestion. This either increases or reduces the movement of food along the intestines. depending on the time spent, some bacteria, especially in the large intestines feed on this food, and produce lots if gas. Eventual passage of gas could relieve symptoms in some people. This could be seen in irritable bowel syndrome. Drinking much water, diet rich in vegetables and fruits, and exercise are initial solutions. drugs to normalize contraction of intestines also do exist.

He had orichetocomy same year and has been on hormone therapy (androgen deprivation via bicalutimide pill) since then. His PSA levels were very low (below 1) in the first 2 years after surgery. Now it is 5. I read about intermitted triple hormonal therapy and use of 5-ARI inhibitors. Should we be given any of these ? His Oncologist though supposedly a reputed one does not do a good job of explaining why current treatment regime is OK. His bone scan from 2 months ago showed the images looked same as when we was first disagnosed. Look forward to valuable advice","Doctor":"hello dear. I appreciate your concern. In my clinical practice we do not advise triple hormonal blockade in a case of metastatic disease as it offers little benefit. More over more effective therapies are available now. As far as a patient of prostate cancer is asymptomatic and doing well and does not show any disease progressions on scans, we do not change the treatment irrespective of the PSA levels. In my opinion your father is doing fine so no need to change the therapy and hence your doc is doing good. if he progresses to symptoms or show some new abnormalities on scan then we can go with chemotherapy or some other androgen blockade therapy. Yorur father has still very good amount of life to live so do not worry. Take care, Hope this solves your query.regards"},{"Patient":"my relative had a regular check up-blood,urine,etc. 3 months ago.

Early suggestions would help.Thank you.Naushad YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Gretings. If a complete mastectomy has been done and  nodes are free of tumor and the tumor size is small( as in your case), then radiation therapy is not required. Now comes the question of chemotherapy.

If FISH test comes out to be positive ( a bad sign) then i will suggest chemotherapy plus targeted therapy for HER-2(trastuzumab drug). If it does not come positive(good sign) then trastuzumab is not required and requirement of chemo will be decided by another test called oncotype dx. if oncotype dx is high then chemo is required otherwise not.

I had a grandmother on my mothers side, and an uncle on my fathers side, die from pancreatic cancer.I have high enzyme readings of amalyse (wrong spelling) for many years and at other times it is in the normal range. I have gone to a endocrinologist who did a mri about 5 years ago on my pancreausand they said it was normal and couldnt find any thing wrong. The Dr. said that I could be just one of those people who have this unknown etiology and dont know what causes it. Diabetes is very prevalent on my mothers side her mother as well as her sister and brother died from it, altho my mother who is 87 and my father did not have it nor do any of my sisters or brothers as of yet have it., My question is: what can cause such high enzyme readings, sometimes in the upper 300 scale and can it contribute to pancreatic cancer? and what are the later symptoms of pancreatic cancer and the pain associated with it. Is the pain located in the upper abdomen or lower abdomen with this type of cancer.is it a constant pain or only when you eat or after eating?i know it is a difficult cancer to detect and would getting mri or cat scans so many years be able to detect this cancer early if it is present? can this type of cancer be detected early and treated? Being that i have such a family history i am concerned. Thank you for your time, Nadine Connolly","Doctor":"Greetings. First of all you should not be worried due to an isolated high amylase level. There can be several causes of raised serum amylase likegall stone diseasesalivary gland duct stonesintestinal infections, inflammationsdiabetes(uncontrolled)smal cystic lesions of pancreatico biliary regionbenign conditions. However high amylase level are not associated with pancreatic cancer.You may have little higher chance of developing pancreatic cancer as you have positive family history for that.Symptoms of pancreatic cancer are pain in abdomen, or development of jaundice. These may or may not indicate pancreatic cancer and should not cause undue worry. You should be in regular surveillance with your doctor.regards"},{"Patient":"I am a 67 year old male. I have stage 4 cancer. I went to the dr 2 weeks ago when I had a loud and painful pop in my shoulder. Xrays were negative and I go to see about an MRI on wed. I am currently taking Morphine for the pain in my shoulder but it is not working well. I also cant sleep at all due to the pain. Is there a sleeping aid I can take while on morphine to help me sleep","Doctor":"Greetings. It seems your pain is not well controlled and it is the cause of you not getting sleep. The dose of morphine can be increased as per your requirement. If it does not work then other narcotic drugs like buprenorphine or fentanyl in the form of patch can be applied. There are multiple option for pain control and you can discuss these options with your pain physician. i will advise you to increase the dose of morphine or try these patch formulations rather than adding a sleep inducer drug as it will be of little help.regards"},{"Patient":"My father who just turned 90 this month was recently diagnosed with a tumor that is growing between the two bile ducts that lead into the liver.  This was detected thru bloodwork and in the past two weeks he has had two seperate scopes, one of which involved the placing of a temporary stint into one of the ducts. The doctor who performed this discovered during the scope that the tumor was actually larger and was indeed blocking the other duct too. He did not have the dual stint that he needed so he just treated both blockages with temporary stints.  We returned with my father yesterday to this same doctor who is a general surgeon. He advised to have the permanant dual stint placed as soon as possible but also added that there are risks involved. Namely not being able to place the left side stint due to the difficulty with manuvering to that side. My question in all of this is: should my father have this situation treated by this general surgeon (who is almost 70 years old) or should he be treated by a gastro specialist????","Doctor":"Greetings. I appreciate your concern for your father. Your father is suffering from the cancer of the bile ducts which is an aggresive cancer. As he is very old, i think biliary stenting should be done to relieve the jaundice followed by some form of oral chemotherapy if he able to tolerate that.However if he is in a good health and the cancer is localised then upfront surgery is the option. Stenting will be done by gastroenterologist and surgery by a surgeon. Hope you now understand well and can chose depending upon the reports and health status of your father, whether to go for surgery or stenting first."},{"Patient":"Hi, my gran is 78 years old was diagnosed with stomach cancer 6years ago it has progressed to her lung and pancreas over the years she refused treatment and has lived for this amount of time over the last 6months to a year she has lost considerable amount of weight she isn't really eating and has a small drink of water periodically she constantly picks up infections and I know her immune system will be low, she recently got a urine infection and was given antibiotics but she has been in a lot of pain and her doctor got her a morphine pump which she will be on daily at home she's completley housebound now and is mostly in her bed, I was thinking maybe this is due to her cancer and don't really want to ask my mum as she is too upset, her doctor said she is going down hill could you please tell me rufly how long she has left it is horrible to see her like that and in so much pain and I don't want to upset my mum anymore by asking her what her doctor thinks.

First of all you should not be unnecessory worried thinking you have got ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer usually is not detected in early stage.

The Oncologist has no idea what is going on","Doctor":"Good-evening. Bone marrow usually have a patchy involvement with cancer and it is quite possible for a marrow biopsy to miss the cancer. Ideal way is to do a CT guided bone biopsy rather than a marrow biopsy.

If the cancer of pancreas in your friend's  case is localised to pancreas only then the ideal way was to operate it upfront and remove the mass; that would have taken care of the bile also. If we drain bile first and then operate in a localised cancer( as done in your friends case), it increase chances of post operative sepsis(infection). However if it is metastatic, then doctor have done goof to drain the bile as the operation is not feasible in a metastatic case. Now if the bilirubin level comes down to less than 3 mg.dl then only can further treatment(chemotherapy) can be planned. She can be given narcotics pain killers to releive the pain. The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is poor. In a localised case median survival is 2 years.

First of all patients with colon cancer and metastasis to liver can live upto 2.5 years if there is no jaundice. Even if jaundice is there, then bilirubin can be drained and once the bilirubin level is normal chemotherapy can be given. So your doctor is wrong in saying that she has only 2-3 months to live.

In a case of anal cancer the chemo drugs itself and the radiation to anal area can lead to local mucositis(inflammation of the area) and  thus cause diarrhea.

I had a CT after 3 treatments which showed a decrease in size of both the lymph node and the lesion on my liver. I recently heard that immunotherapy has been successful in treating ovarian cancer. Is this an option for me and if so, where can I get this therapy? I am currently using services at Magee Women s Hospital in Pittsburgh, PA.","Doctor":"Good evening. It is good that you have a platinum sensitive disease.

I am a gymnastics coach & had previous muscle issues but no where near as bad as it s been for 8 yrs ~ burning sensations & pain laying on it or with continuel use. The consultant showed me a shadow in the bone & requested an MRI which I still havn t had. I return to see him on 15th Dec. He didn t tell me what it was just said he would sort it when he does the impingement surgery. I am worried it could be cancer as my cousin went on to have bone cancer after she had breast cancer. I also suffer daily chronic headaches (5 yrs) & recently diagnosed with degeneration of the neck and degenerative disc disease in my lower spine requiring surgery.

I have been feeling weak and tired for some months now. I got a medical check up which showed total cholesterol 130, and LDL 64.6 (HDL 54). This was significantly lower than last year's count of total cholesterol 165, LDL 99. I had a complete blood count done about 3 months ago, because of chronic allergic cold. it showed WBC 5000 per cu mm, but a lymphocyte percentage of 52%. in my current full check up, I had almost the same WBC count and lymphocyte percentage, though i have no apparent infection. My haemoglobin is typically around 11.3 g/dL and i always have a somewhat high ESR around 35-40 mm/hr.I have a tendency towards depression and stress for which i have been undergoing psychotherapy but no medication.I have been feeling weak, tired, and have mild body ache for the last some months. I have noticed that i need to urinate more frequently ( my fasting blood sugar was normal 80 mg/dL). I had lost a little weight (around 3 kg) a few months ago but i seem to have gained most of it back, maybe just lost 1-1.5 kg in all. For the last two months i have noticed that there is a mild sensation of something jammed in my throat. I do not have actual trouble swallowing, but the sensation is there, also a little dryness in the throat. This month on the day on which i was supposed to have my period, instead i started having very very mild spotting. That continued, but i still haven't had my period ( about 12 days later). in general my periods are quite regular, though i  have a lot of pain on the first day. A year ago, i had some non-menstrual spotting but not after that until now.I am a vegetarian who doesn't eat egg (though till the age of 14 i was a non-vegetarian, though did not eat very frequently).I am 5 feet 2 inch and 46 kg. My diet hasn't changed much over the past couple of years but I  have started some moderate exercise in the last 4 months. The doctor ordered a chest x ray because of the lymphocyte count and weight loss but that was clear.I am concerned after reading on the net that both high lymphocyte count and low cholesterol are associated with cancer. Do i need to undergo further investigation? do ii need to get checked for hyperthyroidism? Or do i just need to make changes in my diet? I feel weak, and not very alert","Doctor":"Good morning. High lymphocyte count is not associated with cancer as long as you are asymptomatic and there are no other abnormalities in your lab test. Similarly high cholesterol counts is not associated with cancer. High lymphocyte count may be simply borderline high or may indicate some infection so you need not to worry. Do regular exercises to lower down your cholestero level.regards"},{"Patient":"almost 3 years back my mom was diagnosed with cervical cancer. about a year after the first her cancer had grown over 3times bigger and spreaded in her overies, lungs and her neck. at the ending of september 2009 they told her she also has a brain tumer, and about 3 months ago its in her spinal cord and everywhere in her back. i am but 15 years old, shes been in the hospital for 4 weeks tomorow and the doctor tells us she wont make it thru the week, she's had more morphine to kill 3 people. i dont know how she does it. shes been sleeping for 3days strait now. hasnt opened her eyes, hasnt eaten or drank in 3 days. she has a catheder and her urine is very dark like red almost and within those 3 days she peed once and it was barley anything that came out. im scared and i dont know what to do. ive always had my mom around since i was little, i love her so much.

Receptor status like ER PR and HER-2/nue rectpor. Depending upon the positive receptor, drugs are chosen. Similarly if the disease is only in the bones and breast, drugs acting on ER receptor like tamoxifen(oral drug) will help in early stage and no need for chemo in the beginning. IF HER-2 is positive then a targeted agent for HER-2 is added(trastuzumab drug). For bone strengthenng another agent like bisphosphonate or denosumab is added. So you need to know her receptor status before planning out the treatment. Radiotherapy will of course required for brain metastasis.Regards"},{"Patient":"My Brother in law is suffering from liver cancer; he is living in Lahore Pakistan and just 34 years old.

Regards Heidi","Doctor":"Good morning. Your father seems to be suffering from cancer of unknown primary and he has already taken two lines of chemotherapy.  As the disease grows the chances of further chemotherapy working on the tumor become less. As your doctor rightly said, best for your father would be to put him on some experimental therapy. You should go ahead with this trial form of therapy as only this can lead to best results.regards"},{"Patient":"My mother (60 yrs old) is suffering from multiple myeloma since last one year. When she was diagnosed she had high M  about 5.53 gm/dl but with no other symtom like bone lesion or bence jones protein etc. Her treatment started with Leningio, for 4 cycles, which very well controlled the diseases. However, Myeloma protein recurred within a month, time during which she was on thalidomide. She was started with valcade, after two dose only M protein went down to Zero. Only two cycles of valcade were given as she complained of severe neuropathy in hands and legs. After that, as M was under control, she underwent stem cell transplant. She still has neuropathy in hands and legs after almost three months of peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Otherwise she is fine. But since past week she has started complaining of poor eye sight. She has blurred vision and can not see distant objects very clearly. I am worried and would like to know why is it so? Will as this disease progress my mother will have other problems also like kidney failure, inability to walk or loss of senses because of severe neuropathy etc. Apparently this disease looks worst with no sign of relief even after having transplant etc. Will there be any disease free survival period. Please guide.","Doctor":"Good morning. With the current knowledge and advancement in medical science, there is still no cure for multiple myeloma. Only the survival can be prolonged. Transplant only provides a prolong disease free survival but the disease again recurs back. There are still newer drugs available with little side effects and your mother can be prescribed those drugs. More over a repeat transplant can be done once her condition improves. So you need not to worry. With the current available treatment options patient of myeloma can live upto 5- 7 years.regards"},{"Patient":"My friend has Myelodysplastic syndrome from radiation chemo following lung cancer.

Blackening of palms fingers and soles is a side effect of XEloda therapy. It is known as hand foot syndrome. it is a commonly seen side effect and need not to worry. As long as thee is no ulceration and peeling of skin it will not cause any harm and treatment need not to be discontinued.

They found a mass in his gallbladder.  They told him they can't do chemo/radiation as the liver won't be able to handle it or it will kill the liver.  I found 2 websites of people who have this liver condition and cancer and were given chemo/radiation.  He even went and got a second opinion from Oncologists and both sets of doctors are saying the same thing, no chemo.  So why are the doctors telling him that, since I just read that people were given chemo/radiation.  He was given 6 months.","Doctor":"Good morning. Chemo radiation can be given in a case of gall bladder cancer only if the cancer is localised and the condition of liver is good. However in your brothers case, the condition of the liver is not good due the sclerosing cholangitis and might be the cancer is not localised. Hence the doctor has refused for chemo radiation. Only some form of mild chemo therapy alone can be tried in your case.regards"},{"Patient":"hi, my mother is suffering from oral cancer and has undergone through radio therapy and later onco-surgery.

I would come up with these measures for this case of severe hyper acidity. As diagnosis is already evaluated so need not to worry.1 Try raising the head of your bed 4 inches above with blocks.,It also might help to avoid drinking or eating for 2  hours before you lie down.To help control stomach acid one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy or greasy foods.Also take some antacid but if symptoms are severe ( as in your case), then you may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors.2 Tension is the another reason for your problem , so avoid , if necessary consult a psychiatrist.So consult a physician and get his help.

I have read your concerns and will try to answer your questions thoroughly.  I assume you underwent lumpectomy for your tumor.  Atypical hyperplasia is not considered as cancer, so a 0.2cm margin will suffice.  If it is carcinoma in-situ or invasive carcinoma, the margins should be clear in all dimensions.  In my practice, generally at least 0.5cm to 1cm margin is very good.  Your MRI result of a mild nonenhancing distortion posterior of the nipple is  from the post-operative site, since a lumpectomy generally gets a chunk of tissues from the breast, hence, distortion of the tissues in that area are normally seen.I hope I alleviated your concerns.

Cancers generally when in advance stages are like ulcers, the do not heal at all since they continuously multiply nonstop-- they bleed, infect, and smells bad.  If I am the treating surgeon, usually in this type of cases I clean it daily using saline solution, hydrogen peroxide to chemically debride the tissues, the flush again with saline solution, followed by povidone iodine powder or spray, and top it with moist dressing.  If infection is overt, I start antibacterials orally or intravenously.  If persistently bleeding, I refer patients to a radiation oncologist to give palliative radiation to the tumor in order for it to dry up.  Another option is refer to an interventional radiologist, if the feeding vessel of the tumor can be located.

Gullet/esophageal cancer's primary problem will be nutrition. A patient with advanced cancer of this type usually has poor nutrition, since he/she is unable to tolerate food intake.  A low albumin count only confirms that she is poorly nourished, with this status, most patients succumb to infection due to very low immune system.  No patient can survive without eating, the time frame varies on how her body will cope with the stress.  If I was the treating physician, I will offer options for alternative route for feeding (tube feeding, intravenous/parenteral feeding, placement of stent), to boost her immune system through nutrition."},{"Patient":"My father has just started to find out that he has multiple myeloma cancer.

It is possible that you had early cancer and two of your lymphnodes are positive. This means there is some cancer activity in your system which is still in early stages.

Good Day! I've read your concers and will try to breakdown the anwers for you. Whole body cramping can be from several factors-  electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, lack of oxygen in the body.  However, in your case, it might be caused of lack of thyroid hormones since you stopped your thyroxine.  If I was your treating physician, I will request for the following: thyroid function tests, electrolyte panel (Na, K, iCa), CBC.  Treatment depends on your results."},{"Patient":"Hi All, My Father is suffering from Lung Cancer Stage IV - Non small cell due to which the cancer cells are spread over the lungs to other parts of the body.

I've read your concerns and feel sorry for your father.  Lung Cancers commonly spreads to the bones -- which might be the cause of pain of your father.   Stage IV lung cancers are treated by chemotherapy, to slow down and control the spread.  Other symptoms such as pain will be relieved by analgesics.  Weight loss and weakness is part and parcel of symptoms of cancer, your oncologist can give your prescription for dietary supplements."},{"Patient":"My mother has cancer of the gullet. The oncologist says surgery is not an option (she is 84 with a not so good heart) He has told us that chemo and radiation treatment is also out. I assume that means the cancer is to far advanced. He said that a stent will ease the symptoms. I am confused, does this mean she will soon be dead or that she can live a while longer.","Doctor":"Hello! I've read your concerns.   Your mother's problem could really be far advanced since your oncologist limited your options to stenting, plus you mother may not be a suitable candidate for invasive procedures (surgery) and chemo/radiation.  Definitely for this types of cases, the stent will give your mother a better quality of life and more importantly she will can be able to eat and take medications orally.  Placing a stent will prolong her life in the sense that she will be able to nourish herself properly without a stent she will not be able to eat, hence, her immune system will go down drastically and can lead to other medical conditions (undernourishment, pneumonia, dehydration, etc)"},{"Patient":"Hello there.

Ovarian cancer metastasis is really known to be messy and produce a lot of adhesions and metastasis.  Adhesions/metastasis can only be treated with surgery.  If I was the treating surgeon, tumor debulking, peritoniectomy, plus intra operative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) will address metastatic problems in ovarian cancers if still resectable.

It can be quite painful.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are many areas which require attention in your case as the following.1. It is possible that your cancer is still not completely treated. This requires follow up clinical examination and imaging to confirm any active disease. If confirmed then you might require another session of treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.2. Another situation is that your immunity is less due to cancer and chemotherapy. This might cause secondary infection in the throat and neck region. This will usually be found with acute symptoms and local rise in temperature and skin changes. This requires specific treatment to minimize the infection and symptoms of discomfort.3. There might be side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on the neck and throat region. This will slowly improve with time over weeks to months.Please have a follow up consultation with your doctor to know the exact cause of your symptoms and have it treated.

If the cancer in your mother is close to the aorta then it is in the middle and lower thirds. The aorta is a great vessel and if the cancer is infiltrating in to it then the chances of a successful surgery are limited. Therefore the treatment in such a case is chemotherapy and radiation therapy.Radiation therapy is a type of energy used to destroy the cancer cells and reduce the tumor in the lumen of esophagus. This works in many patients and in some people a metallic stent might also be inserted in the esophageal lumen to help in passage of food. A proper staging of the cancer is required to know the extent of disease. If surgery is not possible then most likely this is going to be a palliative treatment approach and will give her more time. Please discuss in detail with available reports as cancer is a serious disease and requires accurate analysis.

Stage IIb is early disease and he is lucky to undergo limb sparing surgery and combination chemotherapy. The goal of cancer treatment is to destroy as many cancer cells and prevent the progress of the cancer.The first step is stabilizing the disease and once this is achieved then the goal is destroying the cancer cells. If the doctors have said that more than 95 percent of the cancer cells are destroyed then your son is in a better position than most patients. He should continue treatment and follow up as recommended. Nutrition is important during treatment and recovery and he should be eating a high protein diet will vitamins and minerals.The risk of recurrence or disease spread persists and close follow up is the only way early disease manifestation might be noticed and aggressive treatment given. If the disease is under control for 5 years then the risk of recurrence is low.

Please type your query here...I was supposed to have had a 4 millimeter lump surgically removed from my breast through needle-guided aspiration because the radiologist could not determine what it was.  However, when the radiologist inserted the needle it went deep into the 4 millimeter lumpspot and liquid came out so there was nothing to surgically remove or test.  They did mammogram and concluded it was a cyst and recommended follow up in 6 months.  However, I am now a little concern that if there were cancer cells inside of this tiny unknown spot/lump, wouldn't the cancer cells be released when the needle burst it?  And, how would I know because there was nothing left to test? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A 4 mm lesion in the breast is too small to characterize. The needle FNAC was offered probably to be more accurate in making a diagnosis. If the lump of cells in the 4 mm area was properly targeted then appearance of liquid confirms the presence of a cyst with fluid. Even in the aspirated fluid, there would have been cells and I guess that slides were prepared and seen under a microscope in your case. If it was indeterminate then it means that no cancer cells were confirmed in the area.Technically speaking even if the 4 mm area was burst with the needle then the cells were confined to a closed area and will not spill over to any other area. Also it might have been close to the skin surface. Please be informed that breast cancer does not have a tendency to spread by a needle track. Therefore you are completely safe from this procedure.Keeping in mind the indeterminate nature of the fluid from the cyst it is advisable to go for regular clinical examinations and also do self breast exam once every 15 days and consult your doctor should you have any doubts regarding any new breast lumps.

This is an advanced disease and cannot be cured completely.For symptomatic relief and to slow down the disease process, radiation therapy might reduce the pain from the cancer and chemotherapy will kill and control the cancer cells.

Lymph nodes are small peanut shaped structures which enlarge during diseases like infection and cancer. It appears that he presently has multiple neck lymph nodes which indicates spread of disease beyond the esophagus.Two years is enough time for a cancer to involve lymph nodes even if the patient is provided recommended treatment and care. If he is losing weight rapidly then a high protein diet is recommended for him.

They might be able to help you out with surgically reconstructing the region and allowing you to open the mouth. Please note that these are highly specialized surgeries which require skill and the outcomes might differ after surgery.

If your father has stage 4 cancer then it is advanced disease and the treatment usually includes pain relief and slowing the progress of disease. Unfortunately with the recommended treatment and support, a patient having stage 4 cancer might survive for up to 2 years and without treatment the end is much closer.Naturopathy is unlikely to help because it is a slow method of treating health problems. Cancer is an aggressive condition and it is not possible to control the multiplication of cancer cells by naturaopathy. In naturopathy the body is repaired in a slow pace and enough time is allowed for the various systems to return to their normal quality of functioning. This is not possible in a patient having stage 4 cancer and the rate of disease progress is much faster than the healing process.Your father might like to follow meditation techniques for pain management and to keep him comfortable with a regular dose of pain relief.

A TRAM procedure was done and it was recommended to take Tamoxifen for five years.  But I would like to have more children plus I had a tubal ligation six years ago.  If I am able to not be at risk of the cancer returning by stopping the tamoxifen, then a tubal-reversal would be a waste of time and I guess I should consider adoption? What do you think","Doctor":"Hello,Some of the cancers including breast cancer might show hormone-dependent behavior. It means that the amount of hormone circulating in the blood might decide the behavior of cancer.It is known that tamoxifen blocks the actions of estrogen and is used to treat and prevent some types of breast cancer. Therefore if tamoxifen is stopped without recommendation, then there is unopposed action of hormones like estrogen which will then likely influence the recurrence of a cancer process.You might like to choose a surrogate mother for your child and complete your family and is a safe option than going for tubal reversal. Going in for adoption is a much safer method than to compromise on your health and take chances by stopping tamoxifen treatment.

If you are having lumps in different areas of the body then please consult your doctor immediately and get a complete clinical examination done.Recurrence of cancer is more common if there are lumps in various places. It will be important to do an assessment of the entire body by imaging methods like ultrasound scan abdomen and CT scan of the chest to be sure that other groups of lymph nodes or the spleen is affected or not.

Largely all patients experience difficulty in swallowing and eating. In the upper third of esophagus patients complaining of pain and difficulty swallowing like lump in the throat.In the mid third esophagus cancer there is dragging pain in the region behind the heart and in lower esophageal cancer there is regurgitation of food.He should be provided adequate supportive care if the cancer is not operable Operability depends on the stage of cancer and if the wall of esophagus has not breached then it is stage I or II disease and surgery is possible.If the cancer has involved the wall and adjacent structures then there is stage III or IV disease. A metallic stent might be inserted in the lumen of the esophagus to help him swallow food comfortably"},{"Patient":"It has been requested that I go in for a vision field test after my eye exam this morning.  Several things were listed for diagnosis.  One of them being the optic neuritis.  I'm really scared at the moment and don't know how to react or what to do.  I have that test in 3 days.  However, I was wondering, if a brain tumor, how fast do tumors typically grow?  If malignant, is it months, years, weeks or what that is considered rapid growing?  What time frame is considered slow-growing?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve which carries impulses from the eye to the brain through the optic tract. This is usually a limited condition and is treated with steroids.Brain tumors are of many different types and categories. Most benign tumors grow very slowly and stay stable for years before they cause symptoms. In contrast malignant or cancerous tumors grow violently and it might take 3 to 6 months for them to grow into a mass of cancer cells.In conclusion, a tumor is slow growing if it takes more than a year or two to double its size and is a fast growing it there is double in tumor volume over 3 to 6 months. You likely do not have a brain tumor."},{"Patient":"Hi my mom has been living with lymphoma for three years now.

There are sodium, potassium, calcium channels and these regulate the flow of information in to and out of the cells. The functions include the regulation of heart beat, the functioning of kidneys, liver and brain and important vital functions int he body.Potassium is one such important electrolyte which needs to be balanced in a narrow range.

It is possible that you have irritable bowel syndrome or a condition like inflammatory bowel disease. If there is no blood in the stool, then the risk of cancer is low.It is suggested that you consult a gastroenterologist and give a detailed history of your problems and get examined clinically. It might require doing a colonoscopy on you. It is a simple office procedure in which a slender tube-like device with a camera at one end is inserted after bowel preparation and anesthesia and the large bowel is visualized.

Paternal pancreatic cancer is in the history.  I am very concerned, would consider seriously a hysterectomy to save my kidney and continue life without the constant concern from the family history and the immunosuppressent medications  of developing cancer myself.  Suggestions/Recommendations please?","Doctor":"Hello,A cyst in the kidney is a benign finding. It is a thin-walled fluid containing sac-like structure which is present in most people after middle age. If the cyst in the kidney is less than three centimeters in size, then there is no concern.It is important to note that you have ovarian cancer and pancreas cancer running in your extended family. For ovarian cancer, it is recommended that you get a CA125 test done annually. It is a tumor marker for cancer of the ovary, and before cancer starts, the CA125 levels usually go up. If there is a high CA125 level, then you should get investigated for possible ovarian tumors.In the case of pancreatic cancer, it is suggested that you get an ultrasound scan of the abdomen done every year and also get CA19-9 levels tested. The CA19-9 is a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer and might help in predicting the possibility of the disease by doing a blood test.Hope I have answered your query.

To provide chemotherapy, a patient should be fit enough medically to withstand the stress associated with the treatment.Having a heart problem should be carefully analyzed. Heart problems might be due to coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease or rhythm disorders. Some of the chemotherapy drugs are cardiotoxic and therefore such medicines might be avoided for your husband.

The surgical removal of tumor mass is the best method to make tumor free. If the lump is small we can go for breast conservation surgery (BCS) along with radiation to the breast, which is equally effective as Modified radical mastectomy (MRM) which we do in case of large tumors and tumor which has met to local lymph nodes. Radiation can be given to breast in case of BCS and chest wall in case of MRM by linear accelerator. After that we add chemotherapy and there are various regimes of chemotherapy approved for this depending on the condition patient and stage of disease. And wonderful thing we can use in cases of breast cancer is anti-hormonal therapy, if the type of cancer is hormonal receptor positive i.e. ER, PR +ve; we use tamoxifen in such cases and if it is HER2/neu +ve then we also we Trastuzumab(Herceptin) if tumor size is >2cm and lymph node mets or high-risk patient.

Hope he is having early stage of disease and is under recommended treatment.He can take glucerna and ensure in a consistency which is easy for him to swallow. Having throat cancer means that he will have difficulty and pain during swallowing. Please give him a watery consistency that will not stick to his throat and cause irritation. It should also not enter his airway and cause cough.In a fine liquid base with water or milk he might be given the feed in dose recommended for his nutritional needs.

Stomach pain, numbness in left arm and frequent are related to each other . According to history , you are taking aspirin . Aspirin may be the cause of hyper acidity . Hyper acidity is the root cause of pain in stomach . Frequent urination may be due to tension ,but reason may be diabetes. Diagnosis can be confirmed by HBA 1 C  and blood sugar examination. Numbness in the left arm may be due to a radiating pain from heart disease . Diagnosis can be confirmed by E K G & ECHO.In  my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion.

It is important for him to closely follow up with his doctor every 3 months as recommended.He might be free from disease and it is possible that he is cured from cancer. Usually cancer is cured if a patient survives for 5 years from detection of cancer. It is probable that your brother has shown good response to treatment and he might lead a normal disease free survival.The recurrence of hodgkins lymphoma cannot be predicted and in most patients the disease will not happen again.

This is done under anesthesia and your doctor will prescribe a course of antibiotics to avoid infection.Since you have a headache and sore throat therefore you might have got the flu. A flu happens due to infection with the virus causing common cold. This might stay for 3 to 5 days and make you feel weak. This is not a serious concern but you should continue taking fluids and healthy food after the colonoscopy is done.Please be sure to inform the doctor about your feeling unwell and this will help the doctor to quickly assess your clinical situation with least discomfort and pain. If your symptoms worsen then the colonoscopy might be rescheduled after a week when you feel better.

This uses a special stain called pampanicolaou stain and shows the presence of any abnormal cells in the cervix portion of uterus.The endometrium is the inner lining of the uterus and is examined by a biopsy for endometrial cancer. The pap smear will not look for cancer in endometrium. However your doctor is right and if you are persistently having heavy periods only then the endometrial biopsy is required.

This requires early detection and treatment for better survival and quality of life of the patient.Having a testis removed because of disease is much favored over imminent poor survival if the condition is not treated. He might require psychological counseling to make him understand the seriousness of his condition.Most patients lead normal life with good survival if a surgical removal of the affected testes is done. Radiation and chemotherapy might also help depending on the type of cancer he is having in the testis. Close follow up is required for some months. He might choose to have a testicular prosthesis in place to feel like a normal man. Avoiding or delaying treatment is to be avoided because his life is more important.

It might cause mild symptoms in some patients and others might have severe symptoms.Usually the condition might have a large mass or multiple masses in the liver causing a hard to palpate mass in the abdomen. The mass causes compression of vascular structure including the inferior vena cava and this might lead to blood clots in the vein goind to the heart. The veins of the kidneys might also show clots.Few people develop ascites and fluid collection in the abdomen and this is due to the inability of the liver to function normally.

There was seizure activity at the time of her death. Many times patients are not aware of the fact that cancer has spread to the brain. This causes electrical discharge in the brain and might lead to uncontrolled seizure activity. This is what happened to your mother and probably she had a severe seizure at the time of her death. It does not look like too much oxygen caused her death. The oxygen saturation does not go beyond a particular level and therefore it is less likely that given her oxygen caused her death.Your sister having colon cancer might have been put on oxygen because the saturation was falling down.

Such a pain might have originated due to nerve stimulated during or after surgery. There are many nerves which pass through the pelvis on their way to supply other areas and it is possible that mild nerve irritation might have occurred.The tailbone or coccyx area is not involved and only you are having nerve stimulation which makes it appear as though the pain is originating at that location. The cyst in the ovary if large in size then might have caused this nerve irritation. It is also possible that your lower back might be having degenerative disc changes. This might be investigated by doing a MRI lumbar spine if required after clinical examination. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My friend had a pilodontal cyst that turned into a massive growth.

You might like to discuss any newer PPI and also take additional precautions to deal with your GERD better. Please take small regular meals instead of larger meals. Sit up straight for at least 30 minutes after having a meal. Keep the head end of your bed raised by 6 inches to make you feel better in the mornings. Drink adequate amounts of water and avoid fasting.

I have found this through google and please give me reply, as i m in Banglore with him at St. Johns, My no. 0000 Laximan Pujar. thanking you. laximan","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A throat cancer is a difficult condition to treat and it looks like your father developed a side effect during treatment. Usually the food passage and airway are separate in humans. However due to the cancer and subsequent treatment, there is a suspected false passage between the throat and the food passage. This is to be confirmed by doing a dedicated CT scan if the symptoms worsen and surgically it might be corrected.Your father is showing good response to treatment and therefore getting him treated after taking an expert opinion is suggested. You might like to consult more than one oncologist and then proceed with the recommended treatment after studying his cancer and general health condition. Please continue ryles tube feeding because nutrition is important to maintain a good level of general health condition. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"i started chemo today, one of my meds is zofran odt, i'm trying to figure out how to take it says take one tablet every 8 hours for 72 hours post chemo, then every 8 hours as needed, does this mean i wait until my 3 day cycle of chemo is done or today?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The medicine zofran contains ondansetron which is given to reduce nausea and vomiting in patients who are getting chemotherapy. This medicine is given initially during chemotherapy and most patients have discomfort and nausea when they are given the chemotherapy.Please take it one tablet every 8 hours for 3 days when taking the chemotherapy cycle because you might get nausea and vomiting during this time. If you feel better after the 3 days cycle then you might stop taking it. However if you feel persistent nausea and vomiting then it is suggested that you continue to take zofran for another two days.

Could missing bone be bone cancer? I am 41 with no family history of bone cancer. Dr. Has not seen this before and doesn't know what it is.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that you might have a bone cyst or a benign swelling which is causing your symptoms. The pain might be arising from stimulation of the nerves in the area. If it has happened slowly over more than 6 months to a year then it is a benign swelling. If it has increased in size within 3 months then a suspicion of cancer or an acute inflammation is to be thought of.However the pictures of the bone erosion are to be evaluated in detail to know about any pattern of destruction on the lines of a cancer. Please upload your images and report if possible and we can discuss the bone changes in your knuckle accurately. A FNAC from the swelling might help and this is a simple investigation by which few cells from the problem area are looked in to  using a microscope.

Today she went to the hospital to have a course of chemotheraphy, and they sent her away and removed the PICC line. I was just wondering if this was normal procedure? As they have sent her away another time before. Before she got diagnosed, she was a heavy drinker and smoker. And I believe she is still drinking and smoking at present. Could you give me any answers regarding this please, and any help. Thank you Sarah","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The PICC is short form for peripherally inserted central catheter. This is a narrow luminal catheter introduced through the arms to reach the superior vena cava to help in drug delivery close to the hear to enable quick and equal distribution of the chemotherapy medicine.The PICC lines are watched regularly and if there is an indication of the line not functioning adequately then it is removed and another PICC line might be inserted in few days or during the next cycle of chemotherapy.Replacing the PICC line is a normal procedure and does not have anything to do with the lifestyle of the patient and if she is smoking or drinking at the moment.

He's still very weak, after 1 session of chemo, has high fever and cough almost alternate day. I want to know whether any other form of treatment is available. Thank You.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your father has got a complicated medical condition due to the pre existing liver cirrhosis and a adrenocortical tumor which has spread to the lungs. In this situation it is important to take care and maintain his liver functions on one side and also attend to the adrenocortical tumor which has spread to the lungs.It is true that chemotherapy makes the patient weak and your father is having high fever and cough regularly probably because his immunity is low after chemotherapy. In this situation a calculated risk is to be taken to extend the survival of the patient. If the benefits are higher then the patient is to be given chemotherapy with regular monitoring of liver function.Right now your father has limited treatment options other than aggressive chemotherapy. If his doctors find him unfit then they will stop treatment with chemotherapy for a short duration and start it after few weeks. Stopping any treatment will cause disease progress.

These drugs might alter glucose metabolism in the body and predispose a person to higher levels of blood glucose.This might be considered as a stress on your system in response to the disease and the treatment. It is suggested that you please get HbA1c test done and if the report shows more than 6.2 percent then you should try any limit the sugars.

I am having a difficult time trying to determine if I should have a lumpectomy with potential radiation and hormone therapy or a simple mastectomy.  This area of calcification was picked up on mammography (yearly study) and they didn't know if I could have had it in 2009 since it is  right up against the chest wall which made it difficult to capture via xray.  If I should need radiation would proton thereapy be an option.  I have had 2 brothers that had this method of treatment for prostate cancer.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Intraductal carcinoma is a cancer of the lactiferous ducts in the breast. Treatment for intraductal carcinoma requires a planned treatment approach. This includes lumpectomy for small tumors and wide excision for tumors that might be excised. For tumors which are fixed to the muscles of chest wall, it is better to avoid surgery as first line of treatment and give radiation and chemotherapy and then decide if surgery is possible.Hormone sensitive cancers work better with exogenous hormones. Some tumors are estrogen receptor sensitive and these will show improvement with hormone targeted therapy.

How exactly does \\"invasive\\" affect prognosis?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in,An invasive tumor is one which has infiltrated to surrounding tissues. Such a tumor requires wide excision and a margin of healthy tissue is also removed at surgery. This will ensure that the margins are tumor free and there is less scope fr micro invasion of the cancer.From the prognosis point of view, this might be a slightly advanced or aggressive cancer and requires a planned treatment and management. You should be completing dedicated treatment and follow up with the doctor regularly. Mohs surgery might be discussed with your doctor depending on the extent of the cancer.

The number of lymphnodes which are cancerous is significant.  The treatment she is getting is acceptable.For the side effects she should try and have a calm mind.

She started with Cyber Knife to her Clival Tumor, which was ineffective after 8 months. She also has been thru a Cisplatin/Gemzar treatment as well as a Carbo/Taxol treatment that did not effect the cancer in the bones at all. In the 9 weeks that she was on The Carbo/Taxol, spots of cancer showed up on her liver. She is also receiving regular treatments of Zometa as well. She is trying one more avenue now with an oral 5-FU and Zometa. My questions are, if those other chemo s did absolutely nothing to change her cancer, how likely is this 5-FU to work? Also, if she has lived over a year with stage 4 cancer, how long can we expect her to be with us? Weakness and pain is constant for her and I want to know how long she will have to suffer for...","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The medicine 5FU is 5 fluoro uracil and is an anti metabolite. It kills the cancer cells by interfering in the cell growth cycle and stopping multiplication of cells.Unknown primary with metastatic disease is a difficult condition to treat and usually requires treatment with many approaches and regular modifications to control the disease. Stage 4 cancer is advanced disease and survival is unfortunately up to 2 years after detection in most patients. Hoping that your mother has got a less aggressive cancer and it gets under control and she has an extended survival for years.Oral 5FU and zometa might work where Cisplatin/ Gemzar and Carbo/ Taxol failed to show effective response.

I can understand your situation and problem. First of all, no need to worry for Cancer. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is marker of infection and inflammation. And chances of breast infection after pregnancy are more. This is due to lectiferous glands in the breast. So possibility of breast infection is more in your case and not breast cancer. Another possible reason for raised ESR is positive ANA (anti neutrophilic antibodies). This suggests possibility of connective tissue disease.

We are all shocked. I do not know his weight. He is tall. I do not know his medical history. I live in Europe and he lives in South Africa. It is winter out there and he has caught a cold. Should he postpone or go ahead with the chemotherapy given that he has caught a cold? I am sorry this is all I know at the moment. I do not know what stage of the disease he is in nor if the lymphoma has spread from his lymph nodes to and organs or to his blood system. I also do not know what type of Hodgkin's Disease he has. I know there are at least 4 or 5 different types. I would be most grateful if you couls advise whether the treatment should be postponed until after he has fully recovered from the cold. Many thanks in advice for your reply.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is suggested that he gets a complete blood count done and then it will be known if his cold infection is of a severe grade. If there is severe infection then it will be wise to provide treatment and then allow him to recover over a week or 10 days before initiating chemotherapy.A week of wait is acceptable and the chemotherapy might be planned such that he is physically fit at the time of commencement of treatment. Please note that every patient will feel weak after chemotherapy and his health will go down. He requires good care and support.

Please consult a surgeon and get an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy done to know if there is any ulcer in stomach which is causing your symptoms. Do not skip meals and avoid spicy foods, alcohol and smoking for some time.Eating raw white rice which is uncooked is unlikely to cause any cancer or pre cancerous condition.

The blood might be from the wall of the large bowel but serious damage after radiation cannot be ruled out until the investigations are done.For clearance of cancer it is important to do regular ultrasound and CT scans as a part of surveillance.

These likely represent small foci of microvascular ischemic disease. No confluent signal change suggestive of mass lesions or infarct is identified. 2. No abnormal areas of enhancement are seen.No mass lesions are identified.3. Grossly normal internal auditory canals. No mass lesion is seen. No abnormal fluid collections are present.

I can understand your father's situation and problem. Constipation in CA stomach patient needs investigations to rule out internal abdominal causes. Common causes are obstruction, paralytic ilius, loaded fecal matter etc. Intestinal obstruction is common in CA stomach patient due to enlarged abdominal lymphnodes. Hypokalemia (low potassium)is also common due to decreased oral intake and poor absorption. And this can cause paralytic ilius. So better to first get done ultrasound examination of abdomen, serum potassium level and if needed CT abdomen to search for the cause of constipation. If hypokalemia is the cause than potassium supplements should be given. But if obstruction is there than he needs surgery. High fiber diet, plenty of fluids can also helpful in constipation. So first rule out above mentioned causes for constipation and start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i am bleeding from my anus for a few weeks now its always off and on but i read on a site tht if it doesnt cause pain and its a dark red and in clots i may have cancer. what is the easiest way to find out if i do if i dont have money to go see a doctor?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Painless, bright red bleeding from anus is mostly due to piles (hemorrhoids) and anal canal cancer. Best way for diagnosis is locale site examination of anus. If on local examination dilated veins are seen than it is piles. But if nodule or mass or ulceration are seen than possibility of anal canal cancer is more. For all these you need to consult doctor and get done clinical examination of your anus. You may require proctoscopic examination also. So consult doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Yes, post operative chemotherapy is advisable in GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumour). It is to treat distal metastasis.

I thought cyberknife would be an effective treatment but my Dr said the tumors were too close to the surface, and they cant be removed surgically because the risk of facial paralysis is very high.  my question is, would brachytherapy be a good option for my case?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, brachytherapy is good option for you. In fact it is the only option for you because surgery is very risky at that location. Possibility of facial nerve damage is high in surgery. So better not to go for surgery. Brachytherapy is non invasive, so safe and will need to cause any damage to facial nerve or other structures.

I can understand your sister's situation and problem. She is having metastases in liver and bone. This is classified as stage 4 cancer, inoperable cancer. In this stage only palliative treatment in the form of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, nutritional support and pain management are indicated. Stem cells, thermal therapy etc is useful in stage 1 - 2  cancer. Once cancer is in stage 4, these newer treatment will not help. So better to consult oncologist and discuss all these.

She has been recovering. 3 weeks ago she started to have breathing difficulties, earache and cannot swallow. dr did a scope and found her throat is inflamed and have white patches at the cartilage. he gave antibiotics and painkillers for ten days. she is breathing thru stoma since february 2011. Is the cancer still present in her throat?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your mother's situation and problem. Vocal cord cancer is curable only in early stage where enblock resection is done. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy suppress the growth of tumour cells but they can not cure the cancer. So she is still having the cancer. And possibility of worsening of growth is more in her case. Growth causes obstruction in the lumen, so patient feels difficulty in swallowing, breathing difficulty etc. White thing might be due to fungal infection. So she may need antifungal drugs and repeat cycles chemotherapy. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi,I have been with my partner for 3 years we just got married 2 months ago.  I was tested for all STD's going into the relationship and again when I was pregnant with my now 18 month old.  I had a pap smear in April 2009 but am not sure if I was tested for stds.  I had a copper IUD put in me late December and when I went for my check up in Jan they took swabs when I complained of abdominal pain and having to pee frequently.  They came back clean but I phoned up my GP for antibiotics for a UTI since this is fairly common after having an IUD put in the Dr didnt test for it.  Well the pain went away but come back a couple of weeks later.  I put it to the back of my head as was very busy with exams and planning wedding plus thought I had to suffer through it cause of the IUD.  We went away on honeymoon and had pain while sex.  I thought it was the IUD and went to have it checked and was sent to another clinic after the first clinic took swabs.  They did swabs at second clinic and both tests came back positive with Chlamydia!  I have not cheated and the only person that I have had sex with is my husband for the past 3 years.  Of course I accused him of cheating and he swore that he hasnt cheated on me.  He went to get a full STD check and to add to the confusion he has come back negative for any STD's.  I am so confused as to how I could have gotten this.Before my husband got tested I was told that it was possible that he had Chlamydia and I was resistant to it and then when my IUD was put in I finally caught it.  Is it possible for my husband to be carrying Chlamydia but not have it and not test positive for it?Also I am worried that I have something else perhaps cervical cancer and it has had a reaction with the IUD and given me false positive results??  I am still peeing frequently and having abdominal pain even though I have completed all my antibiotics.  I will add that I have not had sex with my husband since all this has gone down and also he when he went to the clinic they gave him treatment for it even though they hadnt gotten his test results back yet.I am so confused and upset and I need answers as this is taking over my life.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. First of all, no need to worry for cervical cancer because your all reports are negative for cancer. You are having chlamydia infection due to IUD in uterus. IUD weakens local uterine defense system, so women on IUD are more prone to STD s. You are mostly infected through your husband. Male urethra is very protective against infection. So your husband might be carrying chlamydia without infecting him. And during sexual Intercourse, you are infected. Since your defense system is weak due to IUD, you are having symptoms of infection. So better to get done sensitivity report for guidance of effective antibiotic therapy. No need to worry for cervical cancer. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi I have had malignant melanoma 10 years ago with multiple mole biopsies, breast cancer with treatment three years ago, uterine cancer with complete hysterectomy two years ago.

They are doing surgery tomorrow and stated there is a 50% chance he could die?  Is this true?  Is this a risky surgery?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, this surgery is very risky and chances of death on operation table is highly, roughly 50-60%.This is because of the location of tumour. When tumour is around major blood vessel like aorta, chances of bleeding are more. So sudden massive bleeding during surgery can happen and it can cause death of patient.

I can understand your concern. No, this is not common. Foul smelling discharge in rectal cancer patient suggest infection at tumour site. Chemotherapy makes patient immunocompromised. So chances of infection are high in these patients. Radiotherapy weakens local defense system. So both these make patient prone to infection.

She did a vaginal ultrasound, a hysteroscopy, and eventually a D&C to be safe.  The results were normal with everything.  However, whenever she would do the vaginal ultrasound, there was one area that always looked like it had thickened.  The bleeding continued off and on.  We changed HRT.  We changed progesterone.  Finally, five months later, I got a second opinion.  Same routine.  Same tests, except this time I was sent to Dr. Platt, ultrasound guru, and he saw that same area that looked thick and had extra blood flow and said, \\"You need to get a D&C now.\\"  I had another one.  Same result.  Nothing.  Bleeding continues to start and stop.  This last week, I started bleeding more than ever before.  Sort of like a small period, with red blood some and light blood at other times.  I use the Vivelle patch, but only use the smallest dosage, cut it in half, and replace only one time per week.  I've done that for 10 years.  I use bioidentical progesterone that my GYN had mixed for me.  So my estrogen is very little.  Last week, I went back to my original GYN, and she did another ultrasound, saw that same area that looks thick, and this time we decided to send me to an oncologist.  Last point:  I am leaving on Sunday for an international vacation, and I cannot see the oncologist until I return.  How to control my fears about cancer?  Oh, and my mother had breast and cervical cancer (still alive), my grandmother had breast cancer, and my daughter died eight years ago from sinus cancer.  I've always been super healthy.  Whew!  I know that's a lot.  I'm thinking that perhaps the recent change of progesterone has stimulated this bleeding?  I'm also wondering what the heck that thickened area is that they keep seeing even after a D&C?  Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should not worry much about cervical cancer. You had D&C (dilatation and curetteg) twice and both were negative for malignancy. So possibility of malignancy is very low in your case. So no need to worry and enjoy your vacation. Yes, your bleeding is mostly due to hormonal imbalance and for this you need to consult gynecologist after your tour. Also consult oncologist after tour to remove your fear. Thickened area is mostly due to fibrosis. So at present, no need to worry for cancer. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"im a 40 yr old male.  i have been hoarse for over a month and saw a well respected ENT in Dallas yesterday.  I have a fairly large polyp that he said did not look cancerous.  He said i needed to have it surgically removed.  Im very nervous.  Could it be cancer?  What are the chances?  Could i lose my voice from the surgery?  Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Polyps can be cancerous if age is more than 60 years. So at your age of 40 years, possibility of benign polyp is more than malignant polyp. But for confirmation, we need histopathological examination of polyp. And for this excision biopsy of the polyp is needed. This is minor surgical procedure in which polyp is taken out surgically and sent for histopathological examination. No need to worry for hoarseness of voice or loss of voice. It is very safe procedure. So get it done and confirm the diagnosis. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Breast cancer if detected early is having excellent prognosis and near normal future life. First of all consult oncologist and determine the stage of her breast cancer. For this she needs PET scan. There are four stages of breast cancer. Stage 1 and 2 needs surgery (mastectomy) and post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Stage 3-4 needs chemotherapy and radiotherapy with subsequent debulking surgery. So treatment options are many in breast cancer but first determine the stage of cancer.

Both are good for diabetes and hypertension. Regarding prostate cancer, food is not an issue. But maintaining good immunity is important in cancer patients. So give him high protein diet like eggs, beans, legumes, pulses etc. Multivitamin tablet containing folic acid, niacin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, vitamin b12 etc is also important for immunity.

However, if you have a BPH then it is suggested to get blood PSA level test done. This is prostate specific antigen and is a marker for prostate cancer.PSA is normal up to 4 ng/ dl. More than 4 ng/ dl is an intermediate risk for prostate cancer and above 10 ng/ dl should be evaluated for possible prostate cancer. The PSA test might be done every year after 60 years of age. Having BPH is common in the elderly with 10 percent of males having it at 60 years and 80 percent at 80 years.

There is no single type of lymphoma and many types exist depending on the type of abnormal cell proliferation which is found on histopathological examination.The symptoms are unexplained weight loss of more than 10 percent over past 2 months with nightsweats and fever which has not showed any significant cause after doing routine testing. Many patients show painless lumps in the armpit, neck and other places where lymph nodes exist.Rarely lymphomas might also originate as lumps in any organ of the body. It might also affect bones in few patients. The spleen is usually enlarged in most patients of lymphoma. There might be abdominal pain from lymph nodes or enlargement of the spleen.Some of the lymphoma patients have occult disease and the symptoms stay undetected until it has manifested in to later stages.

Please type your query here...I was diagnosed with a beneign carcinoid stomach tumor last December.  I have recently been running a low grade fever and headache in the lower part of my head in the back.  Could there be a connection to the tumor that was removed?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A benign carcinoid tumor is a tumor which might cause release of neurochemicals which increase blood pressure and cause headache.It is possible that the benign tumor might have secreted certain chemicals which are directly related to causing headaches. Such tumor cells might be present elsewhere and they might continue to release the chemicals. I am not sure if you have been detected as multiple endocrine neoplasia which is also called MEN syndrome. In this condition there might be benign tumors in several places which might cause release of chemicals even after the removal of the stomach tumor. This requires detailed assessment regarding possibility of other similar tumors. Please discuss with your doctor and get complete evaluation done for it.

There is also a particular type of melanoma involving the eyes called occular melanoma and many patients admit to having spent years using many years on tanning beds under the sun therefore making it a cause.

It is suggested that  you make an appointment with the surgical or medical oncologist and discuss her condition in detail. The pathological report must be discussed regarding the malignancy and possible staging of the disease.It is not clear if your mother had large bowel cancer. Should her reports show colon cancer then she should regularly get CEA level in blood done to know if her cancer is still there. She might also have to do ultrasound scan abdomen and chest X ray regularly. Many patients with colon cancer have disease spread to liver and other organs if not treated aggressively. Please discuss this with her doctor in detail.

I hope he is getting treated in a cancer research institute where new medicine might be available on trial basis to know if a particular disease in late stage might be controlled by giving new medicine. Please have a discussion with a hematoncologist in a cancer research institute for such treatment options. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"my aunt was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.  It originated in her colon and has spread to her liver.  She has had 2 chemo treatments but is not having more.  We were told that she will be starting hospice.  She has gained 40 lbs in the hospital in 2 weeks.  Her legs and feet are extremely swollen.  She is confused at times.  How do we know if she has 2 days, 2 weeks or 2 years to live?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to know about your aunt who is suffering from stage 4 cancer. Colon cancer might be violent at times and even after surgery about half the patients develop spread to liver, lung and brain. The expected survival of a stage 4 cancer patient is up to 2 years from the date the cancer detection was confirmed in the liver.The maximum survival depends on many factors like age of patient, response to treatment, progress of disease, general health condition and mental outlook. In case of your aunt, it is important to know if the liver and kidneys are functioning normally. Swelling in legs indicates a problem in liver, kidney or heart. If there is a complication in the liver or kidneys then survival is reduced to 6 months. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi, my dad has been diagnosed in July with cancer of the esophegus, liver and spleen,we have been told its inoperable. he cant eat and struggles with fluid. the docs have talked about fitting a stent but he has been in hosp for 5 days and not yet had this done. he is on morphine and is also having seizures. I know he has to go at sometime but I was hoping you could give me a time frame, I understand without knowing him you cant give me exactly how long but hopefully you can give me a guestimate. I do not live close to him and dont know if I should be by his side now or wait.Many thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer in the esophagus is a growth in the food pipe. It might involve the proximal third, middle third and distal third. The stage of cancer is demonstrated by the infiltration of the cancer to the adjacent soft tissue structures. If the cancer is spread to liver and spleen then it is stage 4 cancer and less likely to be operable.In such case the doctor might suggest inserting a bare metallic stent in to the lumen of esophagus to allow easy flow of solid and liquid food through the narrow area. This will not treat the cancer. Treatment of cancer is by providing chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink tumor. The liver and spleen metastasis might have to be treated by chemotherapy. The expected survival in this condition is up to 2 years. Some patients might survive more with good treatment response and care. Pain and discomfort is treated with pain relief. Please discuss with the doctor regarding any stent placement to let him to take food and liquid by mouth. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My sister in law was diagnosed with breast cancer 3 yrs back, had it removed & was treated but now its back - 4 months ago was again diagnosed with breast cancer & as its now in the blood has desposited cancer sites on spine, pelvic bone, neck bone, she has really gone down fast & is wheelchair bound from weakness - today found out that its now in her lung & liver - hospital say they can do no more....................pls how long has she left??????????","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Unfortunately your sister in law has stage 4 cancer. This is because the breast cancer is spread to the spine, pelvis and cervical spine which recently involves the lung and liver. Spread of breast cancer happens in a small number of patients and has an expected survival for 2 years with good care and treatment. She might be provided chemotherapy and radiation therapy to reduce the disease progression and extend her survival.Your sister in law might be having a lot of pain and reducing the pain and discomfort is important. For her pain please talk to her doctor and let her be at least discomfort. Her nutrition is also important and providing high energy foods with protein might help.

It is possible that your grandfather had prostate cancer manifestation in his bones and that is now spreading to other organs in the abdomen or elsewhere.The expected survival in stage 4 cancer is up to 2 years from the detection of disease with recommended care and treatment. In your grandfather the countdown to 2 years starts from the day he was told that the prostate cancer has spread to bones. He might be having a lot of pain and discomfort due to nerve root compression from the collapsing vertebrae. Providing him adequate nutrition is important.

Are there any complimentary alternative medicines ?thanks","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern, if this it the malignancy of prostrate then it need to be treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, without this nothing can be done, and if this is not being done then it would spread in all over system, do not waste the time,  hope this information helps, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"My grandmother has recently undergone a surgery for hernia. The doctors now say she has stage 4 cancer. She is located at Mumbai, India and the only options given to us is surgery and chemotherapy. My grandmother is very weak after surgery. We need guidance in the course of action that can be taken. I have posted the report handed over to us. A 2.9 x 2.8 x 2.3 cm measuring hypodense to soft tissue lesion heterogenrously enhancing seen arising from the right adrenal gland. Il defined mesenteric thickening and stranding noted in the left lumbar region.  Soft tissue density irregular border lesion with calcific speck within is seen in the central pelvis with adjacent mesenteric thickening, abdomino-pelvic fluid.  This lesion causing indentation on the posterior wall of bladder.  The uterus and ovaries not visualised seperately.

Both kidneys are normal in size, shape and show good prompt function.  There is no evidence of focal lesion.  A tiny cortical cyst in the midpole of the left kidney. There is no free fluid or significant lymphadenopathy. The bowel loops appear unremarkable","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There is a suspected tumor in the pelvis, probably originating from the uterus or ovaries. This is because the report shows that the pelvic organs cannot be clearly visualized and there is a mention of the mass lying behind the urinary bladder.The words mesentric thickening and an enhancing mass in the right adrenal gland indicates possible disease spread. This is the reason doctors find it to be stage 4 disease. The survival for stage 4 cancer is up to 2 years with recommended chemotherapy and good care.

Not like a tumor bump but almost like the size of a pimple but a little bit bigger. I know its not an STD but Im freaking out a little that it might be cancer or something, what are the chances?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Bumps on nipple do not indicate cancer. It might be due to benign condition including infection or due to hormonal changes. However, it is suggested that you have it examined by the surgeon and observe for progressive changes over the next few days.In most probability you do not have cancer if it is the size of a pimple and not exactly a lump. You have not mentioned about any pain over the area. If there is pain then a possibility of an infective pimple is more likely.

Unfortunately due to having sex too early there is a pregnancy. There is a significant chance of having an abnormal fetus because she is taking chemotherapy.Please consult the oncologist and make them aware of the situation. Since there might have been adverse effects on the growing fetus, it is better to consult a gynecologist and take a collective decision on the future of the pregnancy.

A recent ew ailment is vaginal bleeding of very bright red blood.had hodgkins lymphoma several years ago scared may have something similar. Not sure how to approach doctor, just had benign cyst removed from left breast 5.5cm as well. See doc for results few days should i mention to him. Wondered if could be gall stones","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is unlikely that alcohol is directly related to vaginal bleeding. However a possible relation exists between alcohol drinking causing gastritis which leads to shoulder and rib pain. The shoulder and rib pain is because of nerve irritation and non specific. Alcohol precipitates features of gastritis. This might be felt as pain in the chest which might include ribs and shoulder.Hodgkins lymphoma usually does not cause bleeding through vagina. You might have to get a gynecological examination done to know if there is any condition in the cervix or vagina which might be causing the bleeding. It is also possible that after taking alcohol your urinary bladder is over distended or you might have cause in the urinary system for your bleeding. Doing an ultrasound scan of abdomen and pelvis with pap smear might be required. Complete blood count is also suggested with peripheral blood smear. Please mention these details to your doctor. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"hi my grandfather has had lung cancer and bowel cancer the last 3 years,in that time he has lost alot of weight,Yesterday he went for a scan and it showed that the cancer has now spread his liver and brain,i know there isnt much that can be done,but im just wondering what will happen him the next couple of months,","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells involving a particular organ system. In colon cancer there is abnormal growth of the large bowel. Initial stages of colon cancer is treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In about half of colon cancer patients, there might be spread to liver within 2 years of cancer detection. It might also involve the lungs and brain like in your grandfather. This happens because the cancer cells persist and travel through blood and multiply in target organs.Your grandfather has stage 4 cancer and with the best care and treatment his survival might be extended up to 2 years. Please discuss with his doctor and provide pain relief and keep him comfortable. He also requires healthy nutrition and adequate fluids to maintain his general condition. If seizures happen then anti epileptics are to be given.

Allopathy doctors do not show any hopes for cure but are trying to prolong his life only. Is there any medicine in ayurveda that will help him give a better life?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about your husband who is having hepatocellular cancer. There is probably a blood clot which has developed in the IVC which is a great vein transporting blood to the right chamber of the heart. This is a serious concern and I hope you have discussed the matter with allopathy doctors and treatment might have been started to dissolve the clot. The problem happens when such a clot reaches the lung through the heart and causes complete occlusion of pulmonary artery leading to lungs not receiving blood for oxygenation. If your husband develops breathlessness then please take him to the hospital immediately.Ayurveda does not have any confirmed research on the treatment of hepatiocellular carcinoma in my knowledge. It is important to keep in mind that the blood clot in IVC should be dissolved to extend his life using allopathy medicine and prevent sudden complications. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"i have a small tumor kind of thing in testicular area i don't know exact technical term for that but it's hard and feeling some pain not in that particular but in adjacent area and its attached with one of my testis i just consult with a doctor and he suggested to consult with some surgeon, i have some fear can anybody tell me what are the chances of testicular cancer in this case","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to do a clinical examination and follow it up with an ultrasound scan of testis. The surgeon is the doctor who deals with testis related problems. Most swellings in and around the testis are benign and it looks like your tumor like growth is from the epididymis which is a structure at the head of the testis.There is usually no pain associated with cancer, though it might be felt by some patients. The growth also is hard and therefore requires detailed evaluation. It is possible that you had a benign cyst which might have got infected. Cancer in the testis is more common in the elderly but is also less often seen in young males. The ultrasound scan testis is most important and I guess you should get it done immediately.

Tata memorial hospital mumbai is a research center and they might have accurately done staging for your uncle. I guess the doctors want to shrink the tumor with chemotherapy and then proceed with surgery. The benefit in this situation is that the surgery is easy and there are better chances of survival.In many cancer hospitals the same protocol is used and you might take another opinion at any well known cancer center. There is Kidwai memorial institute of oncology in bangalore and cancer research center in chennai and trivandrum. Your uncle might take opinions at these centers before going for surgery.There is no single best doctor when we consider cancer treatment. It is an evolving field of medicine and I refer my patients to tata memorial hospital because their set up is organized and regularly new treatment options are reviewed for research purposes.

He has had chemo and radiation treatment and an operation removing a 7cm gland. he went for more chemo, but his body rejected the chemo. the doctors advised mroe radiation as he still a gland under his arm.After the first chemo and radiation treatment - he had another scan and this was clear in the nasopharynx area. His blood is low and he is feeling tired all the time. Why did the chemo not work the second time and is more radiation the answer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and it is not possible to predict the outcome before giving treatment. The usually treatment is surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery is done for early cancers and that is why the doctors removed a 7 cm tumor. This is followed by single or combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy.Chemotherapy might not work because the cells are resistant to the particular medicine. If first line of medicine does not work then the second line of chemotherapy is given. If there is still no response then radiation therapy is increased in dose. The second chemotherapy probably did not work due to aggressive nature of the cancer and is rarely seen. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"In March 2010 i had a cervical biopsy because my pap smear came back abnormal. Lately (about 2 months) I feel bloated and tired more than usual.  My bloating looks like i'm 2-3 months pregnant.  No changes in my eating habits.  Could the bloating be related to ovarian cancer? or a cyst? No adominal or back pain. or abnormal bleeding. I am 29. I am now weighing in at 112 (104 previously) 5 feet 2.  Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Bloating is a non specific symptom and might be seen in many conditions. Cysts in the ovary might cause bloating sensation and this requires clinical abdominal examination and ultrasound scan or CT scan. Any cyst in the ovary will be noted. It is also possible that there might be a condition in the uterus and this might be confirmed by clinical investigations.A pap smear is not connected to cyst in ovary. It tells about the cells in cervix. Please discuss your pap smear report with the doctor. If there is any cyst in the ovary then you might have to do additional test like CA 125 to know if there is any risk of cancer associated with the cyst. You might also get your thyroid function test done. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi, since this morning I ve had low grade fever, chills, some nausea due to fever.

TB treatment is to be taken for 6 to 9 months or more for cure. However, if there is no improvement or increase in size and pattern of lymph nodes then a biopsy is always better.Rarely such increase in size might be seen in drug resistant TB and then after biopsy confirmation, second line of drugs might be started. Cancer is less likely but it is important to rule out any nodal cancer. TB and some cancers like lymphoma might have similar symptoms and therefore it is not possible to make a diagnosis from symptoms. At this stage cancer and TB are completely curable with medicine.

However, there is no acute adverse effect after taking small amounts of alcohol and drugs if he is on low dose maintenance chemotherapy. It is important to note that taking IV chemotherapy in small packs is to be clearly understood and unless the details are available, it is only making a guess about the entire situation.

You need to ab an adult above 18 years in most countries and in good health.A small blood sample will be taken from you to determine your tissue type. This information is kept on the register of voluntary bone marrow donors. Should their be a requirement from a matching recipient then you will be informed about the need. The commonest procedure is peripheral blood stem cell donation. For this you might receive injections for 4 days to increase the circulating stem cells in your blood. On day 5 blood will be drawn in to a machine and the stem cells will be filtered and removed and the blood returned through another vein. This process takes place in the hospital and might take 3 to 5 hours and might be repeated again the following day if required.

Routine exam and mammogram resulted in biopsy and diagnosis of breast cancer. Treatment included biolateral mastectomy and TRAM reconstruction. In 2005, I had first colonoscopy that revealed pre-cancer polyps removed. in 2009 I had second colonoloscopy that revealed precancer polyps removed. April 2011, I am 51 yr old female, 5'5\\", 220 lb. Saw my podiatrist for routine appt for pain in left foot. He immediately noticed a change in a lesion on the top of right foot.    I thought the lesion was part of the incision that never healed flat like the rest of the scar. Dr insisted he performed immediate punch biopsy. My breast surgeon has found a palpable lump above the mast/recon incision. My next appt I expect will be an excisional biopsy. I am so anxious ... I can't sleep, even with taking 2 sleeping pills.  I wonder if my breast cancer has recurred, if it's metastisized, and how my foot is involved. How concerned should I be?  I'd appreciate any words of wisdom. thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Breast cancer might metastasize to any part of the body but a lesion in the foot is rarely a metastasis from breast cancer. I have served in a cancer institute for few years and never came across a spread of breast cancer to the foot.However, it is important to do a excision biopsy urgently to rule out a cancer spread. A histopathological diagnosis is the confirmation of a spread and biopsy is recommended. The cancer cells move from one part of the body to another mainly through blood and lymphatic fluid. Direct spread is to surrounding organs.

Is it possible for it to be a whole new/different cancer unrelated to the breast cancer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells involving any organ system. There are cases where a cancer is treated many months to years back and appears again at another location. In other words it is a metastasis of the original cancer after the patient is treated for the primary. The cells that are found in the new location show characteristics of a cancer spread from else where and the pathologist is able to make a diagnosis.Few patients have a completely new type of cancer which is not related to any previous cancer. The biopsy from the new cancer are entirely different and show features of a primary cancer. It is important to get detailed investigation done and do pathological confirmation.

There is a possibility that tissue might slough out from the cervix in a patient of cancer cervix. This is more prominent after having sex because there is close contact between the penis and vaginal vault and cervix of uterus in sexual intercourse. Ejaculation is part of sex and the semen is deposited in the vaginal vault.The semen consistency also might be thick and sometimes there is vaginal secretion also during sex which is more in some people. Sex might cause sloughing of some layers from the surface of cervix and this mixes with the semen and vaginal secrtions causing a brownish vaginal discharge which you experience. Suggested discussion with your doctor. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Off and on each year for a few days, since 2008, I ve noticed bleeding in my rectum and/or in my stools.

I do smoke, can ethis be mestastsis from the breast cancer, or the kind of cancer you get from smoking? I'm having alot of pain in the back under shoulder blade, and when i cough i can feel my lungs hurting.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If you have a history of breast cancer andd the PET CT scan shows a nodule in right lung upper lobe then the likelihood of a metastasis is much more than a new cancer in the lung. Breast cancer might spread to any other organ system and any suspicious area on the PET CT can is investigated for a metastasis first.Please discuss the lung nodule with your doctor and follow rcommended treatment and follow up. If it is a small nodule then treatment response is better. Pain during cough is less likely from a small nodule and might be more related to your general condition. However, a nodule from other benign causes should be ruled out subsequently and any other respiratory symptoms are to be attended to. Please discuss pain relief with yoru doctor to make yourself comfortable.

This pass week end he has been stomach sick and very fatigued .  At the time he was given 6 months without chemo. Despite of how well he has been doing. What how fast can this thing downgrade???","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to hear about your husband who is having advanced stage gall bladder cancer. This cancer is difficult to treat and doing surgery extends survival. Since there is spread to liver therefore he is having stage 4 cancer. Doctors might have suggested chemotherapy to stabilize the disease progress and control it. However, since he has refused chemotherapy, it is possible that his disease has progressed in uncontrolled way and spread to the liver.The expected survival in case of stage 4 gall bladder cancer is 2 years with good cae and recommended treatment. Since chemotherapy was not given therefore the survival in your husband might be reduced from 6 months to a year. He must be under a lot of physical pain and please dicuss with pain relief doctor and make him comnfortable. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi! My husband was recently diagnosed with cancer of the small intestines. He was confined for a week because of all the blood he had lost. He is working as a security personell at the embassy, a very stressful job. My question is, should he be going back to work before the operation or should he stay at home and rest to avoid all the stress and heave work?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A patient having small intestine cancer with bleeding should be taking rest for sometime. His body is weak and he is not fit to work as a security person as it involves a lot of physical and mental stress. He might take up a desk job if possible which might be less stressful. Doing a security job is not recommended at the moment due to his health condition.He should also be provided nutrition and vitamins as recommended by his doctor. Since cancer treatment is a stressful perdion, please help him by giving emotional support and trying to know if he is having any pain in the abdomen for which he might require pain relief medicines. You might make a request to his employer to provide alternate employment. Following his surgery he might require few weeks rest.

I know that breast cancer and leukemia are different but they're actually pretty much the same treatments. Just lately Iowa city hospitals diagnosed her with stage 4 saying that the cancer in her breast was gone but she had tumors in her brain and on her spine.  From prev. ex. i know that a hospital should be doing lps and bone marrows then, RIGHT? Iowa city has not performed either the only thing to prove the sarcoma came from a sore few ribs and an xray that she didnt see.  I had leukemia and had a battery of them tests for three yrs they havent givin her one","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a condition where there is uncontrolled abnormal proliferation of abnormal cells. Treatment of cancer involves surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy depending on the stage and type of cancer. It is possible that chemotherapy medicines might be similar for some forms of cancer including cancer of breast and leukemia. The medicines destroy the abnormal cells and in any cancer there are cells which are destroyed by chemotherapy agents.Regarding the tests for leukemia, bone marrow test and lumbar puncture are essential. However for spread of breast cancer to brain and spine, a bone marrow test and lumbar puncture is not required. It is highly suspicious that a bone or brain lesion in a patient treated for breast cancer is in fact a spread of the earlier cancer. Therefore it is obvious from a MRI scan or X ray itself and no bone marrow or LP required. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi,My uncle has been diagonized with Prostarte cancer a couple of years ago and had to undergo a surgery.

The doctors at Lucknow had found his conditions to be terminated ill and for Palliative treatment","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Kidney is an organ which filters the blood of impurities like blood urea and creatinine. It is important to know that kidneys are important for the proper functioning of the human body. Any obstruction to urinary flow might damage the kidney. Kidney damage also occurs due to strong medicines given during chemotherapy. Chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure also cause kidney impairment.It is important to know the underlying cause of kidney dysfunction in you uncle. Serum creatinine level slowly increases and 8 is high. It would not have occurred suddenly in a prostate cancer patient and earlier reports are to be reviewed and please discuss the same with his doctor. In emergency he might go for a hemodialysis and subsequently measures are to be taken to maintain the level of serum creatinine.

And it is seen more with prostate malignancy. So you are at higher risk of Pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis (DVT)  of lower limbs. D dimer is marker of blood clotting. And hence it is raised in Pulmonary embolism and DVT. Though it is not 100% specific, but possibility can not be ruled out in your case as you also have breathlessness.

But chances of malignancy are less because she is not having an mass lesion or enlarged inguinal lymphnodes. So possibility of post menopausal thickness is more. But better to rule out cancer and hence dilatation and curetteg (D&C) is advised in her case. If D&C is negative for malignancy than no need to worry for cancer. Also get done hormone levels to rule out hormonal imbalance as this is the common cause for endometrial thickening. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your mother.

This pain usually responds to taking antibiotics. You have not mentioned about any episode of loose motions. However, mild bowel infection can occur without loose motions.Coming to your concern about periods, you should have had your periods much earlier if you have a regular 28 days cycle. Not having periods can have many reasons like hormonal imbalance, thyroid disorder, anxiety, PCOS, anemia.

Free fluid in pouch of douglas suggests that there is some fluid in the abdominal cavity which is occupying the space behind the uterus at the time of scan.This fluid is in small quantity then is not a concern.

I have been taking quinagolide (75mg daily) since Dec 2010. My prolactine levels have returned to completely normal and I have now had my 6th period, which is great news as I am trying to get pregnant. I have since lost 3.5 stone in weight to help this process and improve my overall fitness. In the past 3 weeks, my finger tips have gone numb (including thumb and pinkie finger) 3 times. This starts in my left hand, then shortly goes to my right hand. It lasts for between half an hour to  couple of hours at a time. I have an appointment with my consultant in a few months time for a 'check up', but am concerned about this numbness (with pins and needles sensation). Is this connected with either the tumour or the drugs and shall I try and get an appointment set up for an earlier date? Any advise would be greatly received. Kind regards Michele","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Pituitary tumor measuring 4 mm a too small to cause symptoms. However, it will help to get examined clinically and if required then please get a review MRI scan done. Quinagolide causing numbness is rare however the use of other medicines is important to discuss with your doctor.It is important to know if you ever had symptoms due to cervical spine degeneration. The nerves supplying fingers originate in the neck spine and if there is any degenerative process in the spine then it might lead to numbness and tingling in the fingers. Avoid sudden movements of the neck and do not lift heavy weights.

The growth has transformed from low grade dysplasia to high grade means that there might be active cell division which is a precursor to cancer. In such cases it is better to do a CT scan of abdomens and pelvis and colonoscopy. This will show any more early growths and give a complete picture of the nature of illness.The treatment for high grade dysplasia is surgery and regular follow up to prevent cancer from taking place.

In 2009 i had another abdominal ultrasound, my spleen was (15 cm), all other symptoms were there In 2010 I discovered that I had 2 lymph node swollen in my neck. One of them was removed (biopsy) and examined, the final result was no morphological and immunohistochemical evidence to support the diagnosis of lymphoma and we advice for follow up. The second lymph node disappears after antibiotic. In 2011 I had a third abdominal ultrasound, my spleen was (15.2 cm), all other symptoms were there.  I consulted a doctor, he asked for some blood tests: CBC, ESR, CRP, B2- macroglobulin, LDH, Serum protein electrophoresis and , Immunoglobulin levels, Al came back normal.

Such acute symptoms are more likely to be due to infection in the throat. Please continue taking proton pump inhibitors. If the odynophagia increases then you should go back to your doctor and get examined for an oral examination and probably a neck CT scan to know if there is any abscess which is evolving. If there is significant infection then treatment is with a short course of antibiotics.Endoscopy is done when the infection has been treated and the inflammation is reduced and is safe to do after 4 weeks in your case.

PA comes in asks more questions, starts the nerve test again, but then does the follow my finger while shining that pen light in my eyes (I get dizzy close my eyes, he asks me to open, and I apparently go into a focal seizure) after that takes place he immediately does nerve check again, and entire right side is weak.  He discusses his finding with doctor.  Doctor comes in and the tremors were gone, and I was back to \\"normal\\".  They ran blood work, normal (they did not do any other tests), I was told that they could not conduct the type of test I required there.  I go and see a Neurologist tomorrow (Not sure what he'll say, so a little nervous).  I'm just wondering what this could be if it's possible related to the meningioma (sp?) or to the spinal stenosis, or something completely different.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Meningioma is a tumor of the covering of brain. It is possible for a tumor in brain like meningioma to cause seizures and difficulty in initiating movement, though any pain and numbness in the legs might also be due to the spinal stenosis.Since your hands had tremors therefore it is less likely to be due to the spinal canal stenosis and more likely because of the meningioma. The seizure activity is from abnormal current flow in the brain. The meningioma might cause abnormal electric discharges and this leads to brain waves being generated which cause symptoms of seizure. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi my aunt has cancer, a few years ago was in kidney which she had removed. drs say it was there 10yrs maybe but no symptomns. then she got secondary cancer in her lungs i think they used inferin to treat it. now she has spots on her brain, which she has had radium treatment on this week. it has also spread to her bones and liver. what are the chances considering its so widespread. will any other surgery help, how succesful wil the radiation be on bones and brain?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to know the details of the cancer she is having.

For over three years he complained to his doctor about symptoms and wanted further testing done but his doctor kept telling him it was not necessary and it was due to having a fatty liver and being over weight.  He went with a different doctor last year and the doctor had a CT scan done which detected the cancer.  We just want some insight and to know if his cancer was detected three years ago would it have been at an earlier stage and not effecting his lymph nodes.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Colon cancer even after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy, might spread to liver in half of the patients. This is confirmed by many studies and therefore a close follow up is suggested in every patient with colon cancer even on treatment.Please get regular ultrasound scan abdomen done and CT scan abdomen might also be done less frequently. It is possible that the cancer grew over tha last 6 months before detection. To know the appearance of the cancer, it is important to know the CT scan report. Though it is less likely to be detectable on CT san done 3 years back. If the cancer involves a large segment with  obvious wall occlusion then a CT scan done earlier might have given a clue. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"In 2008-2009 I was diagnosed with Ewing s Sarcoma. I did a years worth of chemotherapy and 6 weeks straight of radiation. They moved my right ovary over so it won t get damaged from radiation. I ve been in a relationship for over 6 yrs now and me and my partner really want to conceive. I am getting a little doubtful. It is hard for me to find out exactly when, or if I do ovulate because I don t have normal periods (every month ) my period only comes when it wants to and out of nowhere. I finally had a period on my own last month which really surprised me and made me happy. It s February 20th today and I should have started my period by now but haven t yet. On another note, last night me and my partner were getting a little touchy last night and he even noticed that I had a thick clear discharge in my vagina. I know it normally happens before a period but I m not getting no cramps at all. Which I always do before I start. I ve never had this kind of discharge are all before and I have been sexually active since the day I ended my last period which was in January 27th. Does anyone have any guess or answers at all as to why I had this unusual discharge last night and if this is some kind of sign, could I possibly be pregnant or is my body finally functioning the way it s supposed to. Since I did have a period last month does that mean I can and do still ovulate","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that after getting treated for Ewings sarcoma by chemotherapy and radiation therapy, you have had a sub fertility and this is due to hormonal imbalance. If your periods are not regular then please consult your gynecologist and follow treatment to regularize it. Ovulation occurs 14 days before periods in most women. However since your periods are irregular therefore it is not easy to predict ovulation in your case. There are home test kits available to monitor ovulation or do ultrasound follicle monitoring around the time of ovulation.When your periods are regular then you might use the ovulation kit to know exactly when you are most fertile and conceive. If there is persisting difficulty in monitoring ovulation then there is a chance of pregnancy by artificial reproductive techniques. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I had a mammogram on yesterday and was called back today to say that there was some asymmetric tissue in my left breast, with no sign of a mass.

I also am on a maintenance chem regime because I was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in 2013, but the disease is in remission. I have chem every 2 months. Can this also cause some changes in my breast tissue?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is rare to find two different cancers in a patient but this is not unheard of. The possibility of chemotherapy for follicular lymphoma causing breast cancer is less. However there is a slight chance of cancer in the breast if you have received radiation therapy for your previous cancer.There are studies which have shown that radiation therapy for lymphoma might put the patient at slight risk of another cancer. However, since there is no obvious mass in the breast refion therefore the likelihood of a cancer is less. Since there is a suspicious finding on mammography therefore confirming it with ultrasound is important. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am currently going through chemo for breast cancer, the chemo drug I am taking is taxol... I now have some discomfort in my lower left side... And it hurts when I cough... I am a little constipated from the chemo and steroids they gave last Monday... Is the pain caused by the constipation?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cough is a protective reflex that helps in expulsion of secretions from the airway. Coughing also involves the contraction of the badominal muscles. Sometimes during severe cough the patient might develop continuous muscle contractions in the lower abdominal wall and this causes pain and discomfort/The pain is not because of the chemotherapy. People who are treated for cancer usually end up with a low immunity. This makes it possible for mild respiratiory infections to affect the person. Due to the increased cough, there might be fatigue in the lower abdominal wall muscle. Please take a cough supressant after discussing with your doctor.

She had part of her esophagus removed at the Mayo Clinic. Since she had her esophagus removed maybe it was actually esophageal cancer which is pretty similar but I'm think it was stomach cancer.

The process starts from a single cell and quickly multiplies to involve the entire organ. In case of the esophagus and stomach, there is cancer originating from the walls. The triggering factor might vary from a particular type of fish that is commonly seen in Japanese to any inherent genetic association.Cancers are essentially one rotten egg in a basket which destroys the other eggs. If the single rotten egg or early cancer is not cleared then it proceeds to involve the surrounding areas. In stomach cancer also there are different subtypes like adenocarcinoma, GIST, leiomyosarcoma and lymphoma. Every cancer behaves peculiarly.

I exercise, I do skin brushing on a regular basis for the lymphatic system. put my feet up and use some pressure points to no avail. For one week traveling from Houston to Ireland I had no swelling, however, when I arrived in London it was back and has never left. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The lymphedema from the cervical cancer treatment cannot be cured completely. However the swelling might be controlled with the help of compression wear like stockings. There is excess lymphatic fluid that is occupying the spaces below the skin. This occurs from stage I through stage III. You might still be having stage I of the condition if it is intermittent. It is good that you are having sessions of skin brushing and that will help a long way in your treatment.You might discuss the use of compression garments to keep the swelling down when you are on travel and should you develop swelling at any point in time. Please choose your pressure garment carefully. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My husband was diagnosed with pancratic cancer May 2010.

He did not remove the tumor which is wrapped around the main portal vein.  Since then his cat scans continue to improve with Gemzar/Tarceva chemotherapy.  The tumor is stable and the spread has lessened.  What kind of life expectency can we expect.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your husband's situation and problem. By your history and description, his pancreatic tumour is chemo sensitive. This is the reason for his stable pancreatic cancer. This is actually good sign for prognosis. Chemo sensitive pancreatic cancer is having life expectancy of more than 10 years. The problem in such patients is delayed resistance to chemotherapy. Patient develops chemotherapy resistance after 5-6 years of treatment. So we need to monitor patient every six monthly for worsening of tumour. And if worsening is there than change of chemotherapy is needed. So do regular follow up with your oncologist. He is having good prognosis within expectancy more than 10 years.

I can understand your husband's situation and problem. Non Hodgkins lymphoma is one of the most aggressive malignancy of body. At the same time it is highly chemo sensitive. It actually disappear with effective chemotherapy. This is the reason for short course chemotherapy. Non Hodgkins lymphoma patients need regular follow with CT scan every six monthly. So whenever there is relapse of lymphoma, chemotherapy is administered. Over all prognosis is not good. Life expectancy is less than 5 months.

Especially if the symptoms are associated with frequent urinating, burning while urinating or fever. Lower abdominal pain can be also caused by diverticulitis of sigmoid colon. This condition is almost always caused by chronic constipation so if you have them, this should be considered.Other possible reasons like ovarian cyst, ovaries inflammation, inguinal hernia should be also checked.I suggest you to visit your doctor and have urine analysis, blood work and abdominal ultrasound at first. Diverticulitis should be visible in the ultrasound as well and WBC will be elevated. Both uti and diverticulitis should be treated with antibiotics.You should also visit gynecologist and have transvaginal ultrasound done.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"my mom had a gastrectomy and chemo for a few months (4-6 months) she still has the same symptoms as before the operation - indigestion, vomiting, constipation, severe abdominal pain, severe weight loss.

The colon cancer might spread to the liver in half of patients during or after chemotherapy. It is important to know the number and size of liver lesions. A single lesion might be further treated but multiple lesions have low response rates to treatment.Since the oncologist has told that surgery is not possible therefore I consider the lesions to be multiple and difficult to be operated up on. There are techniques like radiofrequency ablation and trans arterial chemo embolization which might not work for every patient. The prognosis is difficult and survival might be 2 years in most of the patients with colon cancer and having liver spread. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"In a cancer patient with stage IV ovarian cancer that has recurred in the colon and has matasticized in the pelvic lymph nodes and liver. She has recently begun radiation, which is the last procedure that the doctors plans to try. Today she found feces in the vagina.  What might this indicate? How urgent would it be to contact her doctor?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer in ovary that has spread to liver is stage 4 disease; it has limited treatment options and if chemotherapy does not show response then radiation therapy is used to reduce the symptoms.Feces in the vagina might be due to adverse effect of cancer causing a rectovaginal fistula. This is an abnormal connection between the colon wall and vagina and leads to feces matter coming out of vagina. Patient might be considered for surgical repair if general condition permits.

This might have origins in certain viruses but cancer as a condition is not spread by body massage. It is true that any person might harbor an infection so massage therapist have to take precautions when giving massage to any person irrespective of whether thy have a disease.Cancer patients are as good candidates for body massage as compared to the general population. General precautions are to be taken for any person getting a massage, whether or not they have cancer. I hope your organization provides services to cancer patients just the way they serve the general population maintaining basic hygienic practice.

Both of us have noticed that the right breast has shrunk - her considerably and mine not as much but it definitely it is quite smaller than originally after surgery.

It is given to many patients and the treatment is acceptable.Some of the common side effects include the followinghot flushesfatiguearthralgiaheadacheinsomnia increased sweatingThe shrinking of breast is in response to radiation therapy and the breast might have undergone radiation therapy changes and this causes slight decrease in size of breast.

This condition is possible especially if you have had chronic abdominal pains, have been abusing alcohol or are obese.Other cysts sources are liver or intestine mesentery. It is also possible that this is large ovarian cyst.I suggest you to consult gastroenterologist. The cyst should be drained through the skin (if possible) or through the stomach (during gastroscopy).Hope this will help.

Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health."},{"Patient":"sir my name is vaseem khan and i am from dhamtari  the Small village in chhattishghar  my quire is my father age 65 yrs. is suffering from  cancer ““type  of CLL “ last 3 month ,   I have checked  blood test every month and get found every month his HB count is low why this happened","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your father's situation and problem. CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) is blood cancer affecting blood cells. CLL patient is at high risk of hemolysis. This hemolysis can cause breakdown of RBCs (red blood cells) and hence hemoglobin will drop. Another cause is decrease production of RBCs from bone marrow. CLL infiltrates bone marrow. Blood cells are originating from bone marrow. So RBC production is also decreased in CLL. This is another reason for low hemoglobin. With proper chemotherapy, CLL can be controlled and once it is in remission phase, hemoglobin will start rising. So consult oncologist for your father and start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am concerned about some lumps in my mouth that I recently noticed.  They are small lumps on the floor of my mouth, but seem to have gotten bigger and more noticeable since I noticed them about 4 days ago.  I have been chewing tobacco pouches on occasion (2 or 3 a week) for about 2 months now, and have been smoking an average of two cigarettes per week for about a year.  I am concerned that the lumps may be cancerous - how would I know?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Possibility of cancerous growth is unlikely in your case. But since you are smoker and having habit of tobacco chewing, better to get done biopsy from the lumps and get done histopathological examination to rule out cancer. Smokers and tobacco chewers are at increased risk of oral cancer. So biopsy and histopathological examination is must in your case. Vitamin deficiency is common cause for such lumps in mouth. So if biopsy is negative for cancer than start multivitamin tablet containing folic acid, niacin, vitamin b12 and zinc. And in any case you need to quit smoking as well as tobacco chewing as soon as possible. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Hospice stepping in tomorrow but in the meantime he has no physician due to no insurance. At the moment he is expericing the hiccups and sore throat. Hiccups is hurting him. He is on oxycodone as he is in much pain when not. Is there an over the counter rememdy I can get him to relieve the hiccups?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sorry to know that your son is having an advanced stage of colon cancer. At this time, he should be given complete pain relief and emotional support. Arrangements should be made to take care of him all the time and hospice will do that I hope.Hiccups in cancer might be due to acid reflux or as a side effect to chemotherapeutic agents. If his hiccup is from acid reflux then please give him over the counter remedies to prevent acid reflux. Also keep him in seated position for 30 minutes after meals to prevent the food in stomach from returning back in to the esophagus. Many chemotherapy hiccups might also respond to steroid treatment and if he is being given steroids for his condition then that will also treat the hiccups.FDA has approved a medicine called chlorpromazine to treat hiccups in cancer patients but you require a prescription to get it."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2002. Had lumpectomy lymph nodes does positive. I do not have a dr at this time but my affected breast is enlarged, sore and sounds funny but itches. Do you think this is something I sould worry about? as all mammograms have always come back clear.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It appears that you might have a fungal skin infection on the under side of the breast. A clinical examination is required to know if the itching is accompanied by fungal skin changes. The commonest infection is ring worm and it occurs in the under side of breast where there is sweating and moisture deposition.This might not be related to breast tissue and therefore the mammogram comes normal. The treatment for breast fungal infection is application of anti fungal treatment and wearing cotton inner clothes that will prevent sweat formation. If the ointment does not work in a confirmed fungal infection then a short course of oral anti fungal medicine might be taken. Avoid scratching the area of breast where it is itching. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My husband has a sacrum chordoma. It has metastisized to the liver, lungs, bone and blood. Hus urine is continually dark, cloudy, foamy, and white flurry things in it. He is on hospice care and they provide him with antibiotics for 14 days. 3 or 4 days after the antibiotics are finished the symptoms repeat. They have not given us a time frame but he is pretty much bed ridden. Are these urine infections a sign his kidneys are failing?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chordomas are cancer cells that arise from rest cells which start to grow in an adult. Chordoma involves the clivus area in skull and sacral region in the lower end of spine. These are two common locations where it might occur. However rarely it might involve the rest of the spine.Since the chordoma has spread to the liver, lungs and bone, therefore he might be having advanced disease. His kidney function is to be monitored closely for any changes in function and also infection which has to be treated urgently. Cancer patients get week due to low immunity and this is the reason infection causing bacteria find it easy to attack various systems in these patients. Kidney function is studied by doing serum creatinine and blood urea levels which also gives the glomerular filtration rate. Please discuss these levels with his doctor.Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My 91 year old father was recently diagnosed with vocal chord cancer. He started radiation treatments, then after 4 treatments he got shingles. Since then he cannot keep any food or drink down. He throws everything up. He was admitted into the hospital for mild dehydration and stayed for 2 days and was just released last night . is vomiting a side effect of the cancer or the radiation? Also, any suggestions on what to do to keep food or drink in him?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Vomiting is a common side effect of cancer treatment. It is possible that he received radiation therapy to his neck region and this caused fibrosis of the thoracic part of esophagus which is located behind the vocal cord. The esophageal radiation fibrosis might cause strictures which cause discomfort in eating and drinking fluids. The patient might also have pain and difficulty in swallowing.It is suggested that an investigation like barium swallow is done to know if the food pipe has developed any stricture. Then attempts might be made to widen the stricture area and allow the passage of food and liquids. To keep him hydrated, he might be encouraged to take fluids containing proteins and electrolytes in small amounts regularly. If stricture is persistent then regular IV fluids and nasogastric tube might be required to keep him hydrated and prevent malnutrition. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My Dad had a CT scan of his abdomen yesterday and they called to tell us that it showed cancer in the bones, around the veins and in the liver. He just had his blood 'work up' a few days ago and the tests for the liver came back normal. Would the blood/enzymes come back normal if his liver had cancer? Also would a CT scan of the abdomen show bone cancer? We are very uncertain of this diagnosis ....","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, liver function tests can be normal with liver cancer. Liver is one of the largest organ of the body. So to alter it's function, there must be large damage to liver. Liver cancer in initial stage, commonly present as small heterogeneous mass. This small mass can not alter enzyme levels in blood. Slowly this cancerous mass will increase in size and start altering liver functions and at that time he will have higher enzymes in blood. And yes, CT scan of abdomen can show bone metastases. Vertebrae are most common site for bone metastases. And CT abdomen can show Vertebrae and if metastasis are present than can be seen easily. So consult oncologist and start appropriate treatment for your father. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My mother has been recently diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer following the debulking surgery. her CA 125 is 600. the surgeon performed the surgery to take out as much as possible tissue involved including both ovaries with mass,omentum but could not take the uterus out as it was adhered to the bladder. she is 54 years old and all her symptoms started very recently. it's very devastating to me and my family and we are in a big shock as we never expected this to happen to her. we dont know what to do next but we can go to any extent to cure her cancer. please help !","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your mother's situation and problem. Usually after debulking surgery, post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy are advised. During surgery, possibility of local spillage of tumour cells is high. This is due to handling of tumour mass. So to prevent local site growth radiotherapy is given. And to prevent distal hematogenous spread, chemotherapy is given. Besides these, nutritional support and pain management are also important. By all these, we can reduce her sufferings and improve quality of remaining life. Psychiatrist counselling regarding end of life issues is also important. So these are treatment options in her case. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."},{"Patient":"my mom caught a mole today that she has had for seven months. it turns out it is cancerous and she is going to the doctor tomorrow to discuss surgery to see if the cancer has spread. if she caught the mole within 7 months, what are the chances she caught it in time?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your mother's situation and problem. Yes, a mole can develop into cancer in seven moths time. Skin cancers like malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma etc can present as cancerous mole on skin. Usually prognosis is excellent if early detection and surgical removal of mole is done. So better to get done staging of this cancer. And if it is localised cancer than surgical removal with negative margins is curative. Seven months duration is sufficient for spread of tumour. If she undergone biopsy earlier than early detection was possible. So first get done staging of her cancer and than decide treatment strategy. Hope I have solved your query.

I've had to do a blood test to test if they are cancerous or not, but don't get them until tomorrow, and its driving me mad. What are my chances?  Gyno says they look like dermoid cysts.  Should I have surgery or should I try to reduce the size naturally?  Will I have kids, ever?  help please","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history, description and ultrasound findings, possibility of dermoid cyst (benign) is more. And cancerous ovarian cyst is less likely. You are also having infertility. So possibility of PCOD (poly cystic ovarian disease) is also high. PCOD is commonly associated with hormonal imbalance. And this is the cause for infertility in it. So get done blood report for hormone levels and if they are abnormal than you need hormone therapy. It will reduce the size of the cyst and improves your infertility. But if your hormone levels are normal than possibility of dermoid cyst is more. And in this case, you need to get done surgical removal. So get done blood reports and discuss about these possibilities with your gynecologist. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I had treatment for cervical cancer 8 years ago in the form of chemo and radiotherapy.  At that time surgery wasn't an option so therefore i still have my uterus intact.  Is it possible for cervical cancer to come back after this period of time and if so what would the sypmptoms be and  what are your chances of success again.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of cervical cancer recurrence is there, irrespective of surgery in the past. Means even if you had hysterectomy, recurrence can be there. Since you didn't undergo hysterectomy, chances of recurrence are higher in you. Symptoms of recurrence are foul smelling vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, bleeding per vagina, weight loss, anorexia, low grade fever etc. And regarding future treatment, you need to first get done staging of the cervical cancer. If it is localised cancer than surgical removal with post opera chemotherapy and radiotherapy are options. If it is metastatic cancer than palliative treatment in the form of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, nutritional support and pain management are the options. So if you have any of the above mentioned symptoms than consult oncologist, get done staging and star appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Although, all other reports after the operation confirms negative meaning no malignancy in the body now, I would like to take a second opinion whether it is recomended to go for radiotherapy.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, radiotherapy is advisable after surgery for uterine malignancy. During surgery, spillage of malignant cells is unavoidable. Spillage is common due to handling of tumour mass. So tumour cells are likely to present at the site of operation. And hence local site recurrence is common after tumour surgery. To avoid this recurrence, radiotherapy is given post operatively. Radiotherapy will kill the tumour cells at local site. And hence recurrence can be prevented. So it is always advisable to give post operatively chemotherapy to prevent local site recurrence. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Yes, prostate cancer if detected early and managed well, can have excellent prognosis and patient can have almost near normal life. Surgical removal of prostate (prostectomy) is needed. Prostate cancer is hormone responsive cancer. And hence testicles are also removed (orchidectomy) along with prostectomy. Post operatively patient also needs hormone therapy to avoid recurrence.

Can you help please.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your sister's situation and problem. Radiotherapy causes tissue damage, destruction and fibrosis. So pain is common symptom after radiotherapy. For lower limb swelling, following are possible causes in her case. 1. Lymphedema due to metastatic involvement of inguinal lymphnodes. Cervical cancer is known to spread in inguinal nodes. So possibility of blockage of lymph flow of lower limbs is high. And hence Lymphedema is likely cause. 2. Hypoproteinemia and anemia also cause lower limb edema. 3. Decreased urine output due to kidney involvement. 4. Deep venous thrombosis. This is rare complication of cervical cancer but can be the cause. So ask her to consult oncologist and discuss all these causes. Treatment of all these is different.

But better to do it safely and with all antiseptic precautions. Because cancer patients, who are on chemotherapy are at higher risk of skin infection due to immunosuppression by chemotherapy. So use proper aseptic solution before applying NAIR. Also wash your scalp with antiseptic solution after removal of hair. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Can u please tell me the procedure how to treat in your hospital as the patient will be coming from bangladesh..thanks...regards..billah","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Breast cancer if detected early, can have excellent prognosis with near normal life. So first thing to be done is staging of breast cancer in your patient. If patient is having stage 1-2 disease than surgical resection of tumour with enblock resection of axillary lymphnodes are needed. If patient is having stage 3-4 disease than chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and debunking surgery are the option. So in India, I advice you to consult Tata memorial cancer hospital, Bombay for management of breast cancer. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Unfortunately Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and highly aggressive skin cancer. It is a feared diagnosis and to be handled with care. You can see that your husband rapidly progressed from having a lump behind the ear to a large one in the neck and 16 lymph nodes which were malignant.The survival form the condition is low and treatment is difficult due to the aggressive proliferation of the tumor.

I am a man of 64.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, possibility of metastatic bone lesions is high in your case. Prostate cancer is known to have metastasis in bones. It gives osteoblastic secondaries. PET scan can pick up lesions only when they are more than 2-3 cms. Small metastatic lesions can not be picked up by PET scan and hence you are having negative scan. In this case MRI is more sensitive because it can pick up lesions with size less than 1 cm. But biopsy and histopathological confirmation is needed for the diagnosis of bone metastases. So my suspicion is metastatic bone lesions and hence you need to get done biopsy for confirmation. Hope I have solved your. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My father has pancreas cancer( metastatic stage).

Is this just an side effect or does it have a bigger meaning? And what can we do to stop them from swelling more?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your father's situation and problem. Chemotherapy drugs can cause renal toxicity and alter it's function. So renal damage is one possibility for his feet and hand swellings. So get done renal function test to rule out renal toxicity. Another possibility is hypoproteinemia. Pancreatic cancer causes decrease functions of pancreas gland. So absorption of protein from gut is reduced. And hence hypoproteinemia is seen. This can also cause swelling in feet and hands. So also get done serum protein levels. If this is low than he needs additional protein supplements in the form of albumin injections and high protein diet. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father.

And prognosis is even worse if brain and opposite lung is also involved by metastasis. Your husband is worsening even after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This suggest that his tumour is resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. And hence further chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not advisable. Better to keep him at home and discuss end of life issues with him. Give him nutritional and emotional support. Life expectancy in his case is less than 6-8 months. Hope I have solved your query.

This recurrence was in May 2010. I was put on the drug Femara. I am concerned about the PET scans (I'm having my 3rd one next week) and the CT scans that are periodically ordered by the oncologist. How much radiation is too much? And what steps can I take prior to these tests to best protect myself from overexposure?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. PET scan is having highest radiation exposure. CT scan is also having higher radiation but less than PET scan. Permissible PET scan exposure is once in six months. And for CT scan it and once in two months. Anything more than this will cause radiation injury. To prevent radiation injury you should follow these steps. 1. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated atleast 2-3 prior to scan. 2. Avoid Nephro toxic drugs atleast 1 week prior to scan. Dyes used in these scans can cause renal damage. So better to prevent other drugs causing renal damage. 3. Start N acetyl cysteine (NAC) 1week prior to scan and continue it for 1 week more. NAC is antioxidant in nature and helps in prevention of oxidative damage done by radiation.

Please type your query here... my patient had buccal mucosa cancer and ealrly detection done. size was 1.5 cm*0.8 cm*0.4cm depth. undergone surgery. now what we should know? weather this is a life threating ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Buccal mucosa cancer if localised and not metastatic than enblock resection with negative margins is the treatment of choice for it. So get done surgery for this. Usually post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is not needed for small size tumour. So in your patient 's case, only surgery is required. And prognosis is very good in buccal mucosa cancer. Usual life expectancy is more than 10 years. So no need to worry much for this. This is not life threatening cancer. Ask patient to avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid hard to chew food. Avoid habit of tobacco chewing if he has this habit. Start multivitamin and antioxidants tablet. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

We have consulted the major hospitals in India and he was suggested to go for a major surgery which is opening the skull and there is no guarantee for his eye . So we have been gone through most of the alternate treatments like ayurveda, siddha and chemo and nothing has worked for him. Can you please let me know if there is any possibility to cure his tumor without loosing his eye.

A surgery being possible is a curative approach. I am not sure of the position of his eyes as reports are not available but however if surgery is not done then risk to life persists.If there is risk of loss of vision in one eye then I think it is worth to take a chance with surgical treatment. This time it is suggested to have detailed discussion and also take complete treatment like chemotherapy or radiation therapy if required after the surgery. It is less likely for alternate treatment to work at this stage. I suggest that he does not waste more time in decision making and proceeds with a surgery at a good cancer hospital.

Dermovate is a topical corticosteroid which is used in the treatment of skin inflammatory conditions. The dermovate cream is much more milder than a corticosteroid injection. Creams might cause certain exacerbation however it is not seen in every patient.Taking a cream is a safer option over the injection. Injections give a high dose and might cause side effects in other places. Please use dermovate ointment and if there is any adverse event then stop and consult your doctor urgently.

So in brain cancer brain cells are growing rapidly and causing mass lesion. So the main idea behind stem cell therapy is to develop new cells in the body which replace cancer cells. Stem cells are progenitor cells, from which all cells of the body develop. So by giving stem cells, possibility of development of new cells in place of cancer cells can be expected. So this is encouraging option in cancer treatment. You need to discuss in depth about its effectiveness and cost benefit ratio with your doctor. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your brother.

I can understand your father's situation and problem. Cancer wherever in the body, produces chemical mediators called as chemokines. These are responsible for decreased appetite. Burden of these mediators is high if cancer is metastatic. Because your father is having metastatic cancer, he is having marked loss of appetite and weight loss. For his headache and confusion, loosing speech etc, possibility of brain metastasis is more. So better to get done MRI brain to rule out brain metastasis. Another possibility is electrolyte disturbance like low sodium. So also get done serum sodium level. If brain metastasis is present than radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the options. Survival rate in such type of metastatic cancer is very low, less than 1 year. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been having really sharp stomach pains since Friday, but today from 930pm to 11 they were the worse. I could barely move and if i did the pains would get worse and I felt nauseous. I ended up going to the restroom about 3 times and even got some sharp shooting pains in by buttox and under the left side of my rib cage. I am 20 years old and tend to get these kind of sharp abdominal pains, but not as bad as today. Today I was in tears and the pain is in my lower abdominal section but above my private. Can I get any recommendations if to go to the emergency room? Right now it is not bothering me as much, but my stomach still feels very sensitive and twisted. I am also not supposed to start my period until the 1st of the month, so I def. know it's not cramps. Please help.","Doctor":"IT CAN BE INFETION OF ABDOMEN OR OTHER ORGANSYOU NEED CONSULTATION DEFINATELY FROM GASTROENTEROLOGIST TO FIND THE CAUSE AND TREAT MEANTIME TAKE SHORT COURSE METRONIDAZOLE WITH ANTACIDS AND PLENTY OF FLUIDS WITH NON SPICY NON GRESY NON FATTY DIET"},{"Patient":"Hi. Recently while showering (after sitting on the pot) I noticed that there was a lump inside my buttocks, very close to where the anal opening is. It is quite hard and initially only hurt when I apply some pressure on it, but now while not very painful is noticeable throughout. I can also feel some bony or veiny structures around it. I don't think it's anal or colorectal cancer as I'm only 22, with no direct family history of cancer and show none of the symptoms, but I'm worried that it might be skin cancer or something else that's serious. I don't smoke or drink (but admittedly do have a lot of chocolate and fizzy drinks, and not much fruit except fruit juices) and I don't have beef regularly. There are no signs of bleeding and my bowel movements don't seem to be much different. I have no idea how long it's been there, but I only noticed it yesterday. Is this something that will go away or is it necessary to see a doctor (I'm currently job-seeking and am not insured). Please advise. Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of skin cancer is less likely in your case. Common symptoms of skin cancer are chronic skin ulcers, not improving with drugs, recurrent ulcers. These ulcers are usually painless and mostly on the sun exposed parts of the body like face, neck, hands, foot etc. So no need to worry for your gluteal swelling, it is not cancer. Possibility of gluteal abscess is more in your case. So better to consult doctor and get done clinical examination and ultrasound examination. You may need surgical removal of this swelling. Also check for diabetes as diabetics are common to develop gluteal abscess. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Dear sir, I have ovarian cancer detected in july and ca125 value is 12.8 then i've completed operation in july end and after 45 days ca125 value shows 8 then i have taken a 3 chemotheraphy cycle and now my ca125 value shows 18. kindly advice above steps....","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. CA 125 is tumour marker which indicates tumour activity. So it is used in patients who had surgical removal or taken chemotherapy. It is very good marker to suspect relapse or worsening of cancer. You initially had higher CA 125 levels. Than after surgery your level is decreased. This is due to decrease in tumour burden because of surgical removal. But again value raised after chemotherapy. So this indicates, worsening of underlying malignancy. So in my opinion, you should consult your cancer doctor and get done repeat CT scan to rule out worsening of underlying tumour. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am in remission from ovarian cancer(4th year). I just passed some blood tests,etc and I was asked to consult the oncologist because my Iga, Igm and Igg are under the normal level. The waiting list is from 18 to 24 months so I would really like to know if this is a serious matter. All I know of the terms is that it has to do with my immune system. So being in remission, I am of course worried and need to know what the problem is. Thank you for your time. Trudy","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, you are right. IgG, IgM and IgA are immunoglobulins of the body and help in hormonal immunity. Cancer patients are known to have low immunity. And this is even decreased due to chemotherapy. So these patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. Your lower immunoglobulins level suggest that you are at increased risk of such infections. And hence you need drugs to improve your immunoglobulin levels. This is the reason why you are asked to consult oncologist. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"This question concerns my mother in law:She is a 71 year old woman, and she is a smoker. 2 years ago, she had breast cancer, but it was cured through radiation therapy. This February she was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. She has been following chemotherapy treatment since April to October. The liquid in the bile duct has reduced, but there are still lesions on the liver, it is inflamed, and there are now lesions on the spleen. The oncologist said that a resection was out of the question, so he is trying a new drug combo of Irinotecan 180mg, Folinique Acid  400mg and Fluorouracil 400mg and 46 hours of Fluorouracil 2400mg followed by a week of rest. During all of the previous treatment, she has had very low haemoglobin and platelets. My husband and I would like to know a rough estimate as to the prognosis, as our oncologist seems to go back and forth with his answers, so we are seeking a second opinion.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your mother in law's situation and problem. Since she is having lesions in liver and spleen, she is having stage 4 cancer. And only palliative treatment in the form of chemotherapy and nutritional supplements is advisable. Life expectancy in such cases is less than 2 years. Five year survival rate is approximately 40-50%.If nutritional support is good than survival rate also improves. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Please type your query here...my husband was in ER this past Friday and had a scope put down his throat to dislodge a piece of food.  dr said the opening was the size of a straw.  and significant scarring (has acid reflux).  waiting on biopsy results.  could it be cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your husband's situation and problem. Yes, this can be due to cancer. Chronic acid reflux causes constant, persistent inflammation in esophagus. This can lead to metastatic changes in esophageal mucosa. And this causes mass like lesion with narrowing of the esophageal lumen. So his endoscopic finding like straw sized opening and fibrosis can be due to esophageal malignancy. Biopsy isn't needed for confirmation. So collect biopsy report. Also get done CT scan. This will also tell you about  size and extend of the mass if present. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

I can understand your concern. Possibility of brain cancer is very very rare in your case because of your age. Brain tumours are common in children less than 10 years and old age people more than 60 years. So at your age of 19 years, no need to worry for brain tumour.

What end stage symptoms should we expect?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your daughter's situation and problem. Diffuse B cell lymphoma is very rapidly progressive in almost all lymphnodes in the body. It causes lymphnode enlargement and obstruction in the lymphatic channel. So end stage symptoms can be bilateral lower limb lymphedema, superior vena cavalry syndrome (puffiness of face and breathlessness), weight loss, weakness, anorexia, breathlessness due to Pulmonary embolism and lung metastasis etc. Opportunistic infections are also common due to lower immunity. So tuberculosis, fungal infection etc are common in end stage of disease. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter.

I'm now taking inmuran and prednisone for mg. I still have ptosis and had hand weekness in the left hand, until the dr put me on immuran. My question is, does marijuana cause thymoma/","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The marijuana is unlikely to have caused your thymoma. However the myasthenia gravis is the cause for thymoma and 20 percent of patients with myasthenia gravis might develop thymoma after few years.Since you are having myasthenia gravis from age 15 years therefore it has taken 22 years to manifest in to thymoma. The thymus is a gland that is part of immune system in children and slowly with growth the thymus degenerates and this organ is not important. However in those with myasthenia gravis there is active auto immunity which causes the thymus to develop in to a tumor in 20 percent patients and this is called thymoma. Please follow up with your doctor and get treated. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am a inflammatory breast cancer survivor, a few months ago I had a few severe dizzy spells, and have had prolonged sinus issue..left maxillary , cheek are is numb and feels clogged.

Still feel the numbness, no drainage or other symptoms....worried about mets from my IBC cancer to nasal area....should I be concerned.   I think it has been about 3 mos since first sinus issue","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Treating breast cancer with chemotherapy is done by giving many medicines which are strong and powerful. These medicines also require steroids to be given. Many patients experience lowered immunity as a result of these medicines and subsequently might have inflammation and infection.It is possible that you have developed inflammatory sinusitis and this can be treated symptomatically with over the counter decongestants. However since you have the symptoms for 3 months therefore please get a clinical opinion from the ENT specialist and confirm any infection due to your lowered immunity which might require treatment.

Unfortunately for stage 4 cancer, the survival with chemotherapy and good care is 2 years. This can be achieved by continuing chemotherapy as recommended by the doctors.

Now she advised to undergo surgery (gullet and throat resection). Are there any other options of treatment in this situation?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Gullet cancer is called esophageal cancer and it might involve the upper, mid or lower thirds. The tumor is first assessed by endoscopy and CT scan. Radiotherapy is given to reduce tumor volume and shrink the cancer. For cancer of the upper third in the case mentioned the treatment can often be surgical excision of the cancerous part of esophagus and gastric pull through.The area involved by cancer will be surgically removed and the lower part will be pulled up to form the esophagus. This is a successful treatment but there is always risk of disease recurrence. If the tumor showed good response to radiation therapy then this is a good option.

In your wife there is a bright spot in the pectoral region therefore for it to be a cancer it should have grown aggressively over last 6 months with or without development of pain and. Most cancer appears like a lump in the chest and will be fixed to the chest wall.If it is bright on PET scan then it is not confirmed to be a cancer and biopsy is to be done to confirm it. There are other acute and chronic inflammatory conditions which might cause bright area on PET scan. PET scan is a technique by which the glucose metabolism is studied.

There is also a major lump in her breast, which was not reviewed, but the Doctor did tell her she does not have very long. My question is: What are the odds the lump in her breast (which apparently is very large) is fatal, and what effect does it have on the diagnosis of bone cancer? I have done some research online, and have found that amputation is a treatment option, however, can an entire pelvic region be worked on in this way? I can t see how you can amputate a pelvis... Lastly, the Ortho gave her an estimated time frame of 1-2 years, if that, so how accurate could that estimate be? Thank you! Abby","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The lump in the breast quickly requires a FNAC test which will give us information on the type of cells present and if they are likely a cancer. If you say there is a large lump which has grown suddenly then there is more than 50 percent chances it is a cancer. When we talk about fatality then we have to consider the stage in which a probable cancer is detected at the start of treatmentIf there is disease spread to bones then it becomes stage 4 cancer and this has a survival of 2 years with best treatment and care. If there is breast cancer and associated spread to the pelvis then amputation is not the treatment.

Prior to surgery he had six weeks chemo. The doctors told him that everything went excellent during surgery but when he went to his follow up appointment he was told that maybe the cancer spread a bit to his large intestine wall and maybe more chemo is required.

If I were your treating doctor for this case of left side pain in stomach , I would come up with these measures, these includes.1 The first possibility is of peptic ulcer disease or Hiatus hernia.

It might also help to avoid eating or drinking 2 hours before you lie down.To help control stomach acid one should not drink alcohol or  drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy  or greasy foods.Also take some antacid but if symptoms are severe you may need proton pump inhibitors.2 Tension is the next reason so , if present try to relax.3 Amenorrhea is due to lactation so  need not to worry.

There was probably malignant proliferation of cells around the baby and this made it impossible for the baby to survive. It is probably a cancer from the the cells of the baby and not relating to you.The cells of the baby had DNA material from you and your partner and therefore unlikely to be transferred to you.

If you feel that there might be a pulled muscle in the chest then it is suggested to take rest and apply ointment containing muscle relaxant over the painful region.The pain due to muscle pull will improve in 3 to 5 days and you should be feeling better after that. If the pain persists or increases then it requires clinical examination and probably investigations like X ray and echocardiography to know if there is any fluid collection in the heart or lungs.

I can understand your concern.  Your CEA level is increased further.  It may due to some growth of colon cancer.  Chemotherapy is needed according to the need.

I drank half a beer and a Shit of whiskey and later I began to feel sick. Late at night I woke up feeling I was going to throw up but instead I had a bowel movement that stung and it hurt. I felt somewhat better and went back to sleep but the same thing happened again. I had another rush to the bathroom and the same things happened. Later I threw up clear white liquid and I tried to make my self throw up more. I couldn't. So I just took gravol and tried to sleep.I didn't get out of bed today, just to go to the bathroom and get water. But it's now 9 at night andmy stomach STILL hurts. What do I do?","Doctor":"Hi,It appears that the alcohol you took has brought on an episode of gastritis. Just taking Gravol will not help. You shall need strong medicines to stop the acid production in the stomach, like proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole etc), so that acid does not further inflame the already damaged stomach lining. Antacids with cytoprotective agents like sucralfate will also help. In my opinion, you should see a doctor, as you may need certain tests and also since there may be bleeding if this condition worsens. Till you get to see a doctor, avoid hot and spicy foods and take over the counter antacids.Hope this helps you. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My father is 76 yrs old; has had 2 heart attacks when he was 62 yrs. He has hypertension and is diabetic also.

These nodules are to be confirmed whether they are secondaries or due to any other reason. If there are secondary lung nodules then it is stage 4 cancer.

Right now there are 2 tumors in one lung and malignant cells in the heart sac and in lymphnodes in both lungs. It has not traveled furthur so far as we know. Will they be able to give him more chemo with that high of liver counts? Is it normal to have such a hight GGT after 3 chemos? I appreciate your answers. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The liver function tests including GGT might get elevated after chemotherapy. It is important to know his general condition and other levels like SGPT, SGOT, Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. If the tumor has shown response then chemotherapy might be continued after a gap. Since response to chemotherapy causes the tumor to break down and release toxins in to the blood stream therefore he might experience abnormal liver enzymes.Any possibility of a secondary infection is to be ruled out and treated early. Often patients on chemotherapy might show increase in liver enzymes after 4 cycles and this guides the treatment.

As vomiting already under control so need not worry and in my opinion no need to visit an E R . If vomiting reoccurs then  consult E R. 2 Rest is very important for this little boy 1-2 days .

It usually appears with continuous fever for more than a months with weight loss that is not explained.  Patient might develop lumps that are painless in the neck, armpit or groin.Initially the patient is told to get evaluated clinical with blood test and then detailed evaluation might be required.

It will be nice if you might consult a surgeon and have a confirmed diagnosis made. A cancer is less likely if it has appered suddenly in a few days or present for months without any change in size.The surgeon might conclude a confirmed diagnosis after clinical examination or ask for a FNAC test to know if it is a particular type of swelling. Since the swelling is moving over the skin therefore it is not fixed to the deeper layers of tissue and less likely malignant.

Curability of cancer depends on the stage at which the cancer was first detected and the treatment response. From your query, it is not entirely clear about the stage at detection of the disease but it appears to be in the later stages.Regarding the metastasis to legs, I am not sure if there is deep vein thrombosis in the legs causing swollen limbs or there is any other condition directly arising from the cancer. ANother fact is the feces in her stomach, it appears that she might be having bowel related conditions due to cancer spread. Considering the above complications, it is difficult to control the disease and effects due to the cancer and she should be given pain relief and her general health should be maintained.

The stiffness of tongue along with restricted movement is always a cause of concern . In your case the most probable reason for stiffness of tongue and restricted movement id radiation therapy.When person is undergoing radiation therapy it causes dryness of mouth as a side effect which further causes stiffness of tongue . This dryness and the anemic condition as you mention in qery further make the tongue pron to infection .I would suggest you to consult your radiologist and oral pathologist for proper evaluation of the condition and rule out causes like oral thrush ans any malignancy .

You also mention in query that they are painless this also confirm that these are normal.I would suggest you to observe them if they grow in size with time or the change their color or they taste different or getting painful , then it will be cause of concern .These white bumps can be inflammation of these papillae because of infection , continues irritation or trauma  ,lie bumps ,oral thrush or cancer type of condition (rare possibility).The medicine you mention is amoxicillin which can also be the reason for tongue allergy as a side effect.

This provides disease stabilization and slows down the progress. The septic pockets might be controlled with antibiotics over a short course and then the chemotherapy and radiation therapy might be given.This cancer might not respond completely to the treatment given but survival is extended by if they control the disease process and prevent complications like spread to the brain and skull which are structures closer to the mastoid where it has caused erosion.

There can be heart abnormalities due to valve defects or electrical rhythm disturbances. Some of these might be treated with medicines and when there is severe disease then surgical treatment might be suggested depending on the cause of heart failure.3. Spinal tumor must be investigated in detail to know if that is a benign or malignant tumor and its location.

I am 67 years old, and I too have a probable lipoma (MRI 2 days ago--no answers yet) It's large, hardened and to the left of my LS spine, at waist level.  It doesn't cause pain, but does interfere with the fit of my pants. An X-ray of my LS spine revealed nothing in the area, so it's not ossified. I have a H/O spinal fusion L3-5, but that was in 2001...... Could that be a factor, 10 yrs later? I have had a lipoma in my breast (1988), and had excisional biopsy for this--no other personal or family history. I had lost 70 lbs, and am just about at normal weight.  This started to develop over a year ago--before my weight loss-- as a thick pad of soft tissue in the area, and now is definitely hardened. Any advice you can give me would be appreciated! :) Jan W.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A lipoma is a benign fat containing tumor usually found under the skin but might occur in any place.Lipomas are soft swellings that slip  under the skin when palpated with fingers. It will help to get an ultrasound scan of the area and if possible then a CT scan or MRI scan which will confirm a lipoma.If it is a slow growing swelling and soft such that it slips under skin then it is most likely a lipoma. However it will help to consult a surgeon to confirm it and then get treated if required. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"hello, inside my lower lip, at the bottom where it connects under the gums of my bottom front teeth, there are very vidid purple veins, and the general area seems to stand out as a vivid purple, plus i have a canker sore on my gums around there...should i be checking that out to clear any worries of oral cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic.

I left it alone for some time then looked at the area again & it looked like there was faint redness. As the day has progressed I've had other feelings of discomfort. My shoulder aches & has a heavy feeling. The swollen area of my underarm now has a constant achy pain with a burning sensation. Pain is also intermittently radiating into my chest. (In hindsight I noticed these discomforts were present before I noticed the swelling) For the most part it sounds like a swollen lymph node but I don't feel a knot like others seem to describe. There's no cyst-like mass; it's just swollen. I have not done anything to injure my shoulder/armpit. I do not have any apparent ingrown hairs or any itchy sensations. My father is in remission from Non-Hodgkins & his sister is getting treatment for breast cancer. In addition their parents died from cancer.

Second, i have a pituitary adenoma (tumor) and lastly one that has no name as of yet. My main concern for right now is the last one. Per a doctor at Jackson Memorial this is a rare condition that only about 500 people in the WORLD have. They are not sure what causes it or what the name is. However, the condition causes me to faint at least 4-6 times a day, EVERYDAY! When I faint, my heart stops. Usually for a second or two at the most. It makes it very difficult for me to walk at times, and to go anywhere such as school or work.  It has started to affect my motor skills by numbing my hands and legs. I become very disoriented often. I recognize people but have no idea where I am or how I got there. I have fainted twice while driving because there was no warning, no symptom or sign making me feel as if i were going to faint. I do not feel the fainting episode coming. Every specialist I have seen agrees, \\"I am in a life or death situation\\". I may need surgery apart from the treatment. I was told if I need the surgery it would probably not one, but two surgeries. One for a heart monitor and second a brain surgery. There are only three places who know how to identify this condition for what it really is and have treatment for it. Mayo clinic in Jacksonville, Mayo clinic in Rochester, or Vanderbilt University hospital in Tennessee. I am not lucky enough to have insurance so this is going to be extremely pricey. I appreciate all of the help I receive. I’m going to Jacksonville, for it is the closest to home, and i am seeking help but I’m not sure what to expect. Being that I have to pay for consultations, tests and if there’s a surgery, half of the surgery upfront,","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.I hope that you have been cured of the ovarian cancer. Right now the existing problems affecting you involve the pituitary and the heart.Pituitary as you might be aware is the master gland in the body. It regulates the functioning of other glands. A pituitary adenoma is a condition where there is a small or large tumor in the pituitary gland. This can be microadenoma if it measures less than or up to 10 mm or a macroadenoma if larger than 10 mm. The pituitary adenoma might also be functional or non functional. If you have a functional pituitary adenoma or if it is large in size and is causing symptoms like blurring of vision or headache then you require a surgery. In present days the surgery for a pituitary adenoma is done through the nose and sphenoid bone and is successful.Regarding the other rare condition you have written about, it appears that your might be a conduction problem in the heart and this can lead to heart block which is manifested as the heart stopping for a second occasionally. It is important to do electrophysiological studies on your heart and treat the condition with a pace maker if required. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi My name is abhijit and am from India.

It depends on many factors, including the type of cancer, the treatment you had, and how long it’s been since your treatment.

I also want to test preliminary cancer.  Please suggest me what type of test I will do.  what is the price of the test and inform me about the CGHS rate of the test as well.  Anju","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Priliminary test to diagnose cancer depends on type of cancer. For ovarian and uterine cancer you should go for ultrasound abdomen and ca 125 level.  Its cost is very minimal.  It takes 1500 to 2000 rs for both tests.  Consult your doctor and plan accordingly."},{"Patient":"Thanks,i had a pitutury tumor removed 6weeks ago and i am on medication of hydrocortisone,i have sometimes high blood presure which i never had before ,i donot know how to lowe don my blood presure and i get scared,i had my lad blood work everything was ok but my creatinine is 101 and tour prefernce rate is 40-95 and my Gfr is very low and is 49,please let me know what to do","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your creatinine is high and GFR is low, possibility of hypertension due to renal damage is high. Altered creatinine and GFR suggest renal (kidney) damage. And kidney is having important role in regulation of blood pressure. So kidney damage can cause high blood pressure. So better to consult kidney doctor and start appropriate treatment to reduce creatinine level. Once this is normalise, your blood pressure will also come to normal. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My sister-in-law has been told that she has a small amount of cancer in Bile Duct. She has been very itchey & a discharge ( dark in color).

I can understand your concern. Infections are very common in cancer patients because of low immunity. And they are usually drug resistant infection. So better to get done sensitivity report so that we can start appropriate, effective antibiotics. Sensitivity report should be done for isolated e coli bacteria. By this, we can prevent inappropriate antibiotics. This will fasten the recovery and prevent drug resistance. So discuss about sensitivity report with his doctor and star appropriate treatment.

She is having severe hand cramps and her finger hands (and sometime toes) cramp and cross over, looking deformed. She says its a pain level 20. Her first GI Doctor said he had no idea what it is, but I suspect it s due to related and/or new renal deficiencies. Do you know what could be causing this and if it could be severe or indicative of an emergency requiring attention?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your sister's situation and problem. ESLD (end stage liver disease) patients tend to have nutritional deficiencies. Vitamin b12, vitamin d3, hemoglobin, folic acid, vitamin b 6 etc are at lower side in such patients. And these can lead to severe musculoskeletal pain. So her cramps are mostly due to nutritional deficiency of these vitamins. Another possibility of autoimmune arthritis of small joints. She is having autoimmune Hepatitis, so this can be the reason for hand cramps. So discuss all these with her doctor and plan treatment accordingly. Hope I have solved your query.

Now I read on computer that there is such a thing as elbow cancer.  Mine is on] the left elbow ( doesn't hurt at all), but ios geting bigger and smoother every day.   What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi I did understand your concern.There is no such thing as elbow cancer , however there can be several different types of growth that can present as elbow swelling. They can be benign or malignant. It can be reactive due to soft tissue swelling.It can also be due to lymphatic removal from the mastectomy you had if the cancer was on left breast.I would recommend you to consult a doctor and if needed get a fine needle aspiration cytology or a biopsy done to see what are cells making up the swelling. Also if required the doctor may order an imaging study like an MRI of the left extremity to know from where is the lesion arising(bone,muscle,soft tissue).I HOPE THIS HELPS"},{"Patient":"I had a lumpectomy in 2012 chemo and radiation in 2013 I was put on Famara and had pain for a year in the lower legs. That pain is now gone and now is in my hands. I have recently had a burning sesation like I had when I had radiation next to my breast. Is this from the famara or could it be bone cancer","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Bone cancer is less likely in your case. Possibility of Femara induced neuropathy is more. Femara is having letrozol. Neuropathy and nerve damage is known side effect of this drug. So possibility of Femara induced neuritic pain is more in your case. So start vitamin b12 tablet because vitamin b12 is good for nerve regeneration and nerve healing. If still you are not improving then then consult doctor and get done clinical examination to rule out other causes. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

There was no sign of anything except in the uterus. The radiation oncologist I saw yesterday said I have a 9% chance of getting it back without treatment or a 2% chance with it. My surgeon said 15% without and under 10% with it. I know most physicians have no faith in alternative treatments but I do have some (although this is not a religion).","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question.

Now the surgeon wants to do a biopsy because she says the fluid is not normal.  My mother had breast cancer and my fraternal aunt died of breast cancer.  Am I doing the right thing by having the biopsy or not.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, biopsy is needed in your case. You are having strongly positive family history of breast cancer. You are also having inverted nipple with abnormal nipple discharge. All these can be early signs of breast cancer.

Recently some test has been done and his prostate is found to be 140gm. Also his PSA was 16.....I just wanted to know if this was a symptom of Prostate Cancer or this is just BPH","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Both the conditions, prostate cancer and BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) give rise to increase in prostate volume and high PSA (prostate specific antigen). To differentiate between these two conditions, detailed ultrasound report and biopsy is needed. If ultrasound is suggestive of calcification, homogenous prostate than BPH is more likely. But if ultrasound is showing absence of calcification, heterogeneity, invasion of capsule etc then possibility of cancer is more. Biopsy is confirmatory in such cases. So consult doctor and discuss all these to differentiate between cancer and BPH. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your grand father.

Doctors put him under chemotherapy with sutent and my uncle said he has no more pain in the kidney. does this mean kidney cancer cells in kidney are all gone?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your uncle 's concern. Pain in kidney cancer is mostly due to stretch of renal capsule. Tumour mass stretches capsule surrounding kidney and this causes pain. Chemotherapy causes shrinkage in tumour size. So reduction in tumour size cause less stretching of renal capsule. So pain is less. But this does not mean that tumour is cured. It is just decreased in size, so with pain. Eventually tumour will grow again and patient will have pain again. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your uncle. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have a constant abdominal pain in the upper left quadrant right under the breast bone. It never goes away. I have multiple stomach issues but there is still a problem that is undiagnosed and I believe this pain is the source. When I eat and swallow I instantly feel a sensation in that area and will experience a bad odor from my rectum. If I am on an empty stomach that same area with the pain will sound like it is weezing at times like a bronchial breach but in the abdomen. Also it gurgles exclusively in that area of the pain when I am having stomach issues. I have been diagnosed with gastristis, esophagitis and a hiatal hernia but none of these conditions have been associated with that specific abdominal pain or the odor I experience when I eat and after meals. I started a fast to see if I can give the digestive system a break and reduce symptoms. I think I may be suffering from gastroparesis after research. Other than bentyl I am not on any other medication for my stomach but I am sick all the time from it. Odor issue is one of the main concerns I am trying to rid of. It all seems to be associated with the pain in the abdomen I can apply pressure in that area and increase the odor. Is that associated with gastroparesis haven t seen anything about odor?","Doctor":"consult gastroenterologist and get lower GI endoscopy done.Exact cause can be detected by such investigations.You might be having some infection in your GI tract because increased bacterial flora is usually the reason for bad odour which require treatment with ofloxacin 400mg BD 5 days."},{"Patient":"I have this pain on lower right side of stomach,like above the beltline or kinda like under the stomach to the right.

These were no longer doing the job and his PSA started rising to 11 in June 2010. So he had a bone scan and Pelvic MRI which showed no spread. He then had 19 doses of Radiotherapy. After 6 weeks he had a PSA test which has come back at 42. This seems very high to us, is this normal. What reading should we expect after Radiotherapy","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. PSA (prostate specific antigen) is marker for prostate cancer. And it's value correlates with activity of cancer. High PSA level suggests higher tumour burden. And after radiotherapy, PSA level should be decreased. But in his case, it's value is increased. It suggests that tumour is not responding to radiotherapy. In my opinion, he should undergo PET scan to rule out local tumour size and distant metastasis. So better to consult oncologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Also your radiation treatment will be directed to the chest and left armpit and the piercings are going to be on the face. You can have the piercing done provided your blood counts are good and you do not have any infection. The piercing wounds also require to be dune under strict hygienic conditions to prevent infections and complications.For the piercing pat, please discuss with the radiation technologist and it is suggested to have removable body piercing because we never know if the material used is safe when giving radiation treatment, though in most cases it is considered to be safe.

If it IS cancer, what is the prognises - eg how long would he be expected to have left and what would we have to expect ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of cancer is high in your father's case because he is smoker and having multiple lesions in liver, lungs and spleen. So possibility of metastatic disease is more. Biopsy is must for the confirmation of cancer. So if biopsy is positive for cancer, he will be having stage 4 disease. And stage for cancer is inoperable and incurable. Palliative treatment in the form of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, pain management and nutritional support is needed.

NG tube can't be removed because of vommiting (surgery was a week ago) What is going on?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Small bowel loops run over aorta. Aorta is lying beneath bowel loops. So any malignant mass of small intestine can invade aorta. Aorta invasion is inoperable because chances of aorta rupture is high during surgery. And this condition is life threatening. So once tumour invade aorta, it becomes inoperable.

Am I prone to get cancer immedaitely and if I stop completely now, does this mean I can avoid cancer or any related illness completely?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Smoking exposes the lungs to high doses of chemicals present in smoke called carcinogens. These chemicals are derivatives of tar and fine particles get stuck to the walls of small airways. 3 to 6 cigarettes in a month is acceptable and not a serious concern for cancer but might also trigger asthma and respiratory problems in few.However some men might find cigarette smoking as a stress reliever and also get addicted to it. This addiction is bad and often people smoke a pack or more every day. By stopping smoking you can certainly avoid medical conditions affecting the lungs including asthma and cancer to some extent.

The treatment response depends on the stage of cancer and grade of cells in the cancer area. Throat cancer has slightly better prospects and extended survival in early stages. It is important to know what stage the patient is having.Radiation therapy is given to shrink the cancer tissue. After the cancer is reduced then chemotherapy is given. In stage 4 cancer the survival is up to 2 years in many patients but might be less if there is airway infiltration and spread to adjacent structures. The patient usually dies because they cannot eat and the airway is also involved. With chemotherapy attempts can be made to reduce the cancer and this also require attention to the general health of the patient to avoid nutritional deficiencies.

It is possible that your father is still having low hemoglobin and anemia because of which there is regular headache. The doctors probably intend to say that the headache is not a direct result of chemotherapy but due to hemoglobin. Since CT scan and MRI scan have shown normal findings therefore it is unlikely to be due to any bleeding or infection in the brain. However headache due to anemia might be occurring.

Cancers might occur due to many factors and it is not clear about the rat poison that was given to the person. Giving a laced drink is a crime and might have dangerous consequences. The rat poison is less likely to be traceable if the individual components are not known. A poison is a chemical substance intended to cause destruction or harm to the subject that ingests it at that particular dose.Most rat poisons might contain chemicals that if consumed then might cause serious health problems. In conclusion, it is difficult to connect the chronic rat poison laced alcohol intake and it might not be traceable. Please forget the matter and feel relaxed. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My father was treated for prostate cancer and was given radioactive seeds. The process was quite a few years ago when the seeds were new. He was grossly overdosed and is suffering with the damages of the radiation. We would like to find a doctor anywhere in the US that might help him. Where do we look and what category do we search?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You exactly need to discuss the side effects which your father is experiencing probably due to overdose of radiation. Radiation can virtually affect any organ system of the body and it will be essential to know what exactly is troubling him right now, years after taking radioactive seeds treatment for cancer of prostate.Treatment of radiation side effects is by getting attention for the particular problem that he is facing. It might be bowel related, urinary system related or spine related especially for radiation given to prostate.

Should she take these 4 cycles of chemotherapy again, coz she is not in a condition to cope with any more cycles now?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a challenging condition and difficult to treat. In early stages, surgery is recommended with additional chemotherapy and radiation therapy after staging of disease. It is possible that the doctor initially wanted to give 4 cycles and observe. Continuation of treatment depends response to initial treatment and then dose is also modified as per requirement.Saying whether she is medically fit or not is evaluated by the treatment team. It is possible that she might be feeling weak due to chemotherapy and this is observed in many patients. Her blood counts and liver function tests are important. It is possible that complete control over the cancer might be achieved through aggressive chemotherapy and that is what is planned for her. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am 20years old, I had a germs cells tumor since January,2009.I have loss my only right testis due to cancer affected, I  have done my chemotherapy and my blood tests(AFP,BHCG) is also normal but i am facing a big problem that my moustache is less and very light that cant be seen and a little beard hair on chin  .So please doctor tell me how can i get thick and big beard and moustaches.any medicines suggest me i shall be very thankful to you for this act.   Waiting for your best reply","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since you had germ cell tumor some time back, it is possible that thin hair is due to the side effect of cancer treatment. Usually hair related problems due to cancer are temporary and there is return of complete hair growth within a year after cessation of treatment. You will also have a good regrowth in the coming months.If you feel that the growth is taking too long then please visit a dermatologist and take prescription of minoxidil topical solution. Please make sure that any other medicine that you are taking does not interact with this solution. This is applied over the areas of hair thinning in small amount to cause growth of thick hair. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I undergo fnac ,It shows good cellurlarity showing many groups, clusters and sheets of follicular cells most of which show degenerative cytoplasm and small round to oval nuclei. Many scattred bare nuclei are seen. Many hemosiderin laen macrophages are seen. Few scattered hurthle cells are seen. abundant colloid is seen in slightly  a haemorrhagic background. i am worried. please tell me is it thyroid cancer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The above findings of thyroid FNAC show that there are small groups of cells which are scattered with scanty cytoplasm. There is good cellularity and no observation of irregular cells or mitotic activity. Mitotic activity is cell division and when there is any cancer the cells divide rapidly and in disorderly. This is not seen in your case. Therefore most likely this is not a cancer.There is also mention about a hemorrhagic background. This is due to blood components and usually a technical observation. If required, your doctors might consider an excision biopsy depending on the size of the thyroid swelling and any associated symptoms. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc, for the past 3 weeks i had a burning sensation in my stomach just above the naval.

I am a non alcoholic nor smoker. Presently, taking Pentodac and digene gel.","Doctor":"Well you are taking the meds which will help relieve the burning sensation and also you have taken a good step to stop taking spices.

I have high risk HPV with mild dysplasia & I'm having follow pap smears to avoid cervical cancer. But I know that hpv can aslo cause anal cancer & we don't have anal pap smears in my country. Am I at risk of getting anal cancer? How can I prevent it? (I've been married & faithfull for 17 years & we never have anal sex & I don't smoke)","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You do not come under high risk group for HPV associated anal cancer. However you are doing the right action by getting regularly checked up for possible early cervical cancer. Pap smear done regularly is beneficial as you are having high risk HPV with mild dysplasia.Regarding the anal cancer, it is only a probability and this pattern is seen in those women who have had cervical cancer. Since cervical cancer features have not yet manifested in you therefore you might relax about anal cancer occurring due to human papilloma virus infection.

But I know also that HPV can cause anal & oral cancers & there are no follow up tests for these in my country. I've been with y husband for 17 years & faithfull & we don't have anal or oral sex? Is there anything else I can do to prevent these cancers? How big is the possibility to get them because of HPV 16?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.HPV infection is common in women. It might happen even in those with a single partner though multiple partners increase the chances of infection. Prevention of cancer is best by getting screening tests done and recognizing symptoms.If you have HPV 16 infection then getting annual pap smear is recommended and I hope you are doing it regularly especially because of mild dysplasia in cervix. The possibility is small and not something that should be disturbing your piece of mind. Oral, vaginal, vulval and anal cancers are seen apart from cancer cervix which is the commonest condition among cancers present in women with HPV infection. Please take note of any oral or anal symptoms like non healing ulcers, wounds in oral cavity and skin tags in the anal region. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My dear friend has 4th stage cancer of the liver, bone, and lung, and she is very afraid, and as I am a believer in God and she is not, she is not happy to have a relationship with me at this point.

What can I do that is realistic and kind as well as loving?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer is a difficult condition to treat if it is in later stages. Your friend unfortunately has stage 4 cancer and it has spread to liver, bone and lung. Fear is a natural response in any person who is fighting cancer and under physical pain and mental stress. It is difficult to put oneself in her shoes and not to be afraid of the course of disease and pain.You can silently make a stronger bond with her and make her forget the disease and preoccupy her mind with other thoughts. Right now she requires love and care apart from pain relief. Please accept her emotional disagreements and try and do something which will make her feel valued and happy.

Please type your query here...my father was diagnosed in the last week or so with a Klatskins tumor.  After the lab report came back it said \\"negative for malignant cells\\".  He was jaunticed and that's why we sought help.  Malignancy was suspected in the doctors report prior to the procedure to place a stent.  Stent seems to be working for now.  My dad is 92.  we think the doctors worked on the premise that it was malignant during his hospital stay and we were even talked to about Hospice services, etc.  we know a tumor is not good and our doctor reminded us that the biopsy takes only a tiny sample of tissue and that there could be cancer somewhere in the bilary duct.  do we have reason to worry in the immediate future.  Is the diagnosis of negative for malignant cells \\"good news\\" or is this still a serious thing where the stent could obstruct again, etc.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Klatskins tumor is a tumor in the region where both the right and left ducts join to form the common hepatic duct. There are many reasons for the luminal occlusion at the formation of common hepatic duct including  benign fibrosing cholangitis. Since no malignant cells were found therefore the possibility of benign fibrosing cholangitis might also be considered if the biopsy from the tumor area is non malignant.The main problems affecting liver function is biliary drainage. The stent has to be kept open and any bile obstruction treated on time. At 92 years, the possibility of doing a surgery is under risk and most of the manipulations might be done with minimally invasive techniques. Negative for malignant cells is a good news but stress should be on regular follow up and clearing any biliary obstruction.

A minor salivary gland cancer requires treatment as per protocol. The radiation therapy was given to shrink the tumor mass and reduce it in size. Since these cancers might be slow growing as compared to other aggressive cancers, it is treated such that the chances of recurrence is less. The details and staging of minor salivary gland cancer in  your mother is not mentioned and therefore it is possible that the treating doctor wants to reduce the tumor with radiotherapy.Since she is having pain in her inner mouth, it will help to get the oral cavity examined in detail to look for any post radiotherapy residual changes which are causing the symptoms. Some patients might develop mild dental infections after radiation therapy and this is treated with antibiotics should there be infection and pain relievers.

I recently  read that  'Imitinef Mercilet' is a cure for Blood Cancer and it is available at Adayar Cancer Institute, Chennai, India.  Is it correct?  The name of the medicine is :'Imitinef Mercilet'","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since your husband is diagnosed with AML which is a type of blood cancer, chemotherapy is one of the best solutions for him. Midostaurin is a promising medicine and is under multiple research and treatment trials. If your husband is getting this medicine then let him continue taking it under the recommendation of his doctor. It is considered effective for a type of cancer called systemic mastocytosis.The promotion of imitinef mercilet in some sections of media is misrepresented. Just like midostaurin,  imitinef mercilet is the name of another medicine which was in trials some time back. This medicine was not totally curative for all blood cancers but under research for certain blood cancer types. Unfortunately due to public ignorance, this was made in to a news report and mail and circulated among unintended sections of society. It is important not to get misled by such details.

It is influenced by sun exposure and appears as a painless nodule in the skin. If there are lymph nodes involved then it is stage 3 cancer. Since the reports have come as inoperable, surgery might not be the best treatment of choice for him at present.Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are two important strategies that might have to be planned by his doctor and given in a regulated manner. Radiation will limit the aggressiveness of the cancer and reduce tumor size. The chemotherapy will destroy the cancer cells.

My doctor has started me on some tablets for the reflux and I am booked in to have an endoscopy done to check there is nothing going on bowel wise. I am worried though as I read that pelvic pain, irregular periods and diarrohea can be a sign of ovarian cancer. I had a abdominal ultrasound done twelve weeks ago and they checked both ovaries and found a small cyst on one. does this rule out cancer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If there was a small cyst which was less than 3 cm in size in your ovary then it is unlikely to be a cancer. Cancers are usually found in cysts measuring 5 cm or more and with septations. As you have mentioned the presence of a small cyst, it is likely to be a simple cyst in the ovary and not a cancer. If the cyst size is greater than 3 cm then please get a blood test done to measure CA 125 levels.Irregular periods might be associated with your hormonal imbalances which might also be the reason for your cyst in the ovary. Diarrhea is not connected with irregular periods or the ovarian cyst in your case. Please get your endoscopy done for diarrhea and it might tell if there are any changes that are causing the diarrhea. Most diarrhea is caused by benign conditions and you need not worry about cancer. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"..I've had a history of cancer, and had to have a hysterectomy last year.  AndI'mhaving pains again.  I still have my ovaries.  Went for my annual today and the dr. took a urine sample.  what is the urine sample for?  And do they test fordrugs in your urine?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Little pain and discomfort is experienced by many patients after getting a hysterectomy done. Sometimes scar tissue forms in the area of surgery and that will cause pinching of nerves leading to pain. Pain in the pelvis can also be caused due to infections. The urine sample was taken to test for any infections in urine and other routine elements.Usually drugs are not tested for in a routine urine examination. You will be told if such a sample was taken specifically for urine drug level estimation. If you have not been told about it then your urine will not be tested for presence of drugs in your urine sample.

Cancer patients who are taking chemotherapy have a low immunity and they are prone to developing infections which normal people will not get. Even some of the normal bacteria and fungus present in you might cause serious infection to those having cancer.Transmission of infection from a dying patient through air never happens. Most infections are transmitted by touch and therefore, to minimize the infection transmission rate from you to the patient and other patients, wearing a gloves was considered important.

Generalized weakness might be due to malnutrition and combined vitamin and mineral deficiency.His general condition requires to be improved and this can be done by providing him minimum daily nutritional and fluid requirements.

There are some which are aggressive and few that are slowly progressive. By definition, a cancer is an uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. Some cancers respond well to surgery in the early stages. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy also help.After getting MRI, CT scan and bone scan, it is important to get the FNAC and biopsy reports before you start treatment. This is the basis of a confirmatory diagnosis of the bone cancer and its cell type. CT and MRI scan will tell the extent and involvement of adjacent structures. Bone scan will tell if there is tumor spread to other parts of the body and if the cancer is involving more than one bone.Please discuss the biopsy report and MRI findings and then start treatment as suggested by her doctor. Giving the patient adequate nutrition is important to better treatment response.

Kidneys are important organs and no one will survive with both kidneys knocked off. It is possible that the kidneys were partially operated in your husband and the tumor part has been excised.Please have an open discussion with your husband and discuss his medical reports with due respect to his privacy.
