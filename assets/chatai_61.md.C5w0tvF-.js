Symptoms I have experienced in the last month or 6 weeks are: leg cramps at night, one instance of heart irregular beat followed by sinking feeling then it corrected itself. one morning upon rising from bed my right leg had no feeling, it was as if I only had one leg. No pain associated with this incident.","Doctor":"Hi welcom to HCMI have gone thru your query and can understand your concern .For your info Potassium is specifically important to your nerves and muscles. All your muscles need potassium, including your heart  but if the level of potassium is elevated in your body , many symptoms show up leading to certain diseases .Elevated potassium levels is a matter of concern and immediate medical attention needs to be sought. However there are certain things one can try at home to naturally lower the potassium levels .Potassium is an important mineral which along with other minerals plays a crucial role in aiding muscular contractions and digestion. . Alteration in the normal levels of potassium can result in several complications. High potassium level in our body can be associated with detrimental impact on the health of an individual.If you get leg cramps, numbness frequently, especially nocturnal leg cramps it could be due to an electrolyte imbalance. Low potassium levels .It is necessary to maintain normal potassium levels in blood.In a healthy state, the body keeps an efficient balance of all the required electrolytes, potassium is one of them .Potassium is chiefly excreted from the kidney, but due to low kidney potential, potassium built up increases in the blood which may result in elevated levels  in the blood.Increase the intake of calcium rich foods like Milk, dairy products, yogurt, and cheese. Include them regularly in your diet can help control the potassium levels in the blood.Eat a clove of garlic in the morning and one in the evening, with a glass of milk. It interferes with potassium absorption and ultimately helps to lower potassium level in blood.Drink sufficient water. Water helps in flushing out toxins and excess of potassium. However for individuals suffering from kidney disorders, it is crucial to consult your physician before increasing the uptake of water. Excessive consumption of water in individuals with kidney disorders can result in strain on the kidney which can complicate matters. As our body works as a unit , all factors are related to each other . And main cause for all problems  is  our weakened Immune system .To strengthen immunity & achieve over all health  we need to take proper balanced diet and avoid intake of  fried fast foods tea , coffee and colas. Stop drinking alcohol  & smoking . This will benefit to lower potassium in the body.Limit foods which are rich source of potassium, they include; bananas, potatoes, peas, Lima, papaya, yams, avocado etc.Eat fruits and vegetables having low potassium such as; cucumbers, cauliflower, berries, lettuce, lemon, peaches, canned food, etc. These foods are low in potassium. Vitamin C  & D also supports healthy blood circulation.Soy milk and tofu is also helpful, as it is low in potassium.Exercise regularly ,yoga ,pranayam -deep breathing , Kapalbhatti , Aganisar help proper blood circulation & it helps to lower the potassium level in a natural way. A brisk walk of thirty minutes daily or aerobics and other mild exercises improves overall health strengthening immune system and also lowers the raised potassium level.These natural ways are just complementary home remedies and they are not substitute for treatment recommended by the doctor .Keep a regular follow up with your doctor when you are taking blood pressure medications and diuretics.Hope this helps you solve your query .Take care all the best Don't hesitate to get back if have any further query ."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

There are some rare exceptions to this rule. If the core antibody (anti-HBc) is negative then there are two possibilities. (1) there is an infection that has not yet led to increased antibodies against core antigens(2) there is no infection and HBsAg is reactive because of other antigens that cause cross-reactivity.The second is the most likely scenario unless your daughter had symptoms as well. In any case a repeat and more complete testing for hepatitis is warranted.So, besides HBsAg and anti-HBc, also please include the tests:- HBeAg- antiHBe- anti-HBs- liver function testsDoing them in a couple of weeks would be appropriate unless she has symptoms.If she does, then she'll need to contact an infectious diseases or hepatology specialist to receive treatment.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, you can contact me again.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Otherwise, I would also go for an ultrasound of your abdomen to rule out any intra abdominal pathology.

I m seeking disability because of my reoccurring tendency to clot.My docter hasn t let me work or drive for a year and I have never received benefits. I want to go back to work, is a blood clotting disorder a disability? I understand if I don t maintain my diet and INR checks I could clot again.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM. It's unfortunate that you have been suffering from clotting disorder. Yes. That's true that you should avoid prolong driving or air travel to prevent recurrent thrombosis, but if you maintain your INR between 2-3 then there is less chances of getting again clotting in lungs or veins. So, my advice to you is - You can now start driving for few distance and should also start to work as prolong rest also precipitates clotting. But you have to take anticoagulant medicines for whole life. It's true that if you don't make restrictions in diet and not maintaining INR then you have again chances of clotting but if you maintain proper INR  and avoid prolong sitting you will be safe. So, be careful  and gradually start your work again. Best of luck for future life.

All the other results came back normal (ie: iron, b12, frolic acid, liver enzymes ECG and everything else under the sun)! If I stop consuming alcohol on a daily basis will it bring down my MCV count and if so how long does it take to bring it down to a normal level? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello,you should compare this MCV (103) with older measurements. If you values were lower in the past then your implied high alcohol consumption may cause it, although this is usually attributed to malnutrition in alcoholic patients, that is reduced consumption of folic acid and B12 vitamin.Increased MCV may also be found in various hematologic conditions including the myelodyspastic syndrome (MDS). The comparison will answer the question whether investigation is needed or not.If you've always had a value around 103 then no further investigation would be warranted.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, please let me know.

It rarely happens in allergic reactions.Low potassium levels may cause weakness and very low levels may cause rhabdomyolysis (which is muscle destruction).

Is this serious enough to go to the doctor? even though my ultra sound was fine and im having no problems urinating.","Doctor":"Hello,you haven't provided enough details so that I would have a complete picture of your situation, particularly the values of your lab tests. Creatinine elevations can be attributed to very many potential causes. A common - and reversible - one is dehydration. This is accompanied by high urea levels (more than x20 the value of creatinine). Other common potential cause is the use of drugs. Drugs may cause renal injury. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause renal injury and are commonly used after surgical operations to relieve pain.Any of these conditions and most of the other potential causes of elevated creatinine do not cause kidney pain.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, please let me know.

What can help her stay awake? And what can stop the bleeding?","Doctor":"Hello,your friend needs immediate medical attention. Sometimes faintness may be caused by looking at a bleeding site. Although this is most probably her case I can't exclude the possibility of a really deep cut that has hurt a big vein or artery causing significant blood loss.Applying constant pressure on the bleeding site will either stop or reduce blood loss. Lying down might help her feel better.She should get help though because if she passes out she would not be able to apply pressure and the blood loss might be continued.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, please let me know.

Potassium replacement that fails to raise potassium levels is a finding commonly encountered when low magnesium levels coexist. She needs a magnesium measurement and potential replacement. The intravenous is the most efficient way to rapidly replenish potassium losses. If she's capable of taking drugs by mouth then she could also take potassium orally.The most important thing though is to treat the initial problem that caused the low potassium levels.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, please let me know.

Neal Gilbert Centennial, CO","Doctor":"Hello,The normal number of WBC in the blood is 4,500-10,000 white blood cells/mcL.   These cells play an important role in the immune system by identifying and destroying pathogens ( like viruses, bacteria, or fungi). We  have five major types of white blood cells: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes (T cells and B cells), monocytes, neutrophils. A high white blood cell count may indicates:-infection ( like You have),-inflammatory disease ( like rheumatoid arthritis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)- leukemia- smoking- stress- allergy, etc.Please note that drugs may also increase WBC counts. These are: corticosteroids, heparin or beta adrenergic agonists.   In my opinion there is no need to worry about your WBC count. 18.6 is high but as you wrote you have bacteremia so this indicate the cause of your high white blood cells count.

If you can't recall any possible inflammation (including teeth problems, inflammatory papules etc) then it could be even a subclinical viral illness. Rheumatoid arthritis also causes a CRP level elevation but this is not specific or diagnostic. Such a slight elevation is not clinically that important most of the times.SGOT elevation has to do with muscle problems (including the heart muscle) and injuries but it's not that specific either. Have you checked for high creatinine phosphokinase? This is a muscle enzyme that increases in muscle inflammation or destruction.

The usual treatment starts with a low molecular weight heparin like enoxaparin (lovenox) and continues with a coumarin-drug which raises INR to protective levels. Blood thinners help to stop ongoing thrombosis but they don't affect the already formed clots. This is very important because an expanding clot can detach from the vessel wall and occlude pulmonary vessels causing life threatening conditions.

Any body suffering of this from your family ,far or near  ?Spherocytosis is a hereditary condition caused by genes inherited from the parent. A less common digestive tract disorder is obstruction of the intestine, which causes vomiting because food and fluids back up into the stomach . because of the obstruction   due to liver disorder and presence of  toxins in our system  due to indigesion , constipation , lack of  sleep , lack of  activity level  and lack of proper nutrition , resulting weakened immunity . most probably your syptoms are suggesting  the doubt of being Jaundice  .And Jaundice is not a disease but rather a sign that can occur in many different diseases. The liver organ is considered a fire or pitta organ in Naturopathy / Ayurveda. Good health of the liver requires the balance of the pitta dosha . If the liver is overloaded with toxins it will burn too hot and become inflamed causing problems throughout the body. The imbalance is treated with a combination of dietary and lifestyle changes as well as herbal remedies to increase immunity .  Jaundice is the yellowish staining of the skin and sclera (the whites of the eyes) that is caused by high levels in blood of the chemical bilirubin. The colour of the skin and sclera vary depending on the level of bilirubin. When the bilirubin level is mildly elevated, they are yellowish. When the bilirubin level is high, they tend to be brown.Some how and somewhere your digestion system is responsible for all symptoms you are facing presently .Try to remove the cause ,health will automatically follow you  .. In fact,Your body is always fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin,your kidneys or sometimes your whole body .Your immune system is your defense against invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak, the disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowers .Here you have to work to strengthen your immune system by following a certainregimen --Your total health depends on 'what we eat ,when we eat and how we eat '.I would like to suggest you to follow regimen as below to take balanced diet containing all essential nutrients , fiber ,vitamins , minerals in natural form -fruit veges ginger ,garlic ,nuts  fish oil , & flax seeds for Omega 3 All antioxidants help restoring health by killing disease cells on mass basis  .Prepare soup from vegetables like carrot, cucumber, spinach etc. and consume daily.Drink  1/2 a cup of bitter gourd juice 30 ml  daily.Consume aloe Vera juice 30 ml mixed with Amla juice 1 spoon every morning for atleast 15 days for better result .Lemon juice with water with black pepper before meals twice , for atleast 15 days Take Turmeric powder a level teaspoon+ Almond oil is very important  antioxidant for our sound mental and physical health and strengthen immune response naturally  with BF and & at bed time Have this at least for 20 days .

I have had this severe itching problem for about 20 years...from upper arms down to hands on the topside.  I was diagnosed with hemachromatosis about 10 years ago.  The itching has moved up my arms as the years go by and is almost unbearable at times.  At times, the only relief is cold/ice packs.  I have been to dermatolotists and have had ointments/creams prescribed that help very very little.  The only suspected diagnosis I have been given is an allergic reaction to the sun.  My arms stay red almost all the time in the area of itching even when it isn't itching.  Tho...I can feel a stinging sensation almost all the time.   The itching is not a normal itching...it is more a horrible stinging/itching sensation that can sometimes leave bumps and sores.  I am desperate for relief!!!!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Hemochromatosis affecting the liver can cause itching.2. Liver biopsy or biochemical investigation of bilirubin levels can be helpful.3. For itching antihistamines can be taken. Avoid scratching, as it will start a cycle releasing chemicals at site of scratching and further increase itching.4. Sun exposure is also known to increase itching secondary to dehydration. Apply good amount of moisturizers. Get the tests done for further evaluation.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"I am diabetic, and yesterday I had a dizzy spell and after felt a little woozy, This morning I woke up with stiffness in my neck, leading from the top to the bottom right side where the neck and back meet.

After a few days it goes. Any idea? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCMI have gone thru query regarding pain and bulging of veins on wrist .Bulging veins in the hands and wrists are often associated with aging, being thin  and well hydrated. When the arms are down the blood in your veins have to work against gravity to return to the heart. Subcutaneous fat naturally atrophies over time. Think of the difference between the cheeks of a baby and a 90 year old man. These make veins which are normally occurring in the hand more visible. When you raise your arms the blood flows with gravity to move more quickly toward the heart. Unlike the arteries which pulse blood, the movement of blood in the veins is more passive.Bulging veins may signify poor venous drainage from your hand, and this could be due to a variety of reasons, including blood clots, thoracic outlet syndromeIf the level of potassium in your blood drops below normal, it may cause low energy, leg cramps, and more.The most common causes of varicose veins are age, and gender -- they are more common in women -- being overweight or pregnant and poor circulation, Varicose veins are enlarged veins that are usually dark blue or purple and tend to have a lumpy appearance. While not usually dangerous, they can cause discomfort and there are some theories that they can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome Hand exercises may help reduce the appearance of varicose veins and ease the tenderness and possible nerve pressure associated with them.Stretching your wrists and fingers is particularly useful for reducing stiffness and improving circulation. When performing hand exercises for varicose veins or carpal tunnel, don't force the movements -- this can aggravate your conditionMassaging your hands regularly throughout the day may also help drain pooled blood away from varicose veins.Aong with exercise and massage , intake of  healthy, low-salt  nutritious diet to further reduce strain on your veins .   . But if pain and swelling last longer than a few days or become worse, see your doctor.

I can understand your concern  .Actually , The symtoms of your daughter ,discoloration on toe nails and muscle spasms when suffering from anemia are natural . RBCs transport oxygen throughout the body as Anemia is a condition where the number of healthy red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood is lower than normal. , so a shortage of these cells can be serious and can cause all the symptoms  .Anemia is not an actual disease - it's a condition that's caused by some other problem. There are  basic ways you can develop anemia:Stress, worryMost common cause of anemia is blood loss .Lack of nutritionDiseases like These polyps can cause bleeding between periods as well as heavier flow .causing anemiaInsufficient absorbable iron in the diet is the most common cause of iron deficiency. The body needs iron to make hemoglobin, a protein on RBCs that carries the oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hemoglobin also gives blood its red colour. In addition to lack of iron, there tends to be a lack of vitamin B12 and folic acid in the diet as well.Vitamin B12, vitamin C, and folic acid are all crucial to RBC production, and a deficiency in any one of these vitamins puts you at risk for anemia. Good sources of vitamin B12 include beef and fish. Vegetables don't contain this vitamin, so if you don't eat meat, fish, or dairy products, you'll need to take vitamin B12 supplements. Sources of folic acid include spinach, green peas, oranges, and cantaloupe.For your info our body acts as a  unit .If one part gets diseased the whole bodyis affected . So you have to treat the body as a whole so that you don't fall sick Dear in fact,Your body is always fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin, or sometimes your whole body. Your immune system is your defense against invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak, the disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowersSo you should not ignore other possibilities , that can be constipation , mental stress , worry , anger . All affect our health badly .So regular exercise and Balanced diet containing essential nutrients as fiber , fruit green veges vitamins and minerals in natural form - coconut water ,lemon juice with water nuts , almonds , and supplements full of antioxidants as Aloe vera juice + Amla juice 2 spoons , A level spoon Turmeric powder + Almond oil is very important for our sound mental and physical health and strengthen immune response naturally For proper blood circulation. exercise ,yoga ,  Kapalbhatti pranayam -deep breathing ,Anulom Vilom , Bhramari are help ful for soothing nerves inducing sleep and eliminating toxins from our body and help  the natural hormones work, and causes the bone marrow to produce more RBCs leading towards healthy life  . Make sure that you get enough sleep every night. Meditation also helps sooth the mind helps in detoxifying and strengthening the immune system to enhance resistance from diseases and pave way for healthy disease free life .Take Homeopathic  Ferrum Phos 6 & Calcarea Phos  6 / alternately  / 2 times each  .

Taking 1/2 of a 37.5 mg tablet of HCTZ daily for a mild diuretic.  White blood cell count is 3 to 3.8, variable. Been that way for 3 or 4 years.  The rest of the hemogram is normal.

Eating healthy diet, low in fat, lots of veggies and fruit.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Diuretics do not affect WBC count.2. If there is no infection, not to worry about WBC count. Its only lower limit of normal. 3. Hypothyroidism, can cause low WBC count. Once corrected, it should have improved. It would have also caused anemia and low platelet count.4. Take vit B12 and folic acid supplements, it will help in improvement. Not to worry about WBC count, its still good.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"age 40 yr 5\\"2  weight 62 kg I have iron deficiency due to heavy bleeding due to adenomyoma. dr. prescribed me tab registrone for six months. before treatment my platellet count is 160000. after treatment my platelet count is 100000. it decreased due to registrone ?","Doctor":"Welcome to H.C.M.

Physical stress, psychological stress, or infections caused by bacteria or viruses can cause flares (worsening) of psoriasis symptoms. Certain medications also can worsen psoriasis symptoms, including beta blockers (eg, propranolol), lithium, and antimalarial drugs (eg, hydroxychloroquine, Plaquenil)Doctors believe that psoriasis is caused by abnormalities in the immune system, enzymes, and other factors that regulate skin cell division.Part of the process involves an abnormal immune response, which causes inflammation and rapid production of immature skin cells.Genes play a role in the development of psoriasis. Researchers have discovered that a variation in a group of genes known as LCE can protect against the condition. One of these genes codes for proteins that help maintain the skin's barrier.\`Human monoclonal antibodies bind to proteins or cells and stimulate the immune system to destroy those cells.Your immune system is your defense against invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak, the disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowersSo you should not ignore other possibilities , that can be constipation , mental stress , worry , anger .

The third time I did it, I passed out because I didn't eat anything before I donated. This last time there were complications. I found out first year students were sticking me with a needle after they tore up my vein. Apparently I wasn't bleeding fast enough and I guessed it was because I was cold or they might have missed the vein. I had never had problems before this. My blood clotted this time in the bag and I was told I couldn't give. Now I have a softball sized bruise and a golfball sized mass under my skin near the puncture site. I'm concerned about what it is. I've been told it could b a clott that will dissolve and I've also been told it could he an air bubble. It only hurts if a lot of pressure is put on it but the bruising and such makes me look like I shoot up and I scoop ice cream for a living currently and that scares customers. Please tell me what this mass is. I've had it for a little over a week since the donation","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Blood clot formation after blood donation is normal. Sometimes, bleeding can occur into internal tissues due to excessive trauma or vein being missed during phlebotomy could cause this.2. This hematoma would take around 2-3 weeks to disappear. Not to worry.3. Its not a air bubble, as air would have got absorbed by now. Its clotted blood or hematoma.

You have been transferred blood, because your haemoglobin was low.2. Blood transfusion alone would not correct the haemoglobin to normal levels. You would still have low haemoglobin levels, which will cause shortness of breath, fatigue and rapid heart rate.3. You need to avoid excessive strain till your haemoglobin returns to normal levels.

Mean platelet volume is a measurement of average size of platelets.2. Abnormally low MPV can be seen in thrombocytopenia, as production is impaired.3. In immune destruction of platelets, it will increased due to presence of giant platelets. Absence of giant platelets could indicate better prognosis.4.

This may be completely irrelevant but last month unfortunately I went through an abortion and I m just wondering if this could be related to the pain and if not what else may be causing it?","Doctor":"Hi.After carefully reading the history you have provided , your problem looks to be severe costo-chondritis of the lower ribs. The abdominal muscles start from this area so the edema and resultant pain travels to the abdominal area too. The exertion during the sex can instigate the edema and the pain.  be specifically see for the painful- tender area. This will confirm the diagnosis. I would suggest the following treatment.-Rest to the area by means of strapping with the Adhesive tapes during the deep Expiration phase. This will limit the movement, reduce the pain and give rest for healing to occur.-Anti-inflammatory medicines in full dose as per the weight.-Steroids if required for its strong anti-inflammatory role.-Lasix to reduced the edema.This sort of a treatment helps all my patients. and should help you too."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with diabetes after one A1C of 6.6 and put on low dose metformin, then half of lowest dose and now no meds. The A1C went to 5.8 and has stayed there. My egfr ranges from 47-49. I never see a phosphorous result on my labs, but everything else falls in range except low hematocrit and rbc and high mch. Do I need to modify my diet and what does this mean for my prognosis.","Doctor":"Hello,you haven't mentioned you hematocrit or the rest of the complete blood count results. It's hard to give specific advice without knowing the facts. Also please note that the A1c result is credible only when the hematocrit is within normal range. Your eGFR corresponds to stage 3 chronic kidney disease. At this stage, it's likely that no symptom is evident. 5% of stage 3 patients do have anemia, although it's far more common in stages 4 or 5.Your MCH is not helping either, without the rest of the results. If you do have a high MCH then a macrocytic anemia is possible. Since you were using metformin, you should probably check your vitamin B12, which is a common cause of anemia in patients with diabetes. I could be more accurate if I had the results.If you're on a healthy diet then you don't need to do anything about it. If not, then the following general advice would be appropriate. Red meat: once in 7-10 days. Poultry: 3 times/week. Vegetables, salads: every day. Fish: at least 2/week. Don't forget legumes. Avoid sweats and fatty food. If you drink, avoid drinking more than a glass of wine (or two) per day.I can't speak about your prognosis because you haven't shared the details about your medical history except diabetes. If you'd like more specific information, please ask again but provide the details.Useful details would include:- complete medical history, including diseases and treatments- more information about your kidney problem- information about your diet- test results (complete blood count, vitamin B12, folic acid, ferritin levels)I hope I've helped!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"hi my urie test show that my RBC is 10-15Hps this blod in my urine is ocurance and my doctor told me that it it prostitis after undergoing a cestoscopy. he gave me antibiotics bud after 40 days taking antiabiotics my urine test show always RBC is 10-15hps.","Doctor":"Hello,some red blood cells in patients with enlargement of the prostate can be expected.

All my levels went back to normal.   They dismissed Wegener's.   In the interim, I have moved to Florida, and am still having severe nasal crusting.   I literally have to pull out the crusts with a hemostat.   I do my nasal rinses religiously but it goes on and on.   And I still get infections.  Do you have any idea what is wrong with me?  I would really appreciate some input here.   Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,Wagener's granulomatis isan autoimmune disorder which is characterised by presence of auto-antibodies in the blood.The diseases affects the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract and kidneys also.Septal perforation is also a complication of this disorder.The disease has a progressive course and it has to be managed conservatively.The nasal septum perforation has to be managed by procedures like button insertion, etc.In case there is infection, it has to be managed with antibiotics.The disease can be controlled by immunsuppressants.Thus, you need to stay in touch with your treating doctor.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I have had hemolytic anemia for two years now.

Thanks - Celine Quintanilla","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,The course, treatment and management of any hemolytic anemia depends on the cause of hemolytic anemia.There are many causes of hemolytic anemia like disorders of RBC membrane, enzyme disorders, hemoglobinopathies etc.Thus, whether hemolytic anemia will recur or not depends on the cause of hemolytic anemia, its course, clinical state after treatment etc.Thus, you need to consult your hematologist for assessment and further management.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"My mother is suffering fro AML but subtype is not clear .

I take clexane for six months and now my doctors needs to put me on oral anticoaglants. Please tell which is the most adecvate one, because on sintrom my thrombosis extended.thank you","Doctor":"Hello,sintrom and clexane are considered equally efficient in preventing thrombosis. Sintrom is usually preferred mostly because clexane is much more expensive. Clexane is easier to use (if you don't mind the injections) because it has a stable effect on coagulation. Sintrom's effectiveness may vary depending on very many factors and needs close monitoring of the INR. If your INR drops below target levels, you're in danger of thrombosis. If your INR gets very high (particularly if >4-5) then you're in danger for bleeding. Sintrom - when monitored - is usually safe enough. You haven't mentioned your sex. Females that may become pregnant should avoid sintrom.If you've got antiphospholipid syndrome then perhaps you should discuss with your treating physician about aspirin too!I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, please let me know!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"had a cbc done on 9/28/2010 showing rbc 5.37, hb 14, hematocrit 40.5, mcv 75.4, mch 26.1, rdw-cv 14.5 and these numbers have been pretty consistent based upon 3/2/2010 & 5/10/2010 cbc's.

Just wondering if could give some insight on what would cause this type of variance?","Doctor":"Hello,there are a lot of critical details missing from your description but I'll try to give you some direction.A decreased hematocrit with lower than usual mcv and higher rdw usually suggests iron deficiency although this is not 100% certain. Ferritin levels can help estimate the iron stores of your body. Clinical details can be very helpful as well. Any blood loss can cause a drop in hematocrit. This includes menstrual losses, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria etc. Decreased iron absorption is another possible cause. It usually has to do with very low meat and fish consumption. If you've had an infection, a drop in hematocrit may happen due to increased red blood cells destruction (mostly).I hope I've helped!If you'd like a more specific and detailed report, please ask again but mention all the details of your medical history this time!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"I just received my blood work results.

Many thanks Midge","Doctor":"Hi Midge. The infection after any surgery can cause close-cavity infection. It looks you have a close-cavity infection on the right side above the pelvic bone as it is throbbing.I would suggest you to undergo urgent high resolution ultrasonography to watch for an abscess; if present re-exploration is the best way to drain the abscess and put in a drain to avoid further complications like septicemia and bacteremia. The burning pain is again suggestive of an active inflammatory process. Go for . Blood- complete blood picture, kidney functions tests, blood sugar fasting and post-lunch, Urine- routine,microscopy, culture and sensitivity ( before the change of antibiotic).This will certainly help you to recovering faster and completely.Pus culture and sensitivity has to be insisted upon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor I.

In fact black tarry stools are due to bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Bleeding from upper GIT causes black tarry stools and the upper GIT bleeding leads to anemia or low hemoglobin levels. Anemia or low hemoglobin level is responsible for fatigue.

I usually eat lots of raw dark green leafy veg and fruits, along with legumes etc. But sometimes (rarely) I do eat seafood and eggs and honey. I follow a very balanced diet however recently we moved house and I found no time during the move to do grocery shopping to be able to cook my food and/or have my daily green smoothies and salads. Instead I was eating vegetarian Thai takeaway and eating bread and sometimes some cheese again as it was quick and easy. I also started drinking coffee again for the first time in a year. I have been giving blood for the past year with no issue. I tried to give blood today however the nurse advised me my hemoglobin count is low (109) instead of between 115-165 for normal female levels (and 120 to give blood here in Australia). I really believe that this is due to my bad diet stint during my house move. I have been back on the green smoothies and eating a much more balanced, healthy diet again since the beginning of the week. I have also been exercising again so I actually am starting to lose weight and feel a lot better. Do you agree that this is from my bad diet or do you think I need to go to see my Dr to have tests done? Shouldn t I just start eating more iron-rich foods? I look forward to hearing from you.

But usual causes are iron deficient diet, worm infestation or blood loss.considering your description ,I would be ruling out excessive blood loss. if there has been excessive blood loss during menstruation or any other reason ,consult your nearest physician.As you have mentioned that there has been a significant change in your diet,that might have led to low hemoglobin i.e anemia.Having a balanced diet with green leafy vegetables will surely help you regain hemoglobin levels.

Yes it is possible that the pain in abdomen can be due to adhesions. The symptoms along with pain will be distension, spasmodic pains, vomiting. This can be easily diagnosed by a plain X-ray abdomen in the standing postion which can show multiple fluid levels and further be confirmed by enteroclysis under fluroscopy control to see the dynamic bowel movement.

A patient who takes warfarin should make no diet changes, avoid alcohol, avoid taking other drugs and check the INR regularly. Vegetables are not prohibited! The patient should adjust the dosage according to the diet. Other factors that affect warfarin include infections, thyroid function etc. I couldn't name them all. They are just too many. Try to remember whether anything different than usual happened the last few days or if you took (or ate) anything at all that's not in your usual routine, including herbs, vitamins, cranberries etc.I know it's hard, but you should be prepared that you are going to have strange results from time to time. Adjust the dose slowly and stay alert for symptoms of overdosing. When you have a strange result do not wait until the next month to check again.

We are trying drinking cherry juice, taking Vitamin C, eating bananas, putting ice on the joint, raising the joint, everything we can think of that we have found information on.  He is currently a smoker and we were wandering if smoking 15 a day like he has done for many years now will affect his gout attacks?  Will quitting smoking help him ease his attacks?","Doctor":"Hello,the medical treatment for gout attacks is colchicine. If colchicine is contraindicated then non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAIDs) can be used. If the patient can't recover with the above measures then prednisolone is the next step. You can try anything else if you'd like but the mainstay of medical treatment are the aforementioned drugs. Several days after the attack is gone, he should start using uric acid lowering drugs like allopourinol or others (depending on his medical history). Please remember that these drugs may precipitate a new attack, so taking colchicine is adviced. Your doctor should advice you about dosages and supervise your treatment, because some of these drugs may cause problems.Smoking is actually related to lower uric acid levels but this is not a treatment for it. Loosing weight (if overweight) is the good way to go. Abstaining from alcohol is essential.

I had to use the bathroom really bad, but had to take care of my child first, so I held it and right before I went to use the bathroom I felt this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen. I almost threw up because the pain was so awful. I rolled around on my bed moaning and groaning out of pain which helped a little bit and after a few minutes, it went away. Do you know if there s anything to be concerned about?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From the history of holding your child and going to the bathroom simultaneously, it seems to be a minor stretching and tear of part of your abdominal muscles, which might have caused this awful pain. As it went away later on taking rest, I would not consider it to be of any serious nature. However, if it recurs again, I would advise you for an anti inflammatory drug for two to three days along with a proton pump inhibitor drug which should resolve the issue. Otherwise, I would suggest you to see your family physician for a personal clinical examination and related investigations to rule out any intra abdominal pathology.I hope this answers your query. In case of any doubt please do not hesitate to ask again. Thanks for using healthcaremagic portal for your health related queries. Wishing you an early recovery.

You need to get platelet count and peripheral blood smear examination to assess the status of platelets. If platelets are normal in number and morphology then coagulation tests have to be done- PT and aPTT. PT and aPTT will determine whether there is any abnormality in the coagulation pathway. Viral infections are known to reduce platelet counts and thus cause bruising and other bleeding disorders. Thus consult your primary healthcare provider for these investigations.

Drotaverin and Sodium added water and discharged. They did not order any further test, however I requested myself to them for Urine culture and sensititvity. However next day after my discharge, I had intense thirst, burning sensation in whole body. The pain was not there this time. The culture report arrived in the afternoon and it showed my bug was E.coli and resistant to ofloxacin but sensitive to Ceftriaxone. I was treated subsequently. My problem now is- After thorough investigation, my Blood glucose both Fasting, Post prandil were high. HbA1c was 8.1%. I had no test of diabetes before as I had never been ill. My hemoglobin is still on lower side (11.1 gm) this time. Sodium increased to 131mg%. Urine culture shows negative for any bug, but urine routine says I have WBC 4-6/HPF this time, negative for Acetone. Doctor, please help me understand what is going inside me? I am really worried for this. Thank you so much. I.D. Jha","Doctor":"Well, looking at your history and investigations done, your fasting and post postprandial sugar is high with high HbA1c, I would suggest you to visit a physician / diabetologist for further work up of Diabetes. For Pus cell; 0-5 Pus cells can normally be present in urine. More than 10/hpf or presence of clumps warrants further work up."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with a UTI yesterday......and I have experienced them before, but this time there is a lot of lower abdomen cramping which mimics the feeling of \\"gas\\".   I understand this type of discomfort yo be normal...but I am also feeling this cramping type \\" gas \\" pain floating up higher into my upper abdomen....sometime as high as just under my diaphragm.

Yes it is unlikely to have Upper Abdominal discomfort in UTI. I think you are having additional Indigestion Problem .    I advise you do some aerobic exercise like Brisk walking , Jogging or Cycling. Avoid too much of oily food , Non Veg food and eat Citrus fruits . This will improve your Abdominal gas like discomfort. Any clarification feel free to ask . Happy to answer.

It's fluctuating between normal and abnormal neutrophil counts (absolute numbers) probably reflecting bone marrow insufficiency. Age is not a reason for low blood counts. Other causes should be sought. Possible causes include drugs, infections, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), etc.Please also keep in mind that some individuals have counts lower than normal without any problem for their health. If you've always had the same values then this could be your case. If you've had higher values in the past then something else is the matter. Your neutrophils are not so low to affect your immune defences but they can get lower with time depending on the cause.Your doctor should try to identify the cause of your low values.I hope I've helped!If you need further assistance with your condition, please let me know.

What are the possible disorders?","Doctor":"Hello,I couldn't establish any diagnosis with the information you've provided but I'll share some thoughts with you about her condition.Very low hemoglobin values in an otherwise fairly stable patient can be caused by low vitamin B12 values. Vitamin B12 is necessary for blood production. Without B12 the red blood cells become bigger (high mean corpuscular volumes - MCV) and the hematocrit falls. The white blood cells can be affected as well (low numbers and hyper-segmentation). Many patients (usually old) present with a very low hematocrit (and hemoglobin) moaning only about tiredness. If this condition is prolonged then neurological symptoms may ensue.This condition is easily  managed with supplemental B12. Neurological symptoms may not be always reversible. Other potential causes exist of course but I could not say for sure, with the limited data you've provided.I've just presented you a rather common situation (megaloblastic anemia).I hope I've helped!If you need further information, I'll be glad to help.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"I am having uric acid problem for the last 9 years and am taking a zyloric pill once daily.

Off late I have started to do some weights to build some muscles. My zym instructor says without the intake of protein the muscles won’t build. He prescribes me 40gms per day through protein powder. Is this the right approach or should I try some thing else… Please suggest. Thanks Vinay sheel Saxena 41 years , India","Doctor":"Hello,uric acid elevation do not necessarily need treatment. You only need treatment when you have any of the following:- history of gout (red, swollen joint - usually first toe - with fever and PAIN).- uric acid renal stones.- uric acid skin nodules.- very high uric acid levels due to treatment for tumors/hematologic malignancies.Unless you have any of the above then you should not worry that much about your uric acid. Keep in mind that your body weight affects uric acid levels. The less you weigh the better for your uric acid levels and vice-versa.I would advice against protein supplementation for muscle development. If you do have a good reason for treating your uric acid then protein supplementation may worsen it. But even if you don't, you should be assured that a reasonable diet (without protein restriction) is more than enough for amateur athletes. Unless you want to develop the muscles of Arnold Schwarzenegger you don't need supplements.  So, if you do have a good reason for uric acid treatment then don't use protein because you'll make it worse.

I feel ok now apart from a slight ache just below my sternum which i assume is from wretching?","Doctor":"Hello,you've likely described Mallory-Weiss syndrome. This a relatively common condition of esophageal tear and bleeding after vomiting. This is commonly related to alcohol consumption. It heals very soon, so after bleeding stops the patient is safe. Other possible etiologies include- bleeding from peptic ulcer which could recur and could be dangerous.- bleeding from hemorrhagic gastritis which usually heals within 24 hours.- no blood...It's better if you visited a doctor who could identify signs of bleeding. If you have ongoing bleeding then you're in danger. That feeling under your chest could be related to regurgitation of stomach acidic contents into the esophagus which may happen after heavy alcohol consumption.

Cholesterol elevation are much more dangerous for his blood vessels and it's good news that he has normal values. Triglycerides above 150mg/dL are not desirable. Sometimes drug treatment is not needed though. For example if he's drinking alcohol or he is fat then he can lower his triglyceride levels by abstaining from alcohol or getting thinner!Avoiding sugars and fatty foods will definitely help.Unless his cardiovascular risk is very high I would advice against drug treatment for his triglycerides. I could not estimate his risk because more information is needed (his blood pressure, age, smoking, race, etc)If he was my patient, I would suggest increasing his physical activity, eating more healthy and loosing weight (if he's overweight).I hope I've helped!If you need more information on this subject, please ask!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"I recently started getting dizzy and with a sensation like I wanted to vomit, I had blood work done 2 months ago, my Dr. said I had anemia and started taking Iron supplements for a month.

Can my dizziness be because I need those Iron supplements?","Doctor":"Hello,you haven't provided much information for your condition. Therefore a specific answer cannot be given, but I'll try to give you some thoughts about the things you've mentioned.Iron deficiency may cause anemia and various symptoms (including tiredness, dizziness etc). Iron supplementation can be prescribed but the cause has to sought as well. The cause can be a benign condition like blood loss due to menstrual hemorrhage for young woman, or a malignant one like colon cancer.Supplementation for one month is not enough. At least 1-2 months are needed for the patient to recover the hematocrit and 2-4 months more to replenish iron stores. So, I can't tell if your symptoms can be attributed to iron deficiency (only blood tests can indicate that) but I can tell you that iron deficiency cannot be sufficiently treated (if drugs are taken by mouth) in one month only.I hope I've helped!If you need further information on the subject, please ask and I'll be glad to help more!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"I am a 48 yer old female.

Loosing weight is one of the main \\"weapons\\" that a patient can use against cholesterol levels. If you're not overweight then another way to positively affect cholesterol levels is using products that contain phytosterols. Phytosterols have proven efficacy (although not as high as statins) in reducing cholesterol levels. Evidence about cardiovascular mortality benefits is lacking though. Another non-statin drug is ezetimibe. If the above measures don't go well for you, you could try ezetimibe. Please keep in mind that statins is the most efficient way to lower cholesterol levels and the only way that has shown benefits for cardiovascular outcomes.

As we age, ferritin increases. Certain inflammatory conditions also raise ferritin levels. For a young female a value close to 16 ng/mL is very common. Menstruation causes iron losses and more iron is needed during puberty. Runners have more iron losses particularly when they run very long distances.Values between 12 and 150 ng/mL are considered \\"normal\\" but I would be more concerned if she had 146 (that is 4 units below the higher normal level) than 16 (4 units above the lower normal level).

You haven't mentioned your age and weight. Both play a major role in cholesterol levels.

The classical diabetic symptoms are excessive urine production, weight loss and excessive thirst. You should definitely do a fasting blood glucose test. Did you have gestational diabetes? Do you have a family history of diabetes type 2? The test will be decisive for the diagnosing or excluding diabetes.Since there is suspicion for diabetes because of your symptoms, I suggest you try to avoid too many carbohydrates (particularly simple sugars), eat more fiber and avoid gaining weight. If you do have diabetes and high blood glucose, then there is no reason for you to feel shaky because of hypoglycemia. You may feel shaky and weak because of dehydration.

Since your boy's got 3 years old before anybody noticed, he most likely has minor thalassemia which is usually a pretty mild condition that only means a somewhat lower hematocrit than normal. If this is the case with him then this means that one of the parents (or both) is carrying a defective gene. Thalassemia major causes characteristic appearance changes that should get noticed by doctors. Patients with Thalassemia major require transfusions every so often.Let me describe to you how these genes get from the parents to their kids. Each parent has two genes. Each kid inherits two genes, one from each parent.This means that two people with thalassemia minor (one defective gene each) may have a severely sick child with 2 defective genes (thalassemia major). If the kid has one defective gene then this is thalassemia minor. This procedure is a rather simple one although it may sound confusing at first.So the answer is that your other kids may have the defective gene as well and they should be tested.

Thanks, Lacey","Doctor":"I,have gone through your query regarding HPV ,and abnormal pap test result .Genital HPV infections are very common. Up to 80 percent of sexually active adults will get an HPV infection of the genital area at some point in their lives. In most cases, these infections do not cause symptoms. They can cause genital warts .In women with genital warts, the doctor will do a pelvic and rectal exam. A Pap smear will be done to look for microscopic pre-cancer or early cancer of the cervix caused by HPV.HPV testing is not routinely needed. If a PAP smear is abnormal or inconclusive, a DNA HPV test can help determine whether a woman has a higher risk of developing cancer. Women with strains of HPV that pose a higher cancer risk may need colposcopy and biopsies. A woman with a low risk HPV strain probably will need only repeat PAP smears.

Platelet count of 105 is good and not to be worried about. 2. Abnormal liver function tests usually do not affect platelet count. However, the same cause like alcohol suppression or nutritional deficiencies can affect bone marrow and affect platelet count.3. If the platelet count falls below 100, get a complete hemogram to look for pancytopenia. If abnormal, required bone marrow biopsy for evaluation. Not to worry now.

THE DR S HAVE SAID THEY ARE JUST AS CONFUSED AS I AM AND ARE STILL DOING BLOOD WORK AND I WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE BONE MARROW ASPIRATE REPEATED IN 3 WEEKS AS FIRST TEST SHOWED ABNORMAL CELLS. CAN A MED CAUSE SUCH SEVERE BONE MARROW SUPRESSION? THANK YOU","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Cimzia can affect marrow by causing bone marrow suppression rarely. The effects usually would last for shorter period of maximum of 10-15 days and improve after that.2. At present Cimzia does not appear to be the cause. 3. You need to get a bone marrow biopsy to identify the possible cause. Vit B12 supplementation along with iron and folic acid is essential. More details necessary for further opinion.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"2 months ago I was diagnosed with low platelet count. was sent to the hematologist and all they keep doing is rechecking my platelet count and not doing any treatment. last month started having chest pain thought It could be due to the low platelet. went to ER they could not find anything. my regular doctor sent me to have stress test the first one came back slightly abnormal in the nucular stress test came back normal. did not have no chest pain when having both tests done. today I have had burning in my chest off and on and everytime Iget the burning in chestI also get a pain close to my left wrist","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Low Platelet count would not cause burning chest pain.2. Possibility of internal bleeding secondary to gastritis/ GERD or angina pain are usual suspects.3. During internal bleeding, thrombocytosis is commonly seen. If the nuclear stress test is abnormal, further angiography is necessary to evaluate for any blockage. You can start on proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole for a week and see if the pain reduces.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have a blood clot in my right leg. Have been going to the VA but they cannot prescribe anything but warrafin which I have a bad reaction to. Blood pressure increases to ~ 180 and blurred vision. All the local Drs I call tell me to go to emergency room, but I have already been to emergency room twice at the VA. How can I get a prescription for an anti coagulant other than Warafin? Currently I am taking asprine, flax seed oil, niacin, i.e. herbal blood thinners. I took Luvanox shots for one week, then warrafin for 3 weeks. swelling in leg is reduced, but not back to normal. INR on 5 mgs warrifin s 1.1, kidney function 1.4 . It would seem to me I need a anticoagulant metabolized by liver, but VA can t get through the red tape . I have no insurance, can t afford several thousand dollars at emergency room.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. INR should be maintained at a higher rate.2. If you are having reacting to warfarin, better to go for heparin or other new anticoagulants like razaxaban, idraparinux etc.3. Being mobile is the most important thing to avoid blood clot in leg or deep vein thrombosis.

I had an abdominal ultrasound which stated: mildly echogenic liver which can be seen in the setting of fatty infiltration. Also it stated that the pancreas is not well visualized - why would that be? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. On ultrasound pancreas cannot be visualized on occasions as it is always behind the stomach, duodenum. So proper visualization is difficult and CT may be necessary for evaluating it.2. Elevated LDL levels can be reduced either by medication or life style changes or both.3. Life style modifications include weight reduction, moderate exercises and having diet containing moderate amounts of good fat. Avoid alcohol and smoking.4. Fatty infiltration of liver is due to increased lipid profile. It is reversible and will recover with improved lipid profile.

In case it becomes inconclusive, I would advise you for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any other intra-peritoneal pathology including the pathology of pelvic adnexa in case you are a female. In case of UTI or any intestinal infection, treatment with appropriate antibiotics would relieve your problem, but in case of  any other diagnosis, the management would depend on the doctor treating you.

Infection would not usually cause this high range. If the lymphocytes count is high, it will support diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Bone marrow biopsy along with flow cytometry is necessary for further categorization and treatment.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"i was taking medicine happi 10mg last 3 years having a heartburn.after endoscopy nothing found but i couldnt stop the medicine, so i continued taking that.4 months back, i had severe neck pain and consulted physician he gave me gabapentine 100 /day and caldob 500 2 times /day  for 4 months. after i take the medicone everything was fine.

This is not my first time being anemic. I was anemic after the birth of my first child in 1996 and was given a blood transfusion after the c-section. My current doctors do not seem think that this episode is related to the episode in 1996. During my 4 day stay in the hospital this last week, I had just about every test imaginable ran on me. No internal bleeding to be found. After 2 units of blood, iron infusions and b12 shots daily, I was released . when I left the hospital my hemoglobin was at 7.4. Hematologist says I have Pernicious anemia and iron deficient anemia (?) I am now on oral iron pills 3 times a day and oral b12 one daily. Today I will go back to see hematologist to have blood checked again as well as receive another iron infusion. Here is my question... at 18 years old I was diagnosed with ADD. I took the meds until I became pregnant with my first child. After that I developed skills to cope with the ADD without having to take the meds. (make lists, reminder notes, organization classes, meditation, yoga etc) However, now that I am soooooo tired all the time and the ADD seems to be getting worse, I wonder if it is ok to take Adderall while being treated for anemia?

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From the history of bleeding and a mass in the stomach, the chances of the stomach harbouring a malignant mass (needs a histo pathology examination of the tissue to confirm) becomes high, and so the doctors treating him might have advised him for a surgery. As your doctors have examined him physically and must have performed investigations before arriving at the decision to operate, I think they are the best judge, and so you should go with their advice, otherwise the mass may bleed more resulting in more blood loss. The provisional documented diagnosis is abdominal pain and region is epigastric part of the abdomen and the number 789.06 could be some kind of registration or reference number of the hospital where he was treated.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your father's problem.

A vein thrombosis causes pain and swellings of the vein  and limb. Now concerning the red spots in your body on and off, check your bleeding time, PT and PTT and if normal, take a course of Vitamin C. if the spots recurs( spontaneous bruising), it could be related to thin subcutaneous tissue which by itself is harmless. however, if that is true, you might want to check for homocysteinuria and marfans s syndrome."},{"Patient":"Why would a doctor refuse to write an RX for blood work?

I am a 74 year old female with many medical problems. Thank you","Doctor":"sweats do not cause a drop in potassium. Low potassium could be due to leakage of potassium from the urine. you need to check a trans tubular poassium gradient in urine. also check your serum aldosterone as high levels could cause potassium to leak in urine. check your magnesium and calcium levels with vitamin D. unless you treat the vitamin D deficiency, in this case with the active Vitamin D( rocaltrol ), the low magnesium and low potassium will be resistant to treatment. there are conditions like renal tubular acidosis which also cause low potassium."},{"Patient":"Hi, my name is Crystal.

I would like to know what does this mean....since 15 days i feel weakness very much. Also tell me that what i eat and do that my ESR is coming normal.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM, Raised ESR is not a disease. Raised ESR is actually an indication that some disease process is going in the body. In females the normal ESr should be between 0-20 mm in first hour. A value of 38 mm suggests there is sone chronic disease process in the body. Accompanied weakness is probably due to same chronic disease process. You need to consult your primary health care provider for general physical examination to look for the cause of high ESR. Treatment of the underlying disease process will correct the raised ESR. No specific medication is required to correct raised ESR. It is actually the treatment of disease that is required.

Today I noticed a small bruise on the lower right side of my gut, but I'm not sure if this is related.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as I'm in a great amount of discomfort and have no medical insurance at this time.  -Matt W.","Doctor":"Hi! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you to completely avoid eating from outside specially fried, spicy, and fast food which might contain some components which might not be friendly to the mucosa of your intestines, and also external intestinal infections might creep into your GI tract by this way, both the situations giving rise such symptoms in your case. I would advise you to go for a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive. Till then I would advise you to go for a proton pump inhibitor along with a probiotic drug and an anti spasmodic for a symptomatic relief. The bruise on the lower right side of your abdomen could be an independent entity and might not be related to your present abdominal symptoms. However, you need to get your abdomen examined by a general physician to rule out anything apart from the related investigations. Therefore, I would advise you to visit the ER of your nearest government hospital to get at least the routine initial treatment if that is possible.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I wanted to ask that whether the above prescription is correct?","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. I have read your question and understand your concerns. Your prescription needs some modifications otherwise he has done right changes. My advice to you is - 1. The most important thing is your Trademill test is Positive for ischaemia which usually indicates that you should go for angiography to confirm whether any blockade is there or not. (TMT is not 100% specific everytime). 2.Reduction in rosuvastatin dose is accepted and right. He has continued one antipletlet drug tab ecosprin to prevent heart attack. But one anti anginal drug should be added until next TMT or angiography. Tab olmezest has been stopped as your S. Creat is slightly high. Just repeat your S. Creat after 2 months, if it's normal than your creatinine might be raised due to tab olmezest. 3. Consult a cardiologist  also once and show him your TMT report.

The pain is very sharp and when I push in the area it hurts when I am having the pain. I have no gallbladder. It doesn t hurt to push in that area when the pain isn t present.","Doctor":"HI! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, what I guess is that it could be some kind of sub acute intermittent torsion of the ovary harboring the so called tumours, or could be due to intermittent hemorrhage in those tumours. This could be causing some kind of inflammation of the neighbouring peritoneum resulting in such sharp pain and also the hurt caused by pressure at that moment. If I were your doctor, in case of increased frequency and intensity of the problem, I would advise you for an MRI of the abdomen, and a diagnostic laparoscopy during the stage of sharp pain, which could be converted into a therapeutic procedure depending on the judgement of the treating surgeon at that moment. Till then, you could go for some anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief during the pain.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have read your question and understand your concerns. Diabetes should be under control otherwise you will have short and long term complications.

E. g. Tab. Voglibose just before lunch or dinner. Kindly ask your doctor regarding this option. 3.Third option is insulin pump which will automatically deliver insulin according to blood sugar levels.

I have read your question and understand your concerns. Low RBC count is not a major problem. So don't worry. Actually you should provide whole CBC report, so that I can understand the whole problem. Low protein and RBC usually indicates nutritional problem. Anyway my advice to you is - 1.Low RBC count usually indicates iron or vitamin B deficiency. Go for S. Ferritin levels and S. Iron levels to detect that. Hemoglobin level less than 13 also indicates anemia. 2.Check your urine protein levels, kidney and liver profile also to find out cause of low proteins. But mostly it is nutritional. 3.There are many multivitamin preparations available that will increase your RBC count within 3-4 months. But written prescription is necessary for treatment. So ask your doctor regarding that. 4.Eat high protein diet, green leafy vegetables and fruits. Eat jaggery, spinach to improve iron and proteins. Thank you.

I had similar issue last time I gave blood for lab testing.My platelets count was a bit lower than normal suggesting mild thrombocytopenia. Is the rash due to thrombocytopenia?","Doctor":"Yes dear ,platelets count and thrombocytopenia are coneccted .A healthy person usually has a platelet count of 150,000 to 400,000. You have thrombocytopenia if your number falls under 150,000.Regular intake of  healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, especially green  leafy greens,tomato ,brocally, berries ,Papaya and leave extract , Omega 3 ,coco nut  water &  lot of water to give your body the nutrients it needs.  And regular  walk , exercise  ,yoga ,deep breathing for  proper blood circulation  ,   and proper rest and sound sleep to enhance strengthen immunity   of your  system  give further resistance from  diseases .  You should avoid fried fast foods ,and  refined  flour sugar foods  Also stay away from alcohol and caffeinated beverages. Partaking in these foods and drinks can cause your platelet count to drop even further because they may hamper production by the bone marrow., and refined sugar foods.Also avoid  mental strain , worry , anger  .Constipation is the mother of all ills ,should be avoided at any cost .

I really need help. I'm so stressed out and confused right now. For the last few months I've been to the hospital and clinic. I live on a small Island so there's not much option. It all started by this tightening of my chest and heart palpitations. I went to the hospital and the doctor told me  it was anxiety. It eventually went away on it's own. Then I menstruated twice for 2 moths, so I was sent for blood work and a gynecologist. Pap test and exam was normal, but my blood came back as having a little bit of low iron. The doctor suggested I take iron pills. I didn't take them for a month and ended up back at the hospital for another reason and they took my blood again which showed my iron was still low but had went up a bit without the iron pills. I started the supplements afterwards and went back to the hospital a month later cause my knee swell up a bit and I got a bruise on it as well as other smalls one's on my other leg. They ran another test and said that my everything was normal except my red hemoglobin's were a little small. I then went to the clinic and the doctor ordered more tests ( lupus, monopost, rheumatoid arthitis ) cause at this point I was getting aches and pains in my bones and joints as well as a few small bruises on my arms. Everything came back normal except my red blood cells are high and the mono came back positive. I asked the doctor why I tested positive for mono if I have no symptoms and he said I probably had it a long time ago.

He told me I was very pale and my nails were white underneath. Which the nurse told me when I first went in that her daughter had the same signs as me and it time them along time to figure it out. And it was her cortisol levels. I was wondering if that could be my problem. If you could help. I would appreciate it.","Doctor":"Hi, dear. I have gone through your question.
