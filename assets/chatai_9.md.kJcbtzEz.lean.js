You should know that amlokind is a calcium channel blocker, with its main effect on the blood pressure and fewer effects on the heart rate. I would recommend consulting with your doctor to consider the possibility of adding a beta blocker to this therapy, such as atenolol or nebivolol. Betablockers have their main effect on the heart rate and less effect on the blood pressure. So a combination of these drugs, could normalize his blood pressure and heart rate. You should wait up to a week from the change of the therapy to achieve the effect of the new therapy (antihypertensive drugs need up to a week to show their complete effect).

Unfortunately there are not specific medications, which are proved to improve this situation. The best therapy in this case would be physiotherapy and psychotherapy. Recovery after stroke takes time. It is greatest in the first few months, and gradually plateaus, although small gains may be made for the next 1 to 2 years. I recommend continuing the anti vomiting medications(besides the other antihypertensive and prevention therapy) and try time after time to make proves if he can swallow without vomiting (some patients remain with a feeding tube for months). A psychiatric consult may be needed to establish the proper therapy for his mood changes. Many persons have depression after stroke, which makes their recovery more difficult.

I recommend consulting with the ophtalmologist and performing a fundus oculi (which is part of the ophtalmological physical examination), to establish the diagnosis.

I am 72 years old and use to walking 6 miles a day.","Doctor":"Greetings. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Well, in the scenario where your cardiologist and lung specialist say that everything is fine, we have to seek for other causes of this situation. My first assumption was that you had these stents placed in a terrain of an acute myocardial infarction. In that case, a certain part of the heart muscle would be damaged and produce decreasing of the left ventricular function - rising of pressures in lung circulation - shortness of breath. My assumption is also based on the fact that your legs get swollen. If this is the case, then you should restrict your physical activity, to activities that do not produce shortness of breath, restrict salt from your diet. As about the cough, many patients that were subject to stent implantation or any cardiovascular disease, usually have angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) in therapy. These are very effective, safe drugs for fighting high blood pressure and also help a great deal in heart function and in inhibiting the bad remodeling mechanisms that happens to the heart, after a heart attack. But, up to 15% of cases they exert a side effect - dry cough. If this is the case, switch to an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB: the \\"sartans\\"), and the dry cough should subside after three weeks. The passing out episodes, if they are with a loss of consciousness, then further investigation is mandated: EKG, 24-hour rhythm monitor and echoDoppler of carotid (neck) arteries. I hope I was of help. Good day. Regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My mother has cardiac problems. Her Angiogram report says \\" LAD -Type III, good size vessel having 40-50% stenosis at its proximal & 70-80% stenosis at its mid segment. D1 has got 95% stenosis at its proximal segment. D2 has got 30% stenosis at its proximal segment.LCX: Dominant, good size vessel having 95-98% stenosis at its mid segment.RCA: Non dominant vessel having 60-70% stenosis at its proximal segment. What does it mean?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. This angiogram report indicates that this is a three-vessel + secondary vessels, coronary artery disease. As it happens only in 8% of people worldwide, the left circumflex (LCx) artery is the dominant artery. This is only statistics, and it is a normal variable. Now, usually, the treatment recommendations vary from one clinic to another and from one country to another. If she was my patient, and if there was acute ischemia, I would treat only the culprit artery of the heart attack in the first time, with a angioplasty and stent placement. In a second moment, i.e. two weeks later, I would treat the two remaining blockages, the one in the mid-LAD and the one in D1 with stents, if suitable and if in a favorable position. If there was no acute myocardial infarction, and the three arteries would be suitable targets for stents, I would treat them with stents all at once. Even with all these said, there is no invasive cardiologist in the world that would be sure without seeing the angiogram film. There are detailed things that should be best discussed with the operator that carried out the procedure. There is one sure thing: the recommendation is that something should be done about this three-vessel coronary artery disease, whether it is angioplasty+stenting, or coronary artery bypass grafting. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I recently gave blood where they took my BP, it was 130/820 (pulse 82). A week prior I had it checked and it was 120/82 and a week prior to that it was 115/78. The person at the donation site told me that digestion (I had just eaten) may have caused the high BP. Can that be true?","Doctor":"Hello, I really appreciate your concern. You are having minor changes in blood pressure which is quite normal phenomenon. Change in BP can be triggered by several factors like change in body postures, change in pulse rate, time of day (day or night), fluid intake, salt intake, some minor illnesses etc. So there is nothing to worry about in your case. There may be rise in heart rate and blood pressure after meals which is normal activity of heart to provide excess blood supply to stomach. Hope my answer has solved your query.

I went to the emergency room and they did alot of test and they did not found anything wrong. From then on my heart has been having palpitations. I was 26 yld at that time. My cuestion is if the exposure to those  chemicals that we inhale for about 4 hrs it could be the reason.","Doctor":"Hello, I really appreciate your concern. Inhalation of certain fumes or chemicals can cause palpitation. I would like to ask you to what chemical you were exposed at that time. Inhalation for 4 hours can cause acute rise in heart rate but it cannot exert chronic effects like you are mentioning.Atrial fibrillation is itself a cause of palpitation. But acute exposure to fumes do not cause atrial fibrillation.  So there is nothing to worry about the incident. I advise you to avoid stress of that incident and forget it completely. Anxiety or fear can be the cause of your palpitations. Try some relaxation exercies like yoga and meditation. Hope my answer has solved your query. Take Care.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I am feeling shaky almost nervous. I get dizzy very easy. I am tired all of the time. I am thirsty all the time. My head hurts a lot.

I would like to explain that your systolic blood pressure is within the highest normal limits, while your diastolic blood pressure is slightly higher. Although the diastolic high blood pressure is not lower risk factor for cardio-vascular disease comparing to high systolic blood pressure, it is indicative of pre-hypertension or hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure. So treatment (nor pharmacological or/and pharmacological is necessary). First I would recommend to make some modifications to your lifestyle: 1-Salt intake should be limited to approximately 5 to 6 g per day2-You should avoid caffeine intake as much as you can3-You should loose some weight. Body-mass index (BMI) should be reduced to 25 kg/m 2 and waist circumferences should be reduced to less than 102 cm in men and less than 88 cm in women. If the above tips don't help reduce your blood pressure to the goal of below 130/90mm Hg, a medical treatment should be started. I would recommend a thiazide diuretic ( hydroclorthiazide) or an ACEinhibitor (enalapril) or ARB class (losartan) instead of numlo 5 for the beginning of the therapy. These are better treatment in first stage hypertension. I also recommend performing some lab tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes), besides the physical examination and resting ECG, to exclude other causes of secondary high blood pressure before starting the therapy.

I was taking metropolol but I have diabetes and my doctor thought it was better. My heart rate seems to be up as high as 100 from my typical 70-80. Could this be caused by the lisinopril.","Doctor":"Greetings. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Lisinopril is an angiontensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and is effective and safe in lowering the blood pressure, but no effects on heart rate whatsoever. Normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This increase in heart rate you are experiencing is rather from discontinuing the metoprolol, which has heart rate-lowering features. If this is a worrisome happening to you and produces any symptoms, then you can discuss with your cardiologist about the possibility to put you on a drug that have bot blood pressure- and heart rate-lowering features, such as verapamil or diltiazem. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care. Kind regards. Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My husband has a sharp electrical shooting pain in his upper left chest...and also like someone took tape and is ripping of the hair on that side of his chest. Had a weird shock sensation when he put sponge and soap on his chest. Should we be worried?","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Pain in the chest always needs further evaluation. The most serious is the pain coming from a blockage in the coronary arteries, but this pain - angina - is described more like a heaviness or tenderness or squeezing pain in the mid chest, triggered by physical activity, and radiating to the left arm, left shoulder and the jaw. A sharp, stabbing pain in the chest is more a feature of other conditions, rather than coronary artery disease. Such pain can be produced from chronic, but rather from an acute, inflammation of the linings situated in the chest, such as pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (lining of the heart). It also can be produced, if severe in intensity, from a suspected or possible ascending aorta aneurysm. Another, less serious cause, is costochondritis of the ribcage joints and bones. Therefore, at this moment, it is recommended that he does an EKG and an echocardiogram, for the evaluation of pericardium inflammation or fluid accumulation, and for the aortic aneurysm. Also, a plain chest X-ray, for pleural inflammation and costochondritis. After the tests are back, hopefully normal, we can discuss further. To alleviate the pain, he can use any drug from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Had blood pressure checked and doctor decided to prescribe lisinopril. This is the first time I 've had to use medication.

No other history of chest pains and I had an EKG last year during my annual physical that was normal. Not sure if I want to continue with the drug, took the first dosage last night before bed, I am physically active, working out 3 times plus per week. Do not have any pain or shortness of breath while excercising. Have a good diet.","Doctor":"Greetings. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Lisinopril is a safe and effective drug to lower your blood pressure. Normal blood pressure standardized worldwide is: systolic 100-139 mmHg and diastolic 60-89 mmHg. Figures higher than this, found on three consecutive measurements in both arms, in three different times of day, can be considered as hypertension. Although, this means cannot be precise, but a 24-hour blood pressure monitor is. You can discontinue the lisinopril, if you feel like you do not need it, but based on blood pressure figures. If you discontinue it, you should take the upper mentioned measures, to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of hypertension precisely. It is a good thing that you are physically active, but I would suggest you to engage in physical activity for 60 minutes a day, seven days a week, like walking, swimming, biking etc. Also, a diet low on salt.

All this lasted no longer then 3-5 min , just felt quet sick ( nausea ) , and short of breath at the same time . Is this something I would need to worry about ? Many thanks","Doctor":"Greetings. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. The episode you are describing is more like a bout of arrhythmia. What arrhythmia is this, I cannot be precise without some tests done. I see from the prior EKG you have done, there is a very slight prolongation of the QT interval (0.36-0.44 being the normal range). This talks about delayed repolarization and may be a trigger for arrhythmias, sometimes serious. I would recommend, at this moment, an EKG to be done and, then, a 24-hour rhythm monitor registration, to precisely decide what kind of arrhythmia is this. I would recommend you that the EKG should be done as soon as possible. Also, blood electrolytes should be checked, because electrolyte disturbances sometimes give rise to potentially serious arrhythmias. I hope I was of help. Take care.

It feels like tightness and small stabbing. Id say it's right underneath the arm pit, but positions right where the chest curves. More precisely it's at the same height as my nipple. I am a male and 19 years old","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Every pain in the chest mandates further evaluation. According to your age, there is almost a zero possibility that his pain comes from the heart. However, if you continue to feel this way, just to be safe, do an EKG. There are a lot of other origins of the chest pain. Your description is a pain that lasts 5-10 minutes and is localized. Localized pain goes more for a lung origin, or musculoskeletal origin. I am assuming that, as a young fellow, you exercise. If you also smoke, and this pain, when it is present, relates to the inspiratory-expiratory cycle, then a load on your lungs and overall in your rib cage can cause this. Even this has a slight possibility to happen. The main suspicion is on the musculoskeletal origin of pain. It can happen from assuming a bad position while sleeping or a little trauma to a certain part of the rib cage. So, this may probably be produced by a trauma to a rib, a rib-joint or from intercostal (between-ribs) muscles which become sore every time there a physical activity that includes heave respirations is carried out.

Is there a risk or issue if I were to change to enalapril? Both are ACE inhibitors, but it will be much more economical for me to change since others in my household take enalapril. Would the dosage be the same?","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I carefully read your query. Well, as you are aware of, they both are from the same class of drugs (angiontensiogen converting enzyme inhibitors). The effects of these drugs, are a class-effect, which means all the benefits and side effects are dedicated almost equally to every member of this family of drugs. In fact, there are some studies that prefer the usage of always innovative agents, and let the old agents aside. My opinion is that this is not indicative that a more expensive drug should be used, at all costs. In developing countries, such as mine, cost-effectiveness is always an issue, and we receive great results even when we use the older drugs. As I said, this is a class-effect and it is totally safe to switch from one ACE-I to another, and also effective. Of course, bare in mind, that all the ACE-I have the side effect of dry cough, which can happen up to 15% of people using them. In that case, I recommend you to switch to angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB: the \\"sartans\\"). I hope I was helpful with my answer. Good day.

I would like to explain that as long as all his performed cardiac tests result normal, we can exclude any cardiac related disorder, causing this clinical scenario. Anxiety (panic attacks)can be a cause of this symptomatology. Thyroid hormone imbalance could also mimic these symptoms. As you refer, these episodes usually occur at night during sleeping, so a sleep disorder with autonomic reaction (like nightmares), can't be excluded. I recommend perfoming some lab tests like: a complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes to exclude a possible metabolic disorder related to his symptoms.

There are a lot of physiological fluctuations of blood pressure and heart rate during a day. This comes from various physical, psychological and hormonal changes that happen in our organism in a day. Lisinopril is a drug from the angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) family, effective and safe in lowering the blood pressure, but does not exert any effect on the heart rate. If the blood pressure figures remain high, the it can be discussed to switch lisinopril with another drug or keep it and add a second blood pressure-lowering drug to your regimen. I would recommend a drug from the beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker (verapamil and diltiazem) family, because, besides having effects on lowering the blood pressure, they also have the feature of slowing the heart rate down and reduce the heart workload.

ECG and stress tests all clear.Thank you","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, after the EKG and stress tests came back normal, we can exclude, with highest probability, a rhythm or conduction disturbance which could be innate. It is important to be stressed that heart rate tends to increase whenever any human being is engaging in physical activity - it is normal to go up to 200 beats per minute in your daughter's case, or is undergoing to a state with psychological stress. If that is so, then there is nothing to worry about. Also, the pain originating in the right part of the chest and then radiating to the right arm is not linked with the palpitations, and very rarely, with any heart condition. My opinion is that repeated palpitations generate certain amounts of anxiety and the anxiety produces really-felt symptoms by the subject complaining about them, but with no organic or disease-based origin. My opinion, once again, is that there is nothing to worry about. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I am 66 years old and have alot of stress in my life just had a complete heart exam and all came back normal a little heart murmur which i have had all my life and they did a ekg and ultrsound and all the tests that they normally do, and nothing was found also said that my some thing was over 60 which for my age they said that was good so do you think because of the stress that is why my blood pressure is sort of high and i do have white coat syndrone","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. The \\"something\\" that was told to you, is probably the ejection fraction of the left ventricle of the heart. It is a component that describes heart function and, if it is 0.6 or 60%, then it means that this heart fills, pumps and contracts properly (normal ranges being 0.55-0.7, or 55-70%). Stress itself produces produces rapid heart rate and high blood pressure, almost always. This is attributed to high levels of adrenalin and noradrenalin in your system, during stress. Also, long-standing stress exposes the heart to a hyperdynamic state, which can also produce the so-called \\"innocent murmurs\\". I am stating this, because if it was a pathological murmur, it would be diagnosed on the careful echocardiogram examination of the valves and other structures of the heart, which can produce murmurs. You may also have white coat syndrome, and you may also not have high blood pressure (hypertension), but if this is a long-standing high blood pressure then, combined with your age of 66 years old, I cannot exclude the diagnosis of hypertension, at this moment. A 24-hour blood pressure monitor would be a good approach at this moment, to precisely confirm or exclude hypertension and, if confirmed, proper treatment should be initiated immediately, to control these blood pressure figures and keep them under 140/90 mmHg. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Feel free to ask again. Best regards. Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"hi i am a 20 year old female , recently i have been having reay bad anxiety! i was in the gym and use a watch to measure heart rate suddently my heart rate went up really high i was paying attention to the watch though! it happened twice in one week i felt a little light headed but did not faint! ive been to see cardiologist he done the stress test, ecg and a scan and sed i was perfect! i then went to see another doctor to get 2 more ECG done and they were fine too. i just cant believe the doctors and i am so anxious that i have palpitations all day long! even if i dont feel nervous my subconciois is causing palpitations and im scared. i dont want to start taking meds as im so young and this might just be a period of anxiety.","Doctor":"Greetings. Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. If it was something heart-related, at your age there are rare conditions that can be inherited disorders, that would have palpitations for symptoms. However, these disorders are almost always caught in the EKG, and each one of them has specific EKG signs. Therefore, we ruled that out. You mentioned that the \\"jump starting\\" of the heart happened in the gym. It is normal for the heart rate to go up while being physically active. In your case, it is tolerated up to 200 beats per minute (220 - age, is the formula). The anxiety or panic attacks are almost always triggered by some event, such that, the person experiencing them, knows which places or venues will trigger their attack, such as public speaking or performance, crowded places, narrow pathways etc. It works in that way that a certain phenomenon causes the panic attack. From that moment on, every single symptom you experience, comes from anxiety: shortness of breath, high heart rate, high blood pressure, sometimes dizziness or blurred vision. If this situation is affecting your quality of life, then I would recommend you to be started on a course of combination of a drug from the benzodiazepines and a drug of antipsychotic medication. They will help you suppress and prevent the anxiety attacks. I also recommend you to consult a psychiatrist, about the dosage and frequency of these drugs. In the end, I would recommend you to keep being physically active, as physical activity has great benefits in the state of the mind.I hope I was helpful. Kind regards.

Physical activity has a prominent positive effect on the circulation and, thus, on arterial hypertension. So, it is highly recommended that you excercise while with hypertension for 60 minutes a day: jogging, swimming, brisk walking, going to the gym or other light to moderate physical activity alternatives. Olmesartan should not be adjusted to 60 mg a day and I would strongly recommend you to not change the treating regimen without consulting your curing doctor. If these figures of blood pressure are a constant finding, then I would recommend adding a second agent to your hypertension treatment. So, a beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker or a diuretic would be a good choice. The aim is that the blood pressure be maintained under 140/90 mmHg, because it is proven that long-standing higher than these figures cause gradual end-organ damages.

I am 29 and has had hypertension since my early teens. I was told that I am too young for medication amd was treated symptomatically.. ie . Headaches, dizziness etc.. I had my daughter on 28weeks due to pre eclampsia, which our local clinic and Drs missed, as my weight (123kg) apparently warrants high blood pressure.This week I nearly broke my neck due to an fainting episode, and since the fall, i still dont feel much better, in actual fact worse.Today i had a checkup at our clinic and the Dr said that 155/88 is normal, although i remember my previous Dr told me that from 150 + i should immediately consult a Dr, as this is dangerous.. I feel terrible, and they say everything is normal. Is there anything I might be missing or not understand about hypertension.Your feedback will be much appreciated. Kind regards Louise","Doctor":"Hello, Louise! Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. There are some things I would like to share with you in relationship with hypertension. Normal blood pressure ranges from 100-139/60-89 mmHg. Now, in certain moments in a 24-hours cycle, there are a lot of changes in psychological, physiological and hormonal peaks and nadirs in our organism, that can be detected. All of these factors determine our blood pressure and it is variable. Also, there is a phenomenon that is called ''white collar hypertension'', which is characterized by high blood pressure figures every time the patient sees the doctor and/or a sphygmomanometer gets attached to their arm. However, just to be thorough, I would recommend you to wear a 24 or 48-hour blood pressure monitor, to precisely determine whether this is your constant blood pressure or not, and, if it is, proper treatment should be installed. I can see that this figures come as worrisome events to you. The stress and/or anxiety generated by this state, produces high blood pressure figures. I recommend you to take the proper measure of immediately losing weight. You have to modify your eating and lifestyle habits: an hour a day of physical activity, no alcohol, no animal fat, no red meat but more fish and chicken, no fast food, more fruit and vegetables. With a combination of confidence and self-initiative, I believe you will succeed. I hope I was of help. Take care.

In fact, now, I need to use the oxygen most of the time. I will be seeing my doctor this week for follow up. Do you have any suggestions what diseases/problems could be causing this.

Looking for alternate treatments, tests etc. to be done?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Your past medical history is really concerning, and your symptoms seem to be related to sarcoidosis. But I recommend performing some other tests like : pulmonary function tests, a blood gas analysis, a resting ECG, to examine better your cardiac and pulmonary function. An ambulatory 24 hour ECG monitoring may be needed if suspicions of arrhythmia are raised. Steroids can be a therapeutic test for sarcoidosis (which is a disorder which improves by steroids). But in your case, the dose of steroids may need to be raised, in order to have the wished effects. The cardiac complications, improve too, when sarcoidosis starts responding to the therapy. You should discuss with your attending physician on the above possibilities.

My husband age 52 has a very stressful job and has diabetes plus he is about 25 pounds overweight. Do you think he could have possibly inherited this disease","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. I would like to tell you that the coronary artery disease has several risk factors. One of them, a strong one, is the genetic factor. Having blood-related people in the family that have had myocardial infarction or coronary arter disease without infarction, is a strong risk factor that descendents also will have coronary artery disease. There is a little data about the genetic inheritance of the ''widow maker'' artery disease, but ther all are inconclusive. For example, you husband has these risk factors: age above 45, diabetes, overweight and genetic inheritance of the coronary heart disease.

Did you measure your blood pressure during this episode? Nose bleeding is commonly caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure. A wide differential diagnosis between different disorders affecting the mediastinal structures should be done:- A costochondritis, would cause similar pain, modulated by respiratory movements. But would not explain the bleeding nose. The pain modulated by body position or respiratory movements is usually musculo-skeletal. - an aorta dissection, but this would not explain the pain modulation with respiratory movements. - your symptoms don't seem to be cardiac related, as it is very atypical for the cardiac pain to be modulated from respiratory movements. I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination and performing some tests like : a chest x ray, resting ECG, routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, thyroid hormone levels, to establish the possible cause. Meanwhile I advise to closely monitor your blood pressure.

These two disorders would explain the burping after eating two. All your cardiac tests have resulted normal, and based also on the nature of your complains, I would exclude any cardiac disorders related to your symptomatology. I recommend performing a fibrogastroscopy to rule out any gastroesophageal reflux, or esophageal spasms. Regarding Paxil therapy, I recommend waiting some days (up to two weeks) to show its complete effects. This is a low starting dose and higher doses may be needed.

Alcohol can cause arrhythmia in people with normal hearts and can cause heart conditions that result in arrhythmia. People who drink heavily can develop a weak heart (alcoholic cardiomyopathy). Alcohol can directly injure heart cells and cause extra heartbeats and supraventricular tachycardias. Usually the cardiac function comes back to normality after stopping alcohol intake. But for some days, anxiety and withdrawal symptoms may be related to temporary cardiac arrhythmia.

Thank you, Mike Howard","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for your question on HCM!I understand your concern, and would like to explain that his symptoms may be related to different disorders like : 1- Low blood pressure. As his symptoms occurred while standing up, a low blood pressure or an orthostatic hypotension, may be the cause of his symptomatology. I recommend to closely monitor his blood pressure during sitting and standing up position. A head up tilt test may be necessary to exclude an orthostatic hypotension. 2. Low blood sugar: hypoglycemia could cause a similar clinical scenario. I recommend performing a routine blood test (to exclude chronic anemia) and blood glucose levels. 3. A seizure. A partial seizure may mimic these symptoms. If the above tests result normal, an EEG and a brain CT scan may be necessary to exclude a possible seizure and possible intracranial causes.

But, he has been experiencing stomach upsets like constipations since then. Also, he complains of constant weakness in whole body. Could you please suggest, why this is happening ? and in how much time will he get normal ?","Doctor":"Hello, I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to antiplatelet agents. For this reason, I recommend checking his complete blood count for anemia and performing a fibrogastroscopy. Cardiac ultrasound is also necessary in order to exclude heart failure. I would also recommend checking thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction and blood electrolytes. Depression cannot be excluded either. If all the above tests result normal, I would recommend consulting with a specialist in this field. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

In the left leg there s a smaller aneurysm which even got smaller over the last 10months and is said to be stable (that s why I m allowed Ascal now). I would like to pick up my favo hobby again... which is scubadiving. Do you think I ll be safe doing so??? A depth restriction could be an idea?? Your reply will be much appreciated, Thx in advance, Rob Maller (The Netherlands)","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Scuba diving is a stressful activity for your body, but besides the physical activity, it imposes a severe pressure change to your anatomical structures, increasing even more the risk of bleeding from an aneurysm rupture. Taking ascal, may be safe for a normal situation, but may increase the risk of aneurysm rupture during scuba diving stress. There are not many studies related to scuba diving and aneurysms. Unruptured aneurysms, when in small diameters, have shown good results even when not treated with surgery (they have a low probability or bleeding, when unruptured).This is not a brain aneurysm, and I think that you can perform this activity with some restrictions regarding the depth of the diving, to avoid extreme pressure changes. (I would not recommend this activity in case of brain aneurysm, because the devastating consequences of possible intracranial hemorrhage). I recommend monitoring closely your blood pressure, before and after this activity and treat possible high blood pressure. Hope to have been of help!Greetings! Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hai, sir,I am 55 year old lady. I got high BP two weeks before and my doctor prescribed tablet for BP and Anxit 0.25 for 10 days.

Please help me out....","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, your symptoms may be related to depression or any metabolic disorder. Anxit is a drug which can help you with anxiety (anxiolytic drug). I recommend consulting with your ophtalmologist for a careful physical examination, to exclude other ocular causes of blurring vision. A routine blood test (for chronic anemia), kidney and liver function tests, blood sugar, blood electrolytes and thyroid hormone levels, to rule out other metabolic causes of this symptomatology. If all the above mentioned tests, result normal, I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist and consider the possibility of starting an antidepressant.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Olmesartan (Olmezest) is a drug from the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) family. This family is safe and effective to be used with the aim to control the blood pressure. If I would be your doctor, I would choose a beta-blocker as a first-lıne treatment, beacues they also reduce heart workload, beside lowering the blood pressure. It is a matter of choice, and I do not have anything opposite to the current therapy you are on, as long as the blood pressure levels are under control. As for the liver function profile, they have to be increased at least two-fold above the upper normal range, in order to be sought a pathological process. There are many food and beverages, especially alcohol, sometimes even in small amount, that raise the liver function enzymes. So, I think there is nothing to worry about. However, I would recommend you to run these tests again after three or six months. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Kınd regards.

Did you rested for about 5 -10 mins after reaching the doctor and then checked BP? because if not then your BP will show increased valueThere is a entity called white coat hypertension in which BP goes high while checking BP but otherwise its normal.Are you overweight? If yes then also it can cause increase in your BP. I would suggest you to check BP at your local doctor or better at home in resting condition. If that is high you need to modify your lifestyle in eating healthier food and exercising regularly.If you have any more query kindly revert me back.

I can feel it when it does and it makes my chest feel funny and makes me tired.  It comes and goes.  It just started doing it again a couple of weeks ago.  It hasn't done it for about a couple of years now all of a sudden its back.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. This extra heart beat, with highest probability, is what we call extrasystole (a skipped heart beat). It is a premature heart beat that is generated from another area of the heart, not from the normal pacemaker of the heart. After this, there is a pause, as the heart \\"resets\\" and the next beat if more forceful and perceived from the individual experiencing it. This is called a palpitation. They can happen when you are tired, when you exerted vigorously, when you have had alcoholic beverages, and they can happen to anyone. In most of cases, they are totally benign. However, it is not a good sign if they happen often. Therefore, I would recommend you a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor, to check how many times these phenomena happen throughout a day, and if they exceed the \\"normal\\" limit, proper treatment should be started. My opinion is that you should not hold back from everyday activity. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Wish you a good health.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. Everything in medicine, from pharmacological to procedural interventions have their risks. Now, if the operator's first recommendation was to pursue the bypass road, then I would agree, because we have certain scoring systems which help our everyday benefit/risk decisions. Bare metal stents have a probability of 16% to develop in-stent narrowing, and drug eluting stents have a probability of 4% to develop this event. The more stents are put in coronary arteries, the greater the risk of developing in-stent narrowing. Also, the lesser the diameter of the stent, the greater the risk of developing this event. All the patients that we recommend for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be resolved with stents. But, it is this risk that make us recommend CABG. On the other hand, CABG patients have higher risk perioperatively, but the long-standing benefits in survival, symptom relief and quality of life are close between the two procedures, and better with CABG, when there are several blockages in the coronary arteries, because of the risks I explained above. Although, I cannot be clear-cut or the decision-maker to whether one procedure is better than the other in this case, as I have not seen the angiogram film, I would suggest you to follow your invasive cardiologist's advice. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Good luck.

This can make you prone to early onset DM.Patients with LBBB require complete cardiac evaluation, and those with LBBB and syncope or near-syncope may require a pacemaker.Probable causes of LBBB in your case are either an occluded coronary artery or intrinsic disease of the conduction system.Since Holter ECG is normal, primary conduction disorders can be reasonably ruled out.To screen for blocking coronaries, I strongly recommend Coronary angiogram-CAG and highlight the need for temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation.Check with your cardiologist if he shares a similar opinion.Post your further queries if any,Thank you."},{"Patient":"hi I wanted to know I started working night shifts about a week ago and right now I get really dizzy and light headed, my heart beats really hard and fast out of nowhere and this has been going on for some time.

The femoral artery is used to retrogradely go to the aorta and the coronary arteries to check them if there are blockages or not. The punction site can be considered healed in the first 48 hours. In our clinic's experience, the patient who underwent the angiogram via the femoral pathway is advised to assume a lying position, without moving the leg, for 12 hours. Thereafter he/she can stand up, and for 24 hours should ambulate by not giving angles to the leg of pucntion. After 48 hours, to be sure, even showering and light to moderate activity are allowed.

I do track my blood pressure on an app and it has been averaging 118/78 the past nine months (resting heart-rate 58-62), and my cholesterol is between 180-230 (pending if I actually fast properly). My doctor told me to keep to my normal activity and if it persists after a few weeks, he will schedule an appointment with a cardiologist for further testing. It does not hurt, interfere with my breathing, or slow-down my workouts (cross-fit/P90X type of routines). I do remember over a week ago, I had something lodge in my lower throat (very deep) and was hard to breath for about 15 minutes, and it finally passed (not sure what I was eating).

However as it not causing any significant dizziness or other issues it's mostly benign in nature.  A 24 hour holter would be the best test to see what the reason is as you have described that it's transient and lasting for some second and so ecg would be unable to record.

Fever causes the body to produce a number of chemicals that could excite the heart which leads to atrial flutter.You should take care of your fever first as in most cases when fever is treated the flutter goes away. However if it is still present then you may consult a doctor for an evaluation of the cause of flutter.Atrial flutters are in most cases benign and do not cause any significant hemodynamic problems and hence as such do not require any treatment.

Your cardiologist is right that any procedure would be more damaging to your brother as his heart is functioning at a very low level. As far as surgery is concerned his low EF already makes him a very high risk candidate for surgery.He has correctly advised you for an ICD as the major threat to his life is an arrhythmia that tends to occur more with weak hearts.

He has also put him on anti platelets that would prevent any further heart attacks.You have to understand that your brother now requires utmost care and various life style modifications including:1. Total fluid intake should not exceed 1.2 L per day.2. His urine output should be aerial to his fluid intake so as to prevent any fluid from collecting in the body.3. He should restrict his salt intake to less than 2300 mg per day.4. He should have a low fat low salt diet. Consult a dietician for a detailed diet plan.5.

His symptoms don't seem to be cardiac related. But I recommend consulting with his attending physician for a careful examination, a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound, to examine better his cardiac function (based on the fact that he has suffered a heart attack in the past and has stopped taking all the medications). I also recommend performing a fibrogastroscopy (for his excessive burping, which may be related to a stomach disorder), and a routine blood test, Doppler ultrasound of the leg and neck vessels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes. I would also advise to closely monitor his blood pressure. Headaches are often caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure. Hope to have been of help!Greetings!

These are normal values of blood pressure, and are not causing your symptomatology. The fact that you have forgotten to take your medications, has not influenced very much on your blood pressure (we should expect a higher blood pressure, caused by the lack of the antihypertensive therapy effect).I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful examination, a routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes. A Doppler ultrasound of the neck vessels would be necessary to examine the blood flow to the brain and detect possible stenosis of carotid and vertebral arteries. A cervical spondylarthrosis can cause a similar clinical scenario at your age. So a cervical spine x ray is needed to exclude this. Meanwhile, I recommend to take plenty of water. A good hydration is the best in hot weather.Hope to have been of help!Greetings!

She has no record of any heart diseases, but she have had really little hours of sleep recently.Thank you.Best RegardsKoo","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, if this hard heart beat is also associated sometimes with a shortness of breath, combining with the lack of sleep and/or with the usage of energetic drinks or other caffeine-containing beverages, it most probably is an extrasystole (''skıpped'' heart beat). In young ages and when they are not usual phenomenons within a day, there is nothing to worry about. Stressful moments in life, physical or psychological, can be associated with extrasystoles. If this is a worrisome event to her and to you, I recommend her to be put on a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor, to determine exactly what are these phenomenons, and if they are present, are there enough episodes a day to warrant treatment (because there is a cut-off line in the number of extrasystoles that can be tolerated). Instead, there is the option of the episode rhythm monitor - a machine who can be turned on and off by user, when he/she experiences the symptom. When the readings are ready, I suggest you to consult a cardiologist or feel free to ask me again. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"hi, my mother has just had a stent put in one of her arteries. This was done yesterday morning. Since then she complained of chest pains, and now she says she has a mild fever. At emergency this morning they told her that her heart is ok after an ecg and the surgeon couldn't find any reason for concern.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. If the chest pain you are referring to is of same intensity with the pain that brought her to the hospital, then this could be worrying. There is a probability of stent blockage during first 48 hours after implatantion. But, if something would be wrong with the stent, it would have been shown on the EKG. If these are pains more like pinprick or slight stabbing sensation, it is normal after stent placement. I would recommend that she is checked with EKG every two hours. Then she will have cardiac stress tests after 1, 3, and 6 months after stent placement. As about the mild fever, it is the general state of a patient suffering from any disturbance, which engages the whole organism to fighting it. However, I would recommend a complete blood count to check if there are hıgh white blood cells present. I hope I was helpful. Wish you a good health. Best regards. Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Hello, I'm experiencing a discomfort in my heart area every time I breathe in. It's a sharp pain and it really hurts at times. I first had this after my workout and have been having it all day. I'm not sure if this is normal, I'm a little worried that it is something serious, can anyone help me?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Anginal pain (chest pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries) is characterized more by a heaviness or tenderness in the midchest, and it it not affected by the inspiration-expiration cycle. It also has other properties, but this is to refer to your complaints. To determine this sharp pain you are having then we must search other potential culprits. If it happened after a workout where there was clear pectoral muscle involvement or workout that requires heavy breathing, then the highest probability is that this pain comes from the intercostal (between ribs) muscles and/or other chest structures of the locomotion system. Another possibility is that this pain can come from acute or chronic inflammation of the organ linings within the chest, such as pericardial (the sac that surrounds the heart) or pleural (the sac that surrounds the lungs) ınflammation. In order to rule these diagnoses out, I would suggest an EKG and echocardiogram for the eventual pericardial origin, and a plain posterior-anterior and lateral chest X-ray. I hope I was of help. Take care. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Hello doc! I m a little bit worried about my blood pressure reading in morning around 98/55, in noon time 113/65 and in evening 95/45 i m monitoring my BP for about 3weeks and everyday the result is desame. Should i start to worry about it. thank you in advance!","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question. Welcome to HCM. I wıll try to address your concern. First, your age would have helped. Internationally, blood pressure fıgures standardızed as normal are 100-139/60-89 mmHg. These readings do not seem so low as they look. You should be aware that blood pressure is a variable that is target to constant changes in psychological, physiological and hormonal states in the human organism, and it can fluctuate in every human body. I do not have information to what circumstances you had your blood pressure measured, but every action that can cause arteries to dilate, can also lower the blood pressure. Since these figures are worrisome to you, I would suggest you to be put on a 24-hour blood pressure monitor, a machine attached to your body, and periodically measuring your blood pressure. I think we can get more accurate figures by this action. When the readings are back, you can clarify them with your cardiologist or feel free to ask again. Last, but not least, if you do not experience any symptoms, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness etc., when these figures are registered, my opinion is that there is nothing to worry about. I hope I was helpful with my asnwer. Take care. Greetings, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My mum has chd and heart function is now 20%.Meds didn t work only made her stomach sick.I know the stages of chf but what I m looking for is a time frame.Once fluid starts to build, how long until kidney failure? How long from kidney failure until heart stops?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Every organ system can fail when the cardiac insufficiency is present, i.e. her heart pumps only 20% of its content in a single systole, while 55-70% is normal. Which means this heart works only 20% to satisfy every system organs, needs for oxygen and nutrient. Kidneys fail because they are a subject or sacrifice, in order that other vital organs keep going. However, we would only speculate if I gave you an exact or approximate time or longlivety or such patients. The thing that is known is that there is no regression, only slow or fast progression of the disease, depending on the medical, pharmacological and diet measures. Therefore, she should not eat salt at all, because it retains water, and it is estimated that 1 g of salt retains 10 g of water. She should not perform physical activity, other then everyday life duties and activities. If there is shortness of breath and swelling even doing those activities, then she should be bedridden and/or in oxygen. Besides medication taken for the ischemic heart disease, there should also be furosemide, spironolacton and inotropic agents, ıf necessary. Furthermore, this enlarged heart, has its muscle cells stretched and separated from each other and there is deposition of non-functional, fibrotic tissue, whereas in a normal heart muscle cells are in close neighbourhood and connected through channels with each other, with no fibrotic tissue between them. Therefore, this enlarged heart is a subject for malignant, serious, potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A further discussion should be carried out with her cardiologist to assess the possibility of implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrilator (ICD) to prevent death from these arrhythmias. I hope I was thorough with my answer. Take care. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My 15 yr old daughter has pains in her heart that's the word she describes best for it ,now and again while been stood felt  dizzy and fallen to the floor , I've been to the doctors who sent us for an ECG this test came back fine so what else could it be?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. EKG is a test that refers mostly to the changes in heart electrical system, caused by the heart muscle. My recommendation is that right now you should proceed to do an echocardiogram to assess the heart muscle and the valvular apparatus function, also. Although, this is a harg age when she can be subject to a lot of stressful events during a day. The episode of falling to the floor, wıthout losing consciousness I assume, is probably a sudden drop of blood pressure due to brisk switching positions, usually from lying or sitting down to standing up position. However, I suggest you to proceed to echocardiogram, in order to clarify the very little amount of suspicion I have. I hope I was helpful. Take care.

Anyway, before coming to this conclusion, I would recommend performing some tests: - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to examine her heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia - pulmonary function tests in order to exclude a lung disorder - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - blood electrolytes for possible imbalance. You should discuss with her doctor on the above tests. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a condition that should be maintained under tight control, ı.e. under 140/90 mmHg, because there are a lot of studies that confirm that a long-standing, above these figures, blood pressure produces other organ damages, such as kidneys and eyes. Therefore, ıf the fıgures you provided are constant findings, this is a sign that an another blood pressure-controlling drug should be added to your therapy. I would recommend you a beta-blocker, which not only lower the blood pressure, but also reduce the heart rate, thus the cardiac workload is reduced.Combining your age and hypertension, you have at least two known risk factors for coronary artery disease. So, by the body of studies that exist, aspirin should be added to your therapy as a primary prevention (I assume by blood thinners you meant aspirin). The thing with the minimally leaking valve is not to worry about, at least at this moment. It may become an issue after several years, or never. I recommend you to discuss with your cardiologist the possibility of adding these two drugs to your regimen. And, last, I suggest you to run blood levels of total cholesterol, LDL and HDL fractions, and triglycerides. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards. Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Yes I just had an electrical type sensation in my chest I reached for my cell phone in my pocket but it was not there or even in the room it instantly woke me up iv not felt good today my heart was beating hard at the time  and numbness was in my hands what could this be?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. It could easily be a simple intercostal muscle twitching, that resembles like coming from the heart. It tends to happen after exercise and/or any physical activity that includes heavy breathing and/or after episodes of drinking alcohol. However, I would recommend you to do an EKG, and depending on that and your sensation, a 24-hour rhythm monitor, to exclude any possible bout of any kind of arrhythmia. Also, your blood calcium levels should be measured. As for the other part, heart beats very hard in stressful situations, both psychological and physiological. My opinion is that this came as a very worrisome phenomenon to you, and the stress and anxiety from it happening again, produced the other symptoms. Please, run the tests I recommended above and discuss the results further with a general practitioner. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Kind regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My husband was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in February. Since then they had a heart monitor on him for 30 days and have done and MRI and a couple of ultrasounds. In March his heart was functioning at 24%, in April at 20% and May now at 19%. We are told the only option is a pacemaker with a defibrillator. Are there any other options? He is a truck driver and would lose his CDL due to the ICD.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. A heart muscle such severely damaged, that produces 19% of function ıs an enlarged, or dilated, heart. Normal heart muscle cells are in close neighbourhood with each-other and even communicate with tight ion channels. In the case of an enlarged heart, the stretch that is imposed on the heart muscle, makes these cells move away from each-other, and this space between them is replaced with non-functional, non electricıty conductive fibrotic tissue. This is the hallmark that makes these hearts prone to severe, serious, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, which can be triggered at any moment. Therefore, my opinion also is that an implantable cardioverter-defibrilator (ICD) should be placed, to prevent death from these arrhythmias, should they occur. The other alternative is maximizing the antiarrhythmic medication to prevent teh ocurrence of arrhythmias, although at this figures of heart function they can be effective only in a certain amount. My opinion is that even if he does not undergo a ICD placement, he will have his license lost, because of the high risk of these arrhythmias. I hope I was helpful and I clarified your dilemmas.

Doctor said this is a normal variant for him and doesn't need any further investigation.  Should we get another opinion and if this is repolorization can this be corrected or is possible it will self correct.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. This ST elevation, found particularely in young people, wıth an upper slope deflection, is called early repolarization or accelerated repolarization. No harm comes from that, it ,s a variant of normal. This can be easily mistaken by some doctors as acute myochardial ischemia, but I, as your doctor, would tell you that there is nothing to worry about. As for the hert rate, it is considered normal from 60 - 100 beats per minute. However, in young people, highly trained athletes and vigorous physically active people, it is accepted down to 48 per minutes, referred on most studies. So, this is another thing you should now worry about. Should frequencies lower than 40 beats per minute occur, consult your cardiologist. I hope I was helpful. Wish him a good health.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. All the symptoms, like tightness in your throat, thirst etc. are part of the anxiety you experienced from an episode that was new and worrying to you. This is a property of all types of anxieties. Therefore, I think you should fall back asleep with no worries, should this happen again. Because, during sleep happens a phase that is called rapid eye movement (REM) phase. To put it simple, this is the phase during which dreams occur and it is characterized by a flush of adrenalin and noradrenalin in the system, hence the high heart rate. Some colleagues like to call it ''the nightmare heart rate''. My opinion is that there is nothing to worry about. I hope I was helpful. Best regards.

I generally treat my patients with oral tablets of Pantoprazole. I suggest you to please see a doctor if his views are same and if can prescribe these drugs for you.Definitive management depends upon treating the underlying cardiac arrhythmia with medical management and if necessary institution of a temporary or a permanent pacemaker to counteract nocturnal hypotension.I advise you to have a cardiac work-up at the earliest.

Just feel exhausted like I can t do anything. Please help","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Every heart attack means that a part of the heart loses a part of its function or that part ''dies''. There is a total coronary artery blockage that causes that heart attack. If that artery ıs opened within 2 hours, ideally, even within 6 to 12 hours, that part of heart muscle can have a benefit on returning to its function, maybe not entirely, but some of its function surely dies. If these heart attacks you experienced have weakened your heart muscle, then we can say that cardiac failure was installed, hence your symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath etc. If the stent is put within the time I described above then that part of ''stunned'' cardiac muscle, may take up to 6 months to recover itself. Therefore, I would suggest an echocardiogram should have been or should be performed now, to assess the remaining function of the heart, and it is only then we can determine to what strategy to use for treatment and what king of physical activity you should engage. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

Xray shows prominent aotic knuckle but no other findings. I am on hbp drugs (artacand-plus, metoprolol and aspirin) for over 3 yrs now. I am a man and is 46yrs old. My esr is 5 mm/ min and my lymphocyte is 50, other lab results are within normal limit. I am on piriton expectorant for the past 3 days with little relief. I get more relief if i sip juice or swallow my saliva regularly. Please can you help. Gil","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your questıon and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. The blood pressure lowering agent you are using, candesartan, is a part of angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) drug family. This particular class, among other effects, by blocking the above mentioned enzyme, build up bradykinin. The latter stimulates and triggers cough. It is estimated that up to 15% of patients using this class of drugs, experience dry cough as a side effect. I would recommend you to switch to a class with almost identical properties and effects, minus the cough, which is the class of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB: losartan, eprosartan, olmesartan). I suggest you to discuss with your cardiologist about the dosage and frequency of usage. Dry cough should subside within three weeks after discontinuing candesartan. I hope I was helpful. Best regards. Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"My mother is 80 years old and suffers from high blood pressure. She has been having Angizaar h for this condition for many years. Today her bp was 180 by 110 and the doctor has prescribed Nicardia Retard 20 mg to be had in addition to the Angizaar. Is this safe?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I read your query and understood your concern. These are very high blood pressure figures for a person who is under treatment to control it. Blood pressure at this age should be kept under 135/85 mmHg, assuming that she does not suffer from other co-morbidities. There is nothing wrong with this combination, it is a safe and effective combination. If I would be her doctor, I would suggest a beta-blocker more than a calcium channel blocker with a slow release. Beta-blockers are effective in lowering the blood pressure and reducing the heart workload. I also would suggest a visit to the ophthalmologist (the eye doctor), since a fundoscopy test should be in place. Also, I recommend running some liver and kidney fuction tests: urea, creatinine, AST, ALT, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. These suggestions are more to follow to wich grade is the harm done by long-standing hıgh blood pressure. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Feel free to contact again.

Waking up is a kind of stressful activity for the human body, because you change your situation from silence and deep rest to daily activity full of stimuli.  Physical exercise can help you manage better this physiological changes, and reduce tachycardia. I recommend continuing to perform physical activity, as it is very helpful for good function of all your organs and your mind.

The first time was yesterday when I was getting gas for my truck and almost passed out. I became extremely shaky and couldn t walk straight. I went home and had my roommate drive me to the ER.

I have to work in a couple days and cannot afford to loose my job, please help me understand what s going on. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Your symptoms may be related to an inner ear problem. Are your dizzy spells triggered by the head movements?As you refer all your lab tests have resulted normal. I would recommend to consult with the ENT specialist and perform an electronystagmography and labyrinthine test to exclude the inner ear as a possible cause of this symptomatology. Another issue is your blood pressure. An orthostatic hypotension would cause lightheadedness and dizzy spells, exacerbated by standing up. A head up tilt test would be useful to rule out this possible disorder. Meanwhile I recommend betahistine twice daily for some days.

Please help me find out what my problem is! Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that there are many physiological causes of facial flushing, such as a heightened emotional state or eating spicy food. Several medical conditions are also linked to skin flushing such as : a) Rosacea is a skin condition that may produce swelling, redness, and acne-like sores. While the cause of rosacea is unknown, inflammation of the blood vessels from stress, spicy foods, and hot temperatures may worsen the condition. Fair-skinned females between the ages of 30 and 50 are the most susceptible. b) Thyroid dysfunction. I recommend performing the thyroid hormone levels to rule out this possibility. c) Carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by skin flushing and intermittent diarrhea. It is caused by pathological high levels of serotonine. d) An autoimmune syndrome, like a connective tissue disorder can cause skin flushing and hypersensitivity to the light. e) Alcohol intake is also a known factor causing face flushing. Several drugs have been associated to face flushing. I recommend consulting with the GP and a routine blood test, inflammation tests ( fibrinogen, PCR, sedimentation), kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, thyroid hormone levels, cortisol plasma levels and the urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) to exclude the above possibilities.  I would also advise to consult with a dermatologist for a careful physical examination with the dermatoscope.

I would like to know your age and your past medical history. Have you measured your body temperature during the episodes of shaking and sweating?I recommend consulting with the GP and performing a careful physical examination, a routine blood test, blood sugar, inflammation tests (fibrinogen, PCR, sedimentation), kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, cortisol and thyroid hormone plasma levels, to try to find any possible cause. Further specific tests for infection diseases ( like HIV, Wright, Widal , Lyme, etc) may be necessary to exclude any possible cause if suspicions are raised by the above tests.

She had hip surgery a week ago. Her voice is very hoarse and I was wondering if this could be a symptom of her chronic heart failure? She also has COPD, and is now in a rehab facility. She does receive several breathing treatments a day, both at the rehab facility and when at home. Lots of meds. Thanks.","Doctor":"Thank you for your question.According to the details provided by you, your mother is suffering from heart failure with copd. And now she has an associated hoarseness of voice. Does she have cough at present? Or difficulty in swallowing? It would be prudent to visit an ENT specialist in order to check her throat and rule out any problems there. The use of an Endotracheal tube to help her to breathe during anaesthesia in surgery can also cause hoarseness of voice which can last upto 3 or 4 weeks. This too can be confirmed by an ENT specialist.  A chest Xray may also help to rule out any other causes.In certain situations, the nerve to her voice organ or the larynx may be pressed upon by something leading to hoarsness. Again an Xray may help wit this. One other situation you should bear in mind is that since she has heart failure, her heart is probable dilated or swollen. Sometimes ( though rarely) an enlarged heart may press upon her voice organ nerve leading to hoarseness of voice (this is called Ortner's syndrome).If I were your mothers physician I would get an ENT opinion as well as a chest Xray. Further investigations maybe needed according to the discretion of your physician.I hope this will help you to take a decision regarding further management for your mother.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Electrocardıography (EKG) ıs a test done to evaluate the electrical state of the heart muscle. When the heart muscles suffers from a problem, mostly helpful in coronary artery blockages which do not provide enough supply with oxygen and nutrients to it, heart muscle cells start to suffer.

I am concerned with the risks that are inherent to this procedure and any othe information in deciding to choose this route as both of these conditions exist in my heart, sometimes simultaneously.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for writing.I can understand your concern and would try to help you in the best possible way. The procedure is called Radio Frequency Ablation(RFA). It is done by getting an intravascular access just like an angiography. But instead of injecting a dye, a transducer is inserted and various areas of the cardiac conduction tissues are stimulated and ECG is observed. If feels show some abnormal discharge it is recorded in the ECG and the area is ablated by radio waves.It is done as a permanent cure for various types or cardiac arrhythmias like AFib, WPW  and others. I advice you to get in touch with your cardiologist and discuss with him regarding the procedure if it is necessary in your case or not.I would not be able to comment wether it is right for you to go for the procedure as i have your limited medical history with me. So your cardiologist would be a better guy to comment about it."},{"Patient":"Having heart palpitations (feels like extra or skipped beat) for last two weeks straight everyday more than a few times a day. Never happened before. In the past only getting an occasional palpitation once in a blue moon. After first week of palpitations started getting chest pain or discomfort also in upper back ( like how it feels after your muscles hurt from exercise) and dwelling anxious from it all. EKG yesterday said it was normal except for slower heart rate (59 compared to last years EKG 60). Had a physical 3 months ago and everything seemed pretty normal. Doc suggested a chest X-ray eventually and Xanax. She thinks its anxiety or stress and I would have agreed with her normally only with the heart palpitations I don t feel like its that since I ve had a lot of past anxiety over the years but I ve never had these consistent palpitations and its pretty scary. I feel like the anxiety im experiencing now is just due to being scared about the palpitations and the fear and paranoia of something more serious?

Your problems do not seem to be of cardiac origin as your EKG and other tests are normal. Your doctor may be right that it is due to anxiety or panic attacks. One more possibility could be an overactive thyroid which can be ruled out by a thyroid profile testing.I suggest you can speak to your GP regarding that plan the test accordingly. I would also advice you that you are in a good health right now. try to divert your mind away from illness. Start some exercise program like walking, gymming and also share quality time with your family. It would definitely help you stay fit and divert your mind of all unnecessary thoughts."},{"Patient":"I have a cough that is producing some phlegm and has been going on for about 3 days.

Is this something I need to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for writing.I can understand your concern and would try to help you in the best possible way.Sometimes due to a stress or illness the heart may skip a beat or two. It is most often inconsequential.However if it is causing distress to you or symptoms like palpitations, dizziness, chest discomfort then it is better to get it checked up. A simple ECG goes a long way to detect them. If not detected by ECG then a 24 hour ECG recording with Holter may be required to catch these abnormal beats.I advice you not to think about is much and avoid any stress. Also consult a doctor to get yourself checked."},{"Patient":"I blood pressure has been running high all yesterday and this morning 164/104 last night this morning 146/104. I just check it again 136/92 so it goin down but my head is killing me. I took my blood pressure medicine but it s a beta blocker time released.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your questıon and welcome to HCM. I read your query. As I can understand you are already diagnosed with hıgh blood pressure or hypertension and you are treating it with a beta-blocker. In a patient. without any other risk factors or co-morbidities, target blood pressure figures are under 140/90 mmHg. Once it is diagnosed, hypertension should be fought and kept within the above mentioned range, so it cannot produce further end-organ damages. However, these blood pressure fluctuations are normal, sınce it is a constant ''target'' of various hormonal, physıological and psychological changes that happen in the span of one single day. I am not worried about fluctuations. I am worried more about the high figures, even though you are already on hypertension treatment. Therefore, I would be recommend you to be put on a second drug for controlling your blood pressure. I would prefer a drug from the angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) class. You can further discuss this option with your cardiologist. I hope I was helpful. Wish you a good health.

I willl soon undergo the 3d echo, stress test, and holter monitoring. i am scared ..will the doctor suggest a catherization?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. EKG can be suggestive for a remote or a recent myocardial ınfarction, but it is the echocardiogram that can confirm this with higher probability, by assesing the left ventricle wall motion. If I were your doctor, I would have strongly advısed a coronary angıogram. Even if this is cardiac ischemıa and even if it is a remote infarction, it is reasonable to search for other problems within the coronary arteries. If the thing that is scaring you is the procedure itself, I would suggest you no to be scared. There is no such procedure in medicine that is carrıed out with 0 risk. You will be informed in details about the procedure ın your informed consent. You will feel a little pinch which would be the local anaesthesia, and then you will not feel a thing. My opinion remains that there is a strong indication for coronary angiogram in these cases, to depict any problems should they be present and treat them, should the treatment be needed. In the end, recommendations are doctors', the body is yours, so it is your decision. I hope I was helpful. Good luck.

When I stand up I get dizzy feel really weak and my eye sight starts to go black then it wil pass as fast as it came most of the time that is","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. This condition, as you described it, is called orthostatic hypotension. Simply put, it means a significant drop in blood pressure when switching position. This almost invariably happens when people stand up from sitting or lying position to the upright position which the body assumes. There are a lot of changes that happen in vasculature tonus and fluıd redistribuition in these situations. Therefore, you should stand up wıth caution. I recommend you to switch positions every one or two minutes, which means to gradually stand up, not briskly. So, from lying down go to sitting up position and stand that way for one to two minutes, then easıly stand up. My opinion is that such episodes will not happen again. The blood pressure figures you provided are within normal range. If you are on blood lowering-drugs, I suggest you to discuss the dosage and frequency of taking the dosage, with your curing doctor. I think that some adjustments should be made, if you suffer from blood pressure fluctuations and if these fluctuations affect your quality of life. I hope I was helpful. Take care.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Angio computed tomography (CT) of the chest can reveal also problems in the coronary arteries. Although, this is a test that has a high negative predictive value and almost none of the positive predictive value for coronary arteries. This means that if in CT there are no problems ın the coronary arteries, then we can say there is no coronary artery disease. But, if CT is at least suspicious for an atherosclerotic process in the coronary arteries, then a coronary angiogram should be performed, to further evaluate the coronary atherosclerotic process and, if needed, to treat it. This is to what matters about the coronary atherosclerosis shown in the CT scan. I hope I was helpful. Take care.

So, in my opinion, it is not the only cause of the myocardial infarction, but when coupled with other cardiovascular risks such as age, an unhealthy lifestyle, smoking, diabetes or hypertension, it can lead to an increased risk for a heart attack or stroke.

Recommended starting dose of captopril is 25 mg twice  day to be taken one hour before meals. A few precautions have to be taken with this medication:1. Measure your BP at least twice a day. It may cause hypotension on beginning treatment.2. Watch out for dry cough or metallic taste.3.

Is this to me expected with MVP?","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM. Thank you for your question. I understand your conern. First, I suppose your doctor also informed you that lisinopril does not exert such effect like lowering the heart rate, thus reducing the palpitations. Also, lisinopril and other ''prils'' can cause dry cough as a side effect. I am assuming you had high blood pressure and that is why your doctor prescribed lisinopril. In this point that we are standing, I would recommend you to do an EKG, to clear what these palpitations are; an echocardiogram to re-evaluate your mitral valve prolapse and if it is causing mitral regurgitation (returning of the blood through the mitral valve during systole, when it is normally shut) and, if so, what grade is it and does it correlate with symptoms; also, a 24-hour Holter rhythm registration, to see how often the palpitations do happen during a day. It is only when these tests are performed, you can discuss treatment strategies with your curing doctor. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Feel free to contact me again.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. This is a common and, almost always, a harmless problem. Due to insertion of the needle for anaesthesia, cannula and sheath, there are less or more leaks of blood in the area, throughout the procedure. It commonly happens after the extraction of the sheath, through which is the procedure carried out. Most often, it happens in people of both extremes, underweight or overweight, not excluding that it can happen to anybody. So, it looks just lıke a common bruise. If it is big, I recommend you to conduct an echo Doppler of the femoral artery, to see if this hematoma (the bruise) communicates with the artery and/or has established any pseudoaneurysm. But, if it is small, it will eventually clear by itself. To heal it faster, you can apply any heparin-based lotion locally. I hope I was helpful. Take care.

Thank you for your questıon and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. The combination of Losartan with Hydrochlorthiazide is a good, effective and safe strategy used for treating high blood pressure. There is no medication known which carries a 0% risk when it is used. Judging from the beneficiary point of vıew, then it is absolutely safe to use this combination. Not that this is not a good strategy to treat hypertension, since it is proven effective, but, if I were your doctor, I would recommend any drug from a class that has also heart rate-lowering properties, which help reducing the heart's workload. These classes are beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Another thing to be said, once the dıagnosis of hypertension is properly determined, strategy of controlling it continues for a lifetime.

Lisinopril usually does not cause significant liver injury. If your GGT is raised only and ALT/AST is more or less normal, it can be explained by alcohol.

The blood pressure should be kept within normal range, i.e. under 140/90 mmHg. Therefore, I recommend you to discuss with your treating cardiologist or internal medicine specialist, to lower your blood pressure. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitors would be a reasonable approach, at this moment. As for the varicous veins, I cannot conclusively say that this pain is caused from this condition. Even if it is a blood clot, it could be accompanied also with coldness and/or numbness and/or discoloration of the extremity. However, my opinion is that you should undergo an echo Doppler of the leg arteries and/or an angio computed tomography with contrast, of the blood vessels of the leg. I suggest you to further consult a vascular surgeon, to determine the stage of varicous veins, and plan further treatment, because the strategy of the treatment depends on the stage of this condition.

Besides the obvious origins of leg pain, such as bad position or trauma or impact, I would suggest you to explore the vascular side of the problem, to find out whether there is one or not. Do you suffer from varicous veins (swollen calf veins)? I recommend you to do an echo Doppler study of the lower extremities, also a angio computed tomography with contrast agent, of this region. It is because of the blockages in your coronary arteries, no matter what percentage they are, which is an indicator that the atherosclerotic process is present in your body.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, if the cardiac check-up came back fine, then we can exclude cardiac origin as the culprit of this situation. You are young to have angina, though it is not impossible. Therefore, I would recommend you to do a cardiac stress test, which has a high probability on confirming or excluding the coronary artery origin of this problem. On the other hand, the other problems you reported, can come from a common situation which is called deviatio septi nasi. Septum nasi is located inside the nose, on the upper side, and is found deviated or deformed in a large number of people worldwide. It is totally benign and harmless. But, when it is deformed, it blocks the discharge route of one of the sinuses. It results in liquid accumulation within the sinus, its walls become inflammated, hence the headache, nose congestion and sinusitis.

Your dad has a history of coronary artery disease with low Ejection fraction. This means that his heart is weaker than normal and can pump with 38% efficiency. A normal heart can pump with around 55-60% efficiency. This puts him under risk of chronic heart failure in the long run. He would require extra care which includes:1. Keep a strict water intake and output balance to avoid fluid built up in the body.2. Reduce daily salt intake to less than 2300 mg/day.3. Take regular exercise being careful not to overexert. A sing test is very convenient way to test this. He should walk or exercise only till the time he can sing along. If he has any breathlessness doing it he should stop immediately to rest.4. He should take certain medication which reduce long term mortality like beta blockers, aspirin, statins, ace inhibitors and others. Consult your cardiologist regarding this.5. Any chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath has to be evaluated with a physician.As far as left nipple burning is concerned it could be a local thing and would be advisable to be followed up by a doctor."},{"Patient":"I have had constant, dull lower left quadrant pain for almost 4 months now.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for writing.I can understand your concern and would try to help you in the best possible way.The elevated IgE levels mean that you are allergic to some thing however it cannot tell you what you are allergic to. For that a skin test or allergen specific IgE test has to be done. Your abdominal pain and tingling in hands or feet may be related or even be two separate entities. A complete history and physical examination would be required for getting to a diagnosis. Some relevant examination like CBC, stool examination, USG or even scopy may be required to get to a diagnosis.I suggest you consult a physician who would help you with a diagnostic workup and appropriate management plan."},{"Patient":"My heart was beating erratically in my chest that it was moving my chest on it's own and my throat started to feel like it was tightening.

Any stress or tension or physical exertion puts additional load on the heart which is manifested as increased work done by the heart. For this it requires a good blood supply. If this supply is lacking in any sense like in your husband's case the heart is not able to cope up with additional stress and would cause these troubles. So this is my sincere advice to you to avoid any stress, emotional turmoil or exertion.I suggest you consult a physician for blood in vomit as it is a red flag and needs further diagnostic evaluation to get to its cause.

First of all relax and do not take any undue stress. Your heart rate is absolutely normal. In conditioned individuals various changes in body occur that help the patient to cope up with physiological changes during the exercise. Low heart rate when exerting means your heart is in a good condition and is not being exerted unduly. The only precaution that has to be taken is not to exert yourself too much so that you start having breathlessness, palpitations, chest pain or any other problems.In professional athletes the resting heart rate is such that it may be considered abnormal for a normal person. A good example that I quote often is lance armstrong who had a resting heart rate of 35-40 bp due to his conditioned body. You may google it up for further information.So enjoy your workout and do not trust the machines too much."},{"Patient":"Hi there I am a 20 year old male from UK, I found out I have wholf Parkinson s white syndrome about 18 months ago but I have been smoking weed for about 6 years now, I used to get palpitations when I was about 16 I had a quick surgery on it and it s worked great never got them since but sometimes my heart jumps out of rhythm and it s starting to worry me now I quit from October last year till this April that s gone then I got into smoking again but I have had a apifany I don t want to continue if it s gunna make me have a higher risk of dying thank you","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for writing.I can understand your concern and would try to help you in the best possible way.

There are no clear-cut references that can be attributed to a person, and to be arbitrary and say a number of years remained. However, we can focus on statistics about bypass grafts.

They don't seem to be related to any cardiac disorder and the fact that all your previous cardiac tests have resulted normal, is another argument in favor of an extra-cardiac cause. Is the stinging feeling modulated by body movements or breathing? A musculo-skeletic pain would be modulated from the respiratory movements. Does nexium make any changes to your condition? Have you tried any painkillers? I would not exclude a pinched thoracic nerve, which could mimic a similar clinical scenario. I recommend consulting with the neurologist for a a careful physical examination for neurological signs and performing a chest x-ray, a routine blood test and a cervico-thoracal spine x ray to exclude any other possible cause.

If all the above mentioned tests result normal, the most probable cause would remain a musculo-skeletic pain, from a wrong position during sleeping.

I have some pressure in the right hand side of my head which ones and goes .my blood pressure has been quite high recently can this be causing the dizziness , blood pressure has been 165/108 down to 165/95 varied","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read your question and understand your concern. I would like to explain that your symptoms are probably caused by the high blood pressure. You should know that the brain function is closely related to the blood pressure.Normally within some blood pressure limits, the brain has an auto regulatory function, which allows it to maintain a normal function despite the slight fluctuations in blood pressure. But if it is a higher blood pressure, the pressure is transmitted into the brain vessels and the brain tissue, causing dizziness, lightheaded feeling and headache. I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes and thyroid hormone levels to exclude other causes of high blood pressure. You should take into consideration beginning an anti hypertensive therapy to lower your blood pressure.

So it doesn't seem to be any thing wrong with your heart. Regarding the numbness in your hands, it seems to be caused by a pinched nerve in your arms. I would recommend to consult with the neurologist and perform a nerve conduction study (electroneurography) to establish the diagnosis. In case of a pinched nerve, you may need to hold a special wrist splint at night, or even make a undergo a small intervention in case of a severe compression of the nerve.

To make a very long story short I would like to know what your opinion is regarding my recent situation. I ve been diagnosed with Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease, Raynaud s, Fibromyalgia. I ve just been to see a new rheumatologist because my previous one has retired. The new physician was disturbed to find out I don t produce cortisol anymore, have high levels of aldosterone (I think that s what its called), occasional 2.4 levels of potassium requiring IV treatment, face burning/tingling, arm numbness, all over burning or cold sensations, sinus tachycardia, a shadow that showed up on my back left side of skull during a brain MRI and horrible flares of all over body pain, weakness, nausea, headaches, high blood pressure and so many other symptoms. She is sending me to an endocrinologist and neurologist and she briefly mentioned multiple sclerosis at my appointment. I ve never been told I have lesions but with all other symptoms I m worried they will be enough to diagnose MS or the other end of the spectrum and get told nope, no lesions, no MS, good luck with the excruciating existence you experience! That s a nightmare in its own right. Anyway, I guess I just wanted to hear your thoughts and if I came in your office with this information and presentation, what would you say? Thank you in advance for your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I read carefully your question and understand your concern. Your symptoms seem to be related to a metabolic disorder and a hormonal imbalance. High levels of aldosterone may be related to primary hyperaldosteronism or Conn's syndrome. This is a disorder characterized by an overproduction of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, leading to high blood pressure and other cardiac and kidney complications. While low blood potassium is classically described this is only present in about a quarter of people.I recommend consulting with the endocrinologist and perform further blood lab tests and abdominal MRI to determine the diagnosis. Regarding MS, it is a diagnosis based mainly in an abnormal physical examination for neurological signs and an abnormal brain or spine MRI, where specific lesions are reveled. Sometimes it may mimic this clinical scenario, but suspicions are raised only in case of an abnormal physical examination. I would like to know if you have ever performed a brain or spine MRI? It is the most important examination in the diagnosis of MS, but it is usually performed only if neurological signs are encountered during physical examination. So I recommend consulting with the neurologist for a careful physical examination, to exclude this disorder.

The cardiac tests, have resulted normal, and we can exclude this as a possible cause of this confusional state. Regarding the small white spots in her brain, they indicate for a small vessel disease causing a vascular dementia. They are not related to any cardiac cause, but to high blood pressure or diabetes. Dementia is a progressive disorder, which is treated with different neurotropic drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine, memantine) and to help maintain as much as possible an adequate cognitive function and a lot of emotional support is needed.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Yes. It is possible. EKG is a test that reveals the ad hoc, at the moment, state of electrical system of the heart. If there is some acute ischemic process going on, it is captured by the EKG, because these problems, in acute setting, are reflected in it. Echocardiogram is a very useful tool to asses the status, movement and function of the heart wall, valvular system and other. It is very sensitive and specific if you had a recent or remote myocardial infarction, but it cannot depict blockages in the coronary arteries. Diabetes does significant changes to arteries of various diameters, in the body. It does not spare the coronary arteries either. I do not have your angiogram report to tell you more, but if coronary artery bypass grafting was recommended to you, then it must have been at least two-vessel disease and/or coronary blockage in a critical site, where stent placement carries a lot of risk.

I got some OTC Coricidin HBP for his cough/congestion and it has made his BP higher, plus the fever, and his headaches and pulse are high because of this. What can we do tonight? he is 65","Doctor":"Hello, madame. Thank your for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. First, I would like to inform you that dry cough is a side effect of lisinopril and other ACE-I (angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitors). So, if you are not treating the culprit, symptomatic treatment is just for the moment. Therefore, I would recommend to switch the lisinopril with a ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker: losartan, eprosartan, olmesartam etc.). Both classes have same effects, except for the cough (the latter group drugs do not cause it). Be patient, since ACE-I-induced cough can take up to three weeks to subside. Furthermore, combining his age, gender and the blood pressure figures you provided, they are totally unacceptable figures. I would suggest that he should be put on another drug, preferably a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker (if the beta-blockers are counterindicated), since both classes also reduce heart workload and have a beneficiary effect on it. A diuretic agent can also be effective. For his risk factors, his blood pressure should be kept under 135/85 mmHg. I hope I was of help. Feel free to ask again.

Well, you are young to have high blood pressure. The figures, under lisinopril, are all normal. Actually, some of the latest guidelines consider 150/90 mmHg a borderline high blood pressure, not abnormal, not to treat, but to keep under close observation. My oponion is that you can try to titre lisinopril down, just as a test, for two to three weeks, half its dosage a day. Keep in mind that blood pressure should be measured after you have been 10-15 minutes in resting state, and on both arms. When you discontinue lisinopril, a reasonable approach would be to put you on a 24-hour blood pressure registration, to see if these high figures are constant, or they happen only some times a day and if they match with the time when you may have had any beverage or been physically active.I would also suggest some changes in your diet and lifestyle: - low-salt diet and minimum fast-food- fibre-rich diet (green vegetables and fruit) - minimum, if none, caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, black tea, energy drinks)- up to a maximum of 30 grams of ethanol a day (a glass of wine, or two beers)- at least 60 minute of physical activity, varying between swimming, biking, jogging, walking etc. I hope you find my answer helpful.

And since he had an ambulatory (or out of the doctor's office) BP reading taken in the past year, his raised BP may be attributed to anxiety rather than him developing hypertension. Hence, rather than taking such tablets with questionable scientific basis regarding their efficacy, it might be better to talk to your husband's surgeon and discuss about taking an anxiolytic (like alprazolam) tablet for a couple of days before the next posted date for surgery.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. The symptoms you are describing with tremors of limbs and jaw, dizziness, irritability and irregular heart beats, make me suspect for a thyroid gland dysfunction. Therefore, I recommend that you do a full thyroid control:- blood levels of TSH, fT3, fT4;- ultrasound of the thyroid gland. Furthermore, this heart beat that you are experiencing, can be irregular. In this case, the highest probability is that we have to deal with a supraventricular arrhythmia, probably atrial fibrillation (instead of atria being contracted in harmony with the cardiac cycle, their contraction is uncontrolled and they do not function properly to propel the blood into the ventricles). This is a benign arrhythmia, but if more than 48 hours on this arrhythmia, atria can generate little blood clots (thrombi) due to not contracting properly. Thus, I suggest you to do an EKG, echocardiogram and a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor registration, to confirm or exclude this diagnosis and, also to start treatment either to achieve rate control or rhythm control. You can further discuss these matters in details with your treating cardiologist. I hope I was helpful. Best regards. Take care."},{"Patient":"I want to know what my blood pressure should be , I'm 47 years old. I was on the tredmill  my pulse 120/80 is that good or bad? I've be having some anxiety lately and was told to exercise for 30 mins cardio. to produce some endorphin's . what should I be at?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I read your query and understood your concern. Globally, the blood pressure levels accepted as normal, are as follows: 100-139 mmHg systolic and 60-89 mmHg diastolic. Every figure within this range is considered normal. Plain physical activity or programmed exercise should be a substantial part of everyday life of every human being, since it provides a lot of physiological and psychological benefits. I would recommend you a 60-minute a day physical activity, not necessary vigorous activity, but walking, jogging, biking, swimming etc. The thing that worried me, actually, is the blood pressure figures you provided while on a treadmill. This is a normal person's normal blood pressure at rest. Blood pressure goes up when we exercise or engage on another physical activity. A failure of blood pressure to rise during physical activity can be a sign of coronary artery problem. Therefore, I would recommend you to do an EKG and a cardiac stress test. I hope I was helpful.

Is the high CPK a big area of concern my physician is following it up. Great service thanks very much:)","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that your increased CPK level seems to be related to excessive muscles strain, which causes muscle CPK isoform (MM) to be highly increased in blood circulation. Other alternatives may be possible, like inflammatory or autoimmune disease, some drugs side effects, alcohol, etc).It is important to frequently check CPK level trends by repeated lab tests, to better differentiate between possible alternatives..So your attending doctor's decision, seems to be rationale in the diagnostic work up process.Hope to have been helpful!

Not sure if it is affiliated with allergies (been having a horrible allergies and sinus congestion all week), but in the last few days I feel that I have had shortness of breath. Wondering if my heart seems to be beating really fast. I also had a half a cup of iced tea several hours ago and still feel jittery (and i m not usually that sensitive to iced tea...it s something I drink regularly). any idea what may be going on?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using Heathcare magic.Sinus congestion may be due to many causes, allergies are one of them. If you have alergies you should be tested forthem and find out the cause of your allergy because than you can take proper medication and makes lifestyle changes to ease your problem.Shortness of breath is a common allergy symptom, and it is a sign of airway reaction to an allergy. Also rapid heart beat ot tachycardia is an associated symptom with airway obstruction. There are many other causes associated with your symptoms, and that is why you should get a check up by your physician as soon as possible and see what is the cause to your problems.Feel free to contack me again if you have any questions."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with pvcs. I am on a beta blocker. I had this condition for a few years with no symptoms other than a feeling of skipped beats. Couple of months age, I strted getting periodic light headedness. Sw. Cardiologist who performed keg that confirmed I was having a suginificant amount of them. was told not having enough to consider ny kind of procedure. Light headedness is scary. Any suggestions to try to reduce mount of pvcs ?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using Heathcare.Skipped beats and light-headedness are common symptom associated with PVCS.PVCS is a mostly benigne type of arrhythmia. Most of the cases dont need medication, but when it is needed beta blockers are generaly the first choice. You need to know how many PVCS you have hourly. The best way to know that is bu Holter ECG (24-48h Ecg depending on cardiologists opinion). With this test you know when do you have PVCS (day, night, activity), if they are from one or more origins, if you have any ventricular pause or AV conduction problems. After doing this test you will get many answers and if needed your cardiologist will suggest you another medication for your condition.Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions."},{"Patient":"Good day, I was prescribed simvor 40 today by my doctor . My cholesterol results were over the range.,I am 52 years and a female. Can you tell me the side effects?. I am a bit concerned and thought I would try online for the side effects. My e-mail address is  YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello Mrs,Welcome to Health Care Magic. I understand your concern. The drug your treating doctor prescribed belongs to a family called statins. As all the drugs, Simvor (simvastatin) has side effects, which include abnormal laboratory test results, liver problems, muscle problems (pain, tenderness, or weakness), headache, constipation, stomach pain or indigestion, mild nausea, dark coloured urine, pain or burning when you urinate etc.I don't know what your altered level of cholesterol is, but if I was your treating doctor, I would suggest you modify your diet and lifestyle. You can try to limit fat from your diet and instead begin a diet rich in fibres (plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables), rarely having red meat, but mostly chicken and fish, as well as everyday physical activity. I would recommend you also to use healthier cooking methods (Baking, broiling and roasting). Hope I answered to your question. Take care,Dr. Ina Zaimi"},{"Patient":"Hi yes. Husbands blood pressure was 176/104 upon rising this am. After taking blood pressure med it comes down to normal range. Dr tried another med same thing. He also has dissiness and shortness of breath when doing tasks around the house, but not when talking. Any ideas? Thank you","Doctor":"Hello....You did not mention details of your husband like age, since when he is hypertensive, since when he is taking drug, which drug he is taking any other associated symptoms with shortness of breath like leg swelling, chest pain, palpitation.Still, according to your description, it is ,likely to be hypertensive heart failure. In long standing hypertension, generally left ventricular hypertrophy occurs that causes systolic dysfunction that will lead to breathlessness on exertion due to reduce ejection fraction.So in my opinion continue your anti hypertensive drugs as your blood pressure is controlled along with that start Tab Lasilectone 50 mg twice a day.Thank You"},{"Patient":"Ok,,Um dont know how to start this out...here goes.

I am 63, live in Vermont, have problems with depression, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and more. Is there anything that would be causing me to have a sore throat every 2 or 3 months now that did not seem to cause problems before?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern, and would like to explain that your sore throat needs a comprehensive medical investigation to identify the exact cause of your complains. Several factors, like inflammatory diseases, adverse drug effects, even depression may be associated with sore throat.First, a careful physical exam is necessary to rule in/out possible signs of infection, or alternative disorders.Some lab tests, like complete blood count, PCR, ESR, ASO (antistreptolysin titers), fasting glucose, should be done to differentiate between possible causes.A thorough investigation of current therapy and underlying health disorders is helpful too.You need to discuss with your internist about above mentioned options.Hope to have been helpful!

Does he need to go to the hospital?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. I think that if this is a pain that started while resting, he should go to the hospital. There an EKG should be performed and blood tests should be run, such as troponin and creatine phosphokinase (CK) - MB fraction. If they result all normal, then a cardiac stress test, 48 hours after he has been without pain, should be performed, to check if there is an indication of a coronary artery narrowing or blockage. If there is a positive finding, then a coronary angiography would be the reasonable approach. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi doc my father is an angeplast patient with two stent,he is normal for a month but some times he get a blur image but is eye power is normal. sometime coughing problem occur for him  and also he does not have a sound sleep what is the reason for this ?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. To clear something for the start, it is sure that the stents do not cause these problems. They are just a remedy for the coronary artery blockages, an with the proper treatment they tend to last for a lifetime. Being a coronary artery disease patient, I'm assuming he also has high blood pressure. In most cases, the blurry vision can come from degenerative changes that a long-standing hypertension can cause to the eye. Therefore, I would recommend a consult with an ophthalmologist and a fundoscopic exam. It also can be triggered by high blood pressure, which can be fought by adding and/or raising the dosage of the blood pressure-lowering agents, or by low blood pressure, in which case these dosage have to be reviewed. Again, being a coronary artery disease patient, I am assuming he is on a drug from the angiotensiogen converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I: enalapril, lisinopril and other \\"prils\\"). This class produces dry cough as a side effect, in 10-15% of patients (by inhibiting the enzyme - bradykinin builds up - produces dry cough). If this is the case, I recommend switching to an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB: losartan, eprosartan and other \\"sartans\\"), since this class does not produce this side effect, although they have identical beneficial effects on the body. If cough does not subside immediately after switching, do not worry. Studies show that ACE-I-induced cough can take up to three weeks to subside. I hope I was helpful with my answer.

It may also cause cardiomyopathies that is changes in the structure of the heart muscle. Though I cannot conclusively say that weed is the cause for your problems. My advice would be to stop using weed and to follow a healthy lifestyle including adequate exercise (consult with your cardiologist regarding exercise regimens) and a healthy diet. And please do continue your present medications since ventricular tachycardia can be a serious issue.I hope this has been of help to you."},{"Patient":"My blood pressure has increased to 151/104 pulse is 65. I ve taken Azor 5/20 and HCTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide) 12.5 for over a year and blood pressure stayed around 125/82. I developed swelling in my hand and middle finger and the urgent care doctor thought it was Gout and put me on Indomethacin 50mg and told me to stop taking the HCTZ. My lab came back negative for Gout, Uric Acid was 6.9 (normal range), but my blood pressure increased. Should I go to the emergency room?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read you query. Well, at this moment, I understand, you are on a triple therapy for fighting hypertension. First, the amlodipine, which is a constituent in azor, can cause swelling of limbs, most commonly the ankle area, but there are cases, although rare, that it causes also swelling of the wrist area and fingers. In my experience, I would also suspect a gout diagnosis. But, since the uric acid is within range, then this is excluded. Second, indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and just like all NSAIDs, has a tendency to raise the blood pressure by as 20 mmHg systolic. At this time, my opinion is that this is just a side effect of indomethacin. However, blood pressure tends to get higher even if on medication, which controlled it in a past time. I am certainly not saying that this is case. But, if even after two weeks off the indomethacin, you continue to get these blood pressure figures, then I would recommend you to discuss with your general practitioner or your cardiologist, to try raise the now used medication dosage and/or add another anti-hypertensive to your therapy, such as a beta-blocker, which also be beneficiary for your heart, by acting on reduction of heart workload - prolonging the heart cycle - promote a better ventricular filling and a larger amount of blood to supply end-organs. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Wish you a good health. Best regards."},{"Patient":"I have to have a angiogram done and a stent put in., My question is How will the doctors do this when I have blood pooling when given Novocain which is used at the local insertion sight, and Aspirin causes me extreme stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea. My Dr. says if the stent goes in I will half to be on aspirin forever. Oh and I flat lined from a sulfite reaction. Sulfite is the preservative in Novocain and other types of these pain meds. Are the any alternative drugs/meds they can use?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Let us treat the problems one by one. Now, in medicine, every decision is carried out by a doctor who carefully weighs the benefit/risk balance. If a coronary artery narrowing or blockage is left untreated with a stent placement, then that artery will surely totally close and give you a heart attack. This is the primary problem in these cases. In your particular case, you said that you have problems with your stomach. Indeed, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) irritate the stomach inner lining by blocking an important factor which inhibits the acid production in the stomach (prostaglandins). From now to the end, I will share my and our clinic's experience in these cases. First, I would order an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, to see if there is an actual problem in your stomach, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic gastritis or ulcer. If there is a present inflammation there, I would withhold the procedure, until this inflammation is healed. If there is not, then you can take aspirin and clopidogrel, accompanied, of course, with a stomach mucosa protector (anti-H2 hystamine receptor drugs or protein pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs). As for the novocain, yes, it contains sulfite derivatives, which can cause allergic reactions, ranging from mild to true, life-threatening, anaphylactic shock. Lidocaine is used in our clinic, which also contains sodium metabisulfite. However, the need for stent placement is critical. So, you would be safe if an anti-allergic reaction protocol is used, which consists on: - prednisolone 2 x 25 mg (amp), given 13, 7 and 1 hour before the procedure, and - telfast 1 x 180 mg (tb), given 13 and 1 hour before the procedure. I hope I was clear, helpful and thorough with my answer. Good luck with the procedure.

The diuretics she took for many years caused this - it seems. she has been treated with 0.9% and 3% NaCl solution  through IV to no avail. Her Na level is at 107 - far below the minum of 137 for normal people. She has all the symptoms except for coma/seizure. both Na and Cl are low. We are now treating her with ORS 3 packets per litre per day and controlled fluid intake (total of 1.5 litres/day) - for the last week. We have not gone back to the hospital yet to check her Na levels. Is there anything more we can do? thank you.","Doctor":"Thank you for your question.From your brief history, your mother is suffering from heart failure and chronic hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia in such a situation is not only difficult to treat but also a tricky situation even in a hospital setting. is she disoriented? what are the medicines she is on right now? in your mothers clinical state, her body retains both sodium and water but because it retains more water than sodium it causes a relative hyponatremia. hence giving your mother more salt in diet or as concentrated solution of ors may actually be counterproductive for her heart failure. one thing you can try is restricting her fluid intake to less than a litre per day or even to 750ml per day. her serum potassium levels may also need to be checked. drugs are now available for to increase the sodium level in heart failure but they should be used only after consulting her doctor. but all these measures only give you very modest results and i would advise you to take her to a hospital for ideal treatment.

I can sit, and it goes away, until I exert again. I have minor medical knowledge, and know to get to ER if this gets worse and report to the doctor, but...was just wondering...do I need to go sooner than later?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your concern. You are a 55-year old woman, which is a borderline age for risk for cardiovascular disease. The pain in the chest you described, which is triggered by effort and goes away when you stop, fulfils some criteria of angina (chest pain caused by narrowing of coronary arteries - the arteries that surround the heart like a crown, hence the name, and supply its muscle with oxygen and nutrients). Of course, in this level of conversation, when none of the test were carried out, this is just an assumption judging by the characteristics of the pain. Therefore, I would strongly recommend you to do a cardiac check-up: EKG, echocardiogram and cardiac stress test. Also, I would recommend you to be put on a 24-hour blood pressure monitor, to determine if there is also high blood pressure (hypertension) or not. As for the rapid heart rate, if it goes up while exerting, and remains regular, then my opinion is that there is nothing to worry about. There is a simple formula for this - the heart rate accepted as normal, at a person that is exercising, is 220-age (165 beats per minute, in your case). My further recommendations would be, that you should do a complete blood count and measure the levels of the following cell derivatives: - glucose - HbA1c - urea and creatinine - AST, ALT, GGT - electrolytes - total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-fraction, triglycerides I hope I wash helpful and thorough, with my answer.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Cholesterol levels can vary from clinic to clinic and from country to country. In our clinic, for example, it is considered to be high >220 mg/dL. Anyway, with these figures, combined with the age of 63, I would also recommend starting on a hydroxy-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin, such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin etc.). In your case, I would start her on atorvastatin 20 mg x 1 tb/d. There are no medications without side effects. This particular group of drugs tend to elevate the liver function enzymes (AST and ALT) in 8-10% of cases. Therefore, one month after she is on the drug, she should be tested for total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-fraction, and AST and ALT. Also, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria are reported with the use of statins. Although very rare conditions, they are serious complications of statins' use. Nevertheless, there is a large number of studies about statin (you can find them for your own curiosity online) that provide sufficient evidence that this is a class of drugs with high benefits in preventing and treating the coronary artery disease and dislipidemia. In our clinic, it is used routinely in these cases. Also, never to forget, some diet and lifestyle changes should be undertaken. She should have a diet poor in salt, rich in fibre (green or dark green leafy vegetables and fruit), none or very little amounts of red or raw meat, more amounts of chicken, other poultry, fish, and alcohol up to a maximum of 30 g ethanol a day (i.e. two beers or a glass of wine). Also, a 60-minute physical activity, such as walking, brisk walking, light jogging, swimming etc., should be performed. In the end, my opinion is that she should also have a cardiac check-up: EKG, echocardiogram and cardiac stress test. Feel free to ask me again. I hope I was helpful with my answer.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Simply put, one faints when there is not enough oxygen supply to the brain. Since oxygen is brought on by blood circulation, then any reason that can cause lowering the amount of blood circulating to the brain, should be taken into account. It would also be helpful if, by your information, you provided your age and whether this is the first episode of fainting/near-fainting/dizziness that you experience. Nevertheless, some tests would be appropriate at this time. I would recommend you to do a complete blood count, to rule out anaemia; an EKG, to rule out any possible problem in the electrical system of the heart; an echocardiogram, to rule out the possible valvular apparatus disease as an origin of this episode; a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor, to rule out any conduction disturbances in the heart; and an echo-Doppler examination of the carotid arteries, to rule out any obstruction in the neck arteries. More or less, my opinion is to rule out or confirm these main reasons first. Then, we can proceed to a tilt-table test. In the end, after all, a single-episode of fainting during the entire life, can happen to any healthy individual. But, I strongly recommend that the above mentioned tests should be performed. I hope I was helpful. Take care and feel free to ask again. Good day."},{"Patient":"as of the past few days, i am experiencing rapid heart beat.  it was short at first but has increased in duration to about 10 minutes at a time.  when it occurs, i am not doing anything strenuous.  i am 36 and in relatively good health.  is this something i need to worry about?","Doctor":"Dear- thanks for using our system. Rapid heart beat can be secondary to multiples causes. It is important to find out if the heart rate is more thatn 100 per /min and if it is regular or irregular.The best way to find out is taking your pulse and having an electrocardiogram. Medical conditions as panic attack or anxiety, hyperthyroidism, caffeine intake , are some examples of rapid heart beat. You need to see your doctor for a checkup, electrocardiogram and 24 hr holter monitor trying to identify why type of arrythmia you have. Some valvular conditions as mitral valve prolapse can give you rapid heart beat too.I hope that my advise has been helpfulDR.Sara"},{"Patient":"i am 38 year old woman 5 foot 112 pounds I have had pain in my upper left side under my underarm and pressure in my chest every day and have had it for two months if I eat it gets worse I have had ekg s and a treadmill stress test they all came back fine I do have high cholesterol and I am on cholesterol medication but when I take it it makes my chest hurt in a different way , what do you think it could be its driving me crazy","Doctor":"Dear- thanks for using our system, I read your question with care and will give you my medical advise. You might be experiencing chest pain from digestive tract or non cardiac origin. The fact that you already had a negative treadmill stress test goes against cardiac. I understand that you have risk factors for coronary artery disease but test was negative. Statins are the most used medication for cholesterol treatment and they can cause muscle pain that can be what you are suffering.

Increase the exercise and improve the diet for a better cholesterol.You should see the results in 4-5 months.I hope that my advise has been helpfulDr.Sara"},{"Patient":"my heart stings sometimes.  it doesnt always happen, but when it does could last up to an hour.

It depends on age, character of pain. any aggravating or relieving factors, associated with other symptoms, underlying any disorders and many more conditions.Your description is incomplete regarding chest pain.

So in my opinion not to worry regarding your chest pain if you are thinking it is related to heart.

The calcium potassium and magnesium levels need to be in normal range for the proper functioning of the human body..   Now coming towards the medicine you are taking.....furesimide and irbesartan are antihypertensive medications. They lower the blood pressure by increasing the urine output. In some instances the dose become relatively high causing low blood pressure along with electrolyte imbalance. You need to consult your doctor so that your medicines can be optimized to prevent these side effects...    As far as warfarin is concerned the only related thing is PT INR ,your doctor will decide how much anticoagulantion is required for you. Normally INR is required  at value of 2 to 3.. Amiodarone is concerned , it is antiarrhythmic drug and your doctor will adjust your dose..   Last but not the least is insulin you should be cautious regarding hypoglycemia.. So use frequent small meals and  keep sweet candies in your pocket to prevent hypoglycemia... Your doctor will educate you about hypoglycemia and ways to prevent it.

However cryo ablation has more recurrence ,  if the cardiologist is not well trained with its use.  Regards Dr Priyank Mody"},{"Patient":"Since I was young, I used to have random heart burns (random times a year), but it only lasted for about a second. Recently, my heart has been hurting to the point I have to take shallow breaths until the pressure goes away, and it's been lasting for more ten two minutes now. If I try to take a deep breath while I feel the pressure in my heart, it hurts a lot. What's wrong with my heart? Also, it's turned from random times a year to now random times this week","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, I would start my answer by describing you the anginal pain (pain derived from heart when it is suffering from insufficient blood inflow caused by narrowed coronary arteries). It is described more as a tenderness or heaviness in the midchest, radiating to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and/or arm, which is triggered by physical activity and terminated by stopping the physical activity. The pain you are experiencing, which is, I assume, not related to the heartburns, as you describe it, may come from an inflammation on the linings within the chests, like pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart), or an inflammatory/infectious process in the bronchi/lungs. In this scenario, where pain has a inspiration-expiration variability, I would recommend you to get an plain chest X-ray and an EKG and/or an echocardiogram, to determine whether any of these linings is causing the pain. As for the heartburns, the major factor causing them is the excess production of acid after taking certain meals (like, xanthyne derivatives, such as coffee, energy drinks; alcohol and tobacco; pickles, grilled and spicy food). If you are still experiencing this king of symptom, I think you should try a course with a protein pump inhibitor (PPI: omeprazole, esomeprazole etc.) drug, for a month. If still you do not find relief, then a consult with a gastroenterologist and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, would be in order. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have hypertension and currently I am having Ditide once a day, and Covance-50 twice a day. Ditide was introduced by my doctor uncle since I had BP on the higher side. Prior to this I was having Covance-D in the morning and Covance 50 in the evening.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your question. Maybe it is a point of view of your doctor's. I would not go on and disagree with his prescription, since it is not wrong and it is helpful in treating the high blood pressure. Covance-D is a combination of a angiontensin receptor blocker (losartan) with a diuretic drug (hidrochlorthiazid). Whilst, Dytide is a combination of two diuretic drugs. I would share my and my clinic's experience: I would recommend as a first line of treatment for hypertension a beta-blocker (e.g. atenolol, metoprolol), because they also have a significant effect on lowering the heart's workload. If you are suffering from a condition related to the bronchi/lungs, where most beta-blockers are counterindicated, then you should use calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil or diltiazem. If the blood pressure figures would be still high (i.e. systolic > 140 mmHg and diastolic > 90 mmHg), then my opinion is that an addition of an angiontensiogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I: captopril, enalapril, lisinopril) drug would be in order. The addition of other drugs or drug classes to the therapy would be in order, if the blood pressure figures would keep being higher then the figures I provided above. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards."},{"Patient":"I take my blood pressure on a home machine. The first systolic reading is consistently higher than the others. It can go from 146 /82, then 131/ 80 and then 124/81 The rest period between taking the measurements is short, maybe a minute or so. As others have asked how come?  and which is right ?","Doctor":"Blood pressure is a dynamic vital which tends to change according to need to the body and nits never static.  All the readings you mentioned are in normal range except 146 upper,  if it was post any form of exertion it's ok,  otherwise you may consider lifestyle modifications like exercise and cutting salt in diet to prevent any future risk of hypertension.  However to reassure you on the present day all is fine and you don't need to worry Regards Dr Priyank Mody"},{"Patient":"Is a average resting heart rate of 100-114ish bad. I m a 17yr old male. I ve been a pretty lazy and not eating healthy recently since school let out. But I ve been getting back into being active and eating better over the last few days. This is when I realized an estimate of my resting heart rate. Thanks","Doctor":"It s better that your heart rate be less than 100, as along term increased heart rate is not good for heart.  But however as you say you had a lazy life and so now when you start getting active the heart who is not used to work much will have higher rates to compensate which should settle in a month a or two,  don't worry for the same and continue with a good and healthy life.

I have been sitting down now for around so an hour and my heart beat is still thatis this bad?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I understand your concern. Alcohol intake is tolerated variously by various individual organisms. In most cases, almost always, it produces a marked widening of the vascular bed (vasodilation), which, in turn, activates a complicated response in the body, which results, among others, to \\"speeding up\\" the heart rate. My opinion is that, if this heart rate is regular, then there is nothing to worry about. To some extent, this happens to anyone who consumes alcohol in a certain amount, whether you get drunk or not. As a cardiologist, I would advise you not to follow these unpleasant behaviours, such as smoking tobacco or drinking large amounts of alcohol. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care."},{"Patient":"My husband is 52 and he has variable high blood pressure. Every time doctors tried to give him blood pressure medication his blood pressure dropped down too low. The last doctor said to try yoga and meditation.... His blood pressure is sometimes normal 123/83 or sometimes high as 168/105 ....Don't know what to do to regulate it...Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. Now, the age of 52 years old is an age which is accompanied with a higher risk of hypertension (high blood pressure) diagnosis. However, this is not a rule or something that happens always. You should know that there are a lot of blood pressure fluctuations throughout a day, that can be caused by a lot of reason, such as stress, physical stress, diurnal and nocturnal changes in various hormonal levels etc. My recommendation, at this point, would be for him to be put on a 24/48-hour blood pressure monitor, to decide whether the diagnosis of hypertension is there or not. Also, even if it is there, there are a lot of drug classes for treating hypertension, and you should not be confined in using only one drug class, since various organisms can have various reactions to various drug classes, whether they are blood pressure-lowering drugs or other drugs. Feel free to ask me again. Take care.

I have just come off of an abnormal menstrual cycle with extremely heavy blood flow. Could my rapid heart rate be related to the migraine or my hormones or my large amount of blood loss","Doctor":"Dear- thanks for using our service and will try to help you with my medical advise. First of all, heavy menstrual cycle will bring the hemoglobin down and that will cause a.nemia. When you have anemia, the heart tries to compensate and brings the heart rate up, which can be the cause of the increased rate . The headache and dizziness could be from the anemia too.Alterations in hormone can produce these symptoms too. It is advisable to have a complete blood work including hormones and electrocardiogram to evaluate your problem.I hope my advise has been helpfulDr.Sara"},{"Patient":"I went to stand up after playing cards and felt suddenly faint and a bit nauseated.

It is important to find out why he is feeling that his heart itches.

So still I would say no antibiotic Is indicated medically.  However with consideration that you are meeting your grand daughter,  you may take the antibiotic which may or may not cut short the duration of the illness.

However in 70-80 of cases hct is the cause,  so just supplementing hct with another Hct like diuretic with chlorthalidone would do the trick.  If still persistent you can change the drug and use any from calcium channel inhibitor group.  *note.  Respected mam,  as your husband works through the day in the heat,  he would be loosing a lot of electrolytes and water on sweat,  so a diuretic like Hct is not the best anti hypertensive to be given to him,  as it will cause undue weakness and may lead to electrolyte imbalance.

But certainly 90/54 to 95/55 is cause of concern if you reach it often.When heart is not able to pump properly by systolic contraction, the systolic BP is lower ( 114, 95, 94 in your case here).When heart is at rest and dilated the minimum pressure exerted is diastolic BP (e.g. 72, 55, 54 in your case here).Continuous low BP conditions can have many complications in winters, nutrition problems, improper functioning of  body systems which may lead to many other problems for non-supply of blood/ oxygen to remote parts/ brain due to low pumping of heart.It is better to keep trying for normal BP range by natural methods.Take a lot of water with a pinch of salt frequently. Take juices. Have Deep breathing exercises when you get time for at least 10 minutes.If you were my patient I would advise you to Take powder or capsules or Liquids made with Herb ARJUNA (Terminalia arjuna). It is heart friendly and is famous for restoring healthy contractions of heart thus maintaining normal BP.Action may not start early as it is a pure bark of a tree. Its not chemical and is non synthesized. But continuous taking it everyday will start action in about 2-4 weeks. No side effects. No interaction with other medicines. It is also used for hypertension. The thing is it will maintain BP levels. If supported by Yoga and Deep Breathing, it will be unparalleledCommonly and economically available in India."},{"Patient":"My 69 year old wife has been diagnosed with Stage 3 CKD and hypertension, as well as coronary blockage (70-80%) which will likely require a stint to avoid a heart attack. The doctor explained that the stint would require a regimen of aspirin and Plavix (sic?) for an extended period. Our understanding is that aspirin is quite harmful to kidneys, so we re on the horns of a dilemma. Do the risks of heart problems outweigh those of dialysis, or can she survive for an extended period on the aspirin/Plavix without significant additional kidney damage?","Doctor":"Hello,  aspirin for heart problem is taken in the dose of 62-150 mg per day which doesn't have adverse effect on kidney it is rather far higher dose where aspirin is taken as a pain killer ,  and plavix is similar blood thinner  given at 75 mg a day which is removed from the body 50% by liver and 50% by kidney and so no dose modification is needed  for the kidney disease .  Both are beneficial for the heart and should be taken without doubt.

It may be due to heart disease electrolyte abnormalities, Degenerative changes in conduction system of heart. 2) Postural hypotension : fall in blood pressure on standing may cause similar symptoms. It may be due to medicine for blood pressure or due to autonomic neuropathy or severe dehydration. Other causes of palpitations which are unlikely in your case are-1) TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) : Transient decreases in blood supply to brain due to occlusion in blood vessels may cause similar complaints. 2) Hypoglycemia : (low blood sugar) this is possible in patient with diabetes on treatment. In such cases, There may be need for - 1) Detailed clinical Examination. 2) ECG, electrophysiological study of heart, Holter's monitoring, 2DEcho of heart. 3) Blood tests : Complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, serum calcium, magnesium. 4) Brain imaging with angiography.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. I would start my answer by giving you some information about your condition. Mitral valve prolapse is not an uncommon finding in young females. In fact, it is as 16% as often in young females, totally asymptomatic and is found in routine echocardiograms. It is known even in ancient life, when it was called \\"young ladies' disease\\". It takes up to 30-40 years to decompensate the heart, increase heart and lung pressures, and then produce symptoms. My opinion is that, at this period, you should not be concerned about your diagnose, and live a healthy life without limitations. As about the blood pressure, I think that this can be a some-time thing during a day. In my experience, combining these figures with your age, there is nothing to worry about. These figures are borderline low, and can be found in every active 30 year-old, due to resting after a physical activity and climate changes, especially when it is hot. If this a constant finding, feel free to contact me again. Take care. Best regards."},{"Patient":"hi  i am a female of 55years young. i  have controlled high bllod pressure and im takinf Forte Cozaar , disprin cadiocare  and anti depressent Cillift. I take my medication first thing in the morning. Two day ago i noticed my stools were  black(tar couloured) no pain what so ever.  this has stoped and i suspect disprin could have eroded the lining of my stomach. Can this be true ?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I hope I can help with your concern. To get to the exact answer you asked I would need some more information. Have you ever experienced epigastric or chest pain? Was this dark color stool a one-time episode or it happened any time before or during this period? I would like to point out that dark colored stool can easily happen to anybody who consumes certain food, which darkens the stool, such as food with iron in its content, red wine, beet root etc. It is also true that aspirin expresses its effect by strongly inhibiting prostaglandin formation, a very important factor which, in stomach, acts by inhibiting acid formation. After a certain amount of time that aspirin is used, it can predispose the ulcer formation, by inhibiting prostaglandins (acid formation inhibitors and equalizers) - more acid is produced - the innermost lining of the stomach, mucosa, faces more acid - mucosa is eroded - ulcer can be formed. Actually, this is also an effect of all NSAIDs. Being this the case or not, in my experience, I always accompany aspirin and NSAIDs with a gastric protector such as hystamine H2-receptor inhibitors (ranitidine) or protein pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole). First thing I would recommend is that you should do a complete blood count, to see if this dark color is from any blood leakage or it is just alimentary in origin. As for the high blood pressure, I would need more information about the figures of daily blood pressure, to further tell you if losartan is sufficient to treat it. Anyway, After you have provided the blood pressure figures, feel free to ask me again, or consult your treating cardiologist. I hope I was helpful. Best regards."},{"Patient":"My husband have a server heart attack and two light ones. The main Artery to the front part of his heart is 100 blocked.

As you wrote that your husband suffered form multiple heart attacks and Angiogram suggestive of LAD 100% block. But you did not mention regarding other two vessels. A heart has three main blood supply. Most of times 100% block produces collateral automatically according to time so in many cases the part of heart supplied by a perticular vessel is not dead totally but sometimes when sudden blockage occurred then it may be possible that affected muscle part will be die. But still heart can function through other two blood supplies.As you also mentioned regrading work function that is 25%. I think it will be Ejection fraction of heart. EF 25% is significantly low and patient should go under ventricular defibrillation. But in my opinion, there is noting like leaving your hop and it is like walking time bomb.

I was mistaken, I thought it was free advice.Thank you for your time though.SC","Doctor":"Hello..First of all enlarge heart is a very vague terminology. Size of hear increases in two fashion. One is increase in thickness of wall called Hypertrophy and other is increase in cavity of heart called Dilatation. Again Hypertrophy is subdivided into two types inward enlargement called concentric hypertrophy of heart and another is outward enlargement of heart called eccentric hypertrophy. Whereas Dilatation of heart is called Cardiomyopathy. And Cardiomyopathy has various sub types depending on etiology In short, the enlargement of heart including Hypertrophies and Cardiomyopathis; in both cases, the cause is not sure always. Any person at any age of life can be developed theses disease. So in my opinion, better to go for diagnosis of which type of heart disease you are suffering and upto what extent having this disease then start the treatment that depends on condition and etiology.

As you described your chest pain that is radiating to left arm. Generally chest pain of constricting or squeezing type with radiation is likely to be pain from heart.

Your pain doesn't look like being of cardiac origin (facing pain nature and characteristics of breath and position relations).But, it is necessary to exclude other possible causes, like pericarditis (a careful physical exam, cardiac ultrasound); backbone degenerative process (a careful physical exam, backbone X ray study, CT or MRI); pleural inflammation (pulmonary auscultation, chest imagine studies), etc.I recommend you to consult with an internist for a comprehensive differential diagnosis work up, to identify the right source of your complain.Hope to have been helpful!

Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that your pounding heart feeling (that is palpitations), is among the most common heart related complains. It may be caused by just by an increased anxious state, is also a common finding during and after any physical exertions. These above options are almost physiological conditions, and you shouldn't worry about.But, we have to be sure no any other pathological reasons is responsible, first of all any arrhythmias.So, a careful physical exam, coupled with a resting ECG, and if suspicions are raised for a possible arrhythmia, a cardiac ultrasound and an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring are necessary.Several blood tests (complete blood count to exclude a possible anemia; thyroid hormone levels to exclude a possible high abnormal thyroid function; PCR to esclude any inflammations, etc).Hope to have been helpful!

Tonight, she was playing soccer and started experiencing a sharp pain in her chest.  It has been an hour and the pain has minimized some but she is feeling the urge to cough.  She says that it feels like there is something stuck in her throat and she cannot get it out.  She has no other symptoms.  Should I be worried.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding you concern, I would like to explain that a careful physical exam, resting ECG and a trans-thoracic cardiac ultrasound, are necessary to investigate cardiac structures (possible heart chamber dilation, valvular incompetence, etc), as well as to review cardiac performance and what is very important to investigate for abnormally increased pulmonary artery hypertension, which may be the source of your daughter's complains (chest pain, coughing).In addition some blood tests, like complete blood count (rule out secondary polyglobulia), an arterial blood gas analysis (for possible acid-base disorders) should be checked too.If the above tests are inconclusive regarding increased pulmonary artery hypertension, then additional cardiac tests are necessary (for example: exercise cardiac stress test coupled with stress cardiac ultrasound).Hope to have been helpful!

There are two things...Sometimes Panic attack per se can cause chest pain and palpitation. But sometimes if any one having some previous heart pathology then sudden mental stress can cause chest pain due to vasospasm of coronary artery disease called Unstable angina.As you said, your doctore done your ECG and blood test that came neagtive for any heart pathology.

Have had a PE about 6 years ago. I have 4 gene mutations wich are MTHFR and PAI-1. I have an Ivac filter in my vena cava. I have had chest pains for a long time now ,been to emergency rooms countless times. they never find anything. I recently moved to a very remote area and don't have any Specialty Drs. here. I last saw my hematologist in Dec 2012. He said he thought it was showers of micro clotting and to double up on my asprin and folic acid every other day. That worked for a few months but know the chest pain is back and it moves around and is very unsettling, it also seems to get worse with my menstral cycle. I don't know what to do anymore. Any suggestions?  I have to pay to get an answer? Figures","Doctor":"Hello.....As your details it seems that you are suffering from Congenital  hypercoagulable disease. In this case, the blood getting thick day by day and causes clots at any site. Most common is lower large vein due to more stagnant condition. This clot frequently embolises to chest  and causes chest pain that is called Pulmonary embolism.With your description, you are suffering from Chronic pulmonary embolism that also causes right heart chamber enlargement and bilateral leg swelling. But you did not mention regarding breathlessness and leg swelling except chest pain on and off.Definitely this chest pain is due to microclot in pulmonary vessel. But the treatment you are taking is very ineffective. Aspirin is not enough alone to prevent the clot formation and keep the blood thin. So my advise is to start Tab Acetrom with lower dose 2 mg once a day along with aspirin with folic acid. And do your Prothrombin time (PT INR) at regular interval of 15-30 days to keep your INR 2 to 2.5Thank You"},{"Patient":"I barely drank any alcohol about 4 hours ago  (two beers and started drinking a little buy of vodka when I started to feel extremely nauseus), but I have been excessively vomiting for the past 3 hours.

I was still having high blood pressure problems & swelling so my cardiologist told me to stop taking it and started me on Benicar 40mg. He told me it was completely safe to just stop taking the metroprolo; however after reading many things contrary to that, I started back with 50 mg and stopped the Benicar for now. I do not know how many days I should allow to taper off and when I should start back with the Benicar. Right now, blood pressure is okay.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I understand your concern. Well, personally, basing in my everyday experience, I would highly recommend you to continue on a beta-blocker drug (such as, metoprolol). Maybe, I would recommend down-regulating and adjusting your dose (i.e. not 100 mg daily, but 50 mg daily), but I would not recommend stopping it altogether). You see, beta-blockers have an extremely good and beneficiary effect on the heart. They act by both lowering the peripheral blood pressure and the heart rate, which, in summary, decrease the workload on the heart and do not let it \\"get tired\\". If you decide to adjust your beta-blocker dosage, then it is perfectly safe to add olmesartan (Benicar) to your therapy, also with small dosage. They both work together in a line to lower the blood pressure. Anyway, if you are just determined that you want to stop taking metoprolol, it is safe to just stop taking it, and it is not necessary to taper its dosage. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care."},{"Patient":"hellio sir , my mom is infected by tuberculosis since last 6 months. she is taken now akt3 kit.she is under 40 kg. sometimes she suffers rapid heart beat.doctor prescribes us dilzem tablet but somtime this tablet not works and eno or antacid works to control rapid heart beat.please give me help to take right medicine and what is the cause behind it .thank you","Doctor":"Hello, It's most important that we find what is the rhythm of the heart when the heart rate is rapid,  find the cause and treat it rather than just lowering the heart rate like electrolyte imbalance,  anemia ,  a ecg during such episode will be helpful .

Unfortunately metformin you are taking seems to be unable to control blood sugar by itself. You will need a combination of drugs which may be oral antidiabetics or insulin too. I would recommend you to contact your endocrinologist as soon as possible to help you get the proper cure and lower the sugar level. Don't stay at home waiting if it levels out. It won't.I hope this answer was helpful to you!Please kindly rate it as helpful and write a short review about your experience with me!

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern.Anxiety is commonly accompanied with an increase in heart rate. There are various types of anxiety attacks and all of them are charachterized by a flush of chatecholamines (adrenalin) in blood stream. For example, fear (one type of anxiety, called situational anxiety) is almost always accompanied with a significant increase in heart rate, paleness, heavy breathing (all symptoms of adrenalin flush in the system). My opinion is that, just to exclude the heart origin of this sign with highest probability, you should be put on a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor. Otherwise, my opinion is that this is only benign and not to worry about. Although, if this situation affects your quality of life and every-day duties, I recommend a consult with a psychanalist or psychiatrist, to further determine this condition and to start or withhold treatment. I hope I was helpful with my answer.Best regards."},{"Patient":"I'm 33 male I'm having chest problems that's why I'm taking cardicore 5mg and ramipril 2.5mg I not over weight and height is. 5 foot 10. done ecg heart was fine and lately still have chest pains and now I also starting to feel weak in my legs is it the medications I taking causing it","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your concern.According to your age and the medication you are on, I'm assuming they were started for high blood pressure, I would say that this weak feeling could come from the blood pressure-lowering effect of the drugs. I recommend you to be put on a 24-hour blood pressure monitor, while on these drugs, so we can see if the drugs are needed or not. As for the chest pain, and from information you provided, my opinion is that this is not a pain originated from the heart, with a high probability and a low index of suspicion. However, I would recommend you to go through a cardiac and blood check-up, so we can exclude the cardiac origin with even higher, almost certain, probability: EKG, echocardiogram, cardiac stress test, plain chest X-ray and complete blood workup. Remember, pain in the chest can also come from other origins, such as lungs or muscles and skeleton. While at it, I would suggest you to start on a healthy diet:- green leafy vegetables and fruit- alcohol up to a maximum of 30 g ethanol a day (one beer or one glass of wine)- quit smoking- more chicken and fish, less red and raw meat- 60-minute daily physical activity (walking, swimming).I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards."},{"Patient":"hi im Marilyn im 16  5'7  i weight  146 . so yesterday in gym we were doing heart rate monitors and he took down our resting heart rate before starting and mine was 140 bpm and i was wondering if that's bad ? because when he saw it , his eyes got big and was like woah that's high.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I read your query. I understand your concern. During physical activity, heart rate goes significantly high and it is considered a normal event, the formula being 220 - age. In your case, due to strenuous activity, it goes up to 204 beats per minute. However, if this is a figure seen while resting, it is not normal, since the normal heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute, and in highly trained athletes it is considered normal down to 48 beats per minute. Now, this may have been a totally benign and harmless, one-time episode, that can be elicited even in physiological states (such as, anxiety, fear, stress or menstruation). However, I would recommend that you should obtain an EKG, since there are some genetic syndromes that are found in teenage years and mandate prompt treatment. I am absolutely not saying that this is the case. Even in this state where my index of suspicion is very low, my opinion is that you should get an EKG done and consult a cardiologist. I hope I was helpful. Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a woman in her late thirties. I am experiencing significant (obvious) swelling in my feet, ankles and calves almost every day.

I am overweight but not obese, and I walk at least 1.5 miles every day. My Grandmother has congestive heart failure (has had it a long time) and she began getting symptoms like this in her thirties. Do you think that is my future as well?","Doctor":"Hello dear user!I have gone through your query and understood your concerns!Thank you for sharing them on healthcaremagic.We can't be sure that these symptoms you are experiencing now indicate heart failure without doing some examinations. Usually swollen ankles and feet are found in heart congestive failure, but in these cases, feet and ankles are more swollen in the evening and less in the morning. Kidney problems, diabetes, thyroid problems etc, may lead to similar symptoms. So to determine the real cause of these concerns I would recommend you to do some examinations to let us know more about your health.- Blood pressure monitoring- Blood sugar and lipids- Urine test, proteinuria- Liver enzymes, and kidney function indicators (creatinine, urea)- ECG- Heart ultrasound examination and cardiologist consultationThe doctor may ask for more examinations if he sees reasonable.

But remember not to miss it as it is very important for you. Also, get PT/INR checked at least once per week.

Lipid profile and LFT within range. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Normal blood pressure standardized in the world population is: systolic 100-139 mmHg, diastolic 60-89 mmHg. According to your age, it is uncommon, although not impossible, to have high blood pressure (hypertension). The blood pressure can go up and down during one day, because a myriad of reasons. It is recommended that you check your blood pressure after being 15 minutes in relaxing state and sitting. You could also be put on a 24-hour blood pressure monitor, to check your BP throughout a day, and decide whether this is a some-times a day thing, or it is a constant finding. You must remember that various drinks, such as xanthyne derivatives (coffee, tea) and energy drinks, then moderate-to-strenuous physical activity, or excessive stress or anxiety, tend to increase the blood pressure. I would also suggest you to reduce the amount of salt you eat. Also, if you have episodes of occasional or binge drinking (hence, probably, the liver enlargement), you should restrict its intake to 30 g ethanol a day (i.e. one beer, one glass of wine or one shot of a heavy drink, such as bourbon, vodka, gin etc.). In the end, don't forget to measure your blood pressure in both arms.I hope I was helpful. Feel free to ask again.

I have been assessed for heart replacement but have been told that is not necessary at this stage. Will my symptoms gradually worsen and if so over how long a period. I am now on medication for life. My medication is ramipril, sprionolactone, bisopropol, simvastatin, warfarin and digioxin. Would appreciate any thoughts you may have. Thank you. Mark","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I understand your concern.Now, the therapy you described you are taking, is crucial in stopping the progression of congestive heart failure and further remodeling of heart chambers. A normal heart pumps 55-70% of its content during one systole. A damaged heart, whatever is the cause, that is pumping 10-15% of its content, means that contains 85-90% of the content after its contraction. This is acconpanied with high pressures throughout the body. Any factor that \\"helps\\" in raising this pressure, can decompensate your condition and put you in dangerous symptoms, such as salt intake, moderate to vigorous physical activity. Another thing is that a dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart) is prone to dangerous, potentially life-threatening, arrhythmias. At this stage, no matter the life expectancy, I would recommend you to discuss with your regular physician/cardiologist about the possibility of implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent these arrhythmias. I hope I was helpful. Take care."},{"Patient":"I was violently ill on a flight coming home from the States and vomited quite badly.  A couple of days later, I experienced a lump feeling at the back of my throat which to date has not gone away.  I have tried several OTC remedies for heartburn, reflux etc... but all to no avail.  Is this a result of vomiting as it seems too coincidental to only have had these symptoms after I vomited.  What can I do to get rid of this feeling?? Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.  Regards, Janet.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question. Welcome to HCM.Well, it could result on these symptoms, but only if you previously had, even mild, gastritis or gastro-oesophageal reflux. After vomiting and in inflammatory states that include the oesophagus and/or the stomach, there is a drop of pressure in the lower oesophageal sphincter (a \\"lock\\" that normally does not allow the acid content of the stomach to go \\"backwards\\" to oesophagus). I recommend you to have a trial with anti-histamine H2 receptor drugs (ranitidine 150 mg x 2 tb/d for a month) or with a protein pomp inhibitor drug (PPI: omeprazole 20 mg x 2 tb/d for two weeks and x1 tb/d for two more weeks). Also, you should refrain from using certain food and beveragea: coffee, chocolate, alcohol, tobacco, spicy and grilled food, pickles.

Do the stents return me to a \\"normal\\" life expectancy schedule or should I expect to be compromised?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern.It is my opinion and my in my experience, you can live a completely normal life after stent placement. It is a safe and effective treatment for coronary artery disease. However, there are some things that should be taken into consideration. First, you have to be regular in taking your medication. There are certain drugs that are added to your therapy especially to keep these stents patent (such as, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, one of these added to aspirin). Second, there is always a probability of intrastent re-stenosis (a phenomenon that is produced by the innermost lining of the coronary arteries, which is charachterized by narrowing the stent). This phenomenon's probability to happen is 16-20% in cases when a bare metal stent is used, and approximately 4% when a drug-eluting stent (a bare metal stent plus a anti proliferative medication coating) is used. This probability applies to all people. Third, a body of studies has shown that the more stents are used, the greater the probability of re-stenosis is. Also, the narrower the artery and the smaller the diameter of the stent, the greater the probability of re-stenosis. In the end, I would like to say that stents are remedies for coronary artery plaques and can be considered, with simple precautions taken afterwards, cure for coronary artery disease. I hope you live a long and healthy life.Best regards"},{"Patient":"I have had heartburn since 2011 it is not heartburn because it burns every single day of the week even.when I don t eat anything I can.just walk or bend over and get bad burning in my chest plus the chest pain and it apears that underbmy left arm pit is a burninh and it feels as if blood.vessels are swollen to.touch I can feel.them moving when I put my hand there and.rub it up and down also when I touch it my chest starts to hurt very badly I have been.sweating none.stop all day and feel very hot when I have the air on and tired.. I have no clue what this could be","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I read your query and understand your concern.Now, the description of the heartburn you provided, is with highest probability from the stomach, as the origin. This symptom is called pyrosis, and is produced when the highly acid content of the stomach is returned to oesophagus or, sometimes, throat and mouth. This can happen from various reasons, mostly from a disbalance between acid-producing and acid-inhibiting factors in the stomach and from the lower oesophageal sphincter insufficiency. Without digging further more into theoretical details, I would suggest you to refrain from certain food and beverages that favour acid production and/or inhibit acid-inhibiting factors and/or lower the pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter:- alcohol and tobacco- chocolate- tea, coffee (xanthyne derivatives)- spicy and grilled food, and picklesI would also recommend you to start a course with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI): omeprazole 20 mg x 2 tb/d for the first two weeks, then 20 mg x 1 tb/d for four other weeks, and accompanied with domperidone x 3 tb/d. Also, you should not lie down, but sit up or stand, for at least 90 minutes after you have had your last meal.

Such level of blood pressure may lead to heart, kidneys, blood vessels, brain damage etc. The pill you are taking every day is an anti hypertensive drug, that helps normalizing blood pressure but it seems to be not enough. You have to add other drugs in your therapy, like diuretics or other class. Please consult with your doctor as soon as possible to give you the proper medication. Have an active lifestyle, with physical activity, diminish the amount of salt in your diet, be careful with fatty foods.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I read your query.A insufficient heart or a insufficient pump is a situation where heart is not able to properly eject its blood content during systole. Thus, this produces an insufficient peripheral organ blood and nutritional supply, as well as causes high pressures in \\"upper floors\\" (i.e. lungs). In this condition, a great caution should be made and every thing that increases heart workload should be stopped. For example, salt should be refrained from his diet. He should not ingest alcohol. Also, all medical measurements should be made to lower this heart's workload and pressures, such as furosemide, spironolactone and an angiotensiogen converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I: captopril, enalapril, lisinopril), which I'm assuming he is already on. Furthermore, my opinion is that, in this stage of congestive heart failure, you should discuss with your regular cardiologist about a possibility of ameliorating the quality of life and whether this subject is a good candidate for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). All the above mentioned measures are undertaken to prolong lifespan and to slow down the progress of the disease.I hope I was helpful with my answer.

I will start my answer, by clearing the normal blood pressure figures: systolic 100-139 mmHg and diastolic 60-89 mmHg. It happens in vigorously trained athletes that these figures go up on various periods during day. Given your age (>45 years of age) you are in risk for high blood pressure (hypertension) and cardiovascular events. I am not saying that this is a reason to worry, per se, but this is standard for all male population of the world. Therefore, I would suggest you run some tests. First, I recommend you to be put on a 24-hour blood pressure monitor, to determine if there is hypertension or not. If yes, proper treatment should be instituted. At this point, I would also recommend that you restrict salt intake to a minimum and restrict your drinking to a maximum of 30 g ethanol a day (a beer or a glass of wine a day). Also, I would recommend you run some blood tests: urea, creatinine, AST, ALT, electrolytes, total cholesterol, LDL fraction and triglyceride.

I carefully read your query. With the information you provided, I would say that we are facing a problem with your stomach. The chest discomfort, as you describe it, is called pyrosis, and is the burning-like sensation in chest which is produced by the returning of the highly acid stomach fluid into the oesophagus. This situation can be produced even if Helicobacter pylori is negative (it is present only in 30% of American population). Hereby, I would recommend you to follow the measures stated below. First, you have to lie down at least 90 minutes after you have had your last meal (the average time that stomach takes to \\"push\\" its content to the small intestine). Second, I would recommend refraining from some food and beverages that produce more acid and, thereby, irritate the gastric inner lining (mucosa), such as: - coffee, tea (xanthyne products)- chocolate- smoking and alcohol- pickles, grilled and spicy foodThird, I would recommend you to start on a course with a protein pump inhibitor (PPI) drug. For instance, omeprazole 20 mg x 2 tb/d for the first two weeks and 20mg x 1 tb/d for two other weeks. After all these measures are undertaken by you, your symptoms should subside. If they remain present, I would recommend you to perform a upper gastro-intestinal (GI) endoscopy. I hope I was helpful.

Thank you for asking on HCM. I carefully read your query and will try yo be thorough with my answer. The above described symptoms could be of various origins. As a cardiologist, I would like to clear the cardiac origin first. Chest pain with coronary artery origin is called angina and it is described as a chest tightness, heaviness which starts in the midchest region, radiates to both sides of the chest, throat, jaw and left arm, start with physical activity and ceases with the cessation of this physical activity. People with high blood pressure are prone to have these symptoms and, adding your age, are in risk for cardiovascular events. I would recommend you to be put on a 24-hour blood pressure monitor to see if your hypertension is properly controlled, and further adjustment should be made. As for the episodes with losing memory and not remembering what where you doing, I am not sure if these are fainting episodes. Anyway, I would recommend a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor and a colour Doppler echo of the carotid (neck) arteries. Then, it would also be advisable you consult with a neurologist. At the end, I would also recommend some blood tests: cholesterol, LDL-fraction, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, liver function tests and fasting and 2 hours after the meal glucose.

My opinion is that these are benign episodes and usually of no significance. However, if you continue to be concerned, I would recommend you to be put on a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor, to determine if these episodes are more common that you think and, if so, proper treatment should be instituted and caution should be recommended.

I understand your concern.During occasional or binge drinking, depending on how \\"trained\\" is the organism, in the human body happen a lot of problema and disbalances. An important disbalance is that of body fluids and electrolytes, which tend to produce also skipped heart beats (extrasystoles), at times even true paroxysmal episodes of supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Tha mainstay here is that you quit drinking alcohol or, at least, restrict it to a maximum of 30 g ethanol a day (which means one beer or one shot of heavy alcohol, such as vodka, a day). In my opinion this symptom should subside, if you undertake this lifestyle changes.

What is concerning to me, actually, are the figures of heart rate that you provided. This may be a sign of a arrhythmia that can happen in those moments that you have a heart rate of 187 beats per minute.

This is a poorly controlled high blood pressure, if it constantly remains in the figures you provided.

More than increasing the dosage of Losartan, I would recommend you to take it 25 mg x 2 tb/d, to have a greater span of effect throughout the day. My opinion is that this is not enough, however. Therefore, I would suggest adding a hidrochlorthiazid 25 mg x 1 tb/d to your therapy, at first. If the blood pressure continues to be unacceptably high, i.e. more than 140/90 mmHg, then we can try to add amlodipine 5 mg x 1 tb/d to your therapy.

Thank you for your question. I understand your concern.Contrast dye used nowadays for various medical examinations is principally made of iodine. These allergic reactions are expressed by several forms by the human body, ranging from a simple rash to a true anaphylactic shock. Not only people with allergic reactions to dye are at risk for allergic reaction, but also people with prior allergic reactions to various food and drugs. In our clinic, we have an experience with people with prior possible allergic reactions some time in their lives. The proper pre-medication is as follows:- 2 ampulles of Prednisolon 25 mg, intravenously administered 13, 7 and 1 hour before the procedure- Telfast 180 mg, administered orally 13 and 1 hour before the procedure.I am content to say that, when this pre-medication for allergic reaction was administered, we had not have a single episode of allergic reaction to contrast dye.I hope I was helpful with my answer.

Angina, the chest heaviness in the midden part of it, that comes from a coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque of various severity, usually starts as episodes arising on physical effort. Although, we cannot exclude the cases that it arises even at rest.

So symptoms of heart attack usually aggravated when there is increased oxygen demand of heart as in any type of physical or mental exertion.3) With every episode of heart attack there is permanent damage to heart muscles and there is progressive decrease in pumping capacity of heart.  So you should not neglect these symptoms.Seek immediate medical attention.Heart attack can be confirmed by doing ECG, Heart enzyme test (Trop T/ I, CPK-MB usually immediate after episode) 2DEcho of heart which can help in determining pumping capacity of heart.Most definitive way to determine percentage of occlusion of blood supply to heart is coronary angiography.Hope this helps you, if so do vote helpful."},{"Patient":"I'm a 40 year old male that experiences a heightened heart beat and dizziness from time to time.

TMT test mentioned that Inducible ischemia is positive. what it means? What should be next step?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks  your question. Inducible ischemia on TMT means - There is insufficient blood supply to heart when there is increased work load on heart. This may be due to narrowing of blood vessels that supply blood to heart (coronary arteries). In such situations during resting state  blood flowing through coronary arteries is sufficient to meet metabolic need of heart. But when there is increased work load on heart as during any type of physical or mental exertion, (there is increase in demand of oxygen and blood supply of exercising body to meet this demand heart has to work more) the blood flowing through coronary arteries is not sufficient to maintain metabolic need of heart. In that case there may be development of changes of heart attack in heart. In such situation it is advisable to do CAG (Coronary Angiography) to know- Whether there is blockage in coronary arteries or not. - Degree of blockage if present. - Number of blockage. Depending upon it appropriate treatment can be advised. Hope this helps you, if so do vote as helpful."},{"Patient":"What s wrong with my heart ?

Six months later, I had two grand mal seizures and the neurologist in Omaha stated that I had cut back on my seizure medication and this caused the seizures. I recently moved back to Tucson and saw my old neurologist. He looked at the MRI that I had taken in Omaha and said that I had developed scar tissue and that I wouldn t ever be able to go off Keppra . I ve had two issues. (1) I have lost short-term memory (2) I have very high blood pressure.

What is the connection between Clopidogrel and bleeding gums AND when should prophalytic antibiotics should be prescribed prior to oral treatments.?","Doctor":"For what reason , clopidogrel is prescribed? Secondly at times mucosal bleed may occur, but rare. As you already have dental caries, the reason of bleeding is same.

I had been taking 20mg of fosinopril daily for several years to keep my B/P low. Within 30 days after the ablation procedure, my B/P began increasing to the point of being worrisome. Doctor doubled fosinopril to 40 mg but it didn t reduce my B/P. He then added 2.5 mg of Amlopidine which, combined with the 40 mg fosinopril now controls my B/P.

He is in remarkable shape for a man of his age, working out daily, playing golf 4-5 times a week, and in excellent health other than the low nighttime heart rate determined by wearing a heart monitor for two weeks. For the past three weeks, he has been awakened by the sensation of a racing heart. Is this normal? The readings that are generated by the pacemaker transmitted via telephone show nothing out of the ordinary yet he is terribly troubled by the racing heart. What are his alternatives?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. A single- or dual-chamber pacemaker works in a way that, when heart's natural electrical system does not work (does not \\"spark\\"), it comes into play. However, pacemaker does not work when the opposite happens, i.e. when heart rate goes up. Simply put, it works by not letting the heart stop. If this pacemaker implantation was indicated for a disease called the sick sinus syndrome, then the heart rate going up is not a surprise, being a characteristic of this syndrome in the first place. I assume these episodes might have happened in the past. At this moment, I would recommend that maximizing the dosage of drugs used to slow heart rate and/or adding an additional heart rate-controlling drug to the therapy. I would recommend adding amiodarone 200 mg x 1 tb/d, but I cannot say this with certainty as I do not know what medication is he on. Not letting aside that he should do an EKG and his pacemaker checked by the regular cardiologist or physician. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Feel free to ask again.

The relatively novel techniques that were discovered and used to diagnose coronary artery disease, such as nuclear stress test and coronary computed tomography (CT), are shown to be particularly helpful in excluding coronary artery blockages. However, a positive or not conclusively negative result of these tests, warrant further evaluation. Simply put, even if would be 99% sure that your coronary arteries were clean, it is that 1% of doubt that would make me recommend a coronary angiogram, where we can evaluate blockages (if there are blockages) and treat them properly.

If you have done ECG, chest x-ray  and blood work it is hard to believe your chest pain related to heart or lung problems.

In this senerio optimisation of medication is best.  Apart from ranolazine,  other drugs  helping you to get relief is  nicorandil,  trimetazidine .  Optimisation of beta blocker dose,  ivabradine and nitrates. To bring it to your notice that isosorbite and nitrostat are similar drugs and taking both will not help.  As the problem you face needs a more detailed discussion and review of report,  do follow up with us or your doctor if symptoms persist.

I would like to explain that these supplement may cause some side effects like:–Increased Heart Rate–Rapid Breathing or Shortness of Breath–Sensation of Tingling, Itching, Tickling in the Neck, Face and Limbs–DrowsinessIn rare cases it has been shown that chronic intake of GABA supplements over a period of time (3 months or more) has been related to an increase in feelings of anxiety, probably by the tolerance of the body to the drug (it means that higher doses are needed to reach the same effect as before).So I would recommend you to consult with your attending physician and perform a complete check up (routine blood test, ECG, chest x ray, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes), in order to exclude other possible causes of this clinical scenario. Interruption of GABA supplements and a short term therapy with anxiolytics like alprazolam may be helpful. Hope to have been of help!Greetings!

Now, I am having pain in my right side and burning in my below chest area. It lasts for about 2 hours. Should I get and upper or lower GI?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I understand your concern.The features of the pain that you described, are more likely to have a oesophageal or gastric origin. In my opinion, I would recommend that you had some changes in diet, as a first step. I am referring to all the food and other materials that can irritate gastric mucosa and overstimulate acid production, such as:- caffeine, tea (xanthyne derivatives)- chocolate- spicy food- grilled food- tobacco, alcohol etc.Also, you should have your last meal at least 90 minutes before you lie down and check the Helicobacter pylori in stool. If these measures don't work, then I recommend a trial with a protein pump inhibitor (PPI) drug, such as omeprazole 20 mg x 2 tb/d for the first 2 weeks, and 1 tb/d for other 2 weeks. If the symptoms persist, then go ahead with the upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy. I am not saying it is counterindicated to do it right away, but my opinion remains that you should undertake the above mentioned changes first.I hope I was helpful.

Thank you for using HCM. I carefully read your concern.Acenocoumarol is an oral anticoagulant, which takes effect on the body after 48-72 hours. Therefore, the opposite is also true - if you discontinue it, you should wait 48-72 hours for the effect to wear off. Now, every time that INR goes off the range, various methods and dosages can be used to maintain it within range, depending on how high or how low it is. In this scenario, I would recommend a more often measurement of the INR, and consulting the doctor for the dosage of acenocoumarol, on a daily basis, untill a more equilibrated dosage can be instituted.I hope I was helpful.

I read your concerns. Thank you for your query.Now, I spotted two possible cause for these symptoms, from the brief information you provided.First, as it is know sometimes happening to patients suffering from diabetes, who are on glucose-lowering agents (glibenclamid, insulin), the sugar can be lowered below normal range and this is a response to low glucose levels provided to the brain. If this is the case, patient feels weak, is covered in sweat, feels a tremor on his knees. This situation can be overcome with eating a candybar or drinking a glass of juice.Second, it can happen by various pacemaker dysfunctions (end-of-life battery, lead dislodgement), i.e. every problem with the pacemaker, which makes it not work properly when needed. To investigate this, you should go to you doctor's office, and test the pacemaker to see if it is working properly. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Feel free to consult again.

Thank you for asking on HCM. I carefully read your query and I understand your concern. The \\"skipping heart beat\\" is a situation that is called premature heartbeat or extrasystole. It represents an activation of the electrical system prematurely, usually from an another excited site within the heart muscle (ectopic beat). When atrial in origin, or single ventricular, they usually are harmless and nothing to worry about. Let this aside, I would recommend you to have an EKG and a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor or an episode monitor. After having these examinations in hand, we can further discuss about the severity of this condition, and whether we should start or withhold treatment. I hope I was helpful. Feel free to contact me again. Good day."},{"Patient":"I had a high on a c-reactive protein test that came with a group of tests. This was last summer.  Not concerned about my heart till I had a strange shimmer in my heart last night and this morning. Is there more blood tests or other test to check my heart or should I be concerned at all? My father had a heart attack about my age.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank your for contacting HCM. I carefully read and understood your concerns. The C-reactive protein (CRP) is an established indicator of coronary artery disease risk. People who are higher on CRP have a greater risk for an eventual cardiac event than people who have in within normal ranges. It is, in common words, an indicator of the presence of inflammation within the atherosclerotic plaque (fat build-up in coronary arteries). Other test that can show this phenomenon, although not specific, is a recent discovered factor that is linked with this kind of inflammation - the red blood cell distribution width (RDW). Also, I recommend you to check your blood levels of total cholesterol, LDL fraction and triglycerides.Chest pain, indicative of coronary heart disease - angina, is more like a tenderness, heaviness on the midden part of the chest, it is triggered by physical activity (although it can happen while resting), radiates to the both sides of chest, jaw, left shoulder and left arm. According to your characteristics, you have a positive familial history for cardiac events. Do you smoke? What is your age? Besides blood test, I would recommend you to have a full cardiac check-up with an EKG, echocardiogram and a cardiac stress test.Keep in mind that a series of changes in diet and lifestyle will help improve your risk factors for cardiac disease, such as a diet rich in fibres, poor in salt and a regular, 60 minutes, physical activity a day.I hope I was helpful. Feel free to contact me again. Good day."},{"Patient":"Is there any repair of a complete A/V blockage. The S/A node is kicking right along. The node switch is not completing to vents. Have two chamber pacer. Some data about experiments in England with stem like cells. Possibly to much calcium blockers for hypertension plus age???","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I understand your concerns.The pacemaker is mostly placed in cases where the electrical impulse cannot be generated and/or conducted by the heart's specialized structures to do so. It works in the way that it is stimulated any time that heart structures fail to do so.I suppose that calcium channel blockers which you are taking to controll your hypertension are from the fraction that do not act on atrioventricular (AV) node (the \\"dipins\\"). Even if they are from the group that strongly inhibit conduction in the AV node (verapamil, diltiazem), it does not matter, because the implanted pacemaker would act by producing a beat.My opinion is that you should consult the doctor who periodically controls the functioning of your pacemaker. If you remain on AV block, after havin a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation, the highest probability is that it is not functioning properly (end-of-life battery, lead dislodgment, pacemaker dislodgment in the subclavian pocket, etc.)I hope I was helpful.

I am aged 72 YEARS - A DIABETIC PATIENT TAKING INSULINE 30 UNITS AND UNDERGONE BYPASS SURGERY 11 YEARS BACK IN 2004?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question. I read your query.Clinidipine and other calcium channel blockers that do not act on slowing the heart rate may be effective as a single-drug therapy in hypertension treatment. However, every measure that is made to decrease the workload of the heart, helps it maintain its function better. The aim for blood pressure levels in a diabetic patient is to keep it less than 130 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic. Depending on your blood pressure levels, I would recommend adding a drug that also slows heart rate, or, if your BP is less than 130/80, changing the clinidipine with a beta-blocker or, if you have airway or lung problems, with verapamil or diltiazem (calcium channel blockers that slow the heart rate).

If you can, please tell me, has she had any episodes of fainting with or without loss of conciousness? Does she take drugs that lower blood pressure or slow the heart rate? My opinion is that she should do an EKG and be put on a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor. Also, an echocardiogram should performed, to assess heart muscle and valve functioning. After these tests are done, we can judge if this problem is of cardiac origin and, if it is, proper measures of treatment must be undertaken. I hope I answered your question.

Presently,  she is having no problem but sometimes she tells i am feeling breathlessness while walking. Hence please guide me what treatment now has to give.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for asking on HCM. I carefully read your concerns.It is important that you mentioned the fact that this happens while walking. If she complains about it, it means this shortness of breath is making her upset. There are certain, major lung and heart diseases that present with shortness of breath. My index of suspicion is moderate at this phase, but I would recommend a visit to the cardiologist and performing an EKG, echocardiogram and a cardiac stress test. Also, blood tests would be helpful. You see, sometimes, the coronary artery disease does not present with angina, rather with non-specific symptoms, like shortness of breath. In this case, it would be called cardiac dyspnea. About the high blood pressure, if it is diagnosed and established, then I assume she is on treatment. I would recommend adding another agent to the therapy, if the BP figures are constantly high. Furthermore, it is important to restrict salt in diet. I hope I was helpful. Take care."},{"Patient":"For the past 4 nights i woke up around the same time with a rapid heart beat.

I understand your concern.During sleep, there is a predominance of the parasympathetic system acting on the body. However, there is a phase - rapid eye movement phase - which is characterized by a flush of catecholamines (adrenalin) in the system, causing your heart rate to go up. You said that you tried a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitoring. My opinion is that you have nothing to worry about. However, If you continue to be worried, I would recommend you to be put on a episode rhythm monitor, which allows you to turn the machine on right at the moment when your symptoms happen. Then you can go at your physician's office and read the EKG registered at the moment of your symptoms. I hope I was helpful. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 65 years old. I am very active as I play badminton 3 times a week for more then 30 years. Sometime in 2009 I had angioplasty done. Three of my arteries were blocked and the heart surgeon were successful in implanting 3 medicated heart stens. I had been taking medication since then to lower my blood cholesterol and blood thinning medicine. Since then I have been as active both in my work schedule and exercise. My question is how long will the medicated stens last? And do I get the same symptoms of impending heart attack like numbness of the left arm, sweating and fatigue, if the stens are not functioning?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for the question and welcome to HCM. I will try to be as thorough as I can. There is a vast body of data from various studies about medicated stents (drug-eluting stents). We can always restrict our discussion to the rate of blockage within the stent (intrastent re-stenosis). DE stents are like bare metal stents (BMS), except that they have a lining with a cytostatic (anti-proliferative) drug (tacrolimus, everolimus etc.). When a stent is placed, the innermost lining of the artery acts against it by over-proliferating, and this is the drug that inhibits this phenomenon. The rate of intrastent re-stenosis, with these medicated stents, is about 4% and the maximum risk for this to happen is during the first year after it was placed. Now, given that you once had the need to place three stents to your coronary arteries, puts you in a group of population with a risk of further developing coronary artery disease. I am not saying this to scare you. It is just to inform you that symptoms can happen one day again, or may never happen again. Whether these symptoms, if they appear, are from intrastent re-stenosis or a new-developed stenosis in a coronary artery, we cannot be sure until a coronary angiogram is carried out. You should consult your cardiologist, should your symptoms happen in the future. I hope I was helpful. Take care. Good day."},{"Patient":"hi, im diabetic and been noticing a achy left arm and shortage of breath as well as neck pain which i usually brush off? im wondering if i could b possibly having  a mild heart attack? and i have no idea what i should do because by the time i get a appointment at my clinic the symptoms will most likely gone.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concerns. During diabetes, especially in subjects that have poorly controlled diabetes, it comes at a moment that small vessels of the body and nerves become affected. Therefore, it is not surprising that a diabetic patient lacks the specific symptom of coronary artery disease - angina. Instead, these patients more likely tend to have non-specific symptoms, such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), sweating, drowsiness and/or tenderness in places where angina usually radiates (in your case, the left arm). I will not go on and say that this is definitely coronary artery disease, but there is a chance it is. So, I would recommend you to go to the clinic, with or without these symptoms, have an EKG, echocardiogram and a cardiac stress test, eventually a coronary angiogram. If you are diagnosed with coronary artery disease, proper treatment should be undertaken immediately. I hope I was helpful. Best regards."},{"Patient":"I have had this off and on pain in my chest for about three months now. I have had x-ray and my blood work done about a month ago and everything was clear - they tough it was chostochondritis and gave me some NSAID's - they do help but the pain has not gone away. I have also had ECG, thrombosis tests and everything is normal. However the pain is still here. It feels like grabbing sometimes, sometimes it is sharp. I am otherwise healthy 34 year female.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. My opinion is that taking NSAID for chostochondritis is a good choice. I would only add that NSAIDs work by inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins, which are a very important factor in counterbalancing the acid formation in stomach. Knowing this, there will be excessive, uninhibited acid formation, which predisposes the mucosa of stomach to ulceration. Therefore, if you decide to go on NSAIDs, I would strongly recommend that you accompany them with a gastric protector, such as a histamine-H2 receptor blocker (ranitidine 150 mg x 2 tb/d) or a protein pump inhibitor (PPI: omeprazole 20 mg x 1 tb/d). I hope I was helpful with my answer. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"My husband is scheduled for a cardiac cath tomorrow morning because his nuclear stress test came back abnormal. He does not have angina. He has had a bit of loss of energy and endurance. Those were his only symptoms. We were told there is an 85% chance there is a 70% blockage in his RCA. I know once you have the stent, there is no turning back so I am hoping for clean arteries. We would like to have a conversation with the doctor before the procedure to make sure he doesn t decide to put in the stent if my husband could manage without it. What questions should we ask or how could we present it so he knows we trust his judgement, but really want to be conservative here? When is the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) indicated?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I read your query and understood your concerns.Allow me to start my answer with an analogy. Stent placement in a coronary artery is a remedy to the artery, as it is taking antibiotics when you have sore throat. If there is a blockage greater than 60%, then placing a stent is reasonable. There are no drugs or therapeutic remedies that would cause regression (\\"growing down\\") of the intracoronary atherosclerotic plaque. With the maximum of usage and dosage, they could stop it from building up, at best. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI: balloon + stent) is a safe and effective treatment of intracoronary plaques. It is accompanied with a great deal of symptom relief. With the right and proper care after the stent implantation, it should be successful. As about the fractional flow reserve, it is used by the operator when he has doubts whether to deploy a stent or not. In this term, I would only speculate if I gave you a precise answer, because I would had to see it myself. Summing up, my opinion and recommendation is that, if that plaque results over 70% in coronary angiogram, a stent should be implanted. At the end, the choice is always yours.I hope I was helpful.

Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. A hypokinesis of a certain area of the heart muscle is indicative of ischemia of that are. It means that this certain part of heart does not move the same (it is \\"lazy\\") in comparison with the rest of the heart muscle, throughout the cardiac cycle. I would suggest you run a blood test for Troponin and cratine phosphokinase - MB (CK-MB), and lactat dehydrogenase (LDH), to check if this is a recent or a remote event.

The fact that cough stops it, is another important clue. I would recommend you to see a doctor, have an EKG and a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor. Better yet, I would recommend an episode rhythm monitor, a machine that you can turn on and off when this happens again. Even if it is a harmless arrhythmia or premature beats, my opinion is that you should go through and diagnose it as soon as possible, so the right measures for treating or not treating it, might be undertaken.

The other type comes when the heart lining (pericardial sac) is inflammated and is described as a stabbing pain that worsens when lying down and decreases when sitting prone.

If this the case, I suggest you contact your physician and change to a drug from an another class of blood pressure-lowering agents. Second, it can be a sign of a failing heart. My opinion is that this is not the case. However, I would recommend an echocardiogram, to assess the motility and function of the heart muscle, as well as the functioning of heart valves.

From all data that exist and from our clinic's experience, the stent placement in these portions is a very dangerous procedure, both technically and from a result-oriented point of view. Therapy with drugs will only help you calm your symptoms, while the plaque is still stable. But, this blockage will eventually get bigger and totally block the artery, causing a heart attack which, in this position of the artery, is potentially lethal. Therefore, my recommendation is that you should proceed with the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Of course, the choice is only yours.I hope I was helpful and thorough in my answer. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"My dad Had an MI 2 mnths back. He underwent angioplasty n 2 stents were placed. He gets a little chest pain at times which subsides on its own. And sometimes he gets high blood pressure, what could be the cause now? Secondly he has persistant dry cough. Wat is the reason for that?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query.I would open my answer by giving you an information regarding stents. A bare metal stent (BMS) has a 16-20% rate of narrowing, whereas a drug-eluting stent (DES) has a 4% rate of narrowing. I think that you were advised, on discharge, to have periodical cardiac stress tests, 1, 3 and 6 months after the stent implantation. My opinion is that if these symptoms are of high intensity and severity, and/or similar with the ones that heralded the heart attack, you should conuslt your cardiologist and consider performin another coronary angiogram to see how the stents are doing. As about the dry cough, I assume your father is on a drug from the class of angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I: captopril, enalapril, lisinopril), which produce cough as a side effect in 10-15% of subjects that use it. If this is the case, I would recommend changing this drug with a drug from the angiontensin receptor blocker (ARB: losartan, valsartan, eprosartan) class. The dry cough should subside in three weeks.I hope I was helpful. Best regards."},{"Patient":"I am having extremely high blood pressure and symptoms of Pheochromocytoma. The 24 hour urine collection test and the Plasma test were positive, with the hormone levels very high. I had a CT scan done of my abdomen and pelvis but it didn t show a tumor. I am still having symptoms and my blood pressure is still very high, even on blood pressure medicine. Could the tumor be somewhere else? Why would the hormone levels be very high if there isn t a tumor? My doctor is doing nothing else for me and I am very confused about all of this.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I carefully read your query. A high vanylmandelic acid and other metanephrine levels in urine are indicative of pheochromocytoma. It is a tumor that generally arises in the adrenal glands, approximately in 85-90% of cases. However, there is the rest of 10-15% of cases that it can be originated elsewhere in the body, any organ system that has chromaphine tissue. If you have sudden rises of blood pressure, which cannot be controlled by medication, and/or angry reaction from time to time, and/or combining of changing of you face color from pale to red and vice versa, this is probably pheochromocytoma. I would recommend that you proceed further with a total body scan and have the above mentioned urine tests done again. Also, I would recommend a consult with an endocrinologist and a surgeon, after you have your test results back. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi,my father is of age 56. He is diabetic from last 9 years. An year before he had heart attack and have undergone heart by pass surgery. Now his TMT test is positive. His cholesterol is under control. Is there anything to worry? What should we do next?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for using HCM. I understand your concerns.I can make a lot of assumptions based on the brief history you provided. However, I will try to explain some common scenarios. Maybe an artery that was not significant by diameter was left without by-pass, judged by the cardiac surgeon. This same artery could have had a significant narrowing that could produce a positive cardiac stress test. There is also a chance of narrowing of one of the by-pass vessels, keeping in mind that the rate of narrowing, especially when saphenous vein is used for by-pass, is 8-10%. Having a positive stress test, I would recommend a coronoray angiogram, to check the native arteries, as well as the patency of the by-pass grafts.I hope I was helpful. Take care."},{"Patient":"WOULD A PACEMAKER MAKE ANY IMPROVEMNT TO MY DAD. HE IS NINETYFIVE, HAS NO MEDICAL CONDITIONS. HE IS ABLE TO WALK WITH A FRAME.

I understand your concern. Your father appears to have trifascicular block or third degree atrioventricular block. No matter which is the right diagnose of these two, pacemaker implantation is indicated. I can understand that your main concern is about his age, since he is in the oldest old age-group of patients (a dekagenarian). I would take the liberty and inform you that the oldest patient to have pacemaker implanted, in our clinic's experience, is a 103 years old lady. As I write, she should be 106 by now and was last checked last month. Even though the greatest fear is that this is a delicate age, my opinion is that pacemaker implantation is a safe procedure. Of course, I am not saying that the risks are the same for him, as they are for, let us say, a 65 years old person. Still, my opinion remains the same. I hope I was helpful with my answer.

Welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. First, I would like to recommend some tests for this diagnosis. It would be reasonable to do an echocardiogram, to assess the movement of heart muscle, to confirm or exclude a recent or remote heart attack as the main cause for this heart enlargement, as well as to assess the functionality of the heart valves. Furthermore, I would recommend a series of blood tests, such as cholesterol, triglycerides, renal function tests, liver function tests and electrolytes. From the symptoms and fitness you describe, she is probably in heart failure, class II of the NYHA (New York Heart Association) classification system. Since the damage to the heart is now factual, I would recommend starting her on treatment with furosemide (Lasix) 40 mg x 1 tb/d and ramipril 2.5 mg x 2 tb/d. If ramipril is counterindicated, then she can start on losartan 25 mg x 2 tb/d. This is added therapy, while I assume she is on proper medications for established diagnoses. Also, I would recommend that she should a diet free of salt. About the skipped heartbeats, she should be put on a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor, to establish if these events are dangerous and how often they happen during a day. Then, you can consult her cardiologist whether to start also on amiodarone 200 mg x 1 tb/d, or not. I hope I was helpful with my asnwer.

I really don't think I could go through it again","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. If I am assuming right, this a paroxysm of a supraventricular arrhythmia (atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter). I would recommend as a first thing to do to be put on a 24-hour Holter rhythm monitor, or an episode rhythm monitor, which you will turn on when you have these symptoms again. Anyway, bisoprolol is a beta-blocker with a good effect on high blood pressure, bot not a significant effect on heart rate. If you do not have lung or airway problems, I would further recommend that you switch to atenolol 50 mg x 2 tb/d, or 25 mg x 2 tb/d, depending on the blood pressure figures, being a beta-blocker that has a better overall effect on heart rate and blood pressure, as well as decreasing the workload to the heart.I hope I was helpful with my answer.

Thank you for your question. This feeling is commonly caused by brisk standing up from a sitting or lying position, especially after sleeping. It is called orthostatic hypotension (a short-timed, moderate, drop in blood pressure due to change of position and redistribution of body fluid). I would recommend you not to stand up immediately, but go from a lying position to a sitting position, maintaining it for 1-2 minutes, and then stand up.

Thank you for asking on HCM.As I can see, there is a dropped heart function, probably there is a heart muscle damage. I would rather not go on and speculate in giving an exact timing about life expectancy, due to the fact that there are many factors combined. Maybe, the cardiac surgeon can give you an approximation.

I wish you a good health"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, Iâ??m in a seemingly unique situation in regard to my lung health for my age, and I hope to gain a more thorough understanding of what I can expect in the future. I am 31 years old, male, 6â??0â?? tall, 195 lbs, and I started smoking when I was about 23. I smoked around Â¾ of a pack a day during this time frame. Though seemingly not a lot of pack-years, I have a high strung personality, and I smoked very quickly if that means anything. Maybe a year or so ago I started noticing some issues with my body. Heart palpitations and significantly elevated heart rate at times (may be partially related to stress and/or anxiety). Also, I started to experience rib pain, sometimes for days at a time in one spot, but the pain would come and go, and be located in different areas of my chest. I also noticed that these pains would sometimes show up in my armpits, lower back, hips, and abdominal region, though most often in the ribs and armpits. These pains prompted me to ask my GP for a chest x-ray about 7 months ago. My GP determined that I had moderate lung hyperinflation and told me this is indicative of emphysema, but at its beginning stages. X-ray showed no signs of bullea. The doctor told me that this hyperinflation will reverse over the years if I quit smoking. I did some internet research, and I decided to see a Pulmonologist. A spirometry was ordered, and some of the values include (from memory but accurate, I do not possess the test results anymore): FVC: 127% of predicted FEV1: 108% of predicted FEV1/FVC ratio: 71% (Normal value for my age/gender/height/weight is 82% according to test) The interpreterâ??s opinion is that FEV1/FVC is borderline, and the test results indicate normal lung function. Results not significantly improved after inhalation of Asthma medication, though some of the other values not shown above were improved a little. The Pulmonologist was not too concerned, but he did prescribe an Albuteral inhaler, as I do experience very slight shortness of breath. It seems that it takes a little more effort to breath than it used to, the use of the inhaler does help though. I have quit smoking since this ordeal, and the pains, palpitations, and heart rate issues have gone away. But I still do notice my breathing is not quite as efficient as before smoking. I usually sleep on my side as I find breathing easier this way. I really would like a second opinion in regards to hyperinflation being reversible as long as I quit smoking. My GP said that my lungs should revert back to normal size in 5 to 10 years. In my research, I did not read this anywhere, and I read a lot. I like my Doctor a lot and trust him, but he is very young. The other thing I would like to know is based on the info I provided, and being at a relatively young age, what can I expect 20 years from now and beyond. My GP feels that I probably donâ??t have anything to worry about provided I donâ??t smoke, but this doesnâ??t seem realistic to me, and I feel he may be trying not to worry me about it. I will be less worried when I have a realistic understanding of my situation. Please help, and thanks. My email is YYYY@YYYY . Thank you in advance for taking the time to help me.

I am assuming it is a regular beat. My opinion is that no further investigation is warranted. I hope I was helpful. Greetings."},{"Patient":"Missed my metoprolol pill (25mg) at noon. After supper (~6:30 p.m.) I noticed the AF flutter and irregular heartbeat, reminding me of the oversight.  So I took a 25 mg metoprolol right away. It is now 10 p.m. There has been improvement in the degree of irregularity but the beats are not the normal even pace. What should I do? I am not experiencing any pain or shortness of breath.  I am 73. I normally take one 25mg tablet, twice a day (noon and before bedtime).","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question. If this was a paroxysmal episode of atrial flutter, then there is only a slight chance that missing of a single dose of metoprolol causes it. This episode warrants treatment aiming converting this arrhythmia to sinus rhythm. The efforts in doing that should be undertaken in a healthcare facility where cardiac monitoring is readily available. This consists in compensating the possible electrolyte disturbances (mostly potassium levels), giving digitalis derivatives in intravenous route to slow down the heart rate with a chance of self-converting, or administering pharmacological therapy (amiodarone, propafenone) or electric shock (if hemodinamically unstable). After converting into sinus rhythm, proper therapy to maintain this rhythm should be instituted. I hope I was helpful. Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a sore chest as well as an occasional feeling of heavyness on my chest, i went to the doctors and they tested me with an EKG a oxygen count device a blood pressure moineter and they tested my blood sugar and briefly listened to my heart, everything came back fine and they said it was probubly a pulled muscle, Is there anything i need to worry about? I am a male age 15 with no history of drinking smoking taking drugs diabetes or heart defects.","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms are probably related to a musculo-skeletal pain, considering your young age. Anxiety can mimic this clinical situation too. Anyway, if the chest pain is triggered by deep breathing or manual massage on the chest, it is probably related to a local musculo-skeletal pain or inflammation. In such case ibuprofen or acetaminophen would help relieve your symptoms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Her home attendant just took her BP/pulse and reading was 128/77, pulse 100. She just started the Lasiks Thurs. May 7, 2015. She says she can breathe ok, but attendant says she s breathing heavy in a recliner chair w/feet up. She s adamant NO HOSPITAL. Do I need to worry?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for your query. I read it carefully.Now, the echocardiogram is really important in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) in identifying the ejection fraction of the ventricle and in assessing the movement and compliance of the heart muscle. My opinion is that furosemide (Lasix) should be continued, but she should be put in a very low salt intake diet. Furthermore, she should be restricted to only performing routine activities of everyday life. The problem is that any moderate to vigorous effort, as well as other factors (e.g. salt) that increase the workload of a failing, insufficient heart, raise the possibility of decompensating the CHF and exacerbate severe symptoms, that may be even life-threatening.

Should I worry?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that first of all it is important to differentiate pulsus bigeminus form pulsus alternans by cardiac auscultation, as there is a lot of confusion between them.It may be a sign of hypertrophic obstructive csrdiomyopathy, or other disorders, like possible effect of beta-blocker use, dyskalemia, hypothyroidism, disorders of the cardiac conductance system, etc.I recommend you to don't panic! As long as you are free of any disturbing symptomatology, and do not exert clnical signs and symptoms of heart failure, you don't have to worry too much!Probably we have to do only with some extrasystoles without any clinical significance.Nevertheless, I recommend you to consult your cardiologist for a careful physical examination (including cardiac ousculatation), and a comprehesive review of your cardiac condition, to rule out any possible underlying factors.Hope to have been helpful to you!

Thank you for asking on HCM.There are many alternatives on treating, maintaining and controlling the atrial fibrillation. If you do not have airway or lung problems, I would recommend Atenolol 50 mg x 2/d (or metoprolol), which is a beta-blocker with a stronger effect on heart beat, than bisoprolol.

I understand your concerns.I can only assume the scenarios when a totally occluded (blocked) artery is not opened. In my experience, there are several reasons we do not open a 100% blocked artery. In cases of a remote myocardial infarction, which was caused by a totally blocked artery, there is no benefit of opening an artery which, after opening, would supply a damaged territory of the heart. In other cases, the left circumflex artery is the dominant artery (8% of people worldwide) and the right coronary artery is a small, non-important, artery. The risk would be higher if the artery is opened in these cases, then the benefit would be. Another reason is, if the other artery (the one that was 98% blocked) was stented in a state of an acute myocardial infarction caused by this artery, then the other artery is stented in a second time.These are the major reasons why an interventional cardiologist has doubts of opening a closed artery.

I read your question carefully and I understand your concerns.The blockage of the small artery that you are referring to, is probably in a diagonal branch of the left anterior descendent artery (in which, I suppose, was the stent implanted). At times, it can be a big artery, but in 95% of cases it is a small artery, which is responsible for a small territory of the heart. However, as small as it is, it can produce symptoms, like angina. With the proper discharge treatment, my opinion is that, in your case, it shouldn't cause you problems. My opinion is that you should take your therapy regularly and perform a stress test 1, 3 and 6 months after the stent implantation. An echocardiography would be appropriate after 3-6 months, to re-evaluate the function of the heart muscle.As stress is concerned, it is only a minor risk factor in generating coronary heart disease. The disease was there and stress was a plus factor to exacerbate it. Family history of heart disease, however, is a major factor. I recommend you measuring your cholesterol and triglyceride levels, keep a diet of low salt, high fibre (green vegetables and fruit) and performing a 60 minute physical activity per day.I hope I was helpful.

I read you concerns carefully.If it is a chest pain described as heaviness, then an additional stress test would be appropriate, to rule out cardiac causes of the pain. If it is related to your meals, then it may be with a cause from the stomach. It may be from rheumatological factors. It also may be caused (rarely) as a side effect of Celebrex use.

I ve been losing weight for the past 5 months. In March I went to my cardiologist to have my heart checked. Since then I am on Lisinopril 20mg to control my bloodpressure. All the tests were fine. At the time of my doctors visit I was weighing 230lbs. So I dropped around 36 pounds in 5 months. Is that normal? Also, it doesn t stop. I keep losing weight. I changed my diet a little bit, but nothing radical though. Less soft drinks and deep fried food, other than that I have decent lunch and dinner. I don t have any pain or loss of appetite. My bowel movement is normal and stool color is light-brown to brown. Could Lisinopril be the cause of my weight loss? Also, I have anxiety and get very nervous with the slidest pain. Could anxiety also be a cause? Your thoughts and comments are more than welcome. Many thanks Michael","Doctor":"H, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to lisinopril, as this is not a common adverse effect related to this drug. Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician and performing some tests to investigate for the possible underlying causes: - complete blood count for anemia - PSA, Ca19.9 and CEA plasma levels - an abdominal ultrasound - a chest X-ray study - vitamin B12 plasma levels for possible deficiency. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It s like in the very middle.  Could this be sinus or what? Any thoughts.  I google this and surprisingly there isn't really anything but blood pressure things. I have alway had perfect or sometimes low ( according to plasma donation center standards anyway) thanks rachel","Doctor":"Hello Rachel!Thank you for asking on HCM! I understand your concern, and would explain that your rattling sensation are just palpitations, that everyone has experienced on certain moments during his life. Do not worry about them.Returning to your question, I would say that generally palpitations are increased sensations when the person is on normal sinus rhythm. There is not any indirect way to confirm sinus rhythm, besides to register by means of a resting ECG during palpitations, or to undergo an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring (hoping that palpitations will be present during registrations).So I would recommend you to perform an ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter) to rule out any possible arrhythmic events (ectopic beats, supraventricular paroxysmal arrhythmia,etc), and some additional lab tests like complete blood count (to rule out anemia), thyroid hormone levels (for any possible dysfunction), fasting glucose, chest X ray, and if suspicions are raised a cardiac ultrasound.Hope to have been helpful!

I'm on the third day of it. I am 34 years old, male. No health issues. I do feel my heart flutter once and while and just feel tired.. Is this a normal reaction to being sick?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that this feeling looks like a paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia (an episode of atrial fibrillation or flutter, frequent ectopic beats or even ventricular arrhythmia, etc). There is only one way t oconfirm any possible arrhythmic events, by means of ECG registernig during such unpleasant feelings. The most appropriate option would be to undergo an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring (Holter test).In addition I would recommend you to perform a medical check up by your internist or cardiologist, for a comprehensive physica lexam, a resting ECG, chest X ray study, some additional lab tests like complete blood count, PCR, Thyroid, liver, renal function tests, blood electrolytes, etc, to rule in/out any possible flu complications, like thyroiditis, pericarditis, myocarditis, etc. that may lead to generation of cardiac arrhythmias and altered overall health status. A cardiac ultrasound would be necessary, if suspicions of myo-pericarditis, etc are raised.Hope to have been helpful! Greetings!

He went to the doctor last Thursday, He went for a check up and came home with three medications. One was for high blood pressure, and the other one was for stress, and one? Well we ended back today a day earlier then hos original fallow up. He was in pain in his lower back, we thought it could be kiddney stones, he is in alot of pain? the Doctor said it was normal gave him another perscription ,Cipro we just got back home and he is tiered , so he goes to lay down and passes out on his way I am worried can you give me some kind of answer on whats going on? The medications are lorezepam,Terazaosin,lisinopril and now cipro","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern I would like to explain that there are some interactions between the drugs he is taking. It has been shown that lisinopril and terazosin can cause an exaggerated first dose hypotensive response. This means that when combined together in the first days they can cause an extreme decrease in the blood pressure. Another drug that can cause fatigue and sleepiness is lorazepam, which is a drug which main effect is anxiolytic and sedative. I would recommend you to closely monitor his blood pressure. If it is low, I recommend to consult with the GP and lower the doses of lisinopril and lorazepam. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!

At the ER they gave me a shot of Ativan and suddenly all my symptoms went away. I was sleepy the rest of the day, but I got home just fine. Could this have been a panic attack? I also have a thyroid condition and I take Synthroid. I was told that my Thyroid tests were high and I need medication adjustment. Could this have caused these symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms seem to be caused by a panic attack, which may be related to the thyroid hormonal imbalance. I would like to explain that pseudo-hyperthyroidism induced by higher doses of synthroid can cause anxiety, tachycardia and panic attacks. I recommend you to consult with your endocrinologist ,perform thyroid hormone levels to consider the possibility to lower synthroid doses. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!

Can you give any insight on this?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms seem to be caused by anxiety or nightmares. Have you measured your blood pressure during these episodes? The lightheadedness and excessive sweating seem to be related to an autonomic reflex. I recommend you to consult with the GP for a careful physical examination, and perform a routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, resting ECG, chest x ray, blood electrolytes and closely monitor your blood pressure. A polysomnography may be necessary to exclude possible sleep disorders like nightmares which are associated with an autonomic overreaction. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings!

You are too young and with a short experience as a smoker, to have symptoms related to chronic smoking like angina or coronary artery syndrome. I think that your symptoms may be related to other causes like anxiety or musculo-sceletal issues. I recommend you to perform a resting ECG and routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes, and a chest x ray to exclude other causes. Meanwhile I recommend you to avoid smoking, if this is the only triggering factor of your symptoms. Hope to have been helpful!Greetings! Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I am female aged 53.

The pain which is modulated by the position of the body or body movements (like in your situation) is not related to the heart.It seems to be e musculosceletic pain or pain related to the lungs. I recommend you to consult with the GP for a careful physical examination and perform a routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests,blood electrolytes,a rest ECG and a chest xray.

One week after the last injection another doctor prescribed dexamethasone for her flu.now she has so many problems because of hypertension what should we do?when is it going to stop?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern i would like to explain that it is normal to have drug induced hypertension when using steroids like dexamethasone (although dexamethasone is one of the steroid with the minor fluid retention effect). The high blood pressure is going to decrease slowly after stopping dexamethasone intake. I would recommend to lower the doses of dexamethasone and avoid salt intake with food. If this is not possible due to her clinical condition, i would recommend to start on an antihypertensive drug like a diuretic (hydroclorthiazide) during the treatment with dexamethasone.

As long as he has no fever and the phlegm is clear and limited in quantity there should be no concern but if it continues the same rate and does not appear to decrease he could possibly have contracted a hospital based infection in which case a sputum culture should be performed.

Now moving toward the second question,  MRI or blood test is not the sure shot way to detect Tuberculosis,  however based on the clinical situation your describe and if the MRI picture is characteristic along with associated symptoms and Supporting blood investigation, and considering how common is TB in that area,  one can start with fair chance of getting results the treatment for TB and as you describe He is already responding.  Last each individual responds differently and it also depends on the baseline condition.  However he should be good by 3-4 weeks of treatment.

It is called essential or idiopathic hypertension. You say in your query that your husband makes a healthy lifestyle, so we can ignore some of the factors that affect blood pressure.Related to your concerns I would say that, stroke is not the most common cause which leads to high blood pressure and it has a severe and bad clinic, but uncontrolled  hypertension may lead to strokes.If the levels of hypertension remain high for some days, you may consider antihypertensive drugs to keep it undercontrol. Enalapril or valsartan is my favorite drug for this purpose of course taken by the pharmacist or doctor advise. Try to reduce salt in the diet. Meanwhile an analysis of sugar and lipids in blood must be done. If your husband has other complains or he have not any improvements after these measures, please feel free to write us again or talk with your family doctor at your healthcare center.I hope this answer was helpful to you!Please kindly rate it and write a short review about your experience with me!Thank you and best regards!DR ERIOL."},{"Patient":"my 12 year old son went in for echo today...he now goes in every 3 months. the dr. said that everything is the same as last time just a little bigger. he was born with aortic stanois and also has a enlarged aorta.but the dr.also started talking about what needs to be done. which is strange because she has never talked like that before","Doctor":"Hi,The treatment of aortic stenosis with enlargement of aorta is surgical.

Your question is too broad for me to summarise. Get a 2d echo for exact heart pumping.  If heart vessel s are blocked,  treat it,  other medication to make your heart stronger and prevent further enlargement, includes,  fluid restriction,  drugs which includes groups like beta blocker,  ace inhibitors/ arb,  diuretic,  aldosterone antagonist.

Common causes of sharp pain that is aggravated by movement includes an origin from your muscle or tendons, and sometimes from your lung which is what we call pleurisy. These may occur following a number of insults, including an infection or injury. Hope this is helpful."},{"Patient":"I had a heart attack on 23/11/2012.

After I awoke and realized I couldn t breath normal, move my body, and hardly open my eyes. My sibling checked my blood pressure and it was 144/109. I am 20 years old, 5 1, and weigh 115 pounds. I am healthy, but this fainting has happened three times before. What could be wrong?","Doctor":"Dear Patient,     Thank you very much for your question. Your blood pressure 144/109 is absolutely high because arterial hypertension starts from BP over 140/90. However, many factors affect blood pressure include diet, medication, physical fitness, stress or excitement are some of them. By reaching once your BP 144/109 noone can say that you have hypertension because your condition can be situational; stress or excitement , heavy physical exercises can really elevate your blood pressure and above mentioned symptoms seem to be related to your high BP. Your Body mass index is 21.7 and that is absolutely within the normal range which means you weight is normal for your height.            However, my recommendation is monitor your blood pressure for a week and if it remains as same consult your family physician. If you are stressed, try to reduce your stress level by doing meditation or breathing exercises. If you are a smoker, quit smoking because smoking has a great negative impact on blood pressure. Also visiting your family physician is madatory if you remain with same above mentioned symptoms and persistently high blood pressure. Your family doctor may ask you to do an ECG test if he or she finds it is necessary. Also he or she will go for further testing if they are required. Therefore, check your BP for a week and if symptoms remain same visit your family doctor. Also If you find your symptoms becoming worse, then do not waste your time. See your family physician immediately.Hope I answered your question.Good Luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

I also have been diagnosed with neurocardiogenic syncope like 12 yrs ago. So I do take a beta blocker twice a day....","Doctor":"Dear Patient,    Thank you very much for your question. According to your description you may be having a condition called Extrasystoles or premature heart beats. Premature heart beats are divided into premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions(PVCs). In most cases, PACs are benign and no need of treatment. If you have occasional PVCs and you are very healthy, no need of treatments, however, it is needed to monitor your heart function to rule out how often they occur.                  The only way to rule out your heart function is taking an ECG test. My recommendation for you to visit your family doctor again and explain all your complaints. Your family doctor will direct you to an ECG test , Holter monitor test( 24 hour ECG record) , Exercise ECG and blood tests to diagnose your condition.  In your case, I believe holter monitor test can be very useful to make a diagnosis because it is being highly informative compared to standard ECG testing to rule out heart rhythm disorders due to its 24 hour monitoring. As you mentioned, for your neurocardiogenic syncope the underlying cause may be a heart rhythm disorder, therefore, I advice you to visit your family doctor again and do further testing which may help not only to diagnose your condition properly, but also to treat your condition correctly. If necessary only your physician will then direct you to a consultation of a Cardiologist.I hope that I answered your question.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

I would recommend you to perform a routine blood test for anemia (which can also mimic this clinical scenario), measure your blood pressure regularly in sitting position and standing up position.

I understand your concern, and would like to explain that as long as your BP fluctuates between 120/80 - 135/85 mmHg under treatment, your current therapy is effective. To properly judge about therapy optimisation, there is a need for an overall BP values during the entire day-night interval for a couple of days.If your BP shows several bouts of abnormally high values max to hypertension grade I, and this occurs only when you feel tense, it doesn't seem to be any immediate needs for BP therapy adjustment. Just try to look after your psychological conditions, to autocontrol your anxiety and avoid increased stress.If BP fluctuates even outside periods of excessive stress, then it is necessary to modify your BP therapy; probably to increase medication doses or add another antihypertensive drug.

Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding your concern, I would explain that as long as your heart rhythm is always normally sinus rhythm, there is no place to get panic. Relax and don't worry! Sinus tachycardia is a normal physiological reaction against different exogenous or endogenous stimuli. You need to perform a medical check up by your doctor (GP or internist) for a physical examination and some additional tests tests (ECG, complete blood count to rule out anemia or inflammation, PCR, thyroid hormone levels for any dysfunctions, fasting glucose, liver and renal function tests, blood electrolytes, arterial blood gas analysis, etc), to identify the right cause of your tachycardia.If everything results normal, then a psychological status evaluation is necessary to rule out any symptomatology of anxiety, which may be responsible for tachycardia.Hope to have been helpful!

Evaluation having showed variation in ECG suggestive of a heart attack ( ST elevation) along with increased Cardiac enzymes is almost confirmatory of Myocardial Infarction (an ongoing heart attack). The next best step in case of persistent chest pain is to go through a Coronary Angiogram which will give a clear picture of the status of coronary arteries supplying the heart. Any blocks in these arteries if any will be detected and can be dealt with.If the chest pain has stopped, serial ecgs and cardiac enzymes can be taken to confirm an MI (myocardial infarction) or heart attack in simple words, and then the doctor can proceed to do an angiogram or treadmill test based on the changes.High cholesterol levels might also play a part in clogging up the arteries and hypertension can also lead to damage of arteries and plaque formation. All these are additional risk factors if present in leading to a heart attack."},{"Patient":"have been given a recipe for natural help with high blood pressure and irregular heart rhythm wich includes ginger garlic honey lemon and apple cider vineger. however no measurements of each were given. will this help and what amounts of each are neccesary?","Doctor":"The recipe for making this can be found on the following site most of the home remedies there is no definitive research into the efficacy of it.

I am not allowed to take pseudoephedrine or Sudafed. I checked my pulse because the Sudafed races my heart. My pulse per minute is 98 and I'm laying down. Is that bad or good?","Doctor":"If you feel you have caught a cold, your body might react in terms of you getting a fever. A high heart rate between 80 -120 beating regularly is quite normal when a person has fever. These are the body's compensatory mechanisms to fight the infection, eg Flu (viral). A heart rate between 60-100 is usually normal and not of concern. If you have taken Sudafed, which is not clear in your question whether you have taken it or not, it will also cause a slight rise in heart rate which will settle on its own once the effect of the medicine subsides.In your case a heart of 98 should not be an issue.

The weakness and pain started 3 months after I got angioplasty done in July 2012. I had convulsion 4 days after Angioplasty i.e on 13.07.2012. Since then I am on Eptoin 100 mg thrice a day.The cause for weakness and pain was attributed to Cholesterol medicine dosage of which was reduced. My Vitamin D level too was low. With D rise this was brought to required level. Although I got some temporary relief the pain started again in April,2013. The dosage of Cholesterol medicine was further reduced and again I got temporary relief. Is there any solution for my problem? M.A.Subbaraman From February 2014 onwards the pain level is more and of the doctors whom I consulted , opined that I may be having Fibromyalgia for which some sleeping pill and pain killer was prescribed which I am avoiding and managing with the pain","Doctor":"Muscular pain is a common side effect of statin drugs, specifically Atorvastatin at high doses. Having persistent muscle pains even after dose reductions should probably warrant change of the statin drug altogether. If you are exercising while being on the statin probably you can cut that down slightly to see if it makes any difference. Coenzyme Q10 supplements may help to prevent statin side effects in some people, though more studies are needed to determine any benefits of taking it. A blood test CPK can determine if there is any muscle breakdown leading to the pain. To make a diagnosis of fibromyalgia a history of widespread pain lasting more than 3 months, and other general physical symptoms including fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive (memory or thought) problems need to be present. Moreover this diagnosis can only be made if other diagnoses are ruled out through confirmatory tests."},{"Patient":"when ever i start walking fast or up hill my heart flutters or seams like it skips a beat funny 10 days ago i walked 5km in 46 min and also had 4 bypasses 12 years ago but no shortness of breath or no pain could this be blockage again i have a holter on now ancious to see what come out on it","Doctor":"Holter will diagnose the character of your ecg when you are having those missed beat and we can plan treatment likewise.  However it is important to note that these features can be total unrelated to blockages and be an independent phenomenon.

An acute pulmonary disorder? An abnormal neurological condition? Or something else?!!I recommend you to ask medical asistance to the nearest ER service to rule out/in seriuos health conditions. A careful physical examination, coupled with a resting ECG, some lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, including cardiac enzymes), a chest X ray film, eventually a cardiac ultrasound, a cervical&thoracal thoracic X ray film, etc are necessary to identify etiological reason of your complains.Hope te hapve been helpful!

I had also been tested for svt recently because I have palpitations and a shots run of svt... Is it just the cold making my heart race?","Doctor":"The reason for your heart rate shooting up to 110 in the last two days is infection resulting into fever.  It is natural for the heart to increase its heart rate to meet increased oxygen demands of the body due to fever.  So as soon as the fever and infection settles the rate will come to normal.

He remembers the symptoms that lead up to the black out however when someone speaks to him, touches, shakes him he will not respond verbally or otherwise for time frames sometimes lasting up to 15 minutes. He has been to a Peidetric heart Specialist. He wore a 30 heart monitor and the 48 hour with both showing that he goes into sinus Tachycardia with doctors stating it is all anxiety. Other symptoms include: Increased Blood Pressure, extremely bad head aches, chest pain and tightness, dizziness, fatigue, brain fog, heart palpation, nausea and vomiting. I have had to go out and physically look for him multiple times as he walked home fro school and after school sporting events. ( he no longer plays sports due to this) He has lost his balance up to 10-15 times per day and sometimes falls down completely passing out in the shower, walking around the house, getting out of bed. He has seen primary Physician, another heart doctor and a lung specialist,as well as a Neurologist( has been treating for the migraines) had tons of labs, MRI Scan, CT scan, Ultra Sound of neck area.

The best way to help your doctor in similar situations is to measure your blood pressure every morning and afternoon for a week or so and record the measurements. Your doctor will find your records very helpful. The irregular rhythm needs immediate clarification though. It could be just a few innocent systolic but I could also be atrial fibrillation or other types of significant arrhythmias. I mentioned atrial fibrillation because it is fairly common in individuals with uncontrolled blood pressure.You should discuss your problems with your doctor regarding lisinopril side effects and perhaps choose an alternative regimen.I hope I've helped!

Thank you for asknig on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that Amiodaron is one of the most effective antiarrhythmics used for the above mentioned purpose. But, its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile may lead t oserious drug depositions in several organs (liver, cornea, lungs, skin, etc) and may lead to serious complications, such as pulmonary fibrosis, liver toxicity, vision disturbances, dangerous prolongation of QT interval on ECG, dysthyroidism, etc. The best therapeutical strategy for treating your arrhythmias would be to avoid antiarrhythmics (as they may paradoxically show proarrhythmic effects too), and try to eleminate the possible myocardial organic substrate of arrhythmia by possible cardiac ablation, if suchj a procedure is available to your attending medical center. A comprehensive electrophysiological study should be performed first, to address the pathological issues.Ather medical options are avaliable, besides Amiodaron, such as other antiarrhythmics like sotalol, propafenone, flecainide, etc, but each othem has its own side effects.Hope to have been helpful!

In more severe cases more 'advanced' (and expensive) drugs can be used.The choice of regimen depends on the severity of your condition which is in a large part determined with an ultrasound scan of the heart (echo) but other tests might be needed too.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which may coexist has to be treated as well if present.I hope I've helped!

I would most likely start the treatment you suggest for congestive heart failure first. thanks for your time.   Mary","Doctor":"Hello dear user!Thank you for sharing you concernswith us on HCM!Since you have been diagnosed with congestive heart failure and Hep B as well, you have to be in contact with your cardiologist and hepatologist continuously.They are conditions that must be taken under control any time, and treatments should be taken together. There is no reason to quit each of medication. The medication for the heart failure should be taken always, without stopping a day.It would be better if you consult you cardiologist to build up the proper scheme of your treatment because it will be a combined therapy and according to your cardiac function.ECG, and Cardiac ultrasound must be done to evaluate your heart function.Generally, As I said above, more than one drug is used to treat Congestive Heart Failure- Enalapril, or Valsartan to control your blood pressure and decrease you vascular resistance.- A beta blocker (metoprolol, carvedilol), to control the heart rate and increase cardiac output.- A diuretic (hydrochlorthiazide, furosemide) especially if you have fluid retention, edemas etc.- Digoxin may be suggested by your cardiologist if your heart function is damaged and it can't do its function as a pump.The treatment for the hepatitis, should be adjusted by your hepatologist only, and stopped when the specialist sees appropriate.Take care!I wish you a good health!DR ERIOL."},{"Patient":"hi, i underwent a agioplasty in jan 21 wherein i had 3 blocks from that 2 blocks have being stented, now 1 is remaining.

Thank you for asking on HCM ! I understand your concern, and would like to explain that your clinical scenario is more compatible with your spondilities problem. If you haven't cardiac ischemic symptomatology, and no any abnormal changes on your vital parameters (BP, heart rate, no dyspnea, etc) or any other clinical signs at all, there is not any reasons to worry for the moment.Nevertheless, I recommend you to perform a medical check up, for a careful physical exam, resting ECG, and some blood tests (complete blood count, complete urine test, liver and renal function tests, blood electrolytes, a cervical X ray, etc). Regarding your next RCA angioplasty it depend on your coronary lesions anatomy; on ho severe is the remaining coronary stenosis, and on the intensity of clinical signs it may probably produce. A review of your coronary angiography report, and a cardiac stress test would be necessary to decide the right time to intervene.Hope to have been helpful to you! Greetings!

Blood pressure went to 184/72. However, the test also said that she had horizontal st depression in several of the leads (about 6 of them) at peak stress. The test report said that the st depression resolved by 2 minutes into recovery. The test also said her DUKE score was 3 (although I calculate it at 2.5, based on 10 minutes of exercise and 1.5 mm st depression). And the test report said that it was negative for ischemia with an intermediate chance of CAD and a 1% per year cardiac death rate predicted.

Does any of this seem out of norm to you?","Doctor":"The test you described is normal.  During any exercise even in normal people the blood pressure has to do up,  because a healthy heart has to pump blood to the exercising muscle,  which is a normal requirement.

The doctors in the Caribbean say that stress causes the pressure to go up and when this happens I get  a headache followed by a seizure . It happens  once per month when I am on my job which is teaching small children. Please tell me what I can do to get the pressure down. Thank you","Doctor":"Sir you haven't mentioned the dosage,  though 2 tab atacand  and amlodipine are for blood pressure and tegrital for seizure.  Though you have noticed that seizure are precipitated by BP,  many a times of BP taken after seizure,  it will always be high because a seizure will push adrenaline in the blood and this will increase your pressure.  So the 1st thing is to is keep monitoring your BP at different time of the day and different days.  Maintain a chart.  Mostly you will be on atacand 8mg and amlodipine 5mg,  I will suggest you to take a atacand H,  which has hydrochlorthiazide component as well,  2 benefit it will help bring your BP lower and neutralize the side effect of atacand and amlodipine both (potassium balance of atacand  and water retention by amlodipine.

We have to understand cholesterol is not the only risk factor for all future problems of blood pressure,  heart problems,  stroke,  diabetes and changing overall will help.

When you say LVH on echo,  it means the BP was on higher side to cause LVH,  as you say telmisartan and cilacar are good drugs to  control BP and have complementary action I think telmisartan 40 and cilacar 10 mg will do the trick.  Now on the important issue of beta blocker,  you tend to get bradycardia with aten 50mg in a day,  as you are on so many years on beta blocker and we want to medically manage  IHD,  we should optimise the dose.  Do try replacement of atenolol with nevibulol,  which has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity,  so bradycardia is less as compared to aten.

Now if your diagnosis was mitral valve prolapse which h the echo substantiated,  a beta blocker is a good drug to avoid heart beat irregularities (arrhythmia)  and progression  of disease in form of mitral regurgitation.  Inderal has many systemic side effects the spectrum includes what you described.  Replacing it with a small dose of metoprolol (another beta blocker),  which is cardiac specific will nullify the side effects you face.  Now if you have inappropriate sinus tachycardia,  metoprolol is still one of the drugs you can with monitoring of blood pressure,  another safer alternative is ivabradine,  which just acts on the cause with no other actions on body thereby decreasing any side effects.

I had some research done by a cardiologist and he concluded that the circumstances created an inflammation to my heart thus creating the extra systole. He gave me tambocor 50 to releive the problemens and it worked within hours. After one week I didn't have the extra systoles anymore, but the medication made me feel uncomfortable so I stopt taking them. Ofcourse...after a short time...the extra systoles came back so I was forced to take the tambocor tablets once again. I still didn't want to be dependent of this drug my whole life so I started to work out again in the gym and started taking creatine as a supplementation. Within weeks I got off the tambocor and all symptoms were gone. That was then....now...5 years later...starting one week ago...the extra systole came back and are increasing in frequency. They are accompanied with a little shortness of breath, but I don't know if this is anxiety related. During the last 3 years I've had Testosteron injections (not constant, but from time to time) with the last admission beeing 5 weeks ago. I don't know if the sudden withdrawl could be the cause of this relapse or that it should have nothing to do with it. If anybody has any tip on what I can do (other then maybe start with creatine again)....I'd very much welcome the suggestions","Doctor":"Doing your college days as your cardiologist have suggested surely the extrasystole were due to your life style.  However flecanamide for extra systole is rather a strong drug.  Coming to the present time,  recurrence of similar episode noted.  Now testosterone itself and shoot some extra systole as well as sudden withdrawal.  So restarting testosterone is out of questions.  Now if you have access and the symptoms are everyday,  get a 24 holter,  to make sure that it's nothing more than an extra systole.  If the diagnosis is confirmed a small does of cardiac specific beta blocker like metoprolol will do the trick.  I still don't think tambacor for just extra systole is justified.

Now why bypass in not a good option?  The distal vessels and small caliber vessels so putting a graft there in more probability the grafts will get closed in small while and we are to square one. Options : get a thallium,  if the area is well perfused,  only medical  management to optimise the heart condition and prevent further damage. If there I'd ischaemia in the region of supply,  try opening it up by angioplasty,  the results of which can only be told after opening up the block and seeing the condition of distal vessel However as I said there are good collateral in such cases and medical treatment is optimum for most cases Regards Dr priyank mody"},{"Patient":"HI Doc, I am 37, not obese but not fit either.

I don t sleep well, stressed at work and drink a lot of coffee late at night sometimes. I tried to have small cup today and the same thing started happening to my heart.

Many a times because of our anxious nature there is subjective feeling of palpitations when our heart rate increases transiently, ( which is a normal phenomenon),  however which triggers a cycle whereby the brain register s the normal beating too as palipation because our mind become s more receptacle.  So try cutting such cycles short by Not thinking much. Regards Dr priyank mody"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Stephen, My father had gone through heart bypass surgery 5 months back.

There are many possibilities that acidic symptoms create pain across chest. It happens so because the gas accumulated in the stomach area pushes the diaphragm up.

Since I came home from the hospital there has been an increased amount of bruising and well as a burning pain in the groin area all the way up to my rib area. I also have bruising of my testicles and penis. I have a hard time being on my feet for very long. I am a 54 year old male. Should I be seeking medical attention?","Doctor":"Respected sir,  If there is local pain and increased bruising,  both of which has increased post discharge,  I humbly reiquest you to inform your cardiology as there may be a local haematoma (blood clot)  or pseudo aneurysm,  which are known complications of femoral artery punture(leg artery), used to assess the heart artery to put stent.  Many a times they are managed conservatively so no need to worry in that context, but because you are on blood thinner,  do inform your cardiologist"},{"Patient":"I had an angioplasty on December 13, 2014. I was told I have Broken Heart Syndrome. Two days after the angioplasty( they put a plug that was suppose to melt in about two weeks ) I came home from the hospital. That night I got a severe cramp in my right thigh, last about 4 minutes. My entire right thigh turned black from brusing. Ever since I have severe pain in my right groin area, severe pain in my right hip that goes down my right leg to my knee then goes down the side of my right leg into my ankle and foot. It is severe, sometimes I can t even walk. I told my doctor; his response was I m a heart doctor, only deal with the heart and seek help with another doctor. I have, but no answers. My brother and sister both have had this procedure but they needed stints however they never experienced my type of pain ever. They are fine. They both had the plug in their leg but never had any pain as I do. I have gone to 4 other doctors only to suggest I take tramadol for pain. In other other words they have no answers. Can you advise me as to what I can do. This has become a very disabling pain on a daily basis.","Doctor":"The keg artery is used to assess the heart artery to  do angiography and angioplasty.  Post procedure the sheath is removed and either a plug to seal of the artery or the manual pressure is used to close to would.  Many a times there might be small leak if the plug doesn't stay properly or manual pressure was not adequate.  In a rare patient this may lead to a small blood clot or pseudo aneurysm of that artery,  which may give rise to symptoms you described.  It's it's not increasing in size,  it's managed conservatively with as you say tramadol, and I will add local thrombophobe ointment plus plain ice.  For the pain.  However a local femoral artery doppler to rule out any injury is advised.  Your cardiology would surely know about this as it's a very common complications of angioplasty.

It started when my heart started beating really fast, which I had never experienced before and it freaked me out. I went to the hospital and they did an EKG, blood work, and a sonogram. They found nothing wrong with my heart and ruled it as anxiety. But recently, its been acting up again. Two weeks ago my heart was beating fast enough that I couldn't go to sleep. I was checked out again and they said it was another panic attack. I've also started experiencing chest pains and I've started to have trouble sleeping. Now, my heart is beating again, although it is noticable unless I feel it directly. Is this something to be worried about or just heart palpitations brought on by excessive paranoia, as I have been pretty much thinking about my heart a lot. I am 19, I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs. I eat fruits with every meal and I excercise five days a week.","Doctor":"Hi,  as a 19 year old you are too young to get any heart problems.  So I would like to assure you for the same.  Yes anxiety will make your heart beat faster because of the adrenaline pushed  into your bloodstream due to anxiety,  panic.  However if you worry so much and test s are available I will suggest 2d echo to rule out any structural disease specifically mitral valve prolapse,  seen in your age group and if symptoms are everyday a 24-hour holter to see what actually is happening Regards Dr priyank mody Priyankmody86@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Subject: I am a 40 year old male, 5'10\\", 200lbs.

Issue Overview: I had an apicoectomy in December for an infection above a previous root canal.  During the pre-surgery, a doctor noticed I had a high heart rate (120 resting) but thought it was nerves or the infection.  Last week I had a follow up with my primary care, who said my rate was still high and also gave an EKG with a slight abnormality.  This morning I went to a cardiologist for a stress EKG, who said the EKG itself looked good, but again my resting rate before and after is too high (after 10 minutes post-stress my rate went from 170 back to 120).  In past few nights, I woke up soaking wet from night sweats despite cold weather, have felt light headed at times, as well as some slight stomach and chest pain. Suggestions?","Doctor":"Sir I will like to suggest a 24 holter test as will exactly help us know what is the pattern of increased heart,  is it sinus ( normal)  or some other form of various tachycardia.  If that turns out to be normal,  I would think of a condition called inappropriate sinus tachycardia syndrome,  where someone has a resting heart rate on the higher side. Some lifestyle change may be tried like calming exercise,  yoga,  if still on higher side.

He does a lot of strength training and aerobics. he did not get continuous 2 hours sleep too 24 hours before the medical test. I thought this would have increased the blood pressure and for an aerobics person heart muscles get thickend as per my knowledge. Due to this, the combinations of the report would have given such a result. Is it? and he had taken such test 8-12 months back and found perfectly fit.

I have read that palpitations are normal, but nothing I ve read addresses someone who is plagued with them all day, every day.

It's important to establish the type of palpitations,  because u have it everyday lasting for practically a long time,  get an ecg done during the episode,  if is more rarer a 24 hour holter may help.  This will help know what is the frequency and what are the features of heart beats.  If anyone of then shows heart beat which is normal but more than 100,  we should rule out causes like increased thyroid,  anemia in your age group,  however if the type is not normal a review with your doctor for the treatment is warranted.

If suspicions are raised about a possible myocardial ischemia, then some additional tests are necessary (cardiac stress tests, perfusional cardiac imagine tests, even coronary angiography).Meanwhile, a modulation of antihypertensive therapy is necessary, to maintain his blood pressure values under control.Hope to have been helpful to you.

Today I walked for an hour and even went up 2 fairly steep hills of a grade of approximately 10-15%. One hill was about 75 yards long and the other about 50 yards lone. My heart felt pretty good. I could only notice a slight tinge in the area I described during the walk up through about 6 hours after.      On 7/25/12, we learned I had a “slow heart rate” of about 39 beats per minute in my ventricles.

It would have been withen normal.  Now coming to present symptoms,  sir tightness can be due to coronary ischaemia, where blood supply to the heart is less or secondly in your case the pacemaker setting s may have a problem.  However on exertion of what you described is more than 5 METs in scientific language,  and no recurrence of symptoms would suggest that nothing serious pertains to the symptoms.

Im 24years of age, weigh 150lbs, workout reguraly, and eat healthy. I also quit smoking 2 years ago due to chest pain, and headaches while i would smoke. I do not do any drugs or drink, because i get very sick. I also have a five year old son. I remember the day i first experienced chest pain. It was about 4years ago, and i was pumping gas, when all of a sudden a sharp stabbing pain came threw my chest, by my heart area. At first I wanted to call an ambulance, but decided to drive my self to ER. Chest xrays, EKG, and blood came back normal, except my potassium level was extremely low. SO they gave me this big horse, see threw pill, and sent me on my way. Meanwhile, something else seemed to be happening in my body. I was having excuriating headaches, that would come on very dull, and then explode like a firecracker near my temples. They sometimes would affect my vision. MY wieght was going from up to down, and it just seemed like i was just a wreck. Finally the one thing doctors could rule out, is that i had a very ugly diseased gall bladder that needed removal. During the examination before surgury, I explained to my doctor, of headaches, chest pain, dizziness, extreme fatigue, nausea and upset stomach and weight gain where among my symptoms. She ordered up a few tests, inlcuding an ECHO, in which it was discovered that I did have a heart murmur with LOW regurgitation(but at that time still my EKGS where normal), and a cyst on my kidney. In all I was able to get my gall bladder removed, and was told to have heart and kidney followups. Well that was 3 years ago. In the between time I was suffering, feeling like im dieing, my EKGS went from normal to Abnormal, and was told only because of age. It was ruled out aniexty was the diagnose. Now, I have in total went to the ER on 7 different occasions, where one time my EKG was showing a slight heart attack, so the doctor says, but blood work was fine. On all occasions my symptoms where shortness of breath, chest pain, and headaches. my blood pressure on this one occasion was very high, in which they took me back right away, and put me on a heart monitor, and all was fine. I actually have walked out the ER 3x times before speaking to the doctor, because i felt like they didnt care, or wasnt listening to my symptoms because of my AGE. Today has been the worst of my pains ever. I was driving then all of a sudden i couldnt breathe, and i got so weak i felt like i couldnt drive. I literally feel like my life is slipping out of me, and im dieing from heart failure. My primary doctor knows my history. but hasnt sent me to see a cardo doctor yet, only a nero doctor. He also prescribed me migrane pills, and zololoft(which he promised that it would take away my chest pain 100%) I have stopped taking all his medicine because it doesnt work. Im utterly confused, and lost at the point. My mother died at 44 of a heart aneurysm, and my grandma(from dads side) is suffering from heart failure right now. The last 3x times i came down with these crazy espisodes(atleast thats what i call them), i felt like i was going to die, but i didnt even bother to go to ER, because how can you diagnose a condition if there not even ordering tests to determine the underlying cause?

Pain arising from inflammation of coverings of heart and lungs causes such pains which changes with posture and respiration.4.

About 2 years ago I had a few episodes where my heart skipped a beat and then when the anxiety kicked in, my heart would race. I wore the heart monitor for a week, had 2 ekgs, chest xray, blood work, hormones tested, my thyroid tested 3 different times (only 1 first time test, the enzymes were elevated).

Check ur blood pressure. Get examined when u have such complains. What's ur age? R u having thyroid problem?"},{"Patient":"I have been suffering from heart palpitations for more than 3 years, but now they have gotten worse i-e 120-140 bpm with a simplest activity (standing,walking etc). Recently, i noticed blood in my stool.My question is, are these symptoms interconnected?","Doctor":"Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

I was admitted for observation to the cardiac unit and underwent EKG, Echocardiogram, MRI, chest x-ray, and connected to a heart monitor. ( I was injected with heparin and remained in bed during the two night stay.) All test were within normal range and I was schedule for discharge. When the nurse removed the IV from the back of my hand ( in the bed, laying upright) I experienced vasovegal syncope and asystole for 10.67 seconds (heart monitor was still in place to capture the event). Recovery took place without intervention beyond verbal & touch stimulation. I am prone to elevated feelings of anxiety with needles, heights, hospitals, medical stuff, ). After five more days in hospital waiting for surgeon to return from vacation, a dual lead pacemaker was implanted. Multiple post op complications occurred including pericarditis, a lead perforation and 7 weeks out infection of the surgical site due to a lack of wound check & surgical glue still in place allowing for bacteria to grow. A referral to an electro physiologist cardiologist took place at week 8 post op and at week 9 post op it was determined the pacemaker would be removed. The explant surgery happened in a day surgery and I have been home for 2 plus weeks without device. My current doctor s approach is one of assessment, with my increasing my fluid intake, adding salt to my diet (blood pressure now averaging 105/69) and wearing an event monitor to capture events. My anxiety is huge and I am just beginning CBT counseling to help. I have not returned to work or any normal routine as I fear experiencing an episode. Logically I know I fainted due to the IV being withdrawn, however experiencing the heart stop has me feeling a real lack of confidence.

I go to the Gym 3 times a week. My weight has been consistantly at 183 lbs. I am 6 3 - so not overweight. I have been diagnosed with high colesterarol and have been watching my diet as I do not want to go on medications. Sunday I was on the eliptical machine and did fine doing 20 min at above average resistance and then liffted weights for i hour. Tuesday I ran out of breath after 5 min on the machine. Completed 45 minutes of weights and felt fine. Since then I find myself running out of breath walking up the stairs...feel fine other than that.. I did 40 pushups this morning but really had to catch my breah afterwards. Any advice?","Doctor":"This might be a form of angina in which you experience shortness of breath but no chest pain. It also could be asthma or some other problem related to either your heart or lungs. You are active and healthy but you still do have risk factors for heart disease, which include the high cholesterol, your gender, and your age. The most important condition to rule out promptly is coronary artery disease. See your doctor for an exam, EKG, and discuss getting a stress test. If those are negative, further workup can be done at a more leisurely pace. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i have rheumatoid arthritis, had pericarditis in 2009 after child birth, my hearts been hurting. 6 months ago it was occasional, now its everyday starting in the afternoon and goes into the night. i have swelling in my legs. i have family history of congestive heart failure also. i have fatigue, dizziness, extreme joint pain, all these interfere with my daily household duties.","Doctor":"You could be having a persistent or recurring pericarditis, or you might be having inflammation in the chest wall, either muscular or costochondritis (inflammation in the ribs at the point where they become cartilage, close to the breast bone). Costochondritis often is mistaken for heart pain. I would also be concerned about the development of some congestive heart failure, given your family history and your symptoms of leg swelling, dizziness, and fatigue. See your doctor promptly and get this evaluated. You need an exam, and probably an EKG and maybe a chest x-ray. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I had angioplasty in September 2007. I used to take Aspirin and other drugs continuously. Since I feel better and normal. I stopped taking tablets.However I feel little uneasy and loss sleep.  Doctor  could you please advice whether I should continue the medicine?","Doctor":"It's not a good idea to discontinue such medication without discussing with your doctor first. You don't say what else you are receiving besides the aspirin, but I suspect they are protective drugs for your heart. Aspirin acts as a blood thinner and a small daily dose is strongly recommended in people who have had stents or heart attacks. You do have underlying heart disease which can continue to progress, even without symptoms for a long time. I recommend you talk to your cardiologist and get back on your medicines unless s/he tells you something different, Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"my blood pressure has been as low as 87/54, 90/62,100/54, 118/46 and many more variations, and sometimes it is completely normal, i have palpatations a lot and my pulse wiil run anywhere fron 46 to 66 unless i am involved in excerise.I have been dizzy and lightheaded. I also am hypothyroid. do i have a problem?","Doctor":"Yes, it sounds like you may have a problem with your heart rhythm which could be related directly or indirectly to your low blood pressure. A pulse of 46 is quite low and suggests the possibility that there is a partial blockage in the electrical system in your heart. The palpitations may be related to your heart trying to compensate for the blockage by using an alternate rhythm generator- like something called atrioventricular block with a junctional or ventricular response. Get an EKG done soon and see if that or some other rhythm disturbance is the cause. You might also need what's called a Holter monitor or event monitor. This records your heart beat over time and can detect abnormal rhythms that may only be occurring occasionally. A certain type of nerve condition can also be associated with low blood pressure and heart palpitations. Other tests may be necessary to diagnose this. See a cardiologist and get this evaluated. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My mother suffering from rheumatic heart disease and recently had open heart surgery on oct14.before surgery she had taking an injection named penidure la-12 once in every 3 weeks from fast 30years. now operaction is sucussufully after  2months she getiing rumatic pains ..my doubt is could she continew the pendure 12 inject or not..could you pls help me out","Doctor":"hello,I have gone through your question.Thanks for using HCM.Inj.Penidure LA 12 lacs is  usually give to all patients having Rheumatic valvular heart disease to prevent spell of rheumatic fever and to prevent further deterioration of valvular lesion.Irrespective of surgery we give Penidure prophylaxis till age of 45 Yrs.Because incidence of recurrent streptococcal sore throat goes down after this age.In case of your mother please evaluate her for her joint pain by CBC,ESR ,CRP and ASO titre.If these reports point towards active rheumatic fever then after completing course of 4 weeks of aspirin she  should be give Penidure till another 5 years.My best wishesDr.Teli,MD"},{"Patient":"On January 5th of this year I was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolis.
