The first third of the distance Kolya traveled in x / 10 hours. Doubling his speed, Kolya traveled the second third of the distance in x / 20 hours. Thus, for two-thirds of the distance, he spent x / 10 + x / 20 = 3 x / 20 hours.

Which triangle does not exist?A: 1:1:2B: 1:2:3C: 2:3:4D: 3:4:5","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to understand that the altitudes of a triangle are inversely proportional to the lengths of their corresponding sides. This means that if the altitudes have a certain ratio, the sides of the triangle will have the inverse of that ratio. Let's analyze each option step by step.Option A: 1:1:2Given the ratio of the altitudes is 1:1:2, the inverse ratio for the sides would be the reciprocal of these, which gives us the sides' ratio as 1/1:1/1:1/2 = 2:2:1. This satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 2:2:1 does exist.Option B: 1:2:3For the ratio of the altitudes 1:2:3, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/1:1/2:1/3 = 6:3:2 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for any two sides of a triangle, the sum must be greater than the third side. However, in this case, 3+2 is not greater than 6, which violates the triangle inequality theorem. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 6:3:2 cannot exist.Option C: 2:3:4Given the ratio of the altitudes as 2:3:4, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/2:1/3:1/4 = 6:4:3 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. This ratio satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as 4+3 is greater than 6, 6+3 is greater than 4, and 6+4 is greater than 3. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 6:4:3 does exist.Option D: 3:4:5For the ratio of the altitudes 3:4:5, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/3:1/4:1/5 = 20:15:12 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. This ratio also satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as 15+12 is greater than 20, 20+12 is greater than 15, and 20+15 is greater than 12. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 20:15:12 does exist.Based on the analysis above, the only option that does not satisfy the conditions for a triangle's sides is option B.

Define ( text{ord}(n) := min {k in mathbb{Z}^+ mid f^k(n) = n} ), which represents the minimal period of the sequence ( n, f(n), f^2(n), ldots ) (its orbit). This is the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that applying the function ( f ) ( k ) times returns ( n ) to itself.2. Given that ( f^{(n)}(n) = n ) for each ( n in S ), it follows that ( text{ord}(n) mid n ). This is because the period of the sequence must divide the number of elements in the sequence.3. Specifically, for ( n = 2021 ), we have ( text{ord}(2021) mid 2021 ). Since ( 2021 = 43 cdot 47 ), the possible values for ( text{ord}(2021) ) are the divisors of 2021, which are ( 1, 43, 47, ) and ( 2021 ).4. Consider each possible value of ( text{ord}(2021) ):   - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 1 ), then ( f(2021) = 2021 ). This is achievable by setting ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n in S ).   - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 2021 ), this would imply that the sequence ( 2021, f(2021), f^2(2021), ldots, f^{2020}(2021) ) contains 2021 distinct elements. However, this is impossible because ( f(1) = f^1(1) = 1 ), which contradicts the requirement for a 2021-cycle.   - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 47 ), there should be 47 elements in the orbit of 2021, all divisible by 47. However, there are only 43 multiples of 47 less than or equal to 2021, making this impossible.   - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 43 ), there should be 43 elements in the orbit of 2021, all divisible by 43. This is possible because there are 47 multiples of 43 less than or equal to 2021, which is sufficient to form a 43-cycle.5. To achieve ( text{ord}(2021) = 43 ), we can construct the function ( f ) as follows:   - Take 43 distinct multiples of 43 in the order ( 43m_1 = 2021, 43m_2, 43m_3, ldots, 43m_{43} ).   - Define ( f(43m_k) = 43m_{k+1} ) for ( k ) taken modulo 43.   - Define ( f(n) = n ) for all other ( n in S ).6. This construction ensures that there is one 43-cycle and many 1-cycles, satisfying the condition ( f^{(n)}(n) = n ) for all ( n in S ).Conclusion:The set of all possible values achievable by ( f(2021) ) is the set of multiples of 43.The final answer is ( boxed{ {43, 86, 129, 172, 215, 258, 301, 344, 387, 430, 473, 516, 559, 602, 645, 688, 731, 774, 817, 860, 903, 946, 989, 1032, 1075, 1118, 1161, 1204, 1247, 1290, 1333, 1376, 1419, 1462, 1505, 1548, 1591, 1634, 1677, 1720, 1763, 1806, 1849, 1892, 1935, 1978, 2021} } )."},{"problem":"7.4.

Find the coordinates of A' and B':   The coordinates of A' and B' can be found by solving the intersection of the lines M_aI and AC, and M_bI and BC, respectively. However, for simplicity, we can use the given condition that the areas of triangle ABC and triangle A'B'C are equal.4. Area condition:   The area condition implies that the ratio of the areas of triangle A'B'C to triangle ABC is 1. Using the properties of barycentric coordinates, this condition can be translated into:   [   frac{[A'B'C]}{[ABC]} = 1   ]   This implies that the coordinates of A' and B' must satisfy certain symmetry properties.5. Use the Law of Cosines:   Given the area condition, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the relationship between the sides and angles of the triangle. The Law of Cosines states:   [   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(gamma)   ]   Given the area condition, we have:   [   a^2 - ab + b^2 = c^2   ]   Substituting the Law of Cosines into this equation, we get:   [   a^2 - ab + b^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(gamma)   ]   Simplifying, we find:   [   -ab = -2ab cos(gamma)   ]   Dividing both sides by -ab, we get:   [   1 = 2 cos(gamma)   ]   Therefore:   [   cos(gamma) = frac{1}{2}   ]   This implies:   [   gamma = 60^circ   ]The final answer is boxed{60^circ}."},{"problem":"A circle with a radius of 4 is inscribed in a right triangle, the hypotenuse of which is 26.

We know that a equiv 2(bmod 3) and that a equiv 3(bmod 4). Therefore, we can write a = 3k + 2. It is then required that k satisfy the equation 3k + 2 equiv 3(bmod 4), or equivalently 3k equiv 1(bmod 4).Since 3 is invertible modulo 4 and its inverse is 3, this means that k equiv 3(bmod 4).

Calculate the value of cos 18^{circ}: consider the isosceles triangle ABC where the legs are of length 1 and the included angle is 36^{circ}.The angle bisector from B intersects AC at D. Then the triangles ABC and DAB are similar, so CB: DB = AB: DA, i.e., frac{1}{a} = frac{a}{1-a}.From this, a = frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}. The altitude from C bisects the 36^{circ} angle and the segment AB, so sin 18^{circ} = frac{a}{2} = frac{sqrt{5}-1}{4}, cos 18^{circ} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{sqrt{5}-1}{4}right)^2} = frac{sqrt{10+2sqrt{5}}}{4}.Let frac{sqrt{10+2sqrt{5}}}{4} = x, where x > 0.

Let cos 18^{circ} = x (0 < x < 1), then sin 18^{circ} = sqrt{1 - x^2}.

Since cos 18^{circ} = sin 72^{circ}, we have 4xsqrt{1 - x^2}(2x^2 - 1) = x. We can divide by x since it is not 0.

The second factor is identical to the polynomial given in the I. solution.2. Balázs Nyul (Debrecen, Fazekas M.

In the squares, there can be no more than two and three different numbers, respectively (because the set of numbers in each column is the same), and in the rectangles, no more than one (since both in columns and rows, the set of numbers must be the same).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_da44c9888fa01160fc84g-2.jpg?height=512&width=465&top_left_y=1720&top_left_x=1458)Example for seven numbers see in the figure.Criteria: Only the estimate - 3 pointsOnly the example - 3 points."},{"problem":"Given the complex numbers z_1=3+i and z_2=1-i, the complex number z_1 cdot z_2 corresponds to a point in the plane located in (   )A: the first quadrantB: the second quadrantC: the third quadrantD: the fourth quadrant","solution":"Since the complex numbers are given as z_1=3+i and z_2=1-i, their product is calculated as follows:z_1 cdot z_2 = (3+i)(1-i) = 4 - 2iTherefore, the complex number z_1 cdot z_2 corresponds to a point in the fourth quadrant of the plane.So, the answer is boxed{D}.To determine the quadrant, we expand the product of the complex numbers and simplify it to the form of a+bi (a, b in mathbb{R}).

Understanding the Polynomial Behavior:   Since the polynomial ( p(x) ) has no real roots and (lim_{x to infty} p(x) = +infty), it implies that ( p(x) > 0 ) for all real ( x ). This is because if ( p(x) ) were to be negative at any point, it would have to cross the x-axis to become positive again, implying a real root, which contradicts the given condition.2. Evaluating ( p(1) ):   For ( p(x) ) to be positive for all ( x ), it must be positive at ( x = 1 ). Evaluating ( p(1) ):   [   p(1) = 1^{2010} pm 1^{2009} pm cdots pm 1 pm 1 = 1 pm 1 pm cdots pm 1 pm 1   ]   Since each term is either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ), the sum of all coefficients must be positive. There are 2011 terms in total. Let ( k ) be the number of ( -1 ) coefficients. Then the number of ( +1 ) coefficients is ( 2011 - k ). Therefore:   [   p(1) = (2011 - k) - k = 2011 - 2k   ]   For ( p(1) > 0 ):   [   2011 - 2k > 0 implies 2011 > 2k implies k < frac{2011}{2} = 1005.5   ]   Since ( k ) must be an integer, the maximum value of ( k ) is 1005.3. Constructing a Polynomial with 1005 Negative Coefficients:   We need to construct a polynomial with exactly 1005 negative coefficients and show that it has no real roots. Consider the polynomial:   [   P_0(x) = sum_{k=0}^{501} (x^{2010-2k} - x^{2010-2k-1} - x^{2k+1} + x^{2k}) + x^{1006} - x^{1005} + x^{1004}   ]   Let's analyze the terms:   - ( x^{1006} - x^{1005} + x^{1004} = x^{1004}(x^2 - x + 1) geq 0 ) for all ( x ).   - Each term ( x^{2010-2k} - x^{2010-2k-1} - x^{2k+1} + x^{2k} ) can be rewritten as:     [     x^{2k}(x-1)^2(x^{2010-4k-2} + cdots + 1)     ]     Since ( (x-1)^2 geq 0 ) and ( x^{2010-4k-2} + cdots + 1 ) has no real roots (it is a sum of positive terms), each term is non-negative.4. Verifying Non-Negativity:   Since all terms in the sum are non-negative and ( P_0(0) = P_0(1) = 1 ), ( P_0(x) ) is non-negative for all ( x ) and has no real roots.Therefore, the maximum number of coefficients that can be ( -1 ) is 1005.The final answer is (boxed{1005})."},{"problem":"1. sqrt{1991 cdot 1993 cdot 1995 cdot 1997+16}=","solution":"Let x=1994, thenbegin{array}{l}sqrt{1991 cdot 1993 cdot 1995 cdot 1997+16} =sqrt{(x-3)(x-1)(x+1)(x+3)+16} =sqrt{left(x^{2}-1right)left(x^{2}-9right)+16}=sqrt{x^{4}-10 x^{2}+25} =sqrt{left(x^{2}-5right)^{2}}=1994^{2}-5 =3976031 .end{array}"},{"problem":"A wizard kidnaps 31 members from party A, 28 members from party B, 23 members from party C, and 19 members from party D, keeping them isolated in individual rooms in his castle, where he forces them to work.Every day, after work, the kidnapped people can walk in the park and talk with each other.

Let ( a, b, c, d ) be the number of members of party ( A, B, C, D ), respectively. Initially, we have:   [   a = 31, quad b = 28, quad c = 23, quad d = 19   ]2. We claim that ( 3a + 2b - c pmod{4} ) is constant. To verify this, consider the effect of the wizard's rule: when three members of three different parties start talking, they are converted to the fourth party. This means:   - Three variables decrease by 1, and the fourth variable increases by 3.3. Let's check the change in ( 3a + 2b - c ) under this operation:   - If ( a, b, c ) decrease by 1 and ( d ) increases by 3:     [     3(a-1) + 2(b-1) - (c-1) + 3d = 3a - 3 + 2b - 2 - c + 1 + 3d = 3a + 2b - c + 3d - 4     ]     Since ( d ) increases by 3, the term ( 3d ) does not affect the modulo 4 property:     [     3a + 2b - c equiv 3a + 2b - c pmod{4}     ]4. Similarly, if ( a, b, d ) decrease by 1 and ( c ) increases by 3:   [   3(a-1) + 2(b-1) - (c+3) + 3d = 3a - 3 + 2b - 2 - c - 3 + 3d = 3a + 2b - c + 3d - 8   ]   Again, modulo 4:   [   3a + 2b - c equiv 3a + 2b - c pmod{4}   ]5. Therefore, ( 3a + 2b - c pmod{4} ) is indeed constant. Initially:   [   3(31) + 2(28) - 23 = 93 + 56 - 23 = 126   ]   [   126 equiv 2 pmod{4}   ]6.

Since ( 3a + 2b - c equiv 2 pmod{4} ), we need to determine if all members can belong to a single party.

Specifically, we can model the problem using a graph where each circle represents a vertex and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding circles are tangential.1. Model the Problem as a Graph:   - Let each circle be represented by a vertex in a graph.   - Draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding circles are tangential.2. Graph Coloring:   - The problem now reduces to finding the chromatic number of the graph, which is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices (tangential circles) share the same color.3. Planar Graph Property:   - Since the circles are placed on a plane without overlap, the graph formed is a planar graph. According to the Four Color Theorem, any planar graph can be colored with at most four colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.4. Application of the Four Color Theorem:   - By the Four Color Theorem, we can conclude that the chromatic number of the graph formed by the 1989 circles is at most 4.5.

Expressing the problem in terms of polynomials:   We need to show that for an even positive integer ( n ), there exists a positive integer ( k ) such that:   [   k = f(x) cdot (x+1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1)   ]   for some polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) with integer coefficients.2. Divisibility and polynomial properties:   Since ( x+1 ) divides ( x^n - 1 ) for even ( n ), we can write:   [   x^n - 1 = a(x) cdot (x+1)   ]   for some polynomial ( a(x) ). This implies:   [   2 = (x^n + 1) - a(x) cdot (x+1)   ]   Raising both sides to the ( n )-th power, we get:   [   2^n = (a(x) cdot (x+1))^n + b(x) cdot (x^n + 1)   ]   for some polynomial ( b(x) ).3. Existence of minimal ( k ):   This shows that some minimal ( k ) with:   [   k = f(x) cdot (x+1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1)   ]   exists. If we subtract this equation ( lfloor 2^n/k rfloor ) times from the previous equation, the left-hand side must be 0 (or else the minimality of ( k ) is contradicted). Thus, ( k ) must divide ( 2^n ), implying ( k ) is a power of 2.4. Determining ( k_0 ) for ( q = 1 ):   When ( q = 1 ), we must have ( k = 2 ). Substituting ( x = 1 ), it is clear that ( k ) must be even. Suppose for contradiction that ( k = 2^c ) for some ( c geq 2 ). Let ( h(x) = -g(x) ). Our new equation is:   [   2^c = f(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} - h(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   It is clear that ( deg f = deg h ). Let ( f(x) = (x^{2^r} + 1)u(x) + v(x) ) with ( deg v(x) < 2^r ). We can replace ( f(x) ) and ( h(x) ) with ( v(x) ) and ( h(x) + u(x)(x+1)^{2^r} ), respectively, so ( deg f = deg h < 2^r ).5. Finite field ( F_2 ) analysis:   Consider the equation in the finite field ( F_2 ):   [   f(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} = h(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   Since ( (x+1)^{2^r} = x^{2^r} + 1 ) in ( F_2 ), we have:   [   (x^{2^r} + 1)(f(x) - h(x)) = 0   ]   Since ( x^{2^r} + 1 ) is nonzero in ( F_2 ), we must have ( f(x) - h(x) = 0 ) in ( F_2 ), i.e., ( f(x) = h(x) + 2p(x) ) for some integer polynomial ( p(x) ). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   2^c = h(x) cdot ((x+1)^{2^r} - (x^{2^r} + 1)) + 2p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r}   ]   Let ( e(x) = frac{(x+1)^{2^r} - (x^{2^r} + 1)}{2} ). Note that ( e(x) ) is an integer polynomial, and ( e(1) = 2^{2^r - 1} - 1 ) is odd. Dividing by 2, we get:   [   2^{c-1} = h(x) cdot e(x) + p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r}   ]   Since ( 2^{c-1} ) is even, considering this in ( F_2 ), we get:   [   p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} = -h(x) cdot e(x)   ]   Since ( e(1) ) is odd, ( (x+1)^{2^r} ) and ( e(x) ) are coprime in ( F_2 ). Thus, ( (x+1)^{2^r} ) divides ( -h(x) ) in ( F_2 ), implying ( h(x) = c(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} + 2d(x) ). This implies ( deg h geq 2^r ) or ( h ) is zero in ( F_2 ), both contradictions. Thus, ( k = 2 ).6. General case for all ( q ):   Suppose we have polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) such that:   [   2 = f(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} + g(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   Raise both sides to the ( q )-th power:   [   2^q = f_0(x) cdot (x+1)^{q cdot 2^r} + g_0(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   where ( f_0(x) = f(x)^q ) and ( g_0(x) ) is obtained from binomially expanding and factoring ( x^{2^r} + 1 ) out of all terms but ( f_0(x) cdot (x+1)^{q cdot 2^r} ). Replacing ( x ) with ( x^q ):   [   2^q = f_0(x^q) cdot (x^q + 1)^{q cdot 2^r} + g_0(x^q) cdot (x^{q cdot 2^r} + 1)   ]   This completes the construction.The final answer is ( boxed{ k_0 = 2^q } ) where ( q ) is the odd integer determined by ( n = q cdot 2^r )."},{"problem":"8.

In recent years, the use of mortgage loans by young families has become quite popular. Consider the possibility of obtaining a mortgage with a constant, fixed interest rate.

Suppose that, according to the terms of the mortgage agreement, partial early repayment of the loan is possible without penalty for any amount up to the outstanding loan balance on the date of partial early repayment.Let's assume that a mortgage borrower has additional funds equal to the current monthly payment in the middle of one of the payment periods, and he decides to use these funds to repay the debt in addition to the annuity payment. Should the borrower immediately (i.e., in the middle of the payment period) make a partial early repayment, or should he wait until the end of the period and make the payment together with the annuity payment? For simplicity, assume that in the second case, the additional funds will remain on the current account with zero yield until the end of the period.

As a result, due to the reduction in the principal amount, less interest will be accrued on the remaining debt for the second half of the period. At the end of the period, the regular annuity payment will be divided into the payment of accrued interest for the second half of the period and the repayment of the principal.If the borrower waits until the end of the period, then the entire additional amount will go towards repaying the principal. Since the funds will be held in a current account with zero yield, this decision will not result in any additional effects.Let's write this analytically.Let ( mathrm{T} ) be the amount of money the borrower pays to the bank monthly, ( mathrm{S} ) be the debt amount at the beginning of the period, and ( mathrm{r} ) be the interest rate for the period.In the first case, with an additional payment of ( mathrm{T} ) in the middle of the period, the debt amount will decrease by ( T - 0.5 r S > 0 ), so the interest for the second half of the period will be ( 0.5 r(S - T + 0.5 r S) ), and the debt amount at the end of the period will be ( S - T + 0.5 r S - T + 0.5 r(S - T + 0.5 r S) = S - 2T + r S - 0.5 r T + (0.5 r S)^2 ).If the additional payment is made at the end of the period, the remaining debt will be ( S - T + r S - T = S - 2T + r S ), which is greater than in the first case.Thus, all other things being equal, it is more advantageous to pay immediately.## Criteria:5 points - intuitive justification;10 points - intuitive justification + justification with a specific example;15 points - intuitive justification + justification in general form."},{"problem":"Let (f_i) be a sequence of functions defined by: f_1(x)=x, f_n(x) = sqrt{f_{n-1}(x)}-dfrac14.

It follows that if these equations have a solution, they will have an infinite number of solutions.A systematic method for answering the question would be to use the two equations to find expressions for two of the unknowns in terms of the third unknown. For example, we could find x and y in terms of z, and thus work out x+y+z in terms of z.However, the wording of the question suggests that x+y+z is independent of z. Thus a good starting point is to try to find a way to use the two equations we are given to find a value for x+y+z without the need to find x and y in terms of z.We are given that9 x+3 y-5 z=-4and5 x+2 y-2 z=13If we multiply equation (2) by 2 , and subtract equation (1) we obtain2(5 x+2 y-2 z)-(9 x+3 y-5 z)=2(13)-(-4),that is,10 x+4 y-4 z-9 x-3 y+5 z=26+4,that is,x+y+z=30 text {. }We deduce that frac{1}{3}(x+y+z)=10.Hence the mean of x, y and z is 10 ."},{"problem":"1.

Specifically, we have f(g(g(f(2))))=f(f(2))-2=0; let a=g(g(f(2))). For y=a in (J), we have a(f(x)-1)=f(0), which would mean that f is constant if a neq 0, but that is impossible.

Solving these, we get a=1, b=0.Thus, f(x)=x^{3}-3 x, f^{prime}(x)=3 x^{2}-3=3(x+1)(x-1).Let f^{prime}(x)=0, we get x=-1 or x=1.If x in(-infty,-1) cup(1,+infty), then f^{prime}(x)>0, so f(x) is increasing on (-infty, -1) and (1, +infty).If x in(-1,1), then f^{prime}(x)<0, so f(x) is decreasing on (-1,1).Therefore, f(-1)=2 is a maximum value, and f(1)=-2 is a minimum value.( II ) The curve equation is y=x^{3}-3 x, and point A(0,16) is not on the curve.Let the tangent point be Mleft(x_{0}, y_{0}right), then y_{0}=x_{0}^{3}-3 x_{0}.Since f^{prime}left(x_{0}right)=3left(x_{0}^{2}-1right), the tangent line equation is y-y_{0}=3left(x_{0}^{2}-1right)left(x-x_{0}right).Noting that point A(0,16) is on the tangent line, we have 16-left(x_{0}^{3}-3 x_{0}right)=3left(x_{0}^{2}-1right)left(0-x_{0}right).Solving this, we get x_{0}=-2.Thus, the tangent point is M(-2,-2), and the tangent line equation is 9 x-y+16=0."},{"problem":"9.

Then x = sqrt{2}, y = -sqrt{6}.Then boldsymbol{n} = (sqrt{2},-sqrt{6},1).Also, overrightarrow{OS} = (0,0,2sqrt{2}) is a normal vector of plane ABC,So cos langle boldsymbol{n}, overrightarrow{OS} rangle = frac{boldsymbol{n} cdot overrightarrow{OS}}{|boldsymbol{n}| cdot |overrightarrow{OS}|} = frac{1}{3}.So the size of the dihedral angle V-CM-B is arccos frac{1}{3}.(2) Since overrightarrow{MB} = (-1,sqrt{3},0)And boldsymbol{n} = (sqrt{2},-sqrt{6},1) is a normal vector of plane CMN,So the distance from point B to plane CMN is d = |overrightarrow{MB}| cos langle boldsymbol{n}, overrightarrow{MB} rangle = frac{|boldsymbol{n} cdot overrightarrow{MB}|}{|boldsymbol{n}|} = frac{4sqrt{2}}{3}."},{"problem":"When a certain object is moving, the functional relationship between its displacement S and time t (in seconds) is S=2(1-t)^2.

Since b<c, we also know that a+b<a+c.Combining these two inequalities, we have a+b<a+c<b+c.The maximum difference between any number is (b+c)-(a+b) or c-a.So the same as the one we started with. For the initial list of {20,1,8}, the maximum difference will always be 19 ."},{"problem":"4. (10 points) On the clock tower of a railway station, there is an electronic clock.

Understand the rotation of the ellipse:   The ellipse is rotated counterclockwise about the origin by angles (frac{k}{2n}pi) for (k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, n). This means there are (n+1) ellipses, each rotated by a different angle.3. Determine the common area of the rotated ellipses:   As (n) increases, the number of rotated ellipses increases, and they become more densely packed around the origin. The common area of these ellipses will be the region that remains invariant under all these rotations.4. Analyze the limiting behavior as (n to infty):   As (n) approaches infinity, the ellipses will be rotated by every possible angle between (0) and (pi).

Find the radius of the invariant circle:   The largest circle that can fit inside the ellipse (x^2 + frac{y^2}{3} = 1) has a radius equal to the semi-major axis of the ellipse, which is 1.

In each move, we replace two numbers ( i ) and ( j ) by ( i+j ) and ( |i-j| ). After a series of such moves, all numbers in the set become equal to ( k ). We need to find all possible values for ( k ).2. Prime Divisibility Argument:   Suppose ( k ) is the final number that all elements in the set become equal to. Let ( p ) be an odd prime number that divides ( k ). We will use a backward reasoning approach to understand the implications of this.3. Backward Reasoning:   If ( k ) is the final number, then ( p ) divides ( k ). Consider the reverse of the moves. If we reverse the steps, we would have started with numbers ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( p ) divides both ( i+j ) and ( |i-j| ).4. Divisibility by ( p ):   Since ( p ) divides both ( i+j ) and ( |i-j| ), it follows that ( p ) must divide ( 2i ) and ( 2j ). This implies that ( p ) divides ( i ) and ( j ) (since ( p ) is odd and does not divide 2).5. Inductive Argument:   By induction, if ( p ) divides the final number ( k ), then ( p ) must divide all the numbers in the original set ( A ). However, this is a contradiction because the original set ( A ) contains numbers like 1, 2, 3, ..., which are not all divisible by any single odd prime ( p ).6. Conclusion:   Since no odd prime ( p ) can divide ( k ), the only possible value for ( k ) is 1. This is because 1 is the only number that is not divisible by any odd prime and can be the result of the operations described.The final answer is ( boxed{1} )."},{"problem":"5.

Note that if the numbers in the circle do not alternate in parity, then some two even numbers are adjacent. An even number is a divisor of the sum of the even number adjacent to it and the second adjacent number, which means the latter is also even. Continuing this reasoning around the circle, we get that all numbers in the circle are even, which is incorrect. Consider the number 2n-1. By the proven fact, both of its neighbors are even, and their sum is divisible by 2n-1, so the sum is at least 4n-2. The maximum sum of the two remaining numbers is 2n + (2n-2) = 4n-2. Therefore, the numbers adjacent to 2n-1 are 2n and 2n-2. Without loss of generality, let them be in descending order clockwise. Now and further, the situation will be as follows: around the circle, the numbers from 2n to k are already placed in descending order clockwise, where k>1. One of the neighbors of the number k is k+1, and the other neighbor is no more than k-1, so the sum of the adjacent numbers is greater than k and no more than 2k, which means it is equal to 2k. It turns out that the next number after k is k-1. We again get the situation described above.

USSR) In space, given that one side of a right angle passes through a known point A, and the other side has at least one common point with a known line segment B C, find the locus of the vertex of the right angle.","solution":"Solve by considering the position relationship between A and line segment B C in different cases.(1) If A is on the line segment B C, as shown in Figure 415, construct spheres with diameters A B and A C respectively. It is easy to see that no points satisfying the requirements exist outside the two spheres; while any point inside the spheres has such points (as shown by Q, Q^{prime} in the figure). Therefore, the two spheres and their interiors are the required locus (including the line segment B C), of course, when A coincides with B or C, one of the spheres shrinks to a point.(2) If A is on the extension of B C, as shown in Figure 416, assume without loss of generality that B is between A and C. Construct two spheres with diameters A B and A C respectively, then the required locus is the surface of the larger sphere and the points inside the larger sphere but not inside the smaller sphere. This is because, if Q is a point inside the smaller sphere, a plane perpendicular to A Q through Q intersects A C at a point on A B but not on B C, and any point P that belongs to the larger sphere but not the smaller sphere, a plane perpendicular to A P through P intersects B C.(3) When point A is not on the line B C, as shown in Figure 4-17, construct sphere Omega_{1} with diameter A B and sphere Omega_{2} with diameter A C. It is easy to see that any point on the surface of Omega_{1} or Omega_{2} belongs to the required locus, and any point outside the two spheres, a plane perpendicular to A P through P does not intersect A B or A C. If such a plane is parallel to the plane A B C, it does not intersect B C; otherwise, let the intersection line be l, it is easy to see that since l has no common points with A B and A C, it naturally has no common points with B C either. Therefore, any point outside the two spheres does not meet the requirements.Moreover, any point inside both Omega_{1} and Omega_{2} does not meet the requirements. This is because, for any such point P, a plane perpendicular to A P through P must intersect both A B and A C, and the intersection points are not B or C. Let the intersection line of this plane with the plane A B C be l, then l \\"passes through\\" the interiors of A B and A C, and clearly cannot intersect the line segment B C. Thus, such points do not meet the conditions.On the other hand, any point P inside Omega_{1} but not in Omega_{2} and its interior meets the requirements. In this case, a plane perpendicular to A P through P must intersect A B but not A C, so the intersection line l of this plane with the plane A B C \\"passes through\\" A B and does not touch A C, thus it must intersect B C.Similarly, any point inside Omega_{2} but not in Omega_{1} and its interior meets the requirements.In summary, if B_{1}, B_{2} represent the sets of points inside spheres Omega_{1}, Omega_{2} respectively, and B_{1}^{prime}, B_{2}^{prime} represent the sets of points inside and on the surfaces of Omega_{1}, Omega_{2} respectively, then the required locus is B_{1}^{prime} cup B_{2}^{prime} backslash B_{1} cap B_{2}.Note: This problem repeatedly uses the conclusion: In a plane, if a line intersects a triangle and the line does not pass through any vertex of the triangle, then the line intersects exactly two sides of the triangle and has no common point with the third side."},{"problem":"Place real numbers at the vertices of a pentagon so that the sum of the numbers at the ends of one side is equal to 1, at the ends of another side is equal to 2, ..., and at the ends of the last side is equal to 5.#","solution":"Place the number x at the 1st vertex, 1-x at the 2nd, 1+x at the 3rd, -2-x at the 4th, and -2+x at the 5th.

What is the most likely value of S?","solution":"Solution. Let S_{1} denote the sum of the numbers before the last roll. Since S_{1} leqq 100 and S>100, it follows that S_{1} geqq 95. Thus, S_{1} can have six possible values.1. S_{1}=100. In this case, the value of S could have been 101, 102, ..., 106, depending on whether the last roll was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, with equal probability.2. S_{1}=99. In this case, the last roll could only have been 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, with equal probability, so the value of S (with equal probability) could have been 101, 102, 103, 104, or 105.3. S_{1}=98. This time, the last roll could have been 3, 4, 5, or 6, so the value of S could have been 101, 102, 103, or 104, with equal probability.4. S_{1}=97. This time, only 4, 5, or 6 could have been rolled last, so the possible values of S are 101, 102, or 103.5. S_{1}=96. This time, the last roll could have been 5 or 6, so S could have been 101 or 102.6. S_{1}=95. This time, only a 6 could have been rolled last, so the value of S could only have been 101.From the list, it is already clear that the most likely value of S is 101. More precisely, the probability of 101 occurring is exactly as much greater than the probability of 102 as the probability of S_{1}=95. Similarly, the probability of 102 is greater than the probability of 103 by the probability of S_{1}=96, and so on. The possible values of S in decreasing order of probability are: 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106.Remark. Using the same line of reasoning, for any natural number n(geqq 6), we find that when rolling a die until the sum exceeds n, the most likely value of this sum is n+1. This result does not change if, instead of rolling a die, we randomly select from the numbers 1, 2, ldots, k with equal probability. (Of course, this is only valid for n geqq k.)"},{"problem":"4.

Simplify the given inequality: We start by rewriting the inequality in a more manageable form. We can express the given inequality as:[left(x-1right)^{2023} - 2^{2023}cdot x^{2023} leqslant x + 1]This can be rearranged to group like terms, leading to:[left(x-1right)^{2023} + x - 1 leqslant (2x)^{2023} + 2x]2. Define a function f(x): Let's define a function f(x) = x^{2023} + x, which is valid over the domain of all real numbers (mathbb{R}). With this function, we can rewrite our inequality in terms of f(x) as:[f(x-1) leqslant f(2x)]3. Analyze the function f(x): We note that f(x) = x^{2023} + x is an odd function. Additionally, the derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x) = 2023x^{2022} + 1, is always greater than 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. This implies that f(x) is monotonically increasing over its entire domain.4. Solve the inequality: Given that f(x) is monotonically increasing, the inequality f(x-1) leqslant f(2x) simplifies to solving x-1 leqslant 2x. Solving this inequality for x gives us:[x - 1 leqslant 2x implies -1 leqslant x]This simplifies to x geqslant -1.5. Conclusion: Therefore, the solution set for the given inequality is x in left[-1, +inftyright).

Then N=[(2 k+1)+(2 k+2 n-1)] n / 2=(2 k+n) n, which is a product of two integers with the same parity, since adding the even number 2 k to the integer n does not change its parity.1. Since 2005=401 cdot 5, taking n=5 gives 2 k+5=401, i.e. 2 k+1=397.

We start by expressing the given sum in a more manageable form. The sequence of numbers is (11, 15, 19, ldots, 2007). This sequence is an arithmetic sequence with the first term (a = 11) and common difference (d = 4). The general term of the sequence can be written as:   [   a_n = 11 + (n-1) cdot 4 = 4n + 7   ]   Therefore, the sum we need to evaluate is:   [   left( sum_{n=1}^{500} (4n + 7)^2 right)^2   ]2. Next, we expand the square inside the sum:   [   (4n + 7)^2 = 16n^2 + 56n + 49   ]   Thus, the sum becomes:   [   sum_{n=1}^{500} (4n + 7)^2 = sum_{n=1}^{500} (16n^2 + 56n + 49)   ]3. We can split the sum into three separate sums:   [   sum_{n=1}^{500} (16n^2 + 56n + 49) = 16 sum_{n=1}^{500} n^2 + 56 sum_{n=1}^{500} n + 49 sum_{n=1}^{500} 1   ]4. We use the formulas for the sum of the first (n) natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first (n) natural numbers:   [   sum_{n=1}^{500} n = frac{500(500+1)}{2} = 125250   ]   [   sum_{n=1}^{500} n^2 = frac{500(500+1)(2 cdot 500 + 1)}{6} = 41791750   ]   [   sum_{n=1}^{500} 1 = 500   ]5. Substituting these values back into the sum, we get:   [   16 sum_{n=1}^{500} n^2 + 56 sum_{n=1}^{500} n + 49 sum_{n=1}^{500} 1 = 16 cdot 41791750 + 56 cdot 125250 + 49 cdot 500   ]6.

Each number appears at least once.2. In each row or column, there are no two numbers having a difference of 0 or 1.Let's break down the problem step by step:1. Understanding the Board Size and Conditions:   - The board is ( 18 times 18 ), which means it has 324 cells.   - Each number from ( 1 ) to ( n ) must appear at least once.   - No two numbers in the same row or column can have a difference of 0 or 1.2. Minimum Number of Distinct Numbers:   - Since each number must appear at least once, ( n ) must be at least 18 because we need at least 18 distinct numbers to fill the 18 rows and 18 columns without repeating any number in a row or column.3. Difference Condition:   - The condition that no two numbers in the same row or column can have a difference of 0 or 1 implies that if a number ( k ) appears in a row or column, neither ( k-1 ) nor ( k+1 ) can appear in the same row or column.4. Constructing the Grid:   - To satisfy the difference condition, we need to ensure that the numbers are spaced out sufficiently. One way to approach this is to use a modular arithmetic approach to ensure that the differences are maintained.5. Checking for ( n = 36 ):   - If ( n = 36 ), we need to place 36 distinct numbers on the board. However, constructing such a grid while maintaining the difference condition seems challenging, as noted in the solution.6. Checking for ( n = 37 ):   - For ( n = 37 ), we can try to construct a grid. One possible way is to use a pattern that ensures the difference condition is met. For example, we can use a step pattern where each number is placed in a way that ensures no two numbers in the same row or column have a difference of 0 or 1.   Here is a possible construction for ( n = 37 ):   - Place the numbers in a diagonal pattern, ensuring that each number is spaced out by at least 2 positions in both rows and columns.   However, constructing such a grid explicitly is complex and may require trial and error or a more systematic approach.7. Conclusion:   - Based on the given solution and the difficulty in constructing a grid for ( n = 36 ), it is reasonable to conclude that the smallest ( n ) is likely 37.The final answer is ( boxed{37} )."},{"problem":"Given that O is the coordinate origin, the line l_{1} is x+y-4=0, and the line l_{2} is y=2x. l_{1} and l_{2} intersect at point A.

Consider the two cases for angle ADC:   - If angle ADC = 60^circ, then angle ACD = 180^circ - angle ADC = 120^circ.

Since f(x) = (ln{x} - k - 1)x, we differentiate f with respect to x for x > 0:   f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ln{x} - k - 1)x = 1 - k - ln{x}.   When k leq 0, because x > 1, f'(x) = 1 - k - ln{x} > 0,   so the function f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (1, +infty), there are no intervals of decrease, and no extremum values.      When k > 0, let 1 - k - ln{x} = 0, we find x = e^k,   so for 1  e^k, f'(x) > 0,   therefore the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (1, e^k) and increasing on (e^k, +infty).

To find the maximum value of g(x), we look at the endpoints:   g(e) = frac{(e - 4)ln{e}}{e} and g(e^2) = frac{(e^2 - 4)ln{e^2}}{e^2}.   The maximum occurs at x = e^2 giving us g(e^2) = frac{2e^2 - 8}{e^2}.   To ensure the inequality k+1 > frac{(x-4)ln{x}}{x} always holds, it suffices to have k+1 > g_{text{max}}(x).   Hence, k + 1 > 2 - frac{8}{e^2}, which results in k > 1 - frac{8}{e^2}.   Thus, the range of k is boxed{left(1 - frac{8}{e^2}, +inftyright)}. 3.

However, it primarily checks for any kind of association, not just a linear relationship. Therefore, the statement that independence testing is a test for whether two variables have a linear relationship is not accurate. Independence testing can reveal whether variables are related but does not specify the nature (linear or otherwise) of this relationship. Thus, boxed{text{A is incorrect}}.- Statement B: Independence testing, like any statistical test, cannot provide 100% certainty due to the inherent uncertainty in statistical inference. It operates on the principle of probability, meaning there's always a chance, however small, that the conclusions drawn could be incorrect. Therefore, the claim that independence testing can determine with 100% certainty whether there is a relationship between two variables is false. Hence, boxed{text{B is incorrect}}.- Statement C: The interpretation of a 99% confidence level in the context of independence testing (like using the chi^{2} test) is often misunderstood. A 99% confidence level means that we are 99% confident in the statistical inference made - in this case, that there is a relationship between smoking and lung disease. It does not translate to a direct cause-effect proportion among individuals (e.g., out of 100 smokers, 99 will have lung disease). Therefore, this statement misinterprets what confidence levels indicate about the data. Thus, boxed{text{C is incorrect}}.- Statement D: In the context of the chi^{2} independence test, the observed value k of the random variable chi^{2} is crucial. A smaller k means that the observed data is closer to what we would expect if the two variables were independent, leading to a higher probability of incorrectly concluding a relationship when there might not be one. Conversely, a larger k value indicates a stronger deviation from independence, suggesting a stronger relationship between the variables. Thus, the statement that the smaller the observed value k, the greater the probability of making an error in judging \\"the two variables are related\\" aligns with how the chi^{2} test works.

If the line (l) intersects the circle C at points A and B, find the equation of the locus of the midpoint M of chord AB.","solution":"1. To determine the position relationship between the line (l) and the circle (C), we first identify the center and radius of the circle (C). The circle (C: (x+2)^2 + y^2 = 5) has its center at (C(-2, 0)) and a radius (r = sqrt{5}).   The distance (d) from the center (C) to the line (l: mx-y+1+2m=0) can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line:   [   d = left|frac{m(-2)-1(0)+1+2m}{sqrt{m^2+(-1)^2}}right| = left|frac{-2m+1+2m}{sqrt{m^2+1}}right| = left|frac{1}{sqrt{m^2+1}}right|.   ]   Since (m^2 geq 0) for all (m in mathbb{R}), we have (m^2+1 > 0), and thus (sqrt{m^2+1} > 1). Therefore,   [   d = left|frac{1}{sqrt{m^2+1}}right|  1). This inequality shows that the distance from the center of the circle to the line is less than the radius of the circle, which means the line (l) intersects the circle (C).2. To find the equation of the locus of the midpoint (M) of chord (AB), we consider the coordinates of (M) to be (M(x, y)).   The line (l: mx-y+1+2m=0) passes through a fixed point ((-2, 1)), which means any line parallel to (l) will also pass through a point that forms a right angle with the center (C(-2, 0)) and the midpoint (M).   When the slope (k_{MC}) exists, it can be expressed as (k_{MC} = frac{y-0}{x-(-2)} = frac{y}{x+2}). Similarly, the slope (k_{AB}) between (A), (B), and the fixed point ((-2, 1)) is (k_{AB} = frac{y-1}{x+2}). Since (AB) is a chord of the circle, and (MC) is perpendicular to (AB), we have (k_{AB} cdot k_{MC} = -1), leading to:   [   frac{y-1}{x+2} cdot frac{y}{x+2} = -1.   ]   Simplifying this equation, we obtain:   [   (x+2)^2 + left(y-frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4}, quad text{where } x neq -2.   ]   In the special case where the slope of line (CM) does not exist, meaning (CM) is vertical, the equation of (CM) is (x = -2).

Note that the actual lengths of the side lengths are the number of lattice points minus 1, so we can work in terms of r, s, t and subtract 3 to get the actual answer at the end. Furthermore, note that the number of lattice points inside a rectangular region is equal to the number of lattice points in its width times the number of lattice points along its length.Using this fact, the number of lattice points in R is r^2, the number of lattice points in S is s^2, and the number of lattice points in T is t^2.Now, by the first condition, we have [r^2=frac{9}{4}cdot s^2 implies r = frac{3}{2}s     quad quad quad quad quad (1)]The second condition, the number of lattice points contained in T is a fourth of the number of lattice points contained in R cup S. The number of lattice points in R cup S is equal to the sum of the lattice points in their individually bounded regions, but the lattice points along the y-axis for the full length of square S is shared by both of them, so we need to subtract that out.In all, this condition yields us t^2 = frac{1}{4}cdot(r^2 + s^2 - s )implies t^2 = frac{1}{4}cdotleft(frac{9}{4}cdot s^2 + s^2 - s right)implies t^2=frac{1}{4}cdotfrac{13s^2-4s}{4} implies 16t^2= s(13s-4)Note from (1) that s is a multiple of 2. We can write s=2j and substitute:16t^2=2j(26j-4) implies 4t^2=j(13j-2).Note that j must be divisible by two for the product to be divisible by 4. Thus we make another substitution, j=2k:[4t^2=2k(26k-2) implies  t^2 = k(13k-1) quad quad quad quad quad (2)]Finally we look at the last condition; that the fraction of the lattice points inside S that are inside S cap T is 27 times the fraction of lattice points inside r that are inside R cap T.Let x be the number of lattice points along the bottom of the rectangle formed by S cap T, and y be the number of lattice points along the bottom of the the rectangle formed by R cap T.Therefore, the number of lattice points in Scap T is xt and the number of lattice points in R cap T is yt.Thus by this condition, frac{xt}{s^2} = 27 cdot frac{yt}{r^2} implies frac{x}{s^2} = 27 cdot frac{y}{frac{9}{4}cdot s^2} implies x= 12yFinally, notice that t=x+y-1=12y+y-1 (subtracting overlap), and so we have [t=13y-1 quad quad quad quad quad (3)]Now notice that by (3) , tequiv -1 pmod{13}implies t^2 equiv 1 pmod{13}.However, by (2) , t^2 equiv k cdot -1 pmod{13}. Therefore, -k equiv 1 pmod{13} implies k equiv -1 pmod{13}Also, by (2) , we know k must be a perfect square since k is relatively prime to 13k-1 (Euclids algorithm) and the two must multiply to a perfect square. Hence we know two conditions on k, and we can now guess and check to find the smallest that satisfies both.We check k=12 first since its one less than a multiple of 13, but this does not work. Next, we have k=25 which works because 25 is a perfect square. Thus we have found the smallest k, and therefore the smallest r, s, t.Now we just work backwards: j= 2k = 50 and s=2j=100. Then r=frac{3}{2}cdot 100 = 150. Finally, from (2) , t^2=25(13cdot25-1) implies t^2 = 25 cdot 324 implies t=5cdot 18=90.Finally, the sum of each square’s side lengths is r+s+t-3=340-3=337=boxed{textbf{(B) }337}.~KingRavi"},{"problem":"3.

What is the maximum number of sides a coin can have as a projection of a convex polyhedron with n faces?","solution":"8.6. Answer: 2 n-4. First, let's prove that the projection of a convex polyhedron with n faces can have 2 n-4 sides. Cut off the edge C D of a regular tetrahedron A B C D with a prismatic surface, the lateral edges of which are parallel to C D (Fig. 57). The projection of the resulting polyhedron with n faces onto a plane parallel to the lines A B and C D has 2 n-4 sides.Now, let's prove that the projection M of a convex polyhedron with n faces cannot have more than 2 n-4 sides. The number of sides of the projection onto a plane that is not perpendicular to a face cannot be greater than the number of sides of all other projections. Indeed, in such a projection, each face turns into a side of the polygon; if the projection plane is slightly moved, this side will either remain or split into several sides, while the number of other sides will not change. Therefore, we will consider projections onto planes that are not perpendicular to the faces. In this case, the edges that project into the boundary of the polygon M divide the polyhedron into two parts: \\"upper\\" and \\"lower\\". Let p_{1} and p_{2}, q_{1} and q_{2}, r_{1} and r_{2} be the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the upper and lower parts (vertices and edges of the section are not counted); m be the number of vertices of the polygon M, m_{1} (respectively m_{2}) be the number of vertices of M from which at least one edge of the upper (respectively lower) part extends. Since from each vertex of M at least one edge of the upper or lower part extends, m leqslant m_{1}+m_{2}. Now, let's estimate the number m_{1}. From each vertex of the upper part, at least three edges extend, so the number of ends of the edges of the upper part is at least 3 p_{1} + m_{1}. On the other hand, the number of ends of these edges is 2 q_{1}; therefore, 3 p_{1} + m_{1} leqslant 2 q_{1}. Now, let's prove that p_{1} - q_{1} + r_{1} = 1. The projections of the edges of the upper part divide the polygon M into several polygons. The sum of the angles of these polygons is pi(m-2) + 2 pi p_{1}. On the other hand, it is equal to sum_{i} pi(q_{1 i} - 2), where q_{1 i} is the number of sides of the i-th polygon of the partition; the latter sum is equal to pi(m + 2 q_{1}) - 2 r_{1}. Equating both expressions for the sum of the angles of the polygons, we get the required result. Since q_{1} = p_{1} + r_{1} - 1 and m_{1} + 3 p_{1} leqslant 2 q_{1}, then m_{1} leqslant 2 r_{1} - 2 - p_{1} leqslant 2 r_{1} - 2. Similarly, m_{2} leqslant 2 r_{2} - 2.

Therefore, ( b ) can be expressed as:   [   b = a cdot 10^n + a = a(10^n + 1)   ]3. Given that ( frac{b}{a^2} ) is an integer ( k ), we can write:   [   k = frac{b}{a^2} = frac{a(10^n + 1)}{a^2} = frac{10^n + 1}{a}   ]4. Since ( k ) is an integer, ( a ) must be a divisor of ( 10^n + 1 ). We need to find the possible values of ( k ) under the constraint ( 10^{n-1} leq a < 10^n ).5. We know that:   [   1 < frac{10^n + 1}{10^n} < k leq frac{10^n + 1}{10^{n-1}}   ]   Simplifying the inequalities:   [   1 < frac{10^n + 1}{10^n} < k leq 10 + frac{1}{10^{n-1}}   ]   Since ( n > 1 ), ( frac{1}{10^{n-1}} ) is very small, so:   [   1 < k leq 10   ]6. We need to find the divisors of ( 10^n + 1 ) that lie between 1 and 10. For ( n = 3 ), ( 10^3 + 1 = 1001 ), and the divisors of 1001 are 1, 7, 11, 13, 77, 91, 143, and 1001. The only divisor in the range ( 1 < k leq 10 ) is 7.7. Therefore, the possible value of ( k ) is 7. For example, if ( a = 143 ), then:   [   b = 143 cdot 1001 = 143 cdot (10^3 + 1) = 143 cdot 1001   ]   [   k = frac{b}{a^2} = frac{143 cdot 1001}{143^2} = frac{1001}{143} = 7   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 7 } )"},{"problem":"Let A B C be an acute triangle, and let M be the midpoint of A C.

(Russia) Answer. sqrt{2}.","solution":"Let S be the center of the parallelogram B P T Q, and let B^{prime} neq B be the point on the ray B M such that B M=M B^{prime} (see Figure 1). It follows that A B C B^{prime} is a parallelogram. Then, angle A B B^{prime}=angle P Q M and angle B B^{prime} A=angle B^{prime} B C=angle M P Q, and so the triangles A B B^{prime} and M Q P are similar. It follows that A M and M S are corresponding medians in these triangles. Hence,  angle S M P=angle B^{prime} A M=angle B C A=angle B T A. Since angle A C T=angle P B T and angle T A C=angle T B C=angle B T P, the triangles T C A and P B T are similar. Again, as T M and P S are corresponding medians in these triangles, we have  angle M T A=angle T P S=angle B Q P=angle B M P. Now we deal separately with two cases. Case 1. quad S does not lie on B M. Since the configuration is symmetric between A and C, we may assume that S and A lie on the same side with respect to the line B M. Applying (1) and (2), we get  angle B M S=angle B M P-angle S M P=angle M T A-angle B T A=angle M T B, and so the triangles B S M and B M T are similar. We now have B M^{2}=B S cdot B T=B T^{2} / 2, so B T=sqrt{2} B M. Case 2. quad S lies on B M. It follows from (2) that angle B C A=angle M T A=angle B Q P=angle B M P (see Figure 2). Thus, P Q | A C and P M | A T.

We would like to reduce it to a homogeneous inequality, that is, an inequality that remains true if we multiply the different terms by the same factor k. Therefore, we will use the inequality x^{2}+1 geqslant 2 x, which is true for all real x, since (x-1)^{2} geqslant 0. Applying this inequality to the relation givesa_{j}+2 a_{j+2} geqslant a_{j+1}+a_{j+1}^{2}+1 geqslant 3 a_{j+1}This relation is already more manageable. Now we would like to use the fact that the sequence is 2020-periodic. We will therefore consider an integer j geqslant 1 such that a_{j} is maximal. This is possible given that the sequence takes a finite number of distinct values because it is periodic. Without loss of generality, we assume that j geqslant 2.Thus, we have 3 a_{j} leqslant a_{j-1}+2 a_{j+1} leqslant a_{j}+2 a_{j}=3 a_{j} by the maximality of a_{j}. In particular, to have equality, we must have a_{j-1}=a_{j}=a_{j+1}. An immediate induction shows that if k geqslant 0, a_{j+k}=a_{j} and that if k leqslant j-1, a_{j-k}=a_{j}. The sequence is therefore constant and equals a_{j}. The inequality then becomes a_{j}+2 a_{j} geqslant a_{j}^{2}+a_{j}+1 or a_{j}^{2}-2 a_{j}+1=left(a_{j}-1right)^{2} leqslant 0, so a_{j}=1.Conversely, if a_{k}=1 for all k geqslant 1, then for any positive integer j, a_{j}+2 a_{j+2}=3 geqslant 3=a_{j+1}^{2}+a_{j+1}+1, so the constant sequence equal to 1 is a solution. The only sequence that is a solution is therefore the constant sequence equal to 1.Comment from the graders: The exercise is generally well done, by various methods. However, few students thought to verify that the sequence obtained at the end is indeed a solution: even though it was very easy to verify here, it is important to at least mention a verification.

Since O - the center of the circumscribed circle - lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AB, point D also lies on this perpendicular bisector.

From the sum of the angles in triangle BAD, we have: alpha + alpha + (alpha - 45^{circ}) = 180^{circ}, i.e., alpha = 75^{circ}.Finally, if we denote the midpoint of segment AB as M, then from the right triangle AMD we have AD = frac{AM}{cos 75^{circ}} = frac{AB}{2 cos 75^{circ}}.

Then, according to Bayes' formula,begin{aligned}P(B)= & Pleft(B mid A_{1}right) Pleft(A_{1}right)+Pleft(B mid A_{2}right) Pleft(A_{2}right)+Pleft(B mid A_{3}right) Pleft(A_{3}right) & +Pleft(B mid A_{4}right) Pleft(A_{4}right)+Pleft(B mid A_{5}right) Pleft(A_{5}right)+Pleft(B mid A_{6}right) Pleft(A_{6}right)end{aligned}If the red ball is drawn in the first three draws, the sum can be at most 4+5=9, and if it is drawn in the 5th or 6th draw, the sum will be at least 1+2+3+4=10. Therefore,Pleft(B mid A_{1}right)=Pleft(B mid A_{2}right)=Pleft(B mid A_{3}right)=0 quad text{and} quad Pleft(B mid A_{5}right)=Pleft(B mid A_{6}right)=1If the red ball is drawn in the fourth draw, then the sum is at least 10 only if the drawn balls have the numbers 1,4,5 or 2,3,5 or 2,4,5 or 3,4,5. Each of these four triplets can appear in any of the 3! orders. Therefore,Pleft(B mid A_{4}right)=frac{4 cdot 3!}{5 cdot 4 cdot 3}=frac{2}{5}Let's calculate the probability that exactly k balls are drawn, i.e., Pleft(A_{k}right).For k=1, this probability is frac{1}{6} because out of 6 possibilities, only one is for this event, which is drawing the red ball immediately.For k>1, in the first draw, we can draw any of the 5 white balls out of a total of 6 balls, in the next draw, we can draw any of the remaining 4 white balls out of a total of 5 balls, and so on until in the (k-1)-th draw, we draw one of the remaining 5-k+1 white balls out of a total of 5-k+2 balls. Finally, we must draw the red ball from the remaining 5-k+1 balls. Therefore, for all k=1,2,3,4,5,6,Pleft(A_{k}right)=frac{5}{6} cdot frac{4}{5} cdots frac{5-k+1}{5-k+2} cdot frac{1}{5-k+1}=frac{1}{6}The final solution isP(B)=frac{2}{5} cdot frac{1}{6}+1 cdot frac{1}{6}+1 cdot frac{1}{6}=frac{2}{5}"},{"problem":"## Task B-3.6.Inside the square A B C D there is a point M such that |M A|=7 mathrm{~cm}, |M B|=13 mathrm{~cm} and |M C|=17 mathrm{~cm}.

Define the set ( G ) and the problem constraints:   Let ( G ) be the set of points ((x, y)) in the plane such that ( x ) and ( y ) are integers with ( 1 leq x, y leq n ). We need to find the largest number of elements in a subset of ( G ) that does not contain four non-collinear points forming a parallelogram.2. Construct a subset with ( 2n-1 ) points:   Consider the points ((1, i)) and ((i, 1)) for all ( i in {1, 2, 3, ldots, n} ). This gives us ( n ) points on the first row and ( n ) points on the first column, but the point ((1, 1)) is counted twice. Therefore, we have ( 2n - 1 ) points in total.3. Verify that no four points form a parallelogram:   To form a parallelogram, we need four points ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), ((x_3, y_3)), and ((x_4, y_4)) such that the midpoints of the diagonals coincide. However, in our construction, any set of four points will either be collinear or will not satisfy the parallelogram condition due to the specific arrangement of points.4. Assume a larger subset and derive a contradiction:   Assume there exists a parallelogram-free subset of ( G ) with ( 2n ) points. We will show that this leads to a contradiction using the Pigeonhole Principle.5. Consider horizontal distances:   Each horizontal line can have at most ( n-1 ) different distances between points. If we place 2 points on each of the ( n ) horizontal lines, we have ( n ) distances. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these distances must be the same.6. Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:   Moving a point from one horizontal line to another does not reduce the number of different horizontal distances. Thus, we will still have at least two horizontal distances of the same length in different lines, forming a parallelogram with these four points. This contradicts the assumption that the subset is parallelogram-free.7. Conclusion:   We have shown that a parallelogram-free subset of ( G ) cannot have more than ( 2n-1 ) points.

Thus, line l always intersects odot C at two points.(2) According to the problem, let the midpoint of chord AB be P(x, y). From (1), we know CP perp PQ.The trajectory equation of point P is the circle with diameter CQ.

A mistake in the preparation of the competition led to the omission of the hypothesis \\" triangle ABC is acute-angled\\" in the final version of the text, and thus the correct answer was (E): if the angle at A is obtuse, the segment P D measures 9.

Consider the colorings of a 5 times 5 table described in the problem (i.e., such that in each column and each row exactly one cell is colored).For convenience, let's introduce some notations. The top-left corner cell of the 5 times 5 table will be called A, and the bottom-right corner cell will be called B. Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored. To find this, we subtract from 120 the number of colorings of the first table where A or B is colored. To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not. This leads to the equation 120=a+96, i.e., a=24. Then b=24 as well.The number of colorings where both A and B are colored is the same as the number of ways to color the central 3 times 3 square.

This indicates that before starting the journey, the car had 50 liters of oil in the tank.- Oil Consumption Rate: To find out how much oil the car consumes per hour, we observe the change in oil quantity between two consecutive hours.

For Part (2):- Relationship Between y and t: Given the initial amount of oil and the consumption rate, we can express the remaining oil y as a function of time t.

In an alphabet of n>1 letters, a word is any finite sequence of letters in which any two adjacent letters are different. A word is called good if it is impossible to erase all letters from it, except for four, so that the remaining sequence is of the form a a b b, where a and b are different letters. Find the maximum possible number of letters in a good word.(D. Khramtsov)","solution":"Answer: 2 n+1.First solution. Let's call the length of a word the number of letters in it. Let a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} be the letters of the alphabet. Then it is not hard to verify that the following word is good:a_{n} a_{n-1} ldots a_{2} a_{1} a_{2} a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} ldots a_{n}It remains to show that there are no good words of greater length.Suppose that in an n-letter alphabet, there exists a good word of length 2 n+2. Then some letter (say, a_{1}) appears in it at least three times. Mark its second (V) and penultimate (P) occurrence in the word (then V stands no further to the right than P).Any other letter appears no more than once before P, and no more than once after V, otherwise by erasing letters one can obtain a forbidden sequence. Therefore, each of the letters a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} appears no more than twice. Moreover, if such a letter does appear twice, then one of its occurrences stands before V, and the other after P.Suppose a_{1} appears k geqslant 3 times. Then between V and P stand at least k-3 letters different from a_{1} (one between each pair of consecutive occurrences of a_{1}), and all such letters appear exactly once. Highlight k-3 such letters. The remaining n-k+2 letterscan appear at most twice. Therefore, the length of the word does not exceedk+(k-3) cdot 1+(n-k+2) cdot 2=2 n+1which contradicts our assumption.Second solution. We provide another proof that the length of a good word does not exceed 2 n+1. Induction on n geqslant 2. In the base case n=2, the letters in the word alternate, and a word of length at least 6 contains a fragment of the form a b a b a b, from which by erasing letters one can obtain a a b b.For the inductive step, assume that in an n-letter alphabet there is a good word of length at least 2 n+2. Then some letter a appears in this word at least three times. Suppose that there are two letters, a and b, each appearing at least 3 times. Let, without loss of generality, the second occurrence of a stand earlier than the second occurrence of b; then by erasing letters one can obtain the word a a b b, which is impossible.Thus, the letter a appears in the word k geqslant 3 times, and all others at most twice. Then the length of the word is at least 2 n+2 and at most k+2(n-1), from which k geqslant 4.Between the second and third occurrence of the letter a there is some letter c. This letter cannot appear in other places: if it appears after the second occurrence of a, then by erasing letters one can obtain aacc, and if before it, then cсаа (since k geqslant 4).Suppose the neighbors of the letter c are different. Then, by removing c from the word, we obtain a good word in the (n-1)-letter alphabet (without the letter c). The length of this word will be at least 2 n+1=2(n-1)+3, which contradicts the inductive hypothesis.If the neighbors of the letter c are the same, remove from the word c and the letter before it; then at this \\"junction\\" will remain different letters. Therefore, we again obtain a good word in the (n-1)-letter alphabet, the length of which is at least 2(n-1)+2; this is also impossible by the inductive hypothesis.Comment. Only providing an example of a good word of 2 n+1 letters - 1 point (this point can be combined with the points mentioned below).Only proving that a good word has no more than 2 n+1 letters - 6 points.In proving this estimate, only proving that at most one letter appears more than twice - 2 points (out of 6); these points can be combined with points for the example."},{"problem":"The domain of the function f(x)= dfrac {1}{ sqrt {1-x}} is (quad quad)A: [1,+infty)B: (1,+infty)C: (-infty,1]D: (-infty,1)","solution":"To ensure the function is meaningful, we must have 1-x > 0,Solving this inequality gives x < 1,Therefore, the domain of the function f(x)= dfrac {1}{ sqrt {1-x}} is (-infty,1).Hence, the answer is boxed{text{D}}.To determine the domain of a function, consider the factors that affect it: the denominator must not be zero, and the radicand under an even root must be non-negative.

Initial Setup and Definitions:   We need to find natural numbers ( n ge 2 ) such that the ring of integers modulo ( n ), denoted ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ), has exactly one element that is not a sum of two squares.2. Multiplicative Closure of Sums of Two Squares:   The set of elements which, modulo ( n ), are sums of two squares is multiplicatively closed. This follows from the identity:   [   (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2.   ]3. Units and Non-Sums of Two Squares:   If ( a ) is an element in ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ) that is not a sum of two squares and ( u ) is a unit in ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ) that is a sum of two squares, then ( u^{-1}a ) is also not a sum of two squares. This follows from the multiplicative closure property.4. Exclusion of Small Values:   It is clear that ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 3 ) do not satisfy the condition. For ( n = 2 ), the elements are ( 0 ) and ( 1 ), both of which are sums of two squares. For ( n = 3 ), the elements are ( 0, 1, ) and ( 2 ), where ( 2 equiv -1 pmod{3} ) and ( -1 ) is a sum of two squares.5. Prime Power Form:   Claim 1: ( n = p^k ) for some prime ( p ) and some positive integer ( k ).   Proof:   Let ( n = prod_{i=1}^m p_i^{k_i} ) be the prime factorization of ( n ). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem:   [   mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} cong mathbb{Z}/p_1^{k_1}mathbb{Z} times cdots times mathbb{Z}/p_m^{k_m}mathbb{Z}.   ]   Let ( (a_1, cdots, a_m) ) be the unique element of ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ) that is not a sum of two squares. There exists ( 1 le i le m ) such that ( a_i ) is not a sum of two squares modulo ( p_i^{k_i} ). Without loss of generality, assume ( i = 1 ). If ( m > 1 ), then we have at least two elements that are not sums of two squares: ( (a_1, 0, cdots, 0) ) and ( (a_1, 1, cdots, 1) ), which is a contradiction. Hence, ( n = p^k ).6. Power of 2:   Claim 2: ( n = 2^k ) for some integer ( k ge 2 ).   Proof:   By Claim 1, ( n = p^k ) for some prime ( p ) and some positive integer ( k ). Suppose ( p ) is odd. Let ( a ) be the unique element of ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ) that is not a sum of two squares. The element ( 2 ) modulo ( n ) is a unit in ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ) and is a sum of two squares. By the earlier property, ( 2^{-1}a ) is not a sum of two squares, implying ( 2^{-1}a = a ). Thus, ( 2a = a ), leading to ( a = 0 ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( p = 2 ).7. Specific Value of ( k ):   Claim 3: ( n = 4 ).   Proof:   By Claim 2, ( n = 2^k ) for some integer ( k ge 2 ). Suppose ( k > 2 ) and let ( a in mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ) be the unique element that is not a sum of two squares. The element ( 5 ) modulo ( n ) is a unit in ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ) and is a sum of two squares. By the earlier property, ( 5^{-1}a ) is not a sum of two squares, implying ( 5^{-1}a = a ). Thus, ( 5a = a ), leading to ( 4a = 0 ). Therefore, modulo ( n ), ( a in {2^{k-2}, 2^{k-1}, 3 times 2^{k-2}} ). By the multiplicative closure property, both ( 2^{k-2} ) and ( 2^{k-1} ) are sums of two squares (since ( 2 ) is). Thus, ( a = 3 times 2^{k-2} ). For ( k > 2 ), ( 3 ) is a sum of two squares, contradicting the uniqueness of ( a ). Hence, ( k = 2 ) and ( n = 4 ).The final answer is ( boxed{4} )."},{"problem":"Given a linear function y=kx-k, if y decreases as x increases, then the graph of this function passes through which quadrant?A: Quadrants I, II, IIIB: Quadrants I, II, IVC: Quadrants II, III, IVD: Quadrants I, III, IV","solution":"Given the linear function y=kx-k, we are tasked with determining through which quadrants the graph of this function passes, given that y decreases as x increases.1.

Solution Take k so that 2 k-1 ≤ n < 2 k . Then, adding leading zeros as necessary, we can write n as a k digit binary number. Let A i be the numbers in X which (when written in binary) have a 1 in place i. That gives us a collection of k subsets. Any number in X must have at least one 1, so the A i have union X. Any two distinct numbers in X must differ in at least one place, so if we take that place to be i, then A i contains just one of the numbers. Thus f(n) ≤ k. Now suppose we have a collection of h subsets which satisfies the condition. We can classify the elements according to whether they are in or out of A i . That gives 2 h - 1 possible classifications (-1 because an element must be in at least one A i ) and no two elements can have the same classification. Hence n ≤ 2 h - 1.

Let M be (x₁, y₁) and N be (x₂, y₂). From the tangent and circle relationship, we have frac {|m|}{ sqrt {1+k^{2}}} = sqrt { frac {18}{5}}, which implies 5m² = 18(1 + k²).

Understanding the Problem:   We are given 8 distinct points on the circumference of a circle, and we need to color some intersection points (bullets) of the chords such that for each pair of points ((i, j)), the number of quads containing (a_i) and (a_j) whose diagonals intersect at a red bullet is constant.2. Counting Quads and Bullets:   - There are (binom{8}{4} = 70) ways to choose 4 points out of 8 to form a quad.   - Each quad has 2 diagonals, and their intersection is a bullet.   - Therefore, there are (70 times 2 = 140) bullets in total.3. Double Counting Argument:   - We need to find the smallest (n) such that each pair ((i, j)) is contained in the same number (z) of quads whose diagonals intersect at a red bullet.   - By double counting, we have:     [     binom{8}{2} cdot z = binom{4}{2} cdot n     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     28z = 6n implies 14z = 3n     ]   - This implies (3 mid z), so (z) must be a multiple of 3.4.

Verification:   - Each pair ((i, j)) appears in exactly 3 of these 14 quads.   - Therefore, the construction satisfies the condition that (r(i, j)) is constant for all pairs ((i, j)).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 14 } )."},{"problem":"11.

Initial Observation:   - The set {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1} contains 2n-1 elements.   - We need to find a subset A such that no two elements in A add up to another element in A.2. Sum-Free Subset Size:   - We claim that the maximum size of a sum-free subset of {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1} is n.3. Proof by Contradiction:   - Assume there exists a sum-free subset A of size m where m > n.   - We will show that this leads to a contradiction.4. Grouping Elements:   - Consider the following groupings of the elements of {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1}:     [     {1, 2n-1}, {2, 2n-2}, ldots, {n-1, n+1}, {n}     ]   - This grouping has n pairs and one single element, n.5. Pigeonhole Principle:   - Since m > n, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these pairs must have both elements in A.   - If both elements of any pair {k, 2n-k} are in A, then k + (2n-k) = 2n is in A, which is a contradiction because 2n is not in the set {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1}.6. Alternative Grouping:   - Consider another grouping:     [     {2, 2n-1}, {3, 2n-2}, ldots, {n, n+1}, {1}     ]   - This grouping also has n pairs and one single element, 1.7. Analysis of Groupings:   - In both groupings, there can be at most one element from each pair in A to avoid the sum being another element in A.   - Therefore, the maximum number of elements in A is n.8.
