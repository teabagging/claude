If these symptoms are associated with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough with blood-streaked sputum, then it could be as a result of a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).

I would suggest you to go for a repeat monospot test along with some special tests for infectious monocleosis if suspected strongly by your treating physician. Any type of chronic fever (high grade) will cause anaemia and this can occur in Enteric fever.

I am eating but it hurts when I do and within minutes I feel the need to use the restroom. Also I am having Diarrhea. Is this a flare up?","Doctor":"Hi ! It could be a food poisoning if you have eaten from outside. Otherwise, it may be an attack of chronic pancreatitis, where there is periods of remission followed by periods of exaggeration of the symptoms. You are suggested to get yourself reviewed by your family physician, who may advise you some routine blood check ups like CBC, and stool test, apart from some specialized tests like an ultrasound or a CT scan to know the status of the pancreas and manage accordingly.

My issue, is that I have a chronic fluttering /vibration which is quite aggressive in my chest. It developed slowly over the past seven years and it is worst when i sleep. I wake up several times a night (4 or 5) with a flutter, which sometimes becomes a faster heartbeat . I do not know if the source is cardiac although i had an echo last october which showed my heart is structurally normal (although left atrium is 4 inches and was 3.5 inches in 2005). I have a mild mitral and tricuspid leaks. I was taking part in some activities in 2005 which may have perforated my colon , though i do not think anything untoward happened. I notice that the vibration is heavy and gets worse (constant), before i have to poop; then it subsides. At night, when i wake up (this has been going on for about six months), i have a palpable pulsation in my left chest. Using a portable ECG, this has on two ocassions shown suspected fast heartbeat; other times, wven though the pulsation is quite palpable, there is only a normal wave form on the ECG. I also get quite tired around 2-3 pm and feel exhausted; and in 2011 i was diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea (it was not made clear to me whether it was OSA or CSA but i had very bad CSA at the time and this has now resolved a lot, so i only have a few apneas that i know of, as i do not use the CPAP all the time now). I do not think sleep apnea is causing the current pulsation which is severe just before pooping; in the past, i used to get very severe abdominal cramps before pooping, to the point where it felt like i was being stabbed. Now that these cramps do not happen, instead, i get the pulsation. Is there any doctor out there who can help me? I have pretty much given up hope of finding the cause. I suspect a twisted or perforated bowel; bowel cancer (my Mom died from bowel cancer last year); or a congenital cardiac complication which is hidden on a stress echo but which is significant enough to cause heart flutter at night or the vibration is coming from a large artery which may have an aneurysm. None of the doctors i have seen (i have seen 25) are willing to or interested in doing further tests to find the cause.","Doctor":"Hi.

She has a hard time breathing and can t get to physical because she almost loses consciousness . I believe she has diabetes and we are checking for this as well. She did have cancer and she has masses of tumors in her abdomen area which are being checked out now, through testing. Her eyes sometimes feel that they are going to shake out of her head mostly when she wakes up. She gets the shakes so bad she can t function and the doctors never check her for diabetes.

Right now the standard care for transplant eligible patients is induction therapy followed by stem cell transplant. Transplant in myeloma is much simple than other diseases. But you need to understand that transplant is a form of consolidation therapy and doesnt make the patient rid of the disease completely.

Thanks Rabiul Islam.","Doctor":"since you said your sister has recurrence it is important to confirm whether recurrence is confined to local region only or if there is spread to distant parts of the body. If the recurrence is solitary, resection of the lesion would help. Sorafenib  is for metastatic disease. Since her disease has come back in just 4months, you need to understand that she has got aggressive cancer and whatever treatment is offered the responses are shortlived"},{"Patient":"I had my annual mammogram and thermoscan done this week. In addition I had a CEA blood test done: In 2009 my CEA was 4.0; 2010 it was 3.6; in 2011 it was 5.2 and now 2012 it is 6.6. My doctor called me today and would like it repeated within 3 months. My arthritis has been worse lately (I am 56 years old) and I have had some numbness in my (R) hand (which I thought may be carpal tunnel as I do inputting of numbers all day long). I have been more tired lately. My brother passed away at age 58 with kidney cancer which had spread to pancreas , liver, spleen, colon, etc. How concerned should I be ? In the back of my mind of course I think Cancer..","Doctor":"I dont understand why you are getting CEA test done regularly since it is not a screening test for cancer. please dont give too much credence to CEA. Since got it done anyways and since it is rising, get a colonoscopy done first and then PET CT whole body. That would answer all your doubts"},{"Patient":"Hello, Occasionally, i have very very sharp pain that feel like it shoots up from my rectum maybe about 2-3 inches up the centre of my body. The pain is paralying, and only lasts about 30 seconds. I don t know if it is related, but I also have pretty severe pain in the ovary area, usually on the right side, and this often lasts longer to the tune of 2-3 minutes. I find that when I push it slight relives it, and also if I lay down and bring my knees up. I ve had an endoscopy and there were no signs of cysts or endometriosis . This is not indigestion, as I know what that feels like. Any ideas? I m 29, but have been experiencing these problems for 6 years, I have a 4 yr old child, I have no family history of cancers, and I feel I am otherwise healthy with a vegetarian diet. 5 7 , 125 lbs. Thank you so very much","Doctor":"Since you said the endoscopy ( i presume it is colonoscopy) is normal, then you need not worry. if entire colon is not examined, please get it done first and also ultrasound abdomen. if both are normal. there is a possibilty of this being IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) but chances of cancer are almost absent"},{"Patient":"Iam a relapsed dlbcl patient relapsed after autologous transplant done in Aug-2011. I have taken R_CHOP 6 cycles since Aug-2009,6 cycles of R_MINE after 1st relapse in Aug 2010.Now what are the other suitable Chemo regimens available for treatment .If radioimmunotherapy with Zevalin would be suitable for me. I am a humanmale aging 49 yrs.","Doctor":"there are many chemotherapy regimens for relapsed DLBCL like RICE, GEM OX, DHAP etc. Choice of regimen is decided by the treating doctor. Radioimmunotherapy is not done widely. it is expensive and it has got its own side effects. Since it has relapsed very soon, complete cure cannot be achieved now and whatever regimen if followed, the aim is to prolong survival and offer good quality of life"},{"Patient":"my auntie was diagnosed with ovarian cancer few years ago. After chimoterapy and other treatment she was fine. since then she had kidney problems and last week the doctors found a tumour in her liver . What are her chances of survival considering that she receives treatment in an underdeveloped country (romania). Want to know how long can she survive in the worst scenario? thanks for your help. Georgia","Doctor":"metastatic ovarian cancer is a bad disease. patients usually do not survive long. Around 6months to one year according to literature. Survival depends on the treatment offered, her performance status, etc. If she is tolerating therapy well and is responding well, she will have better survival than without treatment"},{"Patient":"I am 61, Few years ago I had breast cancer , one breast removed went thru all chemotherapy , radiation etc Am on femara n heart pills, sugar reduction pills, have cholesterol and sugar levels fluctuate mostly on high side ! Sometimes feel nose blocks then when I blow my nose I see blood on my tissue It isn t much but noticed it on different occasions, My Question is how do I control sugar ? Getting blurry eyes can t even watch Tv as I can t see faces clearly Also want to drive my car as I feel happy when I drive","Doctor":"For control of sugars first thing to do is to go for regular exercise, diet control and medications. medications prescribed by your doctor need to be strictly adhered to. if there is no control with oral medicines if your doctor things it is necessary. then he will put you on insulin. Your blood pressure also needs to be checked regularly. high blood pressure is a common cause of nose bleed, but other local causes can be ruled out by an ENT specialist only. Your blurring of vision is also likely due to high sugars"},{"Patient":"Hi, I just got my blood panel results back the other day and it had the following results: Testosterone , Total: 410 mg/mL (low) Vitamin D: 23 mg/mL (low) Cholesterol: 113 mg/mL (low) WBC: 2.0 k/uL (low) Lymphocytes: 40.7 % (mid-high) Monocytes: 17.5 % (high) The doctor referred me to a hematologist , but the soonest appointment is next week. I ve had the same types of numbers on previous blood panels (over 10 years) and I m hardly ever sick. I m a 41 year old male, I don t smoke and I don t drink. Should I be worried? Could it be cancer? I m freaking out here.","Doctor":"from what you have written you dont have cancer and there is nothing to worry also. Cancer cells can be made out on peripheral smear itself. Since you said you have the same type of blood picture 10 years back, it all the more indicates that there is nothing to worry. Cancer usually progresses with time. There is one type of cancer of lymphocytes which progresses very slowly but your blood counts dont suggest that type of cancer also"},{"Patient":"My wife had breast cancer approx. ten years ago and had radiation and chemotherapy. After her treatments were ending her oncologist discovered she had a very high heart rate and she was subsequently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation . Cardioversion has not been successful in restoring normal rhythm for more than a few days. Atenolol and Tykosyn were somewhat successful until recently. She had cancer in her other breast last year and underwent radiation treatments. The Tykosyn has now ceased being effective at all. What is the likelihood of the radiation having affected her heart and precipitated her atrial fibrillation?","Doctor":"it is very uncommon for radiation to precipitate atrial fibrillation especially if it on the right side. Scatter is very rare with the latest technology radiation. you havent mentioned about chemotherapy. Some chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin and trastuzumab can have an effect on heart but the effect is mainly on heart muscle, though rhythm disturbances can also occur. But these effects are not longlasting and she would revert back to normal with time"},{"Patient":"sir,my father 78 years old is suffering from prostate cancer since 2009.In 2009,completed IGRT treatment and psa falls to 0. .Now from 2011 his psa rises from 0 to 15.5, then performed bone scan and found that prostate cancer is spread to bones. Then injections Zoladed quarterly,lupride quarterly but now psa rises to 61. Now doctor advices for Bilateral orchidectomy.I am very much worried .My father is heart patient. Whether this operation orchidectomy is necessary for him. Whether cancer will be stopped growing after this operation .Please help and guide me. Thanks","Doctor":"yes, orchidectomy helps him. Prostrate cancer is driven by masculine harmones and cutting down the production of harmones slows down the progression of disease. Lupride also does the same job, but orchidectomy is simple and more effective. But remember since the disease has already progressed, complete cure is not possible now and we are aiming at best possible survival with good quality of life. he might soon require chemotherapy also"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have had dysmennorhia for years, I had a tubaligation at 21 I have one son now 28 yrs old!

Are the ovarian cysts likely cancer? I am 50 years old, had the u/s to measure the fibroid but got the other results as well. Will my MD likely suggest an abdominal now instead of the robotic surg?","Doctor":"your ultrasound reports are not very clear. you would need CECT abdomen to better characterise the lesions. One thing is sure that all ovarian masses are not cancers. but thorough investigation is very much necessay because stage of the disease has an important role in survival in carcinoma ovary and high index of suspicion is necessary to pick it up early. from what you have written cancer is unlikely but further investigations are required"},{"Patient":"My daughter s husband has brain cancer and has recently been showing signs of what might be a psychotic break.

He is driving us all crazy now because you can t tell him what actually is happening. HELP!!","Doctor":"he definitely has psychotic problem and needs the help of psychiatrist. Frontal lobe tumors commonly cause such problems. Apart from treatment for brain tumor, which is mandatory for his survival, he also needs treatment for his psychological state.

There can be due to multiple causes cause of which can be pinpointed after clinical examination. it is very important you consult your doctor as early as possible since lymphoma patients with diabetes and viral infection cannot tolerate any kind of insult to the body. worry and getting scared doesnt solve your problem but see your doctor at the earliest"},{"Patient":"Been feeling heat sensations in front of thigh(left only) for a couple of days now; i m a mantle cell lymphoma survivor, i have 5 disc fusion in lower back(20 yrs now) and taking propanolol and endocet. Could u please give me a rough idea ; also have headaches lately at the base of my skull radiating from back 2 front;fevers also on and off .Thank you for ur advice","Doctor":"your thigh pain is probably referred pain from the back. if endocet doesnt help you, you need to go for other drugs that act on nerves, somthing like gabapentin and amitryptyline. You didnt mention why you are taking propranolol. Propranolol helps in certain types of headache like migraine but your headache seems to be referred pain too. Good clinical examination can sought out the cause of your pain and appropriate medications and help you"},{"Patient":"My mother is a patient of Chronic Lymphocytic lukemia.After her 5th cycle of Chemotherapy which is Bendamustine & Retuximab regimn she is suffering from fever & lungs infection.As the oral antibiotics were not working doctor advised her to get admitted in hospital.As the WBC & RBC were low,she was given 20 colstim injection & 2 packed cells.Now she is still in the hospital & she is suffering from night swelling.Can u please tell me the reason of this??","Doctor":"Bendamustine is notorious in causing bone marrow supression and low counts. low counts in turn make her prone to infections. her present state is due to infectious complications. Since bendamustine and rituximab is now an approved therapy for CLL, patients are given this treatment and risk of infection is always present when the counts drop. treatment for this present condition is with appropriate antibiotics and other supportive medication. Colstim helps in hastening blood counts by one or two days but understand that colstim doesnt do miracles. counts need to improve on their own. her condition would be reverted to normal only after improvement in blood counts.

Any ideas as to what could be causing this would be greatly received.","Doctor":"good to hear that the biopsy report is negative for cancer. your present condition may be totally unrelated to past history of mole. it might be due to other causes like local muscle problems. this would subside slowly.

A clinical examination might be necessary. Excluding gastritis is necessary. Other accompanying signs like fever, diarrhea might be needed during the evaluation process. The past medical history, an abdominal ultrasound coupled with a complete clinical review might be very useful in determining the cause of the pain.

After biopsy report it was known that she had gall bladder cancer.  After 2 months she was adviced for a PET-CT Scan in which it was detected that the cancer has spread to other parts of the abdomen like liver, pancreas etc.,  She was adviced for 3 cycles of Chemothereapy with medicine Gemcitabine and Dacotin and tomorrow she will be completing the course.  Whenever she was given chemo she suffers sever loose motions due to infection and she will be given lomotil and cifran CT for 5 days.  The problem is her blood test report for SGOT & SGPT reading shows 114 and 73 respectively which was done yesterday.  What could be the reason and any remedy to bring them to normal range?","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to read this history. As the PET CT Scan shows spread of tumor to other parts, this will be a stage 4 and needs Chemotherapy. Cirrhosis and cancer have increased the values of SGOT SGPT. It is more important to look for treatment of cancer and go ahead with a detailed discussion and possible outcome . Measure the cause and effect, Pron and cons with your treating Medical Oncologist ( the Specialist who treats cancer with Medicines only ) before taking further steps."},{"Patient":"I have an abdominal pain on my right side about 2\\" below my rib cage. when I first noticed it the pain would wave across my abdomen, now it feels like a stitch concentrated in one area. I have had a MRI and Ultrasound and they have ruled out my Liver, Gallbladder, Kidney and Pancreas. I find the pain is worse in the morning. There is no relief with a bowel movement.","Doctor":"Hi,    Site of your pain suggests pathology in liver,kidney,gall bladder,pancreas and intestine.By your investigation most of the causes have been ruled out except those related to the bowel.USG and MRI will not pick up pathologies inside the bowel.Pain from the early part of the small intestine can be felt on the right side.The Intestinal pathologies are better picked by endoscopy or colonoscopy ,wherein the entire intestine is visualized from inside.Peptic ulcer could be a leading cause.Even the external causes will be only be rarely missed by  scans.Relief with bowel movement is more commonly seen with irritable bowel syndrome.Again duodenal ulcer pain is more in the mornings."},{"Patient":"my son was just diagnosed with colon cancer which has spread into his liver he has 3 lesions in the liver one of which is 6 centementers large.  the mass in the color in causing a blockage only allowing liquids to pass.

The biopsy results will be available soon as it takes a few days for this test. I wonder why the patient is at home. He must be in a hospital under constant supervision. Colostomy may be required to remove the blockage, cleansing of bowel and as a preliminary step for a major surgery if needed. Your Oncosurgeon will be in a better position to guide you and have a session of discussion as per the reports. #3 lesions in the liver may need CT Scan and/ or biopsy ( Fine needle Aspiration Cytology)."},{"Patient":"I'm a 16 year old female and I've been having a lot of bleeding from my anus when I have a BM.

One and a half years ago I was diagnosed with rectal cancer.  I had radiation everyday for 5 weeks along with chemo 24/7 for the same 5 weeks.  Surgery followed this.  The part of the rectum that was cancerous was removed along with 32 lymph nodes.  The pathology report stated that I had clear margins and no lymph nodes were  cancerous at that time.  Before the radiation and chemo, I was told a few lymph nodes were enlarged,they looked suspicious----maybe cancerous.  I had an ileostomy for 7 months.  During these 7 months I had chemo (folfox 6) every 2 weeks for 4 months.  At the end of the 7 months the ileostomy was reversed.  I have regular check ups and everything so far is good.  I also have severe peripheral neuropathy from chemo.  This developed 2 months after chemo was done,  I have seen a specialist for this as the burning was more than I was able to handle any longer and it was keeping me from sleeping.  For this problem I take .25mg ropinerole which has taken the burning away but not the pins and needle and numbness feeling.  I am able to tolerate and sleep now though.  I also take paxil 20mg for anxiety and zopiclone 7,5 mg for sleep.  Anyways, for the past month I have been having upper abdominal pain, just above my belly button.  Its a throbbing pain not real severe, but it can get real bad , mainly at night.  When it gets bad at night  the pain is like contractions.  They spike and then subside.  It can go on for hours during the night.  For a few days after a bad night my abdomen is tender.  After the tenderness goes away I have no pain for maybe a week and then I have another spell.  No other symptoms.  Just wanting another opinion.  Thank you so much.","Doctor":"HI. You have put the history nicely. After such a major therapy in the form of Chemo plus Radiotherapy and Surgery some sequel are expected. From the history submitted by you , this may be due to subacute intestinal obstruction.

I started to think about it more... Then heartburn comes after two days... one of my friend said as you are so sensitive, the stress factor caused you heartburn.. He is right and am thinking all the time about it... After eatng, when i belch i started to feel the food coming back... I have a sore throat because of this.... Please help me, what should i do? I am sure all these symptoms are stress induced.. sometimes traces of blood in saliva too... not always.. my doctor friend said, this is because of the stomach acid.. help me...","Doctor":"Hi there,         Right lower abdominal pain and heart burn are 2 different entities.As your CAT scan is normal any significant pathology for the cause of right lower abdominal pain is already ruled out.So,there is no need to worry on this.Now coming to heart burn,its true that it can be stress induced.Some other habits can also contribute to this like irregular food habits,excess coffee,smoking,alcohol,high spicy food etc.Heart burn is due to to reflux of acid from the stomach upward into the esophagus.This can cause congestion in the larynx,which may be the cause for the sore throat that you are experiencing.Firstly try methods to reduce your stress,Secondly avoid food and other habits that increase stomach acidity and thirdly take antacids for 3-4 weeks.If you still dont feel the difference further evaluation in the form of endoscopy may be required."},{"Patient":"my dad is 72. diagnosed with lymphoma of the abdomen in Sept. had 4 chemo treatmenst. all the tumors have shrunk except the ones around pancreas. had to have a stint in the bile duct. no tumor. they say he has a dark spot on the pancreas. the nodes around the pancreas have actually grown thru the chemo. his dad died of pancreatic cancer. he belly was distended very badly in September and was in a lot of pain. the day after his first treatment the paid was gone. the belly gradually went down. im worried he too has pancreatic cancer. is this common with lymphoma?","Doctor":"Hi...pancreatic cancer and lymphoma are very different conditions... there is no treatment for the former but the later is curable depending upon the stage of disease...Dr. Ashish Verma"},{"Patient":"I have made two attempts to drink the prep for a colonoscopy.

I am getting a colonoscopy on Monday, but have had very negative experiences with being sedated, and have a history of agitation and severe anxiety when sedated. I have asked the doctor performing the procedure to provide me with an alternative to the Versed/Demerol combination, and he is very averse to the idea. Ideally, I would prefer no sedation at all and a pain reliever to take the edge off discomfort. How can I proceed?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM,There are lot of studies done to compare sedative and conscious sedative ( versed, Demerol combination). There are advantages and disadvantages for both . Advantages of Versed and Demerol combinations are , cost effective, rapid recovery and safer, as compared to Sedatives. Disadvantages are idifficulty to reach to caecum, specially in case of diverticulitis, and missing out some lesions. One of the reason for using sedation, is if patient is anxious and surprisingly you want to avoid sedation to reduce your anxiety. For Versed and Demerol combination, it is important that patient should be well informed, educated about the procedure, relaxed, and with high pain threshold. Is colonoscopy really indicated for you? Do you have family history of Colon cancer, Stomach cancer, breast cancer or ovarian cancer? Do you have any other risk factors  for colon cancer? You may also go for yearly occult blood test for stool instead? I would like you to discuss with your doctor, the real need for the colonoscopy. For choice of Sedation, also both surgeon and patient should be comfortable. usually Surgeon's preference is to do the procedure withour Sedation.Hope you got all relevant information.take care.Dr H Hamdani"},{"Patient":"My mom had undergone lump removal surgery in axilla.

I ve had a MRI done on my brain in I believe in 1998 because I asked a doctor about electricity going through my brain. The MRI showed that I had an empty cellulor configuration. Through research I know that a flatten Pituitary gland or fluid leaking from the pituitary gland can show as though it was an empty cellulor configuration. I hope you can understand what I am asking. Can my pituitary gland be injured from that car accident instead of the chemo therpy that I had. I blamed my chemo therpy for my depression. Nobody has really helped me. I found myself going to the health food store. Any advice. Thank you a lot! I just want to know if my pituitary gland could have been injuried from that head on collision, which is causing my depression from the lack of hormones. Could a hormone problem be the reason for my depression. Thank you! I hate typing my brain is faster then my fingers. 1","Doctor":"possible reason for your absent pituitary gland may be accident or any bleed in sellar region which holds the gland. it may be because of other reasons too. but definitely not because of chemotherapy . I would advice you to go for a complete Heath check up to rule out thyroid, diabetes and other hormone related problems which may be the cause for depression. I hope this clarifies your queries and would be glad to answer more if any. regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 26 year old female, and I am curious about some indicators of lymphoma that I have been displaying. I have several enlarged nodes (5 in the back of my neck, 2 on left, 3 on right. one on left has been present for 18yrs and one on right has been present for 14yrs. 3 in groin area one on left, 2 on right. one on right has been present 4 years. one in left side of jaw that has been present for 8 years. those are all that I know about), unexplained weight loss (25lbs in a little over one month), extreme fatigue , weakness, persistent cough and shortness of breath without any infection or illness aside from chronic hepatitis b , lack of appetite ... pretty sure I ve listed them all. I also have a family history of Hodgkin s Lymphoma. I had a contrast ct Tuesday, but haven t received the results yet and likely won t till next week. I will also be having blood work to check for any other indicators next Tuesday, and will be having a procedure to remove the lymphnode from the back of my neck (that has been there for 18 years) as ordered by both doctor s I see (one I see every week, and the other is one he referred me to over suspicion of lymphoma) to be checked. I don t know when the procedure will be taking place, and they both suspect worst case scenario. I don t think anything will come of it, however (and I am aware that it is impossible to make a diagnosis over the internet), I would like to know if I could get an expert opinion based on these symptoms.","Doctor":"probably lymphoma is what a clinician would suspect based on your symptoms and clinical findings as you indicated. the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy of the lymph node which will give the correct subtype of the lymphoma and would help to start with treatment appropriately. please be assured that majority of the cases of lymphoma gets cured with recent available medications. I wish you speedy recovery.

Thanks for the query.In such cases it is recommended to do preoperative radio or chemoth to reduce tumor size. Then it may be operable. You should now do frequent red blood count check,eat easier food and use stool softeners. If there is low hgb you need blood transfusion. Also take iron supplements. For pain relief you may need some stronger opiate painkillers and sitz baths may be helpful too. Wish you good health.

To console myself I ruled out the possibility of kidney stones because I have never felt any pain in my back. Has this something to do with the gall bladder or Appendix?","Doctor":"Hi, Acute appendicitis is a diagnosis with high probability. Cholecystitis is very unlikely to present with a lower abdominal pain.Gall bladder is situated in the right upper abdomen,so the pain arising from there will also be in the upper quadrant on the right side.In appendicitis,after a sharp initial epigastric pain,it radiates to right lower quadrant of the abdomen.Pain may settle and only tenderness may persist.Thats why you are having pain only on coughing.Further evaluation for appendicitis in the form of blood tests to look for high counts and USG abdomen is required.Urine routine examination and USG abdomen will also help in ruling out an ureteric colic."},{"Patient":"I am 5 8, I weigh 129, and I am 17 years old.

It showed epididymitis cyst on left and right, being the left the biggest. About 3.4 cm. The GP advised to leave it alone as the body might reabsorbed it. But  then on the other hand he prescribed flowmax. I have stopped it as a I don't have an enlarged prostate or cancer. PSA 1.0 and rectal examen showed no abnormalities. However, the other day while having intercourse, my wife noticed that I had not ejaculated and sure enough I did not see any trail of semen, so I have taken upon myself the decision to discontinue Flowmax as I have read in some forums that Flowmax creates abnormal ejaculations and/or retro-grade.Your advise, please....","Doctor":"Hi,Epididymal Cysts are not harmful if they are not causing pain or increasing in size.Epididymal cysts usually develop in adults around the age of 40.Cysts are found in as many as 30% of asymptomatic patients having scrotal ultrasound for other reasons.Treatment is not usually necessary and explanation and advice is all that is usually required.As you have mentioned that you don't have any prostate problem or any other, then you may discontinue Flomax tabs. Its adverse effect is retrograde ejaculation.Do consider a positive feedback as a credit to my work Let me know if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"hi I have severe stomach pain which is radiating round my back was in hospital for the preceeding 24 hrs where they did blood tests which they said was fine also had an ultrasound for gall stones which proved nad was given 4 lots of different antibiotics aswell as pain relief  no food was eaten during my stay in hospital was sick before they sent me home with more antibiotics an pain killers today I have tried to eat but as soon as I eat something the pain starts an nausea also I have noticed that my urine is very strong an that I have only been once today d","Doctor":"hi and welcome to healthcare magic... ! I would like to know if you consume alcohol or not.

To the best of my knowledge & experience, Welbutrin (bupropion) is a very good drug to treat depression especially if symptom profile includes decreased physical activity, lethargy, sleepiness, fatigue etc. & it dosent cause sexual dysfunction by itself per se. But if symptom profile is predominated by anxiety & allied symptoms which I guess are the source of your troubles & probably sexual dysfunction also; then switching welbutrin to a more specific antidepressant alternative like Mirtazapine which works superbly for anxiety & allied symptoms, gives you good sleep as well & is neutral on sexual dysfunction as a side effect.

My spleen has been measured in excess of 30 cm and is very hard and extended.  My concern is the possibility of a rupture of the spleen.  How much pain will be associated with this occurrence and what action should I immediately take.  My Dr has ruled out a splenectomy (sp) as he doesn't think with my very low blood cell counts that I would  survive the surgery.    If you would please advise on the possibility of a non-traumatic rupture.  Thank you, Craig Phillips","Doctor":"Hi,I read your query very carefully and would like to say:If the spleen rupture did occur than you should go immediately to the hospital, because of the sharp pain in the left superior abdomen.The surgery is the best way to treat spleen rupture.Hope i answered to your question?Dr. Benard"},{"Patient":"My spleen measured at 16 cm and my liver is also enlarged I have had an ultrasound done and my main doctor sent me to a cancer center without even telling me. I just got a call from the cancer center to make an appointment. I don't know what is going on or what are they are looking for or what kind of cancer would I have from having and enlarged spleen and liver. My liver has a lot of fat in it.","Doctor":"Hi,thanks for using healthcaremagic.Enlarged spleen and liver are not signs of cancer. It can be due to a lot of causes including a simple infection. Usually it is a result of some sort of infection.Fatty liver is also not a sign of cancer. It is present in almost 80-90% of obese people so there's nothing to worry about.Maybe you had some other finding for which he referred you to the cancer centre.Are there any other findings in the ultrasound scan? Any enlarged lymph nodes.There is a slight chance that lymphoma may cause enlargement of liver and spleen but without enlarged nodes it is unlikely to affect only liver and spleen.As per your history, I feel it is because of some sort of minor infection which should resolve soon.Hope it sorts your problem and wishing you a speedy recovery.Regards,Dr. Pankaj NagoriConsultant RadiologistKolkata"},{"Patient":"I am a newly diagnosed NHL patient receiving Rituxan Infusions. The first dose could not be completed because of severe chills, rigor, abdominal pain, fever and flushing. It was restarted after protocol medication. Again it had to be stopped for the same reasons. It was successful the next week with decadron 4m po the day before and the night before. The infusion went well with premedication of Tylenol, benadry. po and decadron and zantac IV. The next day I took post med of decadron 4 mg po the day and 4mg po again the night. However, the next day I went inot rigor and chills for two hours. Sent to ER and remained for 24 hour observation. Now the doctor is saying it was not a reaction to rituxan, but anxiety. I was NOT anxious because I had a great experience up unit the rigor returned full force when meds were stopped. I don t trust the judgements being made with my health. What to do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for this question. As you have pointed out in your situation, your symptoms of rigors, chills etc. stopped during second time when you were premedicated with the list of medications mentioned in your vignette. But subsequently you again developed similar symptoms despite adequate premedication. Hence there appears a scope for doubt that this time around your symptoms were Not due to Rituxan but those of anticipatory anxiety to medication infusion. This might happen some time & you should not fret over this too much. You have been diagnosed with a serious medical illness & are successfully coping with the same. Hence I would suggest you should consult your doctor about sos use of a benzodizepine like clonazepam or etizolam to help you cope up better with these manifestations. Wishing you good luck!!"},{"Patient":"I am currently seeing a urologist for bladder cancer. I was diagnosed in 2010 and it keeps coming back and not getting better.

There should be one where you can be referred to. But note that it is the management and not the doctor which makes the difference.I hope you find this helpful.

Some represent just simple exaggerated growth. Others may presentment cirrhosis, abscesses, hematoma, cancers, etc. Much information has to be gathered and the findings of the ultrasound and CT scan put together before making a diagnosis. at times, a biopsy may be needed.Gallstones and esophagitits do not cause liver nodules.

In some cases, these masses produce no complications, while other masses may cause life-threatening symptoms due to the excess production of certain hormones.

She went through chemo 4 weels, radiation 4 weeks and then removal of spleen, 2/3 pancreas, resection of artery.  She hasnt felt well since surgery, now her hemogoblin is 3 having blood transfusions over a period of 3 days. Does this mean cancer has reappeared?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for this query.I am so sorry to hear about this anemia. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy have as serious side effects anemia because these drugs and the rays destroy the cells that produce blood cells. This may not represent a recurrent cancer because it is not a classical presentation of pancreatic cancer but rather a side effect of treatment procedures. More blood tests can differentiate this and more so when the number of new red blood cells like reticulocytes remain low despite the worsening and severe anemia.I hope you find this helpful.

As the day moved along and into the evening I could not pass any urine. I went to the emergency room at the Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD. and seen the staff doctor. She said she was going to place a new catheter and when she did I was able to pass urine. I was informed by another doctor who works with my urologist that I have a blockage and this is what causing a weak Bladder. I don t understand that after 7 months they can t find the blockage?

For early stage or superficial bladder cancers, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), is the most common treatment. This surgery is done through an instrument passed up the urethra, The side effects of transurethral bladder surgery are generally mild and do not usually last long. Unfortunately, even with successful treatment, bladder cancer often recurs (comes back) in other parts of the bladder. If transurethral resection needs to be repeated many times, the bladder can become Weak,scarred and lose its capacity to hold much urine. this can be the reason in your case too. you must discuss with your treating urologist clearly. hope this helps!"},{"Patient":"I am 40 years old, male, height 5 10 weight 212 pounds; I have been treated for hypothyroidism since 2010; on Sept 16th, lab results came back indicating an extremely low level of TSH, very low Vitamin D and low (200) Testosterone. I have extreme fatigue and attention, concentration problems; I feel cognitively impaired and have started to notice troubles with my vision. My doc prescribed 50,000 IU Vitamin D, 0.088 MG of levothyroxin, and Testosterone IM injections. I knew something wasn t right weeks prior; since the findings and modification in treatment; I asked my doctor (an Internist) for a referral to an Endocrinologist for an evaluation. Thus far, I am getting the run-around from his office staff on the doctor needing to approve the referral. I called an endocrinologist s office, recited the same as above and was told they would definitely see me but needed the medical information from my Internist. I have a job with a lot of responsibility and must get to the bottom of the problem rather than treating symptoms, IMHO. Is there a credible reason my Internist would NOT want me to be evaluated by an Endocrinologist? I am beginning to wonder if my doctor s staff is incompetent, if not, it is hurting the level of Trust I have in my Internist. He showed the lab results to me and emphasized the seriousness of treatment. I m caught between a rock and a hard place. My question, I suppose, is why would my Internist NOT move more quickly on providing a referral or at least giving me the records so I can give them to the Endocrinologist? If this thyroid condition, vitamin, hormone condition is not a big deal, it sure feels like it. I have thyroid cancer history in my family and my father died of adreno-carcinoma. Any enlightenment would be very much appreciated.","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcare-MagicGreetings of the dayI would also agree that you require evaluation by endocrinologist.

Had stress test, echocardiagram and carotid artery test. All tests were normal.","Doctor":"Hi ! It is good that all tests related to your heart were normal. Erosive gastritis m gives rise to esophageal spasm which may mimic a cardiac problem.CT scan is not the ideal investigation to show erosive gastritis. It can be diagnosed with the help of your history, followed by the endoscopy. You can go for a proton pump inhibitor, a prokinetic agent, and an antacid after consulting your doctor, and at the same time you should go more for bland diet, fresh vegetable and fruits, and avoid fast fried food from outside.

A sonogram detected a 19 mm polyp in my bladder in May. The scan was prompted by the presence of hematuria. This was followed by a thoracic, abdominal and pelvic MRI which detected no other abnormal growths.

Since that time I have been on maintenance chemo. Had a surgery to remove extensive scar tissue and part of the small bowel due to freq. bowel obstructions. My only symptoms of gluten intolerance could also be due to the chemo so I m wondering if I have some intolerance.

Now I have lower left quadrant pain off and on. The Pet Scan showed something in the colon but the colonoscopy showed nothing. My CT Scan showed small lesions on my liver and kidney which are too small to determine what they are. I already had some cysts on my liver and kidneys but these are new.

This past July she had a D & C because she was having some spotting. The procedure went well and no cancer was found but she is still bleeding going through  3-4 pads a day. We've been back to her gynecologist twice since the D & C and she assured my mother that nothing was wrong, everything looked clean and nothing was found. If everything's fine and there's no cancer why does my mother continue to bleed everyday? That doesn't seem normal to me.  Is there anything else we should be looking for?","Doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question.The most likely cause of bleeding is related to \\"atrophy\\" of the lining of the uterus.  A D&C, though, is not the best way to evaluate the uterus.  The best procedure is to put a camera into the uterus (called a hysteroscopy) as she likely has a polyp with the uterine lining.I hope that this helps and good luck!"},{"Patient":"Went to Dr for a feeling of sweeling in my left upper groin area .He checked prostate and thought it to be a little inflamed .He gave me cipro and took 4 blood test ,all come back good .Dr also ordered a pelvic ct scan.after taking cipro for 21/2 day I got diearria that looked like raw hamberger.Went to er and they put me on fladgyl ,diearria is getting better .CT results showed thickining or inflamation of colon wall .What could couse this ?

Thickening and inflammation of colonic wall on CT pelvis does not means only cancer of colon.It could be due many more conditions like ulcerative colitis,chron,s and non specific colitis,although all these conditions will produce addational symptoms in addation to thickening of colon.The best way out is to go for a colonoscopy to determine the exact nature of this swelling and inflammation and if necessary diagnosis can be confirmed by biopsy taken during colonoscopy.Consultation with a physion who may be able to perform colonscopy on you is advisible.Diarrhoea could be part of same disease or could be due to speradded infection due to prolong  course of cipro and may get settled with a course of flaygl.

I have the left lobe removed (where lump was discovered). Surgeon was confident it was not cancerous, however, upon pathology of tissue discovered follicular cancer. I then underwent removal of right thyroid lobe by Cancercare surgeon and was discovered to have papillary cancer on that side. I have been monitored with yearly thyroglobulin blood test and ultrasound and this past spring, a lymph node appeared positive for cancer along with eleveated thyroglobulin. I had surgery this past February and they removed a the lymph node from left side of neck along with 12 other lymph nodes that were negative. In September, I am to have follow up with radioactive iodine treatment under the care of a Nuclear Medicine physician. He has consulted with two of his colleagues as to best approach and these colleagues had varying opinions. One said I should have a therapeutic dose of radiation to ensure there were no microscopic cells in my body, the other said to take the thyrogin injections and then test Thyroglobulin level and if within normal range, would not go ahead with diagnostic body scan as the blood test has been proven to be more accurated than a scan. If the thyroglobulin is normal range, then, no additional radiation would be necessary. I am wondering what research has been done as to best approach to ensure microscopic thyroid cells are destroyed and the prevalance of disease returning every few years. I note from my research that thyroid cancer is recurrent around the 8 - 10 year mark and I would like to avoid having further surgery as I was told by my surgeon that he wants to avoid recurrent surgeries due to complications of developing scar tissue.","Doctor":"Hi, As far as my opinion is, you need to undergo follow up with thyroglobulin levels and neck ultrasound to check for any recurrence. Radio iodine scans are used for knowing the amount of thyroid tissue post total thyroidectomy so that the residual disease if any can be ablated with an ablative dose of radio iodine. Other methods to look for neck masses in such patients are CT, MRI or PET.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello, my fiance noticed a lump, about the size of a marbal, on his throat yeasterday on the left side of his adams apple.

I am 20 years old, it would be great if someone could help me with this. thank you","Doctor":"Hi, Any lump in oral cavity/lip should be seen with suspicion in a tobacco chewer. Please see an ENT and get it examined. It can be benign and because of inclusion cyst or mucosal bite or a benign lesion of the minor salivary gland. Still being a tobacco chewer, see an ENT. Also stop using tobacco. Regards"},{"Patient":"My mother has stage 4 throat cancer and has been told it is to late for treatment. We have accepted that.

She has lived past the time her doctor said she would and up until now has been doing wonderful. Almost as if nothing were wrong, but this fever has me worried.","Doctor":"Hi,Your mother is on palliative care for throat cancer which is untreatable by the modalities available. It is the symptomatic treatment which is given to the patient depending upon the symptoms like pain, vomiting, fever, bleeding breathing difficulty, dysphagia and like that.

Is it wise to have skin grafting or should I go another route to make the scar not so obvious? And, can you recommend a qualified doctor in South Carolina?","Doctor":"Hi, do not know about a doctor suitable for you in South Carolina but repair of the defect can be done best with a small rotation flap may be a nasolabial flap (still would be better to comment after seeing the defect). Grafting with free skin is a good option for this region if done as a primary reconstruction. A pedicled flap from adjoining skin or forehead is a better option as a secondary reconstruction which you now need.

THANKS.","Doctor":"Hi, a recurrent or residual disease post surgery and CTRT in oral cavity cancer carries a poor prognosis. A restriction in mouth opening is another ominous sign which points to the possibility of involvement of pterygoid muscles and is a sign of inoperability. Any way, please go to your doctor and if the recurrent disease is operable, it should be excised, otherwise she needs palliative care. Regards"},{"Patient":"I have bumps on the back of my tongue . Was just refered to an endocrinologist cause my thyroid is huge and they think it maybe thyroid cancer . Can t sleep wondering should I go for possible bad news","Doctor":"Hi, Bumps on the tongue is usually not a sign of cancer leave alone the thyroid cancer. A thyroid mass needs evaluation by FNAC, Ultrasound of the neck, and thyroid profile. If it is very huge, then a CT neck also is needed. Please get your self examined and investigated. Otherwise a thyroid cancer is on the cancers with better prognosis compared to many other head and neck cancers.

I was an occasional chewing tobacco user however i recently went to the states for 2 months and increased my chewing tobacco intake. I have since cut back and am ready to quit. Cn chewing tobacco be causing this? if so could it be cancerous? I dont have any signs of oral cancer . Really wish i did not stat chewing in the the first place. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, its nice that you are going to stop the chewing tobacco habit. There can be multiple causes of nasal bleeding and crusting with scab formation by nose picking is the common. Hypertension is the most common cause in the elderly. Cancer can be cause of nasal bleeding but needs to be evaluated and for that you need to see an ENT. So, do not worry, just see an ENT and get yourself examined in case you do not fit into the above two described categories.

The bump went down to barely there, but he still had pus in his throat. He felt a bump in throat and pulled out a white nugget type thing. He went to a ENT doctor and showed him the white nugget who said it was indeed a tonsil stone .

Listed off a bunch of things he could have including tonsil cancer! My husband is a very fit 46, never smoked , and rarely drinks. My question is can you have tonsil stones and tonsil cancer.","Doctor":"Hi, from your description seems like an infective condition and is because of collection of debris in tonsillar crypts.

I do have post nasal drip , can this be the cause of my enlarged lyphnodes? I scared of this being cancer . please help!","Doctor":"Hi, a swelling which is there with no harm for so many years is unlikely to be a cancerous thing. Movable lumps on both sides of jaw are usually lymphnodes and are not to be worried about for cancer. A hashimoto's thyroiditis should be under observation and there is some chance of it going to lymphoma (<10%) in long run. Just get an FNAC done from the suspicious lumps.

My question is considering my cancer was in stage one how long will it take to recover my voice and how will I know if the concer is completely gone. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi, a Stage I throat cancer (vocal cord) is usually treated with a single modality, be it surgery or radiation. You have undergone laser excision for that & then there should be some reason for your doctor to ask for radiation. May be the margins came out as positive. Otherwise voice usually starts recovering around 6-8 weeks post the completion of radiation but the quantum of recovery can be explained by the operating surgeon depending upon how much he/she has excised.

Although the involvement of bone is rare, it can involve any part of the body. You need to undergo MRI of the spine to see for the cause of sciatic pain.It may also give a clue if there is relapse of lymphoma to spine and bone scan also may show the uptake. The involvement of spine can be conformed only with biopsy of the lesion. With the presence of disease elsewhere in the body, biopsy of spine may not be required and requires treatment for lymphoma.Hope i have answered your question."},{"Patient":"I had gone through the acostic left axial tumor surgery in August 2011.

But if it is palsy and your doctor has documented the need for excising the nerve, you need to go for rehabilitative procedures like gold weight implant for upper eye lid, sling operation for angle of mouth or jump grafting from hypoglossal nerve to facial or a cross over graft or a free flap neuromuscular transfer.

Your friend has under gone surgery and now is undergoing CTRT, so must be have a T3-T4 disease and the symptoms you are describing can be because of the edema of the area in throat.

Onset of post-hernia repair pain usually occurs immediately after surgery.There are two predominant types of post-hernia repair pain: nociceptive pain, due predominantly to inflammation, and neuropathic pain, due to nerve injury. The most common type of postoperative pain is nociceptive which occurs due to tissue damage or mesh placement.the most common treatment for alleviating such pain is the groin block.Based on pain distribution, the patient is given ultrasonography-guided local anesthetic (lidocaine) injections in the ilioinguinal nerve and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves.there is considerable pain reduction and mobility is also increased.the swelling in your groin maybe a seroma or collection of fluid in the groin region.if you have additional pain and fever then it can be an abscess.i would advise you to get the groin block and then get an aspiration of the fluid done to get a clear picture about the swelling.depending upon that we can start anti-biotics and other tablets.thank you wishing yu good health"},{"Patient":"my husband went in for a test at the cancer center on his blood.

Please make sure you see a specialist as soon as possible in view of your past history and also get a trans-vaginal/pelvic sonogram. It could be the ovarian cyst that was noticed in the past and if it has increased in size, you need treatment immediately. Please get proper advice soon. Hope you find this information helpful.

You have to do the true cut biopsy  to know more parameters. For staging they need to have more tests like bone scan, CT scan of chest and abdomen and some blood tests to finally declare what stage it is. I feel your mother must be post menopausal and things will do better once the tumour is completely removed. Results still depend on what they find after removing the tumour like lymph node status and hormonal status. Over all prognosis should  be good.Dr. Ticku"},{"Patient":"I had a complete cystectomy in May 2010 due to the cancer of the bladder . Consequently, I wear a urostmy bag. My problem started in the middle of year 2011 when I started feeling pain in the pelvis . The excruciating pain occurs on both sides, left and right, more frequently on the left-side and it is located on the side of the body, a couple of inches below the ribcage. My ileal conduit is on the right side of the body. Originally, the frequency of pain was with an interval of four to five weeks. But now this is happening almost every night. I had all sorts of tests/scans done but no medicine has been prescribed by any consultant. My own GP has prescribed suppository diclofenic sodium . This relieves the pain within minutes but other pain killers do not have effect for a good couple of hours. Could you please advise. I will be extremely grateful. Thanks. IH BOKHARI. LONDON (UK)","Doctor":"Hi, My one suggestion would be to go easy on diclofenac sodium. By itself, it is an excellent pain killer, but in the context of your ileostomy condition where some urine will  reflux back into your kidneys, there is a risk of kidney injury with use of NSAIDs such as diclofenac. I suggest you use Tramadol which is probably a milder analgesic, but is significantly safer in your case."},{"Patient":"I am 76. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. Had a lumpectomy. More tumors found, and one large against chest wall. Mastectomy. Had Chemo. Took Arimidex (spelling??) for 4 years 10 months. Was in pain everyday. The breast cancer had recurred., same side, chest wall. I had lumpectomy on Oct. 6. Pathology showed it to be recurrence. Pet scan showed no where else in my body. Nov. 12, more surgery to take out more tissue to try for clear margins. After healing, radiation. Then Arimidex for 5-10 years. Or Tomaxifen for 5-10 years. I know how I feel everyday on Arimidex.

Anne Marie Martainez","Doctor":"Hi Anne Merie Martainez,The breast cancer is a systemic disease i.e it involves all the system in the body. Surgery and radiation will only take care of disease in the breast. There is a spread of small cancer cells to other parts of the body called micrometastasis. So these cells can regrow later time.This is the reason the chemotherapy or harmonal therapy is recommended to kill these small cancer cells which cannot be detected by investigations.Hope i have answered your question"},{"Patient":"My brother has just been diagnosed with aggressive b-cell lymphoma and now has swelling in legs, swelling in abdomen, pulse of 108, blood pressure of 152/70, and feels warm all the time, esp. at night, but no fever.

Treatment for lymphoma will reduces it. if does not pits on pressure, deep vein thrombosis should be ruled out with color flow doppler of lower limbs.

My father had bladder cancer last year and was cleared and received BCG treatments just to be safe.","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,The problems in the stomach could be explained by a blockage generally called an intestinal obstruction. The past history could suggest the fact that maybe due to spread of a tumor, an intestinal region was affected, and the tumor mass is blocking the flow of food.

Endoscopy and serum potassium should be checked first. thanks and hope this helps. Kind regards"},{"Patient":"I have had tremindous stomach pains.

So you need to consult your doctor for the same and continue the xgeva to prevent further development of new metastasis.

How did he know that the Radiologist did not see a lump and that is the reason why she did the test over again and send it all over my body which i had said to him but still ignore my request to send me to see that specialist.

It started in May 2013. Every time  I'd put something in my mouth, I'd get nauseated. Then I started having stomach pains. I had an endoscopy and everything was normal. While they were in there, 3 biopsies were taken, all negative for cancer and H. palori (probably spelled wrong). Then CT scan and ultra sound on abdomen, gallbladder and appendix was normal but they did find 2 \\"spots\\" on my liver (another CT and ultrasound scheduled for December 2013). Colonoscopy performed and only found internal hemorrhoids. Now the pain is in my lower right abdomen and right testicle. I saw a Urologist this past Tuesday and they did an ultrasound on it and said it appeared normal. Had blood tests done, LDL slightly elevated, bilirubin was a little off, no diabetes, lead levels normal, calcium elevated, B12 normal, but they said something else was also off (can't remember the  name). Because of that they want to check my thyroids. Would or could my thyroids be causing the pain. Sometimes I feel good and others times it feels like I was kicked in the abdomen by a horse and sometimes it feels like someone is squeezing my testicle. Any info would be gratefully appreciated. Thanks.","Doctor":"confirm what  the spots in liver are but getting the scheduled tests done. your symptoms are not related to this but since the imaging of rest of the body is normal, there is nothing serious about it."},{"Patient":"I have been feeling a lot of tightness in my chest.

My problem is I am terribly afraid of pneumonia . My doctor says I can get pneumonia from stopping my meds, but they tell me everytime I have an infection to stop my meds? I am prone to having bad sinus infections, and many times they cause me to cough up mucus, and when I call the RA doctor they tell me to skip the meds till the infection is better. My question is isn t this information I am getting somewhat confusing and it stands to reason to me if I need to stop the meds when I have an infection then the taking the meds will contribute to the infection. I think I am better off without the RA meds. I need some clarification, because I have constant sinus infections!","Doctor":"RA is basically related to the immune system and drugs work by supressing the immune system. Since the medicines suppress the body's entire immune system, you will be more susceptible to infections during that period. When the blood counts are critically low, you will be be advised to give a break to your medicines to help the counts to recover. What you need to do is to avoid catching infection and take preventive measures like avoiding getting exposed to people with infection, avoiding crowded places, wearing face mask when going out, maintaining healthy diet. you can take vaccination also like pneumococcus vaccine and influenza shots."},{"Patient":"I have been using RX bio-identical progesterone for 20 years.

So, in a way the doctors are doing the appropriate thing by giving her anti TB treatment. It is advisable to start the treatment early in such cases, prolonging it may lead to sticking/ fibrosis in pleural space/ lung. You are right that these drugs give side effect to other organs but when we looks at the risk -benefit ratio of treatment with drug side effects , we decide the line of management. This risk -  benefit ratio goes infavor of treatment. Now about the test report, many times on is not able to get to a clear cut pathogen in such cases, as it is difficult to cultivate them in laboratory, also a long time is required some times.  but still the consensus says that if the fluid study dosent come out with any bacterial, viral, malignanat cause, it is treated for TB. In almost all such cases the medicine is successful in curing the patient.Hope this answer helps you trust your doctor. give your friend a good, healthy diet, regular walks when she is able to, breathing exercises and get scheduled tests done to check any adverse effect taking place. Please do. it worry about many side effects as anti TB drugs are sometimes given even to newborn / infants and toddlers and they too are able to make it safely.

When they did the surgery, they found a boarderline tumor on my left ovary. They removed everything including 7 lymph nodes on my left side and pelvic tissue. Everything came back clean. I just had a 5 month check-up, and my gyn./oncologist said that I had granular tissue on the vaginal cuff. She scraped some off to biopsy, and then used the silver nitrate to treat it. I am concerned about the biopsy. I just had it done yesterday, so I haven't had time to get the results yet. I guess what I want to know is what she is really looking for the biopsy to tell her? Is she concerned about cancer spreading there? She acted like it could be scar tissue. If it is scar tissue, does the silver nitrate usually take care of it with one treatment, or does it sometimes take multiple treatments? It all took me so off guard that I didn't think to ask her any of these questions when I was there yesterday. I was having some dull cramping once in awhile, and I had spotting one time since surgery,  plus a yellowish discharge sometimes which, now that I've read about granular tissue on the vaginal cuff, I realize that these were all symptoms of that. Anything you can tell me about granular tissue would be helpful. Thank you.","Doctor":"HelloThanks for your query.See, basically, you have a scar on the vaginal cuff, where you had been cut open and then stitched back.It is common for granulation tissue to grow on the scar, that is new tissue growing there.It is not at all cancer.Silver nitrate generally takes care of it in a single sitting.A biopsy is required, because, rarely, there could be pre malignant or malignant changes therein, which need to be excluded while you are at it.You should not worry about it, and wait for the biopsy.If your doctor had suspected cancer, she would have told you so, i think, and you would have had symptoms too.As you have a history of malignancy, hence the biopsy was in order.All the best.Take care."},{"Patient":"my 73 years old mum has just diagnosed with early stage invasive lobular carcinoma with positive osestrogen receptor , positive HER2 ( 2+ ) and KI67","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.It can rarely be cured without surgery and it is not advisable since surgery is the most appropriate way of management of such cancers.It can be associated with chemotherpay or radiation but surgery is the mainstay of treatment today.

Its a good question. Some kidney cancer are genetic (in few percent). Some are related with smoking, obesity, estrogens and some chemical agents.

Such mutated cell can not be controlled anymore and its only aim is to grow and spread.

I am 53 and not done with menopause.  After no periods for about 5 months I started mild bleeding but got heavier continuing for 2 months.  Became very anemic.(been prone to anemia most of my life)  Went to gyn. found I needed iron pills. Stopped bleeding within 8 days. Little to no pain the whole time just rather bloated but quit once iron kicked in. A vaginal ultrasound revealed uterus about twice it's size, walnut size fibroid inside, hyperplasia of uterus and a \\"baseball\\" size left ovarian cyst (appears fluid like). Uterus biopsy was negative. Had CA-125 test revealing score of 95. Gyno wants to remove left ovary and cyst.(laproscopically) Suggests removal of uterus while there, leaving 2nd ovary but says up to me. Second opinion Gyno says take out both ovaries and what ever I want to do with my uterus says up to me.  I do understand that if cancer is found what is taken out changes but what should I ask for initially?  After hearing both and reading all these web sites I am thinking just the left ovary with cyst.  What do you think? What if left ovary shows cancer? What should they take then?  I am now having an uneventful light period starting 2 days ago rather right on time.  I stopped having painful periods about 18 months ago and still without notable pain so this discovery and all these tests really caught me off guard.

It is getting larger and sorer by the day. This is not a sign for cancer is it? To be that sore what do you think it might be?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Lumps on sides of neck in children are usually due to swollen lymph nodes caused by lice and are harmless. When scratched with finger nails, they become infected and painful. Swellings can also occur in other infections like tuberculosis and sore throat. Rarely lymph nodal swelling may occur due to diseases like lymphoma and cancer.If the swelling decreases on taking antibiotics, it is most likely infective. If it persists, your doctor is right in doing a FNAC/ biopsy to confirm diagnosis. It will only be a needle prick test and please do not worry.Mean while you should get concerned if there is significant weight loss, continuous low grade fever and swelling in other parts of the body. This may indicate something serious. If these features are not there, there is no need to worry. You must however completely evaluate the swelling and take proper treatment at the earliest.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, yesterday I noticed that they left side of my mouth became really dry after eating lunch.

While in Dubai, I'm sure I got pregnant and had a miscarriage.  I couldn't see a doctor about it, it's illegal to have a child if unmarried in Dubai.SO here I am in the states.  It's bee three weeks since the miscarriage took place.  I've had minor spotting since then, and the cramps weren't as bad as those first few days.  I noticed a pain that wasn't going away.  When I looked online, it was exactly where my fallopian tubes/cervix are.  It's a constant pain that has been growing since yesterday and got so painful that I went to the hospital.  The doctor seemed more worried about the fact that I could have appendicitis than the whole pregnancy/miscarriage itself.  She decided to do a cat scan.  Four hours later, I was released from the hospital with a sheet that said \\"lower abdominal pain, follow up with a doctor in three days\\".  I asked the doctor at the hospital...is there a cyst, maybe a fibroid, maybe infection, maybe I'm not healing up properly.  SHe looked at me as if I was crazy every time I talked about the miscarriage.  She said she would have to do an ultrasound to find those but that the cat scan didn't show anything, and the blood work said no inflammation or pregnancy. SHe mentioned that it could be irritable bowel syndrome, since I also mentioned that I had hemmorhoids that started yesterday.  I have had that before and I remember it being much higher up than my vaginal area.  I'm not looking to be sick.  I'm aware of my body and I know this isn't normal.  Are cat-scans as accurate as ultra sounds when it comes to miscarriages?  COuld she have missed something or am I going crazy?

The best information you could get about your miscarriage is through Ultrasound.some spotting is common after miscarriage but make sure there are no products left in your uterus.

The chance of getting cancer depends on many factors such as- How many times he takes tobacco, how long he keeps it in his mouth. Much of the time it depends upon persons immunity (body defense mechanism)  some times it is like a person taking less tobacco is getting cancer than a person taking more tobacco.

I describe my pain as follows: right in the middle of my breasts, radiating underneath my right breast, more increased pain down my right side, radiating into my stomach, going through into my upper right back / shoulder.  I have been back and forth to the doctors.  I've had numerous blood tests / stool samples / 2 ultrasounds, the first one came back inconclusive, and I was told that maybe I had a non-functioning gallbladder, the second one came back completely negative, nothing wrong at all, no sludge, no stones, gallbladder looked healthy etc.  I've also had a gastroscopy which returned negative results too, everything absolutely fine.  I'm now currently waiting for a follow-up appointment with my consultant, but I get this pain pretty much every single day.  It only occurs at night time, anywhere from 6pm onwards, and always lasts anywhere from 4 - 8 hours.  I take 2 buscopan, 2 codeine and 2 ibuprofen, but these only really take the edge off and I think they just end up knocking me out.  I can't lie down as the pain increases when I do so have to sit bolt upright.  As the pain always appears more so in the middle of the night I am not sleeping at night.  I have a 4 year old son to look after, and at the moment, with this pain, my life is pretty much hell.  I don't know what to do anymore.  The consultants secretary said the next appointment she could get me was 21st August, which means another 6 weeks of pain before I get to see the consultant again.  I've said that this is now not good enough and I can't be expected to suffer every day with this pain, not sleeping etc without it being sorted.  Please, any ideas, is there any light you could possibly shed?  Thank you.

Good appetite, no gastric complaints. He has been started on antibiotics (ceftum) 5 days ago but no relief. - could it be that the lymphoma is progressing and not being controlled by chemo?? - how to check that the chemo is really killing the cancer cells? that the disease is not progressing?","Doctor":"Hi! welcome to HCM! In most cases, the treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is chemotherapy, usually with a regimen of 4 drugs cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, plus the monoclonal antibody rituximab . This regimen, known as R-CHOP, is usually given for about 6 months. Rituximab is a type of biological therapy . Rituximab targets a protein known as CD20. CD20 is found on white blood cells called B cells. It is the B cells that are cancerous in the most common type of non Hodgkin lymphoma. Rituximab attaches itself to the B cells and marks them. The cells of the immune system recognise the marked cells and kill them. An increased risk of getting an infection from a drop in white blood cells – it is harder to fight infections and patient can become very ill. DLBCL can be cured in about half of all patients, but the stage of the disease and the IPI score can have a large effect on this. Patients with lower disease stages have better survival rates, as do patients with lower IPI scores. hope this helps!take care!"},{"Patient":"hi thanks doc i m myself doing md in oncology i have a problem, since quite early in my age i started menstrubation and i used to have frequency of micturation wchich increased specificaly after manstrubation i m 37 now unmarried still manstrubate but now the symptoms seems to be increasing ,afrading is it prostate or bladder cancer although i know they r rare in my age but still worried","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for using Healthcaremagic,I have gone through the details provided by you.Masturbation is quite normal in young age and has no relation with development of cancer.You are studying medicine so most likely it is some kind of infection which causes frequency and urinary symptoms.It is necessary to find exactly what it is so just consult a Urosurgeon and get tests like Complete blood count,Urine analysis, semen analysis to see pus cells.We can also get Ultrasonography to see size and tissue, if dynamics of bladder is required than Uroflowmetry can be performed .If there is any infection UTI,Prostatitis, it can be certainly treated.Please do not worry about cancer.Hope this information helps you.Take care.Good Luck.Dr.Akhilesh Dubey M.D."},{"Patient":"My farther is very duck and has not been able to eat any foods for a very long time a feeding tube was implanted into his stomach after killing a canxerouse growth at the top of his stomach into the esphiges  recently went for a surgery to remove that part of his stomach And a stomach infection was found in the lineing of his stomach walls and now he still has a very hard time eating any food sand comains he's always cold","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query.

Welcome to HCM! A testicular lump or swelling within the scrotum may not cause harm or even need to be treated. But it is still important you see a urologist so that he can determine what is causing the lump. Diagnosis often can be done based on the signs and symptoms and the location and feel of the mass. Additional visualization is usually done with ultrasound imaging, and by viewing the mass by transillumination. Urine or blood tests may be done to test for a bacterial or viral infection. Causes of relatively painless lumps may include:Varicocele ,hydrocele ,Testicular cancer — Although rare, testicular cancer can occur , usually as a painless lump on the testicle that may be accompanied by a dull ache or sense of heaviness. Even if you're not experiencing pain or other symptoms, any scrotal mass should be examined  for accurate diagnosis and treatment. hope this helps.Take care!"},{"Patient":"my father has stage 4 esophagus cancer he has had a year of chemo and today they stented the tumor area and took another biopsy.

It is an indicator of the function of the kidney and only when both the kidneys fail does it start to rise. That cause then needs to be corrected. Cancer is a very rare cause of kidney failure and there are other much common causes. Also, the calcium levels can also increase just because of kidney failure.

Alaxan contains two drugs, paracetamol and ibuprofen. Potentially they can lead to kidney damage if used for prolonged periods in high doses. Pain of malignancies is severe and there is a need for pain killers. Are you on any chemotherapy? As chemo usually kills the cancer cells and decreases the pain so the need for painkillers decreases. Try to decrease the dose of Alaxan from 3x to 2x and than 1x. There are other group of drugs called opioid analgesics that decrease the pain and can be obtained on prescription by cancer patients. Try other measures like meeting friends and family that help distract from pain. Also other therapies like acupressure, massage etc that help to bring down the pain and need for pain killers.

People who have atrial fibrillation are one such group and you belong to this group. This drug has no effect on formation of new cancer in the body or on progression of pre-existing cancer. The only problem is tendency to bleed more than a normal individual. This is normally not a concern except when a procedure needs to be done on the patient, like biopsy/surgery.

Well. there are many aspects of life which are beyond the control of human being, and doctors are also human beings. I am sure your doctors must have given their best in removing as much cancer in her stomach as possible by surgery, and chemotherapy, but always it is not possible, and there are chances that it might have already spread by the time of diagnosis and surgery.The surgery might have been a palliative one only.There are many claims for treating the cancer by many other sciences, but there is no evidence to substantiate their claim. So is the case with the Raw Vegetarian. In her present state, you have to be strong enough to counsel her and give her all the love and affection with the care which she deserves.

Have been advised 8 rounds of chemo. After the second chemo, i experienced hardening of the stools and after a day or two, had severe pain in the anal region. Was diagnosed as fistula. Am told that surgery is the only option ! however, due to chemo, cannot have the surgery done now. Is there any other oral treatment for the same ?  Please advise.  Raji","Doctor":"Hi Raji ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef, a general surgeon answering your query. Possibly during and after the chemotherapy you couldn't resume to your normal diet and liquids. Due to this you might have developed constipation and while passing hard stool might have developed a fissure in ano which could be diagnosed only by physical examination of the perianal region. The doctor/surgeon examining you can say with certainty whether it is a fissure or fistula.However, if I were your doctor, after clinically examining you would have advised sitz baths(sitting in a tub of warm water) three times a day, an anti inflammatory, and an antibiotic which covers specially gram negative and anaerobic organisms. I will also add an probiotic and a stool softener to ease you of your pain, and to avoid further trauma to the anal mucosa. This being done, I would also advise you on your diet towards more of roughage and enough liquids to avoid constipation. Most of the acute fissure in ano of recent history usually heal by themselves with this type of conservative management and dietary regulations. However, if the pain increases without much relief, and the fissure is recurring after being cured , then a lateral sphinterotomy surgery with gentle anal dilatation may give you a permanent cure, but you have to continue to keep a watch on your diet. By any chance, if it is a fistula as told by your doctor, the only treatment available is a surgery. This can be decided by the doctor who has examined you, and it is not possible to diagnose it over the net due to obvious reasons.I hope this information helps you in  discussion with your doctor for further management.

If prostate cancer recurs, follow-up treatment depends on what treatment you have already had, the extent of your cancer, the site of recurrence, other illnesses, your age, and other aspects of your medical situation. If the cancer is still thought to be localized to the area of the prostate, a second attempt to try to cure the cancer may be possible. If you've had a radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy may be an option, sometimes along with hormone therapy.

In myeloma cells,  Bortezomib proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, permitting activation of programmed cell death in neoplastic cells dependent upon suppression of pro-apoptotic pathways.Cyclophosphomideis a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent.The main effect of cyclophosphamide is due to its metabolite phosphoramide mustard. This metabolite is only formed in cells that have low levels of ALDH.Phosphoramide mustard forms DNA crosslinks both between and within DNA strands at guanine N-7 positions (known as interstrand and intrastrand crosslinkages, respectively).

You had a psychological conflict in your mind which was not resolved in that level itself, because you were not aware that this conflict can produce such a cancerous growth in your body. Depending on the nature of the conflict , the particular area in your brain  is stimulated to produce a pathology in a particular organ. In your case bladder was affected through a programme in a particular area of brain corresponding to the bladder. You went to a urologist and got the biopsy done and diagnosed the problem as cancer. You again recollect the whole process of management of the cancer growth, removal of the cancer cells etc. till today. It has frightened you to the point of panic and disappointment. You did not resolve your conflict in the psychological level. So you did not get cure. You did not get a constitutional treatment considering your mind and body. So you are not cured. But your cancer cells are removed. The cancer cell growth, which was a part of your defence were removed without curing you. Naturally your constitution is still sick or more sick. Your agitation and fear of death is there in your constitution. You have complained only about a mental symptom manifested through your body as flutter. There must be several physical symptoms going on in your body just like the fluttering you have complained of. Many of these degenerative symptoms are not even noticed by you. One thing I can conclude. That is - you are now in a worse health status and you need a constitutional treatment. You may please do not go to a conventional medical specialist. He will again suppress your flutter by a stronger sedative or stronger chemical drug. You may feel your flutter has gone away. Just like they have removed the cancer cells which were in reality a part of the defence mechanism of the body. What you need now is no more a suppressive treatment. You need a constitutional holistic treatment that will take into consideration your mind and body. As a Homoeopath, I can confidently suggest you to undergo Homoeopathic treatment from an expert Homoeopathic physician. You can also approach me for curative treatment. Once YOU are cured, definitely your flutter will be cured and YOU will live for many more healthful years of life ahead.With Best Wishes,Dr C. J.

I was diagnosed with Bronchitis and given an inhaler. I still have the cough, wheezing, tightness but I also had a scope done on my Larynx back in 2011 and I'm a prime candidate for Cancer as the one side is extremely enlarged. My main question is (which I can locate online) what kind of cough is associated with Larynx Cancer? Yes I do smoke but have never had a cough until I had the smoke inhalation. Any explanation of what kind of cough is associated with my previous question would be greatly appreciated. However, if it's not that then the other question would be, how long does it take for smoke inhalation to clear the lungs? I'm having difficulty sleeping as I wake up every 2-4 hours with this dreaded cough.","Doctor":"hello dearthanks for query at HCMsymptoms in larynx cancer depends up on area of the larynx involved .larynx divided in to three parts supra glottic, glottic and sub glottic, symptoms vary according to area involved .supra glottic: often silent, hoarsness of voice is late symptom. throat pain, dysphagia and ear pain are common symptoms.glottic : hoarsness of voice is early symptom, also produce stridor.sub glottic cancer: earliest symptom is stridor, hoarseness is late feature.nature of cough may not determine the location.smoke inhalation may take years to clear from lungs and it also has long term complication and adverse side effects.cough during sleep and awakening in your case might be due to bronchitis.your diagnosed with bronchitis so all symptoms might be related to it.if you still have strong suspicion of cancer visit doctor get alrynx examined and radilogical investigation like x  ray and ct scan might be helpful in your case.regards"},{"Patient":"When I was in the Air Force in 1979 as a jet engine mechanic, I had a lump removed from my left breast that was diagnosed as Fibroadenoma and chronic cystic mastitis. In 1995 I had to have my left breast removed because of cancer. Could the first lump removal have anything to do with later getting cancer in the same breast?","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.I am a Homoeopath answering your query and the answer which I am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. This I say because Homoeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. Therefore due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brain washed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. Coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. You are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. It must have been related with your children or your family. The sensitivity is genetic and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. Mind- brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. You consulted your gynaecologist and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it and you subdued to his suggestion. Actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you or it was the result of a self defence mechanism. Since you had not  'resolved' the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting 'resolved'. But the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis . By removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured but your lump in the breast was removed. In 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. Instead of recognizing the mass as a defence mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. The tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. If you could have recognized the lump as a defence mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. But the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. In no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured.Hope by this time you  have got the answer for your query. Both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same programme. Homoeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. With Best Wishes,Dr C. J. VargheseHomoeopath drcjvarghese@gmail.com."},{"Patient":"Because I take Plavix and aspirin I bruise easily.  I am a 87 year old White male.

First of all let me say that I am a Homoeopaths and so I will be sharing with you some different thoughts than what you have been hearing for the last so many years about your sickness. First of all from the short query, I understand that you had cancer. The word cancer stands for a cellular change occurred in your body some 14 years back. At that time nobody gave you these thoughts and that is why you still hold that what you had was a life threatening event in your life and you believe that you are saved from cancer because of the chemo therapy, radium therapy or surgery. As a Homoeopath I would say that you had a shocking psychological conflict just before the development of a lump or ulcer in your body and the resolution of the conflict also happened during the course of treatment and so you survived. It was your strong will power or good mentality you developed towards your life situations that you could come back in life. That psychological resolution of your conflict made you to survive but the resection or the cancer treatment did not cure you fully and that is why you are still having pains. Now you are under the impression that there should have pain killers to control these pains. Again take from me that you are getting pains because you are not cured. I really and fully mean YOU. Pain is the language of nature that tells you that everything has not become alright. The body wants a curative treatment but you are giving drugs to stop this cry for cure.A child crying violently can be made to shut his mouth by beating him and threatening him with a stick. His cry can also be relieved by giving him stomach full of food or offering what he asks for. What your system demands now is not stronger threats and stronger sticks. YOU need a curative treatment, which so far you did not get. Nobody might have suggested you to undergo a Homoeopathic treatment.  Therefore my advice to you is to approach an expert Homoeopathic physician and get the right genetic, constitutional, individualistic and curative treatment. Homoeopathic cure is rapid and permanent but in your case I do not expect a sudden relief because for the last 14 years you are under strong chemical suppressive treatment for cancer and other pains. But you will be able to reduce the dosage gradually and finally you will be able to drop the chemical drugs for good and you will enjoy many more healthful years of life ahead. Remember that the child who was beaten to silence for such a long period of time will not any more cry for food or demand for other things. But you can imagine the health status of that child.I hope you followed my different chain of thoughts as a Homoeopath. Therefore instead of thinking about stronger drugs, start thinking about reducing the dosage and finally living happily and healthy without drugs.With Best Wishes,Dr C. J. VargheseHomoeopath drcjvarghese@gmail.com."},{"Patient":"I'm male, 16 white Australian. I wear contacts daily and glasses on the weekends, I've just noticed that my right eye has become itchy lately. Today when I looked in the mirror I noticed that the pink fleshy part in the corner of my right eye, the corner close to teh middle of my face, has another fleshy darker coloured part that comes onto the eye a little. This appears to be the cause of the itchiness. I'm 16 and this freaks me out, cancer or what. Can you give me some information on this and some recommendations if any?

Our eyes are very delicate organs and can get infected even by dirty hands or handkerchief contact with eyes. As you said you wear contact lenses so the chances of infection is more because of contamination with lenses.I would advice you :1)to maintain hygiene while using lenses.2)Wash your eyes with running cold water after removal of lenses.3)Try to avoid using lenses untillitching goes away.4)you can use re-wetting eye drops prescribed by the physician.5)visit eye specialist to check your lenses if the itching increased.Hope the information provided is helpful to you.Don't worry be careful.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 46 yr. old female.  I have birthed 11 children.  This is the first time last month that I did not get a period.  I figured it was the beginning of menopause.  I did 3 pregnancy tests and I am not pregnant.  Last year (Aug. 2012) I experienced loose stools and blood in my stools with an  urgency to go to the bathroom for months.  This all began after my husband and I visited a seafood restaurant and he also had the same problems.  His symptoms went away and mine did not (I was pregnant at the time and had a miscarriage).    I went to a gastroenterologist and had a colonoscopy  and he diagnosed me with colitis/crohn's disease.  I was put on Colazal (3 pills 3x a day)  I took for several months and the problem went away and I also went and got a second opinion at UNC Chapel Hill hospital.  She told me I had a bacterial infection and did not have crohn's disease and I discontinued all my medication.  Three full months after discontinuing any medication,  .my husband lost his job in July and  in August my symptoms of diarrhea, loose; urgency to go to the bathroom have all returned.  However, this time I have stomach/abdominal pain.  My stomach hurts after I start eating.  I did start at the onset of all of these symptoms to go back on the Colazal but since taking it I now experience stomach pain and nausea.  I am also recently very hungry.  I have NOT lost my appetite and not lost any weight.  I have no family history of colitis or crohn's disease.  My color is fine.  I have energy to do what I need to do but it has become part of my routine going to the bathroom 4-9 times a day especially after I have had a meal.  I stopped the colazal  because I read that stomach pains and nausea are part of the side effects.  I am hungry and have a big appetite.  I am tired but I have a lot of responsibility.

His wound was left open for a few weeks and then he was put on a wound vac.  The wound closed and the surgeon had to reopen it due to the fact that he now had a MRSA infection that developed in it.

Any infected wound is left open to heal by secondary intention after gradual cleaning of the floor of the wound with regular dressings.

Firstly I thought I had bacterial conjunctivitis in both eyes from gardening the previous day, so I started using chlorsig every 3 hours. The pain in my caused my study to take the back burner, and even take the afternoon off work. It helped but took the full 3 days of treatment and on the 4th day I felt like i'd been run over by a bus, increasingly tired and totally depressed. To top it off, the very next day I started menstruating which shouldn't sound unusual, but after having chemotherapy for breast cancer back in 2006, I generally only get one period each year. Does any of this sound overly concerning to you, or am I just having a typical peri-menopausal crappy week? Cheers Mandy","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.I also think that you were affected by a virus for the last one week. But that virus is not what you are talking about. Virus is a biological waste particle in your body as a result of the disease and not the cause of diseases. I am a Homoeopath and so you be prepared to hear something different about your diseases. The virus I meant was something in the dynamic level, a mental conflict. Since in your opinion these mental influences have no significance, you did not mention anything about that in your query. These mental conflicts made you sick to the level of reducing your immunity. This made you susceptible to diseases. The first disease was a conjunctivitis, a relatively harmless affection. But when you started suppressing it with local application, it went to a deeper levels producing deeper affections. Your conjunctivitis was in the ectodermal level but the period problem and the unusual tiredness was in the Neuro endocrine level. That is why you had a very bad period this time. All your hormonal system got shattered and you suffered unusually bad this time. Now my suggestion is that you should stop external application or medication to control conjunctivitis . It can be managed simply by frequent washing of eyes with pure cold water. You are advised to have constitutional treatment to strengthen and cleanse your constitution. I can confidently suggest you to take  Homoeopathy for that. You have proved that your health is not very good because you have the history of cancer and getting periods only once in an year  after chemotherapy. My concern is more about your constitution which reacts badly to any stimulation and my advice is to get Homoeopathic treatment from an expert. I can also help you provided you ask a premium question or you contact me directly with more details about YOU because Homoeopathy never treats your diseases but treats only YOU.

Forum. If I were treating doctor of this severe pain ( of your husband) I would come up with these reasons. 1 The most important reason may be acute ( chronic ) gastritis with recurrent episode of pain due to various factor as radiotherapy for prostate cancer , drugs causing gastritis, tension ( of disease ) , stress . As you mentioned that endoscopy and colonoscopy didn't find any thing. In chronic gastritis usually we don't find any thing except mild erosion in lesser or greater curvature of stomach. Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with blocks. It might also help to avoid eating or drinking for 2 hours before your husband lie down. To help control the stomach acid , one should not  drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy or greasy foods. Also take some  antacid ( with ingredients oxetacain in them). As symptoms are very severe so proton pump inhibitor may require. 2 You mentioned that there is diverticulosis . In my opinion this is not a case of diverticulosis. The symptoms of diverticulosis are distension, flatulence & sensation of heaviness in the LOWER abdomen ( as all these symptoms are not present )3 The most important reason of this pain is tension & anxiety .

Is it normal?","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.A lump in the lower part of your breast is not cancer. It has got nothing to do with cancer also. But the fear of cancer is not good for your health and so you have to read a lot about the disease 'cancer' from different sources. I am a Homoeopath and we Homoeopaths have got different approach to this sort of lumps in breasts.You had a psychological conflict at the time of development of this lump at the age of 14. And you have not resolved it in the psychological level. The fear of cancer is created in your mind by the conventional medicine. As long as you are under the impression that any lump any where can turn to cancer this fear is going to make problem. No such lump can kill you. These lumps are produced by the body to save  you. But a fright can kill an individual. Therefore even if you get another lump in the body or get the present lump bigger just understand that you have undergone another or more severe psychological conflict . Find it out to get it resolved at the earliest. I again advice you to keep away from such frightening business and a read a lot to get right knowledge about cancers and the big business deal behind this word. Knowledge is strength and I wish you will become stronger in future by getting more of right knowledge.I do not mean to say that lump is normal. It can be treated successfully with Homoeopathy where your mind and body will be equally given importance for curing you.

The standard protocol after that is, after six weeks of surgery, thyroid scan, ablation of any remnant thyroid tissue with radio iodine. Also you need to check you serum calcium levels also. After this surgery you need to take replacement for thyroid hormone for life. The dose of drug to be taken needs to be titrated with repeated testing of thyroid hormone levels but usually starts with 100microgram empty stomach daily. It takes some times to adjust dose but once adjusted is nearly constant and takes care of symptoms. The abnormal sensation you are having can be because of the damage to cutaneous nerve supply which usually occurs as we raise flaps during surgery. It usually get fine after some time. Another reason for tingling sensation can be low calcium levels but usually is over face. So, wait for some time, do neck and shoulder exercises regularly and you should be fine in some time. Take care."},{"Patient":"I keep getting occasional sharp pains In my lower right side (appendix area) it's been happening for a few weeks now, I'm 15, and it's only constant occasional pains, iv read symptoms of appendicitis by I'm not vomiting or anything, it's just a really uncomfortable cramping/pain feeling?

No known bang to where the bruise is, though some weeks ago I banged the other (left) side in fall. Age 74. (Father died of leukemia and other causes, sister died of breast cancer). Could this indicate blood disorder, should I resume aspirin - your advice welcomed.","Doctor":"Hi. Please donot worry over this being cancer. It is highly unlikely to be that given the picture you have portrayed. It is more likely due to the aspirin that you have been taking. It is quite common in patients on aspirin to have increased bruisability following trivial trauma. The trauma need not be substantial for bruising to occur. Stopping aspirin for a few days does not help and is not advisable with your history. Just take pain killers if there is pain (Tab Paracetamol 500mg SOS) and keep having a look at it daily. If it doesnt decrease or increases over a week, consult a surgeon."},{"Patient":"Sir my father is a 77 yr old m diagnosed with NHL Diffuse large B cell lymphoma.He has completed his 6 chemos on 23rd sept 2013he was given RCVPRituximab'cyclophosphamidevincristineprednisolonepeggrafeel(filgrastim) was given after each chemofew days back he had fever of 101.3 and we bought him to hospalthough he has no inf detected after blood culturetoday his hb is 7.6yesterday it was 8and day before it was 8.2dr has said its side effect of chemo and will recoverpls suggest wat to dodr has not advised transfusion","Doctor":"As you are undergoing chemotherapy these drigs are very strong and have many side effects one them is bone marrow depression.

She has had about 4 rounds of it. It has not grown which we know is good, but it has not shrunk after her MD has tripled her dose the last round. The pet scan shows no change. Her MD states her tumor is diffuse throughout her brain and is inoperable. The plan is to do 2 more rounds of chemo, then another pet scan> She is going to UAB hospital for RX. I know each case is very unique, but I was wondering is this somewhat typical of this type of brain tumor?

Actually, his cancer is not diffused yet, and he got operated about 2 years ago. Now, he is on chemo in one of our neighborhood country, Italy. As you may see, each of the cases are specific. The main issue in your friend's case is that the cancer is diffused and cannot be operated. Therefore, the treatment strategy includes to try to shrink the cancer and make it not to damage other brain areas. In addition, as in all cases of cancer, to  help patients not to have pain (as less as possible). Although the case of my patient would be more \\"hopeful\\"; however, no doctor would say that that isolated cancer would not cause any harm and when it is going to cause it. So, it's up to our own destiny; however, this does not mean we have to stop fighting and hoping until our last breath.

The median chances of survival for patients with stage 4 pancreatic cancer is about 3 to 5 months.

My surgeon wants to cut my cecum and sigmoid colon out.  I had my first diverticulitis attack back in March with perforation to the bowel. Was hospitalized on IV antibiotics for 5 days then home on antibiotics for 6 weeks.  The antibiotics were actually hurting me so i stopped them, then healed fine.  I have had 3 CT scans done since March, the 1st did not show a growth in my cecum, but the 2nd one did and the radiologist told my surgeon i had a tumor in my cecum.  My Surgeon told him there was no way and that it was from all the infection that i just got over. Well my gut said get another CT to confirm because I had two opinions. Got another one and the tumor was still there. So my Surgeon did a colonoscopy to see what it was.  He was unable to remove it becuase he said it was embedded into my muscle and to close to my appendix and he was scared of perforation.  Now he wants to remove my cecum and my sigmoid. I am not one to just accept what a Dr. says, (no offense) but I am the one who has to live with the consequences, and I know what they will be if I had this done.  I have researched my options and found out that I may be a candidate for EMR procedure and am in the process of finding a Dr. in Houston Tx (which is 4 hrs away from me) but I want the best of the best.  My Surgeon said that I would not be a good candidate for EMR but that he is fine with me getting a second opinion because he knows how much I am against getting my colon cut out.  What are your thoughts on what I should do?   Also, this tumor has been in me for almost 5 months now, how long before I should get it out? I am not wanting to have surgery to remove it until September, if that is the path I have to take.  Any advice would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your question.You have not mentioned exact site and size of tumor. If tumor is in cecum ,then why surgeon wants to remove sigmoid colon which is miles away from cecum .Yes antibiotic cannot cause tumor. Small sized tumor can be removed by EMR that is endoscopic mucosal resection, but if the size of tumor is big and the tumor has penetrated the wall of colon then it cannot be removed by EMR. Surgical removal is then only choice. If your tumor is amendable to EMR then you don' have to wait. Get it removed quickly, as with every  passing days tumor may increase in size and may penetrate the wall of colon and then surgeon won’t be able to remove it through EMR.Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"My sister has tried two cancer drugs for high grade papillary serious carcinoma after she had surgery.

I am currently undergoing evalation at MD Anderson, but do not have several results back yet.  Do you recommend surgery for someone my age, or what type of treatment would you consider.  I have had prostrate cancer and originally it was thought that the cancer had metasticed.","Doctor":"What type of treatment you should undergo depends on two factors. First, what trouble are the hemangiomas giving you. I mean, if they are producing severe debilitating pain or pressing on a nerve leading to weakness of some body part, then yes you need to consider surgery since surgery is the only curative option. If, on the other hand, they are not too much trouble and just produce occasional pain which is relieved by pain killers then i would nt be too worried. Hemangiomas are generally harmless benign tumors of blood vessels and remain lying harmlessly in the body for the entire lifetime. The second factor is your general health and any associated conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, asthma (all increase the risk in surgery).

No symptoms at all.  Are we 100% sure that the cancer had spread to the lungs?  Could the nodules be something else?

Malignant melanoma is one of the deadliest cancers in the human body and is known to come back, generally in the lungs or liver. It is curable only in the early stages and when it has spread to the lymph nodes, likelihood of cure is remote. Having said that, please be assured that the treatment that has been given so far to your dad is absolutely correct and scientific and is the reason why he has survived so far. If you really want to be sure whether this is cancer or not, you can get a PET scan done. But there is little doubt that this is cancer.

H.pylori infection is mainly the cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastritis,although it has also been associated with gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. A blood test checks to see whether your body has made antibodies to H. pylori bacteria. If you have antibodies to H. pylori in your blood, it means you either are currently infected or have been infected in the past. A urea breath test checks to see if you have H. pylori bacteria in your stomach. This test can show if you have an H. pylori infection.

I am a Homoeopath and so you will be reading different version from my side than what you were continuously hearing. Every organ in our body works under the control of the brain. Brain can be influenced by one's mind. When something goes wrong, understand that something happened in the mind-brain-organ axis. The same is the case with any lump formation also. Now you may go back to the days before you found the lump on your neck then you will be able to recognize a psychological conflict that was not resolved. The fear of death coined by the vested interests to the lumps must have affected you when you found the lump for the first time and when you have undergone repeated biopsies with frightful death sentences. If you have still in your mind the fear, then come out of it at the earliest. Resolve the unexpected psychological conflict in the way you think best. Lead a positive life.

Now come back to the surgical repair of the hiatal hernia. Was it a major surgery. Did you get alarmed at or after the surgery? Did you think it was going to be fatal etc.? Also understand that no surgery is curative. It is only an interference with nature and except in accidents, they are not needed. The surgery done for hiatus hernia could have avoided by right Homoeopathic remedies since childhood. But it became worse and the acid reflux symptoms got worst and disease worsened to a more serious type. So now you are suffering from the sessile polyp. I am not to say that surgery on hiatus hernia caused this . It is a constitutional manifestation and so genetic. Now, my conclusion is that you should not worry about cancer or its fatality associated in your case. What you have to do is to approach an expert Homoeopathic physician at the earliest. In case you do not have one and if you opt to consult me online, I need a lot more information about YOU because in Homoeopathy YOU are being treated and once YOU are cured, all your complaints will get relief. You need not doubt, even the polyp can get regressed and your body and mind will become healthy. I can even send to you a case taking form on request in which you can enter your whole case and forward it to me. I will study it and suggest your curative remedy. With Best Wishes,Dr. C. J.

My last CBC blood test came back that my white blood cell count was 12.7 (doctor said likes to see it below 11).  She says this indicates cancer (did I mention her bedside manner sucks?).  I have been having problems with a couple of teeth for the last 4 months and have had several procedures done on them and I am going back again this week.  Seems coincidental that my WBC was high the last two times and fits in to the time period of the tooth problems.  I should mention that I smoke which probably doesn't help.  This is the first time I have had a high WBC without a valid reason for it (i.e. sinus infection, diarrhea etc.).  Should I be freaking out?","Doctor":"Hi! Welcome to HCM! The normal total leukocyte (white blood cells) count ranges from 4000 to 11,000 per microlitre in an adult.White blood cells help protect the body against diseases and fight infections. There are numerous causes for increases in neutrophils, lymphocytes etc. but the most common cause of Leukocytosis is secondary to infection (localized or generalized)or tissue necrosis due to any cause,in your case it can be due to infection in your teeth. The degree of leukocytosis depends upon several factors like its cause, severity of the infection, resistance of the body, localization of the inflammatory process (greater neutrophilic leukocytosis is produced by a localized disease process rather than a generalized one) and modification by treatment.your WBC count is only slightly raised so dont worry.A course of antibiotics will bring it down. take care!"},{"Patient":"My pancrrease may not be working up to  what it should also have gout. What would be best to do ? I was at Dr  last thur. and he prescribed Creon for pancrease and  Uloric for gout.  what is best.  I am 78 my Brother passed almost 2 years ago with cancer of pancreatic also a first cousin passed about 1 year ago.  What can I look for or expect in the future.","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM.You have to be careful for it because you have strong family history.Go for regular screening for condition of pancreas by measuring rbs, s.amylase,s.insulin,usg and even ct-scan abdomem.Avoid any hard drinks if you have habit.Take more liquids and keep proper hydration.Avoid heavy,oily,spicy diet.Take proper sleep and avoid stress.You have to take intravenous hydration during severe episodes.Keep watching for sugar level and ketoacidosis.Go for regular follow up and keep in touch with your doctor."},{"Patient":"yes, i was wondering ... I just vomited A LOT of blood while in the shower... i do smoke cigarettes, about a pack per day and may have breast cancer... also i am a 39 yr old male, smoked for 32 yrs.... anyway what could this mean. it was a mix of dark red and bright red... threw it up 5 times tonight and before this happened, i had chills and felt dizzy and weak...","Doctor":"You vomiting a large amount of blood as is clear from your description could mean one of 2 things, considering your smoking history. Either you have developed stomach ulcers which have now started bleeding. This is quite common in smokers. Or, you have developed stomach cancer which is now bleeding. This is also possible in long term smokers. What you need to do urgently is to see a gastroenterologist and get an endoscopy done through your mouth or nose. That will differentiate between the 2, locate the exact site of bleeding, and if required stop any active bleed. The chills, dizziness and weakness was due to sudden blood loss. You may need a blood transfusion also depending on your hemoglobin.Meanwhile, drink plenty of fluids at room temperature, avoid spicy or fried foods, stop smoking and take Tab Pantoprazole 20mg twice daily."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have two lumps under my right arm in my armpit area. The first lump has been there for about two years. The second lump just appeared in June. I have had two separate ultrasounds on the lumps and both times I have been told nothing is there. I am positive for the BRCA II genetic mutation, so I am at high risk for breast cancer. Sometimes the lumps are sore and today I noticed there is a bit of discoloration. They are palpable and visible to the eye. I am not sure what to do. It is very unsettling to be told nothing is there when I feel these lumps and know they are not going away. Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"It would have helped to have known your age. Anyways, first of all the lump that has been there for 2 years is less likely to be cancerous. However we still need to be sure. May be you have dense breasts and that is the reason the ultrasound has not been able to pick up the lumps. I suggest you get a MRI of both breasts and axilla done. That will definitely pick up any lumps that are there and also comment on the nature of the lumps. If the lumps are palpable, then you can ask your doctor to get a needle test done from the lumps (FNAC), after the MRI has been done. Both these investigations will definitely tell us the exact nature of these lumps. For your BRCA gene mutation, you need to consider one of 3 options. First is a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. This is the most definitive although it does not decrease the risk of cancer to zero but to 5%. Second is close surveillance with 6 monthly clinical examination by an oncologist + six monthly mammogram/ultrasound + yearly MRI. This will pick up any cancer that may develop at an early stage. The third is taking a tablet called Tamoxifen. You need to seriously consider one of these options after discussing with your oncologist."},{"Patient":"my mother in law has just had a biopsy following other tests the consultant has said they are very sure it is cancer it was measured at 14 cms about 3 weeks ago, they have already said it is not possible to operate as there are too many blood vessels that a operation would kill her is this a big tumour we think she has had the lump for about 6 months what is her likely survival rate","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for this query.I am so sorry to hear about this diagnosis and the difficulty operating on this cancer. I can only imagine how difficult it is to imagine your mother in such a terrible stage with very little options left to help her. Please, take heart. show how much love and be the pillar for her as she live these days that non would ever wish to experience. Cancers are of different prognosis depending on the site and organ. Unfortunately, you have not provided the location or organ and this make sit very unlikely to tell you what the survival rate is. What is certain is that if there is no intervention, her days would not be as many any more.I will also like to suggest that you seek a second opinion fro an oncologist. When cancers are this huge, chemotherapy and or radiotherapy can shrink the and make them operable. Ask your doctor to look into this option.I am so sorry about this. may you find the strength to be up to the task and challenges at hand. I wish her the very best of possible outcomes as she takes on this battle.

Sometimes, certain types of cancer seem to run in some families,but only a small portion of all cancers are inherited. You had thyroid growth which was not malignant so nothing to worry.Now for acute and chronic RA,Its true that there is no cure for RA, but treatments can improve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.

My granny has been diagnosed with Moderately Differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma Grade 2 , Site: Esopghagus located in middle 1/3rd. She is 85 years old. The doctor has prescribed Radiology treatment. But my worry is the age of the patient. I don t know whether she can go through the Radiology treatment. I wanted to know more about the treatment for this type of cancer . Please do correspond at the earliest.","Doctor":"Hello Abhiram.ks10, Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.I can understand your concern for your granny. Radiation is the method of treatment of choice for this type of cancers by the conventional medicine. You can ask for the outcome what the doctors expect out of the treatment and the percentage of chances for her to get cured and survive. I am a Homoeopath and so I will be advising you in a different way and it is for you to take the judicious decision about it. According to me your granny must have undergone a shocking psychological conflict at this age almost prior to the development of the stricture of the oesophagus. On examination of the throat for difficulty in swallowing it was found out that oesophagus is having this deformity.   It is said that she had an experience of something that she could not 'swallow'. Now you may go back to her life situations and find out whether she had anything that she could not 'swallow.' Get to know what she felt- whether rejection, indignation, grief, rage, depression etc.- towards this incident. This will tell her genetics. The cause of any cancer is in the mind and is mediated through the brain. Which tissue is to be affected and what should be the type of affection- all these are determined by the 'mind- brain - organ' axis. Give her Homoeopathic constitutional treatment for giving maximum possible longevity of relatively healthful days ahead. Abstain from radiation or any other unnatural surgical procedures.If you so desire, I can help her by taking her case in detail and prescribe for her, her genetic constitutional curative remedy. Give counselling to her in the fashion I explained her disease above and request her to have positive attitudes to the incident and to her present disease condition.With Best Wishes,Dr C. J.

Now onwards, you should not have worries over your disease of cancer. If you go one worrying over your illness, if you are going to ponder over it again and again and if you are too much afraid of it, you are not going to get free from illnesses. I hope you understood why you got cholecystitis now. You should stop being afraid about your illnesses.Cholecystitis is not a major illness. It is only an inflammatory disease and it can go off by itself. If not disappearing, that means your immunity is not improved and you need a treatment that will improve your immunity.

I dohave an appt with a podiatrist this monday, but have been reading up on these tumors. from what I have read, it is stated that in order to keep these fibromas from coming back you have to have not just the tumor removed but also the plantar fasciia as well. If that is done, how will this affect my ability to walk and will I be what would be considered disabled perhaps need assistance walking with a cane?","Doctor":"Fibromatosis of the foot is a non-cancerous condition in which the normal fibrous tissues get thickened. The treatment is linked to the extent of problems that it is causing. If it is extremely painful or debilitating, then you should go ahead with the surgery as surgery is the only curative option available. There are 2 problems with surgery--one it is extensive as you already know and needs removal of adjacent areas, and two there are still chances of recurrence of the disease. Such is the nature of this disease. So, if you are not too troubled by the disease at present, then i suggest you can wait, else go for the surgery. There is definitely going to be some disability after the surgery which may require a splint or cane."},{"Patient":"HiI had a VATS RUL lobectomy in August.

Solitary.Also states: scattered pigmented macrophages in the air spaces and emphysema.  What does all this mean in terms of survival and reoccurence?  Thank you, Coleen","Doctor":"First of all, you did not mention whether you had small cell cancer or not. Both have different treatment algorithms and outcomes. Small cell is generally more aggressive. Also, i would like to know if they removed the nodes or not and if they were involved by tumor or not (this would be in the biopsy report). If they were removed and are negative and the margins of resection are negative for tumor (this would mean that the tumor has been completely removed) then you would be in the 2nd stage (stage IIA technically but high risk due to large tumor size). So, i would recommend that you get further chemotherapy to decrease your chances of recurrence.

The bone marrow examination is done to rule out any hematological(blood) diseases which are common in elder age group. you also need to under go stool for occult blood, complete hemogram, serum iron and transferin saturation to know the type of anaemia and followed by investigations directed towards cause for the same. the bone marrow may fail in elderly but needs repeat testing to find out the exact cause.

CTCL is basically a cancer of the immune system , but I have always been able to complete my treatment before. Every time I finished my antibiotic treatment the bladder infection came back. I have now had nine back to back, UTI s and doctor seems family Doctor seems to not care. I had two Mondays ago a abdominal ultrasound with inter vaginal ultrasound. I have been suffering from stomach bloating and pain. I was aware the past two months that something was interfering with my urine flow. Finally made doctor write the lab orders. Which show a mild plural effusion of my right lung. A 2 cm cyst in my kidney, and a 11 mm change to my endometrial lining in my uterus. He only asked for more testing of my pelvis by MRI, and told me to see my GYN as soon as possible. I will have the results sometime today. But the pain wakes me in the middle of the night like right now.","Doctor":"Hello Cindylanger,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic. As per your query, You have CTCL, Bronchitis, Cystitis, UTI, Stomach bloating, stomach pain, Pleural effusion, Cyst in kidney, Endometrial thickening, Some undignosed gynaecological complaint, Sudden and severe pain that wakes you up in the middle of night etc.. The sad thing about you is that you were and are treating all your physical complaints and none of these medicines cured YOU. I am a Homoeopath and so speaking in a different language which you have not heard about so far. You are not sick because of all these diseases but you get all these diseases because you are sick. By treating each and every one or other diseases you are in no way becoming healthier. On the other hand your health is becoming from bad to worse. This is because, so far YOU are not treated but only your diseases were treated. You got sick because your genetics made you sick. Your genetics made you to think, feel and react in a particular manner. These reactions made physical complaints along with your mental states. No doctor tried to explore your mind. Or for them your mind was not of any importance. In your long query you have not mentioned anything about your mind, your life situations, your mental and physical reactions to them, your family relationships, your social positions, your psychological conflicts through which you have traversed etc. These are the most important factors that made you sick. The chemical drugs and the operative procedures that you were undergoing only suppressed your complaints and made you more sick.It is not too late to come back to natural line of treatment. You are advised to approach an expert Homoeopathic physician at the earliest. If not available in your reachable locality, you can confidently get back to me. I can send to you a case taking format in which you can enter your case in detail and forward it to me. I will help you with the right genetic constitutional remedy.

It took me several months after my Diagnosis to determine what would take away the headaches and fatigue!! many of My Neurologists patients took Percocet and it really helps me to make it through the day!! For the Fatigue I started with Provigil back in 2006 after diagnosis and it made my head very foggy!!! I did not like it at all !!! After trial and error with many different meds, right now, Adderall is the best medicine I have found to help with my Fatigue!!!  I take 3 Percocet a day for my chronic headaches and My Neurologist doesn't want me to take them!!  It is extremely frustrating when you know how the medicine you are taking helps you and your Dr disagrees with you!!!  I also have Anxiety, Panic Attacks, and Depression!! It is very scary when you know with MS you can Debilitate very quickly!! My Neurologist wanted me to go on Gilenya back in 2010, although I did not!! in April I saw my Dr and I was supposed to go on Ticefidera(BG 12) and they were supposed to send in my registration and I never received the medicine!!   The odd thing is that I had Breast Cancer at 29 years old, and I do have the BRCA1 GENE!! My Mom also had Breast Cancer when I was 21 and 5 years later was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer!! In March of 1998 when I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer, My Mom was Dying of Ovarian Cancer!! She lived with the Ovarian Cancer for 4 years and died at the age of 60 after my last round of Chemotherapy( Adriomycin and Cytoxin )! My Aunt also was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer and lived with it For 4 years as well....what I just cannot Conceive is My Neurologist wanting to put me on 2 oral Meds for My MS when they Drastically lower your white blood counts, which I have read in many Articles that if you have had Cancer or have it Presently, One should Never go on that type of Medication... I just am at a loss here and do not know what to do here!!!! The MS Disease appears Invisible on me, which is Good on 1 hand but Extremely Frustrating Because I look fine on the outside most of the time, although have Debilitating Chronic Headaches, known as Suicide Headaches and also the soooo very Frustrating Debilitating Fatigue!! It's very Hard for other people to understand what I go through on  a daily Basis!! I just turned 45 and thankfully I am 15 years out from the Breast Cancer!  ON July 17, 2013, I had my 17th Surgery!!!   I am sooooo tired of Drs telling me what not to take when it works for me,  For Instance the Percocet, 3 tablets a day!! It's my body and I've been through hell and back and I only know how I feel, no one else!! Especially with MS, each Individual with it is very different!! I am just tired and angry and frustrated!  What can I do?? I have been suffering for years and I Research constantly about what other patients with my symptoms are taking and not one medicine is good for each individual!!! So, my question is what do!!!","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic. I feel really sorry for you for taking a lot of chemical drugs for a long period in your past life. I feel for sure that these drugs have made all your problems from bad to worse.I am a Homoeopath and I do not know how you will take my advice. You are wrongly under the belief that your health is very much depending on the drugs you take. No it is not like that. You can make you healthy by thinking in the right way. Your individualistic features, your constitutional peculiarities and your genetic inheritances make you think in these wrong ways. YOU are in a wrong track and I think it is not too late to come back to the natural line of thinking about your health and disease. You have written a lot about your diseases and the drugs taken so far. But you have not mentioned anything about your genetics, hereditary disease tendencies, life situations, your physical and mental reactions against them etc. Body and mind speak the same language.If your body is sick your mind also is sick. You can make changes in the mind and then you will see that your body also becomes healthier. My advice to is to reduce the drugs gradually and to stop at the earliest. In the mean time you have to approach an expert Homoeopathic physician who can cure you. Cure in your case is to offer better health than the present. If not able to find an expert Homoeopath in your reachable locality, you can get back to me with your detailed case. I can even send to you a case record format on request in which you can develop your case and forward that to me. After studying your case I can help you with the right genetic constitutional remedy that will rapidly and permanently cure you and will offer many more years of healthy life in future.If you opt for Homoeopathic treatment, get back to me.With Best wishes, Dr. C.

NEVER EVER ALLOWED TO TAKE ESTROGEN I AM VERY DRY; I DO USE VAGISIL BUT THAT DOES NOT HELP WITH INTERCOURSE I will check with family dr not willing to pay for this info on line","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.The breast cancer has nothing to do with the present complaint. But the hysterectomy procedure must have caused some strictures or adhesions in the part which make you hurt during intercourse. You did not mention about your age. This is important for understanding your sexual life and the painful intercourse. If you are dry , it surely means your mind is involved. If your mind is not prepared for the sex and if the fore play is not going warm you may experience the dryness. Even the after effects  of hysterectomy in the physical level will not produce this dryness.Therefore, it becomes imperative to explore your mind. The psychological conflict that preceded the breast cancer and the causes for the hysterectomy are all important. Your psychological attitude to life, sex relations etc are also becoming important. Dropping of bladder may cause discomfort during intercourse but it will not cause pain for you. My advice to you is to undergo Homoeopathic treatment where your mind and body symptoms will be studied and a curative remedy will be prescribed for you. Therefore approach an expert Homoeopathic physician at the earliest. If not possible for you to find an expert you can get back to me with the details. You have to give me in detail about your life situations, your mental and physical reactions to them etc. I can even assist you to prepare your case by sending a case taking format on request.With Best wishes, Dr. C.

I am very concerned about this. Before having anal intercourse my anus was itchy and sometimes there was a little red blood on the toilet paper but I think it was because I wiped too hard. It is now hurting when I sit down and I feel like there is a mass in my anus. I am so worried that it is something like Anal Cancer . I do suffer from IBS though by the way. Please Help!","Doctor":"It is highly unlikely to be anal cancer by the picture that you have given. It is more likely to be a localised infection which got aggravated by the intercourse. I would suggest you to take a tub full of warm water, put a tablet of potassium permanganate in it and sit in the tub for 15 minutes thrice daily. Also take Tab ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily and apply ointment nitroglycerine (just a small amount) at the anal opening before passing stools. Avoid constipation and anal intercourse.

She lived a year longer than the prognosis amount of time, but could giving her this much morphine have caused her to die sooner, and would she have been in severe pain had we not done this?","Doctor":"Please dont be concerned over the usage of morphine in your mother. It is customary and justified to give morphine to terminally ill cancer patients as cancer related pain is generally not amenable to any other form of therapy. The most important thing to remember while treating these patients is that they should be as comfortable as possible in their last days and pain relief is an important part. You and the hospice did the right thing by giving her morphine else she would have been in agony"},{"Patient":"My e mail i.d. is as given below.

Primary surgery followed by postoperative radiation therapy is the tretment of choice.Surgical excision of the primary lesion and ipsilateral neck dissection are done. Reconstruction are done using  masseter muscle flap or tongue flap. Postoperatively, most patients (90%) received radiation therapy (51–58 Gy) to the primary side and neck. Adjuvant chemotherapy is offered if histologic signs of aggressive behavior are identified . SCC of retromolar trigone is considered as an aggressive and insidious tumor. The reconstruction of the deficit of the anterior faucial pillar–retromolar area with masseter muscle flap is a reliable, safe and absolutely functional method.Regards and take care"},{"Patient":"Very worried about daughter (33 yrs old) with following symptoms: constant nausea , cannot eat more than one or two bites & feels full, stomach (top) pain & tenderness, has started seeing blood in stool , constipation has turned to diarrhea.... endoscopy has been scheduled for 8-7-12.

They have been removed and there is no sign of cancer anywhere else. My questions are: How long does the virus stay in your body?

If so, is cancer likely to recur? am I at a higher risk of cancer myself now? Thankyou","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is transmitted by sexual route and by oral route.The virus causes cancer after 10-15 years of infection.Once infected, the virus stays in the body.There is no drug or vaccine to get rid of the virus from the body.However, preventive measures can be taken.In your husband;s case who has been treated of the cancer, any appearance of new ulcer, proliferative lesion or lymph node should be investigated.As in your case, get pap test regularly.pap test is done to detect any cancer changes in the cervix.Cancer of cervix is more often associated with HPV infection as compared to oral cancers.Avoid multiple sexual partners and practice safe sex.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I have  stage III colon cancer and have had surgery.

I suggest to my patients, especially when there are nodules in the liver, to get a complete review of the liver function and structure. The opinion of a gastroenterologist/hepatollogist is usually very helpful. It is not the right thing at this point to discontinue treatment for colon cancer. This could lead to relapse and facilitate spread to other areas. A complete review by your treating physician and the gastroenterologist's opinion, to me are very important.

Exercise, vegetable, fruits and drinking a lot of water is an attitude advisable to be adopted.The main fear with the morphine you are taking is that of addiction.

Taking feeds through this pipe is a simple task that can easily be learned by the relatives. All one needs to do is to connect the feeding bag to the tube and let the feed run slowly. At the end to flush it with plain water. The patient should be sitting during and a little while after the feed. The only possible complication is that it may come out accidentally when it will have to be replaced which is a simple task again. The tube that goes through the stomach is called PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). It is a specialised procedure done by the endoscopist and is much more complicated. Since it is coming out of the abdomen there are a number of complications that can occur like leak, bleed, pain, dislocation. These are difficult for the relatives to manage and so require specialized care."},{"Patient":"i took a photo of my son today and after posting it on facebook had a message from a friend telling me to get his eyes checked coz one of his eyes is reflecting a funny colour i looked it up and it can be a symptom of eye cancer and now im panicked how do i tell the difference between normal photo reflections and an actual problem??","Doctor":"A common symptom of eye cancer is a white pupil in one or both eyes. This is called leucocoria and in children can be because of an eye tumor called retinoblastoma. However, other color changes are not so significant in terms of cancer. Since you have seen this in a photo, i suggest you see his eye yourself in normal white light and see if you can make out any difference. If not then be rest assured, its nothing but a camera thing. If you do see a difference, there is no harm seeing an eye specialist. It may be something other than cancer."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have hypothyroid . I have been on Armour thyroid for some time.

Really hurts right below my chin . It is painful to swallow and feels like when I do, everything is going to the right side. I am also hearing a popping and fizzing noise that seems to be around my thyroid. I had a blood test on Friday, but have gotten no results yet. Is it possible it is cancer? Would the blood test show anything or should I ask for an ultrasound?","Doctor":"The symptoms that you have related dont seem to be related to your thyroid disorder. Rather, the problem seems to be within your throat. It could be a simple infection or it could be something sinister. Your symptoms are common to both cancer and acute infections. If your symptoms have been there for sometime now or if you are a smoker/tobacco chewer/alcohol abuser then i suggest you visit an ENT specialist or a cancer surgeon and get an endoscopy done (laryngoscopy). If not you can take a course of antibiotics for a week (Tab Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily + Tab fexofenadine 120mg twice daily). Also take lots of water and do warm saline gargles twice daily.

Can you help with any information?","Doctor":"The picture you have described seems to suggest that your relative has a cancerous lymph node in the neck. Lymph nodes are glands normally found in all parts of the body. They become cancerous not by themselves but when there is cancer in their neighbourhood. So, the root of the actual cancer must be somewhere else (voice box, food pipe, thyroid, lungs etc). It is possible for a patient to have such a node for long particularly in slow growing tumors. All i can say is that had she sought treatment earlier she might have been detected at an early stage and cured. It is beacause she has harboured the disease for so long that it has reached the terminal stage.

If that is absolutely normal, then you can follow up with your doctor, initially at monthly intervals and later 3 monthly till the discharge persists. At each visit, repeat the mammo and cytology.

The symptoms that you have described look more like an acute vaginal infection. So, take Tab Fluconazole 150mg twice daily and place a Clotrimazole pessary daily into your vagina for 5 days.

The falling Hb is probably related to your prostate cancer since it may have spread to your bone marrow (the place where all blood components are made). this is even more likely since you stopped Lupron in between. I would strongly advise you to not discontinue Lupron and to keep your testosterone levels as low as possible. That alone can keep your cancer in control. I would have liked to know your PSA level which i hope are being done regularly. They are a direct indicator of the level of your cancer. If your PSA is normal on Lupron, you dont need to take Zytiga."},{"Patient":"I had breast cancer 2 years ago, one lymph node was positive. I had lumpectomy , axillary clearance, 8 rounds of chemo and 30 radio. I now have a lump on my neck, on the same side as my cancer, about an inch in diameter, its just below my ear but not exactly on my jawline, I noticed it a few weeks ago, but I m not sure exactly how long ago.","Doctor":"The lump that you describe is possibly a lymph node in the upper part of the neck. Lymph nodes are present in all parts of our body and get enlarged due to infection or cancer in the draining area. Now, the area that you have described is not part of the normal draining pattern of breast cancer. Had it been in the lower part of the neck i would have been more worried. Another possibility is that it may be an enlargement of the parotid gland ( a gland that produces saliva and is present in the neighbourhood of the ear). It can be enlarged in a variety of conditions including cancer. In short, you need to see your oncologist to ascertain which of the two it is. He will have to get a needle test done to decide upon its nature (FNAC). Meanwhile you can start yourself on Tab Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for 5 days to take care of an infective etiology."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My dad was diagnosed with HCC and is at stage 4 now. He has stopped nexavar since it stops working for him. He s on Tarceva . He has mestasized as well. He has ascites and swollen feet for over 2 weeks now. He often gets severe stomach pain at night around his abdominal area. The pain is not confined to the right side but over the whole area of the stomach. Do you speculate its the ascites pain and not the cancer pain? Although he was given diuretics but didnt quite help. Do you recommend him for fluid suction? What other advice do you have for him? His doctor told him to restrict his protein intake but he s not compliant. Just las few days, he s been having periodic upper body numbness which goes away after 5 minutes. Any idea what s happening here?? thanks","Doctor":"Your dad is basically starting to have symptoms of liver failure. Probably, most of his liver has been replaced by cancer and whatever little is remaining is not sufficient to sustain normal body functions. When the liver fails, it leads to accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and lower limbs. Simple remedies can help alleviate his symptoms partly. Taking a low protein diet is very important as any proteins that we take are metabolized by the liver, putting more stress on the already failing liver. If he is not a diabetic taking more of simple carbohydrates (sugars) will also help as such a diet gives rest to the liver reducing its burden. Keep a pillow or two underneath his feet to keep them elevated to help drain the fluid with gravity. The abdominal pain is definitely due to the fluid and if it is too distressing then you should get it drained periodically. Another option is placing a peritoneovenous shunt, which will continuously keep draining the fluid from his abdomen into his circulation. But that is an operative procedure and he may not be fit for the surgery. Liver transplant is out of the question in his present state. I am sorry to say, but he does not have very long to live and all efforts should be to make him as comfortable as possible in his last days."},{"Patient":"Hello, can you help? I have a permanent stoma following bowel cancer in 2007 (and then 6 mnths of chemo ) for over a yr i have had awful foul smelling vaginal discharge esp. during sex. Dr s thought it was BV, but 2 tests prove not so. My Dr now thinks it could be a rectovaginal fistula . My question is if i get pregnant ( actively trying), will the fistula afftect pregnancy or labour? thanks","Doctor":"If you have a permanent stoma and your doctor thinks that you have a rectovaginal fistula, the first thing that you need to exclude is a recurrence of your cancer as such a fistula should  not normally form in the presence of the stoma. For that you should get a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan done. If it is normal only then should we be talking about pregnancy, else you will have to start on treatment for the recurrence. To answer your question, a rectovaginal fistula will definitely affect your pregnancy as it is a constant source of infection to your vagina from where the infection is likely to ascend to the uterus leading to a number of complications like miscarriage, infected liquor, fetal distress etc. It is not advisable for you to get pregnant till the fistula is taken care of."},{"Patient":"hi, I was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of tongue .

I also have tenderness over the same side of the neck. The pain is not constant, it is aggravated by chewing. I have started going to work now but i never have any pain while at work. I usually get the pain while at home in the afternoons and also early in the morning. what coukd be the probable causes of this pain.","Doctor":"There could be a number of reasons for your pain and a thorough clinical examination is necessary to rule them out one by one. It could be simply related to your surgery and radiation therapy as it can sometimes lead to inflammation of the nerves in this area leading to a neuritic pain that commonly radiates to the ear. It could be a local infection in the operated site compounded by the radiation. Worst possible, it could be a recurrence of your cancer. I would have liked to know the stage of your cancer as that would have helped me assess the risk of recurrence. I suggest you start on Tab Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily + Tab Paracetamol 650mg thrice daily + Tab Ranitidine 150mg twice daily + Tab Gabapentin 1 tab twice daily. That should take care of the pain and infection.

Normally, the first step in the treatment of endometrial cancer is surgery. I this we remove the uterus, both tubes, both ovaries, bilateral pelvic nodes and take a number of samples from various parts of the abdomen. We also take washings from the abdomen surface and send it for cytology testing. This is called a staging laparotomy as this not only is part of the treatment, it also gives the exact stage of the cancer. Depending on the final stage that comes after surgery, she may require postoperative radiotherapy. There is nor role of chemotherapy in endometrial cancer except in the last stage for palliation.

I should mention also his potassium levels are 5.7 do you have any idea why all of a sudden he is having heart palpitAtions and why does he feel it only at night it on aff","Doctor":"First of all, boron, to the best of my scientific knowledge has no role in the treatment of kidney cancer. So, you should check with your oncologist as to the reason why he has been put on it. The palpitations that he is having seem to be related to the increased potassium levels that he is having as a result of poor kidney function. It is important to bring down the potassium levels as any further increase can be life threatening. He can take potassium binding resins orally (K-Bind). That should take care of the immediate threat. Meanwhile, avoid taking any drugs that affect the kidney. The treatment of the kidney cancer also needs to be revised. There are a number of other options available like Sorafenib or Temsirolimus and these need to be discussed with your oncologist before starting."},{"Patient":"Dear sir Last year i had a radical Nephractomy -kiney - adrenal gland removal due to cancer -stage one Recently i had a low blood platelet coun +- 140 .

They are more associated with your urinary bladder where the urine is store before micturition. There are a number of possibilities. It could be a chronic bladder infection, a stone, or worst cancer in the urinary bladder. Certain types of kidney cancers are associated with bladder cancers. These are called transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). If your kidney tumor was a TCC, then the likelihood of a bladder cancer is there. I suggest you get an ultrasound of the abdomen done which should show any such tumor. Also, a cystoscopy (endoscopy through the urinary opening) is advisable. Prostate cancer is a possibility although lower down the cards. If you are above 70 years of age then the risk increases for prostate cancer, in which case you should also get a blood test done called serum PSA."},{"Patient":"sir this is for my.uncle. the result i got after his test :- specimen: is floor of mouth clinical diagnosis shows:- ulcer left side of frenum in the floor mouth. macroscopic examination shows one small brownish white soft tissue .all embeded..microscopic examination shows: given hyperparakeratinised stratified squamous epithelium with dyplasic features..

In that case you will have to undergo surgery for ovarian cancer by a cancer surgeon. If it is normal, then the chances of you having ovarian cancer are much less (though not zero)., in which case you should repeat the CT scan after 2-3 months.

The MRI/CT will tell us whether the disease has spread out of the prostate or not and the bone scan will tell us if it has spread to the bones.A chest x-ray should also have been done to rule out spread to the lungs. If the disease is confined to the prostate and has not spread anywhere then a removal of the prostate by a cancer surgeon is advisable as the chances of cure with this surgery near 90%. However, that will put an end to his sex life as you already know. If he is absolutely adamant not to undergo surgery, then the only option available is radiotherapy plus hormone therapy.

I have one concern which I ve never really dealt with which after talking to my mom I would like to get more information. Periodically (maybe once every 1 or 2 months?) I get a very bad pain in the middle or end of my bowel movement . It usually lasts no more than a few minutes but it is a very nauseating pain.

The pain that you have described is typical of ureteric stones. In order to confirm this you need to get an ultrasound abdomen and x-ray KUB (kidney ureter bladder). Get these done fasting in the morning. In the evening before take 2 Dulcolax tablets and 4 activated charcoal tablets so your bowels are empty. Your problem does not seem to be related to bowel.

She has a little hole on her left side of her stomach and it leaks water. i am worried what this could be. She is overseas and i cant see her. can you please help me and give me some answers.","Doctor":"You have given a very sketchy picture for me to give you a reasonable explanation. This is probably because you are in different countries and i understand. From what i can make out, the doctors must have found masses in one or both ovaries and thought that it was ovarian cancer and operated upon her. During or after the operation they found out that the masses in the ovaries were not due to ovarian cancer but due to pancreatic cancer spreading to the ovaries. Also, there was fluid in her abdomen which means that the cancer had already spread to other parts of the abdomen. Presently she probably has a drain tube in the side which keeps draining this fluid. If this is the correct picture then i am afraid to say, but your mother is suffering from last stage pancreatic cancer which has an extremely poor prognosis and a survival ranging in months. The only treatment option is chemotherapy and that too is palliative.

I do not think she is taking any Rx for the cancer. She seems more scared about heart issues. What would you guess about her life expectancy range now at age 62?","Doctor":"Basically your mother is suffering from breast cancer which has been operated upon and she is a known patient of heart disease for which she has been stented. The biopsy shows that atleast one node has tumor. Ideally in such a situation i would recommend chemotherapy to her. But that she cant take safely due to her heart condition. What i would like to know before i can comment upon her survival is the size of the tumor that was removed and whether it has spread to other parts of the body ( on chest x-ray, ultrasound abdomen, bone scan). If its an early tumor (less than 5cm in size, not spread), then the chances of her being cured just with surgery are nearly 80%. We can further improve these chances by knowing her receptor status. This test can be done on the tumor that has already been removed and is called ER (Estrogen receptor) and PR (progesterone receptor). If any of these are positive then she can be placed on a tablet for 5 years. This tablet will not affect her heart and decrease the chances of disease recurrence by almost 33%."},{"Patient":"if nutrolin b is effect for triedness due to loose motion","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for writing to Health Care MagicMost important part in the management of diarrhea is fluid replacement therapy followed by nutritional management and anti-diarrheal drug treatment.It is very important that you should take Oral rehydration therapy (ORS) after evaluating the dehydration status.Regarding Nutrolin B, it is a probiotic.

Had wrapped around organs like a spider web and they were all bound together along with a huge cyst that was matted to intestine. I was aware of cyst, but no doctor could detect the adhesions with previous MRI, 6 CT's, endoscopy or colonoscopy.

Is there anything I can do  to help her through this, I visit her each day, should I maybe go every other day or what. I need some help, Please","Doctor":"Hi, as you mentioned your mother has dementia, emotional outburst is common in this disease. the only way is to take a treatment for dementia with a good neurologist and make her feel comforable. the presence of lung cancer also make her deppresed and which will add to the emotional outburst. so if you have a biopsy of the lung cancer lesion, can go for EGFR testing. if it comes positive she may be started on oral tablets with TKI inhibitor with medical oncologist opinion. she may also need counselling with antidepressants. try to continue meeting her every day till some these medications take action and then gradually you can reduce the number of visits."},{"Patient":"My 45 year old sister just got diagnosed with colon cancer and showed no symptoms.

I sometimes tend to be a hypochondriac and I have convinced myself that I have it too.  Should I panic?","Doctor":"Hi, you have a symptom of passing blood clots which is not due to hemmoroids. intermittent passage of blood can happen in hemorroids or cancer.but cancer may also have other symptoms like palpable mass in abdoman, constipation, weight loss but these may not be in all the cases. you have to under go colonoscopy to rule out the possibality of a colon cancer as your sister already have the same."},{"Patient":"hi, i just got to know from my breast ultrasound reports that i have a well defined cystic area measuring approx. 4.4mm. is seen in the dermis layer of the sin of the left axillary region. both breast show predominantly fibro grandular parenchyma. there is no evidence of any Sol/ Architectural distortion/ calcification . both nipple, reteroareolar region, skin,subcutaneous tissues and axillary tail region are normal. i am 23 years old female and i went to the gynaecologist yesterday in order to check if i had breast cancer . i was very scared because from last 4 months i had some pimple sort of thing on my left underarm . also i felt some burning pain on my left breast and on the underarm too. i also have spondolysis symptoms so i have the pain on th eentire left side. please tell me is it related to any cancer. i am very scared.","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am,Sorry to hear about your problem. The breast ultrasound report appears to be absolutely normal. The pimple which you have described under the armpit (axilla) is probably an infected sebaceous cyst (infection of the hair follicle) and will subside with time. If it is inflamed and not settling, you can take a course of antibiotic. There are no symptoms suggestive of cancer but you should continue to do breast self examination regularly.Hoping for the best.

My doctor referred me to a larger city specialist.  This specialist said it had to come out.  His schedule did not allow for as early a surgery as his colleague.  I was booked for surgery, travelled to the larger centre, went through some more testing nd finally met the surgeon who was doing the surgery the next morning.  She stated that she had decided to cancel the surgery and just monitor the growth.  I was upset for I did not want this thing left to grow inside.  A biopsy was done.  I did not get the results for 6 weeks and then only because my original doctor kept calling for results.  There were some begnein cells but also some questionable cells so that the report said a diagnosis could not be certain.  I was again told I was put on the OR list.  After 2 weeks of trying to reach the surgeon, she finally called me.  She told me that she had again taken me off the surgery list and wanted to watch this growth and that I would have to fly to this big centre in 3 months for a scan.  She was quite condescending about my doctor and our local imaging people's ability.  I am getting a lot of mixed messages from her.  My local doctor wants this thing out, so do I but she wants to wait and watch it.  I am very nervous that this will turn bad.  She says there is no chance of that happening.  I have a family history of cancer.  My mother, grandmother and everyone on my mother's side have died from cancer, 2 of them from pancreatic cancer.  She cannot understand why I am worried about this and thinks I just want some surgery.  My question is, do I have a reason to worry, do I push to have this growth taken out now.  She did say that she would do it if I insisted.  If she agrees to do it, can I trust her?Hope you can help me decide if I should push this and if yes, how do I go about it.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.i dont htink you need surgery at this point. cysts and cancer are usually easily diagnosed by imaging techniques.  Also some tumor markers can help to evaluiate this. If this was cancer it would already show aggresivity in these 6 weeks since pancreatic tumors are infiltrative. all you need is frequent follow up to se cyst size progression.Wish you good health.

I woke up this morning and it had doubled in size. It is now almost 3 1/2 inches x 1inch. I've also started having night sweats since the lump appeared. I was on 4 different courses of antibiotics over the summer for a bacterial infection in my throat. I'm a 35 year old female. My brother had large b cell lymphoma. Should I go back to my Dr for this? Or is it because I was sick all summer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.A lymphnode in your neck which has been there since 3 months and is increasing in size must be investigated even if its painless.The history of B cell lymphoma in your brother makes it all the more important.

The reason for you abdomen feel heavy is your weight as 5 weeks pregnancy would not cause increase in abdominal girth to the extent that you will feel heavy .Feeling heavy and full could not be symptoms of ovarian cancer. Most probably your HCG (you have mentioned “high” probably a spelling mistake) levels are rising which are do not rise in ovarian cancer but commonly  hydatidiform mole a benign condition but if timely intervention not done can change into malignant condition caled as choriocarcinoma.I would suggest you to remain on regular follow up of gynecologist. Asking any question which pertains to your health is not irrational. You can discuss your issue at length with your physician.

He has never looked at my wound or giving me any cancer treatments.  I do not even know if they got all of the cancer.  What should I do???","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for this query.I am sorry to hear about your battle with breast cancer and the healing wounds. I can only wish you the best of outcomes here.Back to your worry, I would suggest that you take an appointment and ask your doctor what the pathology readings from samples obtained during surgery showed. this is because, in cases of surgery for cancer, we send specimens to the lab of a more detailed reading that would help guide management. I very much hope this was done with you. Also, ask him what are the next plans about your treatment and when is that going to start.As for the wound care, surgeons don't really return to do routine wound care unless there is a complication. As for me, I am always updated on the progress and only called in to evaluate especially when something worrisome comes up. I strongly think that he has not come because you have not had anything which seems out of the normal that requires extra care.I hope this helps. I wish you the very best of possible outcomes.

No coughing at night, mainly in the morning caused by this terrible constant tickle in the throat. Could lung cancer cause a tickle sensation in the throat and a constant need to clear the throat? I recently had sinusitus with a really bad cough and headaches. I had a ct scan on my brain as the headaches went on for weeks but it was all clear. I dont feel like my nose is leaking at the back of my throat, as in post nasal drip thats why im paranoid about lung cancer. Would i have any other symptoms with lung cancer? I had a chest xray about a year ago for another condition but it was all clear.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M. Forum. Don't be in panic , as last year your lung X ray  was within normal limit , so need not to worry. You are so scared about cancer that you are not thinking more than this.Cough with ticking in the throat may be due to ,1 Asthmatic allergic bronchitis as this develops sticky mucus ( due to added infection after allergy) and when it expels from lungs then it stick in throat and you feel such type of tickling . This is not a post nasal discharge but mucus sticky in nature . This is the most common symptom in asthmatic allergic patient. Early in the morning cough ( due to decrease in the temperature ) is an indication of asthmatic allergic bronchitis. 2 Tuberculosis , can be confirmed by X ray ( fresh ) and consult a physician and get his opinion. However early tubercular lesion may be . 3 Cancer least possibility but fresh X ray and  MRI will find out the exact nature of disease. As all symptoms  resembles like asthma , so consultation with a physician will help. Good luck. Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"I am a 40yr old female who had breast cancer in 2009. All treatments are now complete. For 10 wks I have had a constant stitch type pain in my left side under my rib cage. Some of my symptoms include black stools (only lasted 4 days) blood and mucus in my stools (lasted a wk) stools now normal. I have nausea n feel full quickly. I have pain around the middle of my back. Pain in my side is worse after eating and when lying down. Have been to doctor, tested so far for ulcer and helicobacter which are negative. Any ideas?","Doctor":"I would have liked to know the stage of your initial cancer and the treatment which you have undergone. If the pain is on the same side as the surgery then it could be related to the surgery itself and taking a painkiller should suffice. If it is on the opposite side or if it is not being relieved with painkillers then we need to investigate. A simple x-ray chest should be enough for the moment and will tell us if this is disease recurrence. The black stools are most probably because of stomach ulcers which are quite common. For that you should start Tab Pantoprazole 20mg twice daily for a month atleast + Syp Mucaine gel 2 tsf thrice daily. That should take care of the problem. Helicobacter Pylori is not positive in all ulcers."},{"Patient":"I am scheduled to have a breast core biopsy done this Friday for a 6mm nodule found on ultrasound, I have had bloody discharge twice in a period of 1 year. The Ultrasound is characterizing it at BIRAD 4 twice in a 6 month period , I have breast pain as if the breast had broken glass in it. Only breast cancer in family was in my aunt. What are the concerns I should have,,,the obvious is of coarse cancer","Doctor":"Bloody discharge from the nipple alongwith a lump on ultrasound and a family history of breast cancer are all ominous signs for you having cancer in the breast. BIRADS 4 means that the chances of the lump having cancer are in the vicinity of 60-70% and the least you need to do is get a biopsy. Problem is that to do a core needle biopsy from a 6mm lump is technically difficult. If the biopsy is done successfully and returns a diagnosis, then it is alright, but if it misses the lump (in which case the biopsy report will show only normal breast tissue), i would suggest you get operated to remove the lump and send the entire lump for diagnosis. That has a dual benefit. One it will give a conclusive diagnosis and two, it will remove the chances of this lump developing cancer later on. Even if it turns out to be cancer in the biopsy, it is at a very early stage and you shouldnt worry as you will completely get cured with proper treatment."},{"Patient":"My mother recently diagnosed with metastized cancer stage IV.

I also had I-131 iodine treatment. This was in 2010. About 8 months ago I developed Sialolithiasis on the left side. Was treated with antibiotics and was taught how to massage parotid gland which has helped. Now I have developed a knot just below my submandibular gland on the right side. I was told it was a drooping of the submandibular gland due to my age which is 59. I was told this had nothing to do with my cancer or the removal of the thyroid. I have been looking up a forum to this nature which suggest otherwise. Multiple people have commented and their situation is like mine or very similar. Has there been any studies that might be a link between thyroidectomies or cancer with the salivary glands in particular the submandibular glands. I really feel uncomfortable with my situation. I have had a CT with contrast done which came back normal. Can you advise me what to do or give me your opinion.","Doctor":"Your problem is not related to your cancer or to the surgery. They have nothing to do with your present condition. However, they are related to the I-131 treatment that you took. It is known to cause decreased saliva production in both parotid and submandibular glands in a small percentage of patients. This leads to thickened saliva leading to stones or sialolithiasis, swelling of glands, retained secretions, dry mouth. If the submandibular gland is just prominent and is not causing you any trouble otherwise (pain etc), then i would suggest you to ignore it. Also, since the CT scan is normal, the likelihood of this being disease is remote. Other measures that you can take is to keep your mouth wet by using artificial saliva sprays. There is a possibility of stones forming in other salivary glands in which case they will have to be removed. Rest assured, it is not related to your disease."},{"Patient":"I am going to run this by you to see if you have any suggestions. My brother is a family physician and either he doesn't believe my mom or he just doesn't know what is causing this. She has also seen a gastroenterologist and her colonoscopy found slight diverticulitis and 2 non cancerous polyps that were removed and no problems found with the endoscopy other than she had a slight inflammation at the top of her stomach that the physician didn't seem too worried about. This is her symptoms... She complains of a severe tightness around her rib cage to the point where she has to take off her bra and has trouble breathing. She also gets bloated sometimes when this happens. I can't stand to see her in pain like this anymore. I did a search on the Internet, (yes, I know you guys hate armchair doctors.. Lol) and it seems a lot of people complain about this but have no answers. A bit on her background- she is 80 years old. She's a diabetic. We thought the metforman was causing the pain so they put her on lantus and humalog. I know diabetes can cause peripheral nerve damage, not sure if that can cause the tightening. She also has had her left kidney removed because the artery that carried the blood to it got clogged and it failed, so they removed it 12 years ago. She also had two stints put in her left and right illiacs to open them as well. She recently had an MRA, and they found two of the 3 main arteries to the bowels are become blocked, but the physician didn't seem to think this would cause tightening, but chronic diarrhea, which she does not have. This all started after she had the flu last January. She has not visited any foreign country recently, so I don't think it's a parasite. I read that maybe she should have a stool sample to check for parasites. Have you heard of this condition? Any of you? Any suggestions on what to try? I am at my wits end. She lays in her bed and moans when this happens and she's not a complainer so I know it's bad. Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"The picture that you have portrayed seems to be more in favour of a heart related problem than anything else. It is not explained by any of the problems that you have cited, namely, polyps in the colon, diverticulitis. She has a history of blockage in various arteries-kidney, small bowel, iliacs. So she probably has a tendency to excessive clotting. She may have had blockage in one of the arteries supplying the heart and suffered from a mild heart attack.

Also, after removal of thyroid cancer, it is routine to get thyroid scans done to ensure that there is no cancer remaining in the body. Since you have not mentioned any such thing, probably it has not been done. If no scans have been done, then it is possible that your brother is suffering from a recurrence of his cancer which i would say is good news since it can be treated with medicines. So, i suggest you get a thyroid scan done on your brother. If it shows disease in the brain, then that explains everything and the cancer can be ablated with tablets (radioiodine). If the scan is normal, then it is unlikely to be related to the thyroid cancer, and you need to consult a neurologist."},{"Patient":"I just had my thyroid removed as it was cancerous. after 6 weeks, my tsh level is 8.61, my calcium is 2.23 and phosperous is 1.02. I have been stressed this past week and not taken my calcium pills which would explain the low level of calcium and phosperous. I am concerned about the TSH level being so high. I feel fine. I have not gained or lost any weight. the only abnormality is that my period has been spotty. What do you think?","Doctor":"It would have helped had you told me if your entire thyroid was removed or only half. Since it was cancerous it is more likely that the whole thyroid was removed. Normally, after removing the thyroid for cancer, a thyroid scan is done 6 weeks later to confirm that the entire cancer has been removed and if any is remaining to destroy it with medicines. It is only after this scan that Tab Thyroxine is started (the thyroid hormone that you will have to take for life) and the dose is titrated over a period of months to make the TSH normal. If you have not been given thyroxine because you are scheduled for a scan then the spotty periods and high TSH are normal as they are both features of a subnormal thyroid state. They are not related to your cancer and nothing to worry about. If you are not scheduled for a scan, talk to your doctor and get one. If you are already on thyroxine and the scan has been done, then the dose needs to be increased."},{"Patient":"My husband is stage4 metasatic prostate cancer . Has COPD , high blood pressure.

Does this sound like pnuemonia to you? He has had shortness of breath from COPD but this is worse and sudden.

Presence of metastatic disease in the lungs is also possible which can compound the problem. Either way, the treatment remains the same. Preferably the treatment should be in a hospital, but if you need to treat him at home, then you should start him on antibiotics (Tab Coamoxiclav 625mg twice daily + Tab Linezolid 600mg twice daily), nebulization with salbutamol and budecort thrice daily (nebulizer is a small easily available instrument at any pharmacist and is easy to use).

The only option available to you in order to avoid a repeat biopsy is to get the slides and blocks from the lab where the first biopsy was sent and get them to your new doctor. That way he can get those slides reviewed at his own lab and come to the diagnosis. If for any reason this is also not possible then you should go ahead for the repeat biopsy without delay.

Lifting a baby generally will not cause anything like a hernia. It must be that the healing process  is continuing and you had a little muscle irritation.Hernia surely needs to be ruled out if there is any swelling which increases on coughing.

But the pain may be due to the thrombosis of the deep veins of leg, which should be diagnosed with doppler examination of lower limbs. planning transplant means you may be having unfavourable cytogenetics. if you dont have a perfect match for transplant, you can ask for MUD(matched unrelated donor) transplant or umbilical cord stem cell transplant. you need to discuss with your hematologist for these options."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, I had high blood pressure 140/94 last week and relatively high heart beat 90 last week.

I s it some kind of kidney infection or lymphoma?","Doctor":"Blood presssure has nothing to do with malignancy.the swellings are very small, <1cms which are not significant. your low back may need pain killers. you also have no other systemic symptoms suggestive of lymphoma. keep a followup of these lymphnodes and see for the increasing size.if increases in size these nodes biopsy should be done. you need to undergo routine urine examination to see for abnormal cells or microorganism followed by urine culture to rule out infection."},{"Patient":"my father has multiple myeloma cancer and is on his 2nd chemo cycle before a donor transplant and has decided to quit cold turkey, the transplant is a haploid and he has already had this for now 3 years, undergoing 2 previous auto stem cell transplants, will discontinuing chemo make him ineligible to do the haploid transplant? His cancer has been extremly aggressive on his back bones and hips. Any advise about his current decision?","Doctor":"Discouraging chemotherapy may make him ineligible for transplant because his disease should be in atleast very good partial response before transplant.as he had already undergone autologous transplant twice, he may be considered for allogenic transplant which will have good graft versus host disease and reduces the chances of recurrence. but the patient should be eligible for transplant. He may also be tried with newer drugs!"},{"Patient":"HI there, my 3 year old son has been having recurring petechiae for the last 3 months, his initial diagnosis was Henoch Sconlein Purpura, with the first incident of petachiae it proceeded a viral infection and rash that he had a week earlier, the petechiae covered his face, neck, upper back and torso and lastly his buttocks and groin , he didn t have many other major complaints apart from vague tummy pain and foot pain (which has been ongoing for some months). His blood and urine was tested and came back normal apart from slight proteinuria and elevated ESR . Over the next month the rash faded and he seemed recovered, until he developed a fever with no other symptoms apart from petechiae on the roof of his mouth and buttocks, again his blood and urine was tested, blood was normal but hematuria and proteinuria was detected, the GP consulted with a paediatrician and another GP who doubted that it was ever HSP, which of course has left us anxious for answers. Over this last month he has had scattered petechiae over his body, a vague limp, on and off tummy pain, mouth pain, with white patches on his inner lips, night sweats and constant hematuria and proteinuria. We are awaiting an appointment at the hospital, but I really wondered what we could be looking at, could it be autoimmune or worst cancer? Kind regards","Doctor":"The viral fever has preceeded the purpura usually as a palpable purpura on the particular sites, suggestive of henoch schonlein purpura. the child blood tests as  you said is normal which rules out blood cancer like leukemias. these leukemias are known to present with purpura, fever and gum bleeding. normal blood tests and no evidence of abnormal cells in the peripheral blood smear or bone marrow rules out the possibility of leukemia. so go ahead with your consultation with a pediatrician for the treatment of HSP."},{"Patient":"My brother have undergone thyroidectomy due to cancerous growth one year ago, after that again undergone surgery two months back due to high level of thyroxine found in blood.

However in order to be sure, you should get an ultrasound of the abdomen done as the urine test maybe falsely negative. It would have helped had you given some more details about the cancer, what stage was it, when did you have it, what surgery did you have, etc. I dont want you to worry unnecessarily, but it is possible that you may have a recurrence of the disease and that can explain all the symptoms.

A possibility of chronic pancreatitis causing hte stool to become, oily and floating can be explained on this.

You are not just suffering from diverticular disease but also polyposis of the colon, a condition in which multiple polyps form in the colon and sometimes in the small bowel. Some of these polyps may with time develop cancer. Your having pain and weight loss are not good signs and more in favour of cancer development. I am assuming that the polyps that have been removed previously were sent for biopsy and that none of them showed cancer. I would advise you to first undergo a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. That will give us a fair idea of what we are dealing with and if there is any evidence of cancer development. Also, a colonoscopy is advisable (before the CT) but only by an experienced gastroenterologist in whose hands it shouldnt be a problem."},{"Patient":"my husband has tongue and neck cancer,he finished his last radiotherapy treatment about a month ago,he has had a scan on his neck abdomen and thorax ,results came back no evidence of collection,can you tell me please what this means as they seem to have found a nodule in his neck of which they have taken a biopsy really worried","Doctor":"Normally tongue cancer is treated with surgery and if required followed by radiotherapy. Only in cancer of the back part of the tongue (called base of tongue) is radiotherapy (RT) the primary treatment. Even in that case, the radiotherapy is generally combined with low dose chemotherapy to enhance the effect of RT. The chemo is deferred only in cases where the patients tolerance and general condition are poor. If that is not the case, then i am afraid to say but your husband has been undertreated. As far as the nodule is concerned, there can be a number of reasons for the nodule, including infection or cancer. But since they have biopsied it, they must have thought it to be cancerous. Also, the fact that he has not been properly treated makes it more likely to be cancer. I am sorry to be worrying you more than you already are, but i'd rather tell you the truth. Wait for the biopsy report and keep your fingers crossed."},{"Patient":"I have had a swollen tongue on the rt side only for 8 months and ct showed enlargement on the rt side so I had a biopsy of the basevof my tongue.

I would have liked to know your age, the number of children you have, if you have breast fed any of them, and if you have any family history of breast or ovary cancer. Either way, any nipple discharge needs to be investigated, although the history that you give is more in favour of an infection rather than cancer. To be certain, i would advise you to get a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of both breast, alongwith cytology testing of the discharge (the lab guy will take your discharge on a glass slide and examine it under a microscope).

Testicular torsion is a condition in which the testis twists on itself and swells up and becomes painful. It is common after sexual  intercourse.

If the ultrasound shows only cyst, then getting it aspirated (with all aseptic precautions else it will get infected) is alright and not going to affect his potency.

I have been keeping my chechup appointments with my gynocologist and oncologist Drs. who did utra sound tests just 3 months back, and told me everything was okay. I had first line treatment and surgery to remove my entire uterus in september of 2010. After which i had 6 rounds of chemotherapy . My question is that did the doctors not see any changes when reviewing my utra sound every three months now that they tell me my tumor is 9X7.5X8 cm adjucent to my vigina cuff. I explored the inside of my vigina and sure enough i felt a growth there. They referred me to an oncologist/gyn who also expolered and found the growth. Now it has been a month and my Dr. hasn t started me on treatment because she has to refer me to another hospital for a biopsy. Would delaying my treatment make my t umor grow more since it took only three months to grow back?","Doctor":"It would have helped if you had told me about the stage of your cancer in 2010 at initial diagnosis. Ovarian cancer is a bad disease and is known to recur. The good thing is that you have had an almost 3 year of disease-free interval which tells me that your cancer was responsive to the chemotherapy (this is called platinum sensitive disease, platinum being the active ingredient of the chemotherapy) and has a much better prognosis than platinum-resistant disease. Hence you should immediately start on the same chemotherapy as before without delay (Carboplatin + Paclitaxel). Any delay is going to allow your tumor to grow and spread to other parts. Biopsy is a simple procedure and can be done at any cancer hospital as an OPD or daycare procedure. So that is no reason to delay your treatment. I dont think it is anybody's fault, just the nature of this cancer and its tendency to recur. You should start chemotherapy immediately and if after chemotherapy there is a residual lesion that can be surgically removed, then you should undergo subsequent surgery as well."},{"Patient":"Hi. Dr. Bhatti, I had pleomorphic adenoma below the right ear, I am going for consultation for it, I think he wants to have it remove, but I am afraid because of the so many facial nerve , do you think any homeopathy treament or other can shrink the tumor , the tumor sometimes feel like a marble, sometimes it is small, it is not painful at all, but by evening, i can feel that my saliva is incresing. Any suggestion?","Doctor":"Pleomorphic adenoma is a tumor of the salivary glands and going by your description, it is in your right parotid gland which is a major salivary gland in the human body. Problems with this tumor if left untreated for long are dual, one it will keep increasing in size and cause pain and disfigurement. Two, it can get converted in to a malignancy (cancer that spreads). For both these reasons, it is advisable for you to get it removed at the earliest. The surgery that is done is called superficial parotidectomy. The only problem with this surgery is the 3-5% risk of injury to the facial nerve. However , this injury is much less likely to occur in the hands of an experienced surgeon who hass been doing it for long. In my practice for example, i have never encountered a permanent postoperative facial nerve injury. So i would suggest you get it done from a cancer surgeon rather than an ENT or general surgeon. Also, there is no other treatment for this tumor in any science. Please dont be misled by people who claim that they can treat you without surgery. They cannot. They will only waste your time and money."},{"Patient":"I m 46 5 7 160 lbs with a muscular arms, legs & gluts, but I have belly fat ! How can I loose weight & keep it off Post Thyroidectomy for Variant Follicular Pappilary Carcinoma ? The cancer is in remission since surgery w/o RAI, regardless I ve also spent 11 of the last 12 ms infected with one thing or another, do you also have immunity advice for women like me ?","Doctor":"I assume that you are on thyroid hormone replacement ever since your surgery. If not, then you should immediately start on Tab Thyroxine 100mcg once daily. The dose will have to be titrated over a few months by getting monthly serum TSH done till it is normal or low. If you are on this medication then your belly fat is less likely to be due to your disease and more due to your diet and habits. However, just to rule out an organic cause, you should get a serum TSH done. If it is normal then you have nothing to worry about. Otherwise you will need to change the dose. If it is high you will have to decrease the dose and vice-versa. Your disease or surgery has no effect on your immunity and i have the same immunity advice for you as the rest--take healthy vitamin rich food, less oil and sugars, excercise daily."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with bacterial infections for over 10 years and am wondering if dr. maybe need to look for something else that could be wrong. I was diagnosed with IBS 2 years ago after having colonoscopy and removal of unremarkable polyps and then diagnosed with cervical cancer this March and also have found cysts on my liver (still waiting for consult regarding liver).","Doctor":"First of all, i would like to know which part of the body are you having bacterial infections in. If it is not a particular site and you have been having infections all over, then you need to rule out two things--Diabetes and HIV infection (both can be ruled out by simple blood tests, blood sugar fasting and post-prandial + serum ELISA for HIV). IBS itself can lead to repeated gastrointestinal infections in which case you might need to be started on medications fro IBS in consult with a Gastroenterologist. You have not mentioned about the treatment you have taken for cervical cancer. If you have taken radiotherapy then that can cause repeated urinary tract infections and rectal infections. Cysts in the liver should not concern you at all as they are benign lesions which dont produce any problems and dont require treatment"},{"Patient":"qus. related to thyroid problem which lead to cancer as suspected by Doc in Kolkata My close relative who is suffering from Thyroid problem which lead her to some sort of Cancer complication as Doc said in Kolkata now what should I do about it?...","Doctor":"As any other organ , Cancer can also affect Thyroid gland and it needs further management earlier the better.In early stage (known after evaluation by surgeon/Oncologist) Thyroid surgery is enough that is followed by further tests like Whole body I131 scan to know if the surgery is complete or not if not further therapy as required is given.But if at the initial stage there is spread to other organs (eg lung, bone or brain) the treatment is not simple it requires multidisciplinary approach eg Surgery with or without RadioIodine therapy (if the same is iodine avid decided by a Whole body Iodine scan)So in your case you need to consult your Surgeon who will guide about the best option available.Hope this helps youwith best wishes Dr Chowhan"},{"Patient":"Hi I had a hysterectomy in 2005 due to cervical cancer in 2010 I had my left ovary removed I have been experiencing pain in my right side had a U/S done 2D Transvaginal and also on my stomach with a full bladder they found a complex 1.5 cm follicle with internal echoes they think it is a hemorrhagic follicle and report also states trace free fluid in the pelvis. Can you tell me what this means.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,The ultrasonography report showing a complex 1.5 cm follicle suggestive of hemorrhagic cyst suggests presence of a cyst in the right ovary (the ovary which is present).Hemorrhagic follicle indicates presence of hemorrhage or bleeding in ovarian follicle.In an ovarian cycle, a number of follicles develop.One of them matures and releases mature ovum at the time of ovulation.After the ovum is released, the ruptured follicle undergoes certain changes.First the follicle undergoes luteinization i.e. deposition of hormone rich cells.These cells release female hormones. The follicle is called corpus luteum at this stage.After this stage, hemorrhage takes place in the corpus luteum. Sometimes the follicle may enlarge and hemorrhage may be more than normal.This may cause abdominal pain.Conversely, a follicular cyst may undergo hemorrhagic change. This cyst can also cause similar symptoms.Whatever may be the cause of formation of the hemorrhagic cyst, both of them are benign for all practical purposes.Free fluid in the pelvis can be secondary to formation of hemorrhagic cyst.For further management, you will have to consult your gynecologist.thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"i had sex on Friday morning by Friday night I felt minor cramping and discomfort in my lower abdomen....it is Saturday and I still the minor discomfort as if I am pregnant....yesterday was the first day of being fertile could I be pregnant? it feels exactly the same as my first child and I knew with in 2days I was pregnant the first time.","Doctor":"Hi,  Nothing can be said for sure, some times cramps occurs due to fluctuation in hormonal level.

This weekend I woke up with a dime sized red spot on my face that almost looked like something had bitten me but no bite spot in center, no itching or anything. The next day I woke up and the red spot was gone but in its place was a very small bruise-looking spot with dry scaly skin on and around the dark spot. It is 3 days later and no change, moisturizer does not help. Should I be worried that this is more skin cancer?","Doctor":"People who develop skin cancer once have an increased risk of new skin cancers later on. Also fair skinned people, people living at high altitude and those having excessive sun exposure are at an increased risk. What i would have wanted to know is whether the lesion is at the same site as the previous cancer in which case the chances of it being cancer are higher than otherwise. The description that you give is not that of skin cancer. So i would suggest you to take a course of antibiotics (Tab Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for 5 days) and if the lesion still persists or worsens, then show it to a skin specialist. It is more likely to be a benign skin condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old male. i have BN over my right arm and i dont like it to be seen by my friends so i would like to tatoo it, no hair grown and brown pigments. Is there is any effect of tatooing over it? also i had heard of getting cancer when we tatoo over it. please suggest me, i m so embarassed from this also it decease my confidence level.","Doctor":"There is only one problem with you getting a tattoo over the nevus and that is that if there is any change in the character of the nevus with time then you will not be able to know till late. I say this because benign nevus are known to change into cancer although the risk in normal individuals (no family or past history of skin cancer) is less than 1% over lifetime. Changes that signify cancer are increase in size, change in color or texture, bleeding or discharge, pain, change in surrounding skin. Also excessive exposure to sun and fair skinned people are at increased risk. Since you are quite worried about how it looks, I will suggest you this. You can get a tattoo done, but design it in such a way that the nevus and the area around the nevus can be monitored. Also, avoid excessive sun exposure if you can"},{"Patient":"Hi,I am nineteen years old and for the past two years I've had a small movable pea sized lump on my right jaw line.

Anyhow, as i said, your symptoms dont seem to be due to cancer. Rather, you seem to be suffering from abnormal functioning of the thyroid gland. I suggest you undergo a thyroid function test ( its a simple blood test done empty stomach at any lab) and if they are abnormal then they will need correction based on the abnormality. Also, that will explain all your symptoms which will then get relieved gradually with time. At the same time i would suggest you to undergo an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis just to be sure your reproductive organs are alright. Only after these tests can a further course of action be decided upon."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, My father is 50 years old, he has been havin black stool for over a month and 3 weeks back he vomited blood , due to which the Hb went down to 6.5. After a CTScan and biposy he was diagnose with stomach cancer , at the stomach and food pipe junction. 2 weeks back he was operated upon, during which the entire stomach was removed. 5 cm extra radius was cut for biopsy , which suggested positive lymph nodes. Kindly help us with the best possible course of action that we could follow at this point if time. What are your views about Ion - beam therapy? What are the success rates? What other course of action do you suggest?","Doctor":"I am assuming that your father is in a good general condition and does not suffer from any comorbid conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. Also, since you have not mentioned it, i assume that the cancer had not spread to any other body part and that the biopsy report shows adenocarcinoma ( a type of cancer). If the margins of resection in the biopsy report are free from tumor then i would suggest your father to undergo further treatment in the form of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment in which we give special injections into a vein. These injections then kill the remaining tumor cells in the body although they have a number of manageable side effects. Since your father has node positive disease, further chemotherapy is mandatory. However, if the biopsy report says that the margins of resection are involved by the tumor, then i would suggest a course of radiation therapy alongwith low dose chemotherapy (to increase the effect of radiation) followed by full dose chemotherapy. All this treatment should preferably be undergone at a dedicated cancer care unit."},{"Patient":"Yes please, I m pretty sure I suffer from depression , when I feel down I drink to excess, although I am a reasonably heavy drinker anyway.

Certain types of cancers of the colon and rectum do have a hereditary component and the risk is further compounded by alcohol abuse and poor dietary habits. The good news is that the type of bleeding you have described is most commonly due to hemorrhoids particularly in the young age group. However, there is only one way to find out whether you have cancer or not and that is to show it a surgeon or cancer surgeon who will examine your anus and rectum in the opd and remove your dilemma."},{"Patient":"I am a 57 year old female who had a total proctocolectomy done Aug 30/11. I also am a liver transplant recipient (Sept 2005). I had Crohn s Disease for 12 years or so. The pathology report after my procotocolectomy showed signs of cancer in the part of the bowel that they removed. The doctors recommended I have chemotherapy (12 treatments) which I just finished in mid-June this year. I have been having problems lately with bleeding around the stoma which can be quite excessive (can fill up my ostomy bag quickly)., The blood is very red & I noticed tonight that there are blood clots in my bag. I emptied it a couple of times & the clots were in the bag both times within a one hour time frame. I managed to retrieve one of the clots from the bowl to have a good look at it & it looks like a red gel mould approximately 2 to 3 inches long & 2 inches wide! I am freaking out trying to figure out where it s coming from. I don t believe it s coming from the stoma itself. I think the bleeding is from around the stoma but can t figure out how the blood clots can come from outside the stoma! Help - I m totally freaking out!","Doctor":"It is not of much concern presently whether the bleeding is from within or around the stoma. What should concern us more is the cause of the bleeding. There could be a number of reasons, like late onset liver failure after transplant (leading to bleeding abnormality), chemotherapy induced bone marrow suppression (which decreases the number of platelets in the blood causing bleeding), recurrence of cancer in the remaining bowel, recurrence of Crohn's disease in the remaining bowel. Ruling them out one by one, i suggest you get a liver function test and complete blood count done. If these are normal, then you should undergo a contrast enhance computerised tomography (CT Scan) of the abdomen followed by an endoscopy from the stoma. These tests should clinch the diagnosis and the treatment accordingly can be instituted. Meanwhile, it is not a bad idea to show yourself to a surgeon just to rule out a local cause for the bleeding like skin infection/excoriation, etc."},{"Patient":"I have a diagnosis  (9/6/13) of infiltrating carcinoma with lobular features, Grade II and associated microcalcifications.

I plan to follow the Hippocrates Health Institute raw-foods, no-sugar, no dairy, no meat program.  How quickly do I need to make a decision and schedule surgery?  what does Grade-II mean?  Do I at least have the sentinel lymph node(s) removed and biopsied?  How important are the lymph nodes to my own immune system response in fighting cancer cells, especially if I build my immune system with the Hippocrates program?","Doctor":"Hello susannec,You may be surprised to read my answer. I am a Homoeopath attempting to help you. You have said that 9/6/13 is the date on which you got the diagnosis. I wish to know what exactly happened in your personal life just before the onset of the breast node and for how long it is there. If it had its onset sudden, then there was a shocking psychological conflict just prior to the development of the breast node. If the node was there for a longer period, you had an adverse life situation to which you reacted badly and gradually developed into a worse situation.No cancer is created in your body to kill you. It is a reaction of the body to protect you from still worse situations. So first of all you recite to your mind that this is not to kill you but to save you. In short I can say that when your immunity got poor, you became sick. When you say that you are healthy, you did not say anything about your mind. In conventional method of treatment, this mind aspect is not considered as important in the production of the cancer. But as a Homoeopath of 35 years of professional experience I can confidently say that Mind is the most important factor producing such cancers. Therefore my advice to you is to find an expert Homoeopath at the earliest or get back to me personally with your details. I can even send to you a case receiving format in which you can enter your developed case and forward it to me. Please do not go for any  surgery- neither lumpectomy nor total. Even if you go for surgery, continue with a healthy mind and Homoeopathic treatment. A good counsellor can also help you during these processes. You can go for the Hippocrates program.

She did however visit a doctor in June 2011 and her surgeon advised to reduce the size of the tumor before she could be operated on. Her treatment started in June last year (2011) with 8 courses of AC. Regular checks were done but somehow the chemo did not have an affect. Her hormone receptor tests are negative by the way so the only likely treatment could have been chemo, radiation and surgery. Her oncologist then got her on 5FU which did not have any effect on the tumor as well. Now she has secondary liver cancer as well which has taken over two of the sections of her liver. Her chemo stopped a couple of months ago as she did not want to go through any more of it. She was on pain killers and trying out Reiki treatment to manage day to day aches. She would complain of stomach pains and sometimes had trouble passing stool. Then a few days ago her health deteriorated when she started shivering and was admitted in the hospital. The doctors explained that her sodium levels had gone down. Now over the last few days she has been suffering from what looks like ascites (stomach really blown up and hand and feet hard as wood) but the doctors are not draining her stomach of the fluids. She cries due to the severe stomach aches and her urine has turned almost black. Her eyes are yolky yellow and she is on constant pain killers and catheter for her urine. Her breast cancer is reeking blood and needs regular changing. Today they informed us that her platelet count has gone down to 28,000 but still havent informed us whether we should arrange for a blood transfusion. The hospital she is in is not a cancer hospital as this was the one closest at the time when she fell ill. I personally feel the doctors are not taking this case as an oncologist would as a- they have failed to address the ascites issue b- are treating her like a normal patient even when they have all her reports in front of them. They inserted a food pipe today as well so that they can give her food via that. I just feel that since she has been admitted her health is deteriorating even more. Do you think we should change hospitals. Or is this normal in her case to suffer so much. Concerned niece - El","Doctor":"Before i answer your question, let me inform you that i am an experienced oncologist and have been working at a dedicated cancer hospital for some  time now. Let me make a few things clear to you before i move on to the specifics. Maybe you know them already, but nonetheless. Firstly, your aunt cannot be cured of her disease by any form of treatment. Secondly, the treatment that she has undergone so far before this admission seems to be largely correct from an oncological point of view. Finally to your query. Treatment at this point is aimed only to provide her a good quality of life and to prolong whatever life we can. From what i gather she has gross ascites and her liver is failing as well due to the disease. So she would benefit in terms of pain by draining the fluid from her abdomen, although it will re-accumulate quickly and need frequent draining. Also, since her liver is failing and platelets are low, this draining procedure will have to be done after correcting her bleeding profile by transfusing plasma and platelets. In short, she will benefit from shifting to a cancer hospital. However two things you have to consider before shifting are whether she is in a condition to be shifted and your finances."},{"Patient":"Hi, had a colonoscopy yesterday am.  they found a sessile polyp 9mm in size, in the cecum..they also found the same type , in the cecum,  only 2mm in size.  Could you please tell me just what they are, and where they are located??  can they cause pain after the procedure??  when should we go to ER for x-ray if it continues??","Doctor":"Hi! Welcome to HCM! Polyps are commonly found in the colon, stomach, nose, sinuses, urinary bladder and uterus. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where mucous membranes exist like the cervix,vocal folds, and small intestine. caecal polyp is a projection of tissue from the inner lining of the caecum into the lumen. Polyps are benign (non-cancerous) growths, but cancer can start in some types of polyps. Polyps that tend to grow as slightly flattened, broad-based polyps are referred to as sessile,they generally, are asymptomatic. It is not uncommon for a sessile polyp to go unnoticed lifetime. As long as the growth remains small and benign, it will not be noticeable. Sometimes, however, the growth can grow large enough to cause bleeding, even if the polyp itself is benign, and one can get big enough to create a blockage. They are typically identified on a colonoscopy, by a gastroenterologist, and excised for a definitive diagnosis and treatment. Complete removal of a polyp is considered curative some may require screening. Consult your gastroenterologist when your polyp needs to be removed and biopsied. hope this will help you! take care!"},{"Patient":"I am a 46 year old white female, I have family hx of colon cancer.

If your tumor was not at the upper pole, it is unlikely to be a metastatic deposit, otherwise it may be.

If your daughter has been on Temozolamide, which appears to be the case then the side effect is explainable as this drug is known to produce skin problems including rashes, oozing, excessive shedding of skin, patches. The water that is oozing is the normal lymph that is formed in all individuals.

It would be a good idea to ask your doctor about this"},{"Patient":"I am a male 77 years of age. I had a Gleason 8 prostate cancer in September 2009. I was refused surgery (Initialy due to my age but then on appeal due to the fact that it had slightly migrated along the vesical nerve), so had a strong hormone tablet in September then started Hormone injections in October. I then had 7 weeks radiation therapy starting in January 2010 and have also been on Hormone treatment since which is a 3 monthly injection in the arm. Leuprorelin acetate (Prostap® SR, Prostap® 3) In 2009 my PSA was 29. On having the one hormone Tablet my PSA dropped to almost nil immediately and has been the same since. I have some cardiovascular issues and had a TIA 18 months ago. I have a 49% left carotid blockage, which I was informed was not bad enough for surgery and the mortality rate was 4%. I also have CKD grade 2. I am now on a daily aspirin and Statins. The Statins I am sure give me quite regular Aching in my limbs and the Hormone treatment give me hot sweats about 4 or 5 times a day. My Question is:- Initially I expected to have Hormone injections for 3 years after which i would have some confirmation that the cancer had been eliminated. A PSA reading that remained low woul be some confirmation of that. There has been concern in some fields that Statins can contribute to Cardiovascular problems and also to Kidney problems. Should I consider asking for the Hormone Injections in be stopped in order to see whether my PSA remains almost nil or would that be a bad move?","Doctor":"The most common side effects for statins are muscle pains and raised liver enzymes. There are other rare side effects but to date, no studies have shown any significant increase in cardiovascular or kidney problems with these drugs. So you can be rest assured about that. As far as continuing the hormone injections are concerned, you have to take them for life or when the PSA starts rising, whichever is earlier. However, there is an alternative as these injections are expensive. You can undergo a small operation under local anaesthesia called bilateral orchidectomy, in which both your testes are removed. This has essentially the same effect as taking these injections, infact much more reliable. Also it is a one time thing and cheaper in the long run."},{"Patient":"Hello I am the caregiver to my 85 year old father in law.

However, i presume that in view of his advanced age, the decision not to take chemotherapy must have been taken, and he was placed on supportive treatment. Going by the rate of transfusions that your father-in-law has been requiring regularly and the complications that he already has started to develop, he is unlikely to survive for more than a few weeks (2-3) in the absence of active treatment in a hospital and even that is being hopeful. You have to take a collective informed and reasonable decision regarding the continuation of therapy in this regard."},{"Patient":"I am scared that I may have Oral Cancer? Hey.

However, they appear to be the early changes that occur in smokers before they develop cancer. These black patches are called melanoplakia. The crusting can be because of an infection. If you have an ulcer or white or red patch anywhere in the mouth then you need to immediately consult a cancer specialist no matter how far away he is. You also need to quit smoking otherwise the chances of you developing cancer in the future are quite high. At present i would advise you to take Tab.

It may or may not be blood. Both, the pain and the discharge maybe the result of a simple infection which is quite common in this age or it may be due to cancer. Having multiple sex partners is one of the predisposing factors for cervix cancer which can present like this.If your partner is having sex with multiple partners then also you maybe predisposed to cancer even if you are not having sex with anyone else. I would advise you to take Tab. Fluconazole 150mg twice daily and place a Clotrimazole pessary once daily in your vagina for a week. After that, you need to get a PAP smear done which will guide you in determining whether you have cancer or pre-cancer or nothing."},{"Patient":"Hi, I ve been diagnosed with pituitary gland tumor 3 months back, consulted with a gynecologist and she asked me to go for prolactin test which was 178ml then she asked me to go for MRI where 1.5*2mm tumor was found. since then i was taking caberlin 0.5mg twice a week for 1.5 month.

When I have random pains I usually chalk it up to the fibro, but this is palpable and seems very different.

All breast lumps need to be assessed by triple assessment in order to ascertain their nature. This includes a clinical examination, an imaging (ultrasound/mammogram) and a cytological test (FNAC or needle test). Since you have already undergone the first 2 and both are in favour of a benign lump, you just need to undergo an FNAC or needle test from the lump in the breast. If after these tests there is any suspicion of a cancer, then you need to get the lump removed and sent for testing. Otherwise you can follow it up at 3 monthly intervals with your family physician. It would have helped to decide your risk of having breast cancer further had you told us about the number of children you have, whether you have breast fed them and if you have any family history of breast or ovarian cancer."},{"Patient":"Hello,My younger half sister has had pre-cancerous cells removed from her cervix and is supposed to have a cancer screening done every 6 months.

Also, the neck of the bladder should be free from disease else this surgery is not recommended. If that is the case then you need to get the surgery done at the earliest and not wait for 45 days as the tumor may spread even before that. It is a major surgery and carries a 5-10% risk of death depending on your health and the expertise of the surgeon.

I just changed into my pajamas and noticed that I have many (somewhere around 15) small bruises on the insides and backs of my thighs. In the past few days, I have done nothing that might cause these. It s happened a few times in the past, but not often. A few days ago, I started having a sore throat and I was wondering if there could be any corrolation. I cannot remember if the last time this happened was during a time at which I had a sore throat. So far, no unexplained bruising has occured on my stomach, back, chest , etc and very rarely on my arms (though I assume that it s only unexplained because I don t remember hitting something). However, the bruises which have just appeared are not in any place I would bump into. I m a 21 year old otherwise healthy female. The only concering aspect of my medical history is that my mother, my half-sister, and my grandfather on my father s side have all died from cancer . Two cases of melanoma and one of colon cancer.

This is particularly true if the line runs vertically, as in YOUR case . fungal infections of the nail will cause similar lines, although typically there is also more generalized deformity or thickening of the nail as well. Another possibility would be a foreign body under the fingernail, which can look like a black line. . Finally, rarely, bleeding can show up under the nails as small dark lines called splinter hemorrhages AND since you are constantly stubbing it under chair so subungual haemrrhage can be a possibility.melanomas occur on nailbed but in your case its is not likely because it hardly presents like a straight vertical line. you must visit a doctor especially to rule out any fungal infection or trauma.Isincerely hope this will help you!take care!"},{"Patient":"My son in law has had Lymphoma for years, but has been dealing successfully with it.

What I would like you to clarify with your doctor is the indication of this surgery. It could be simply that they want to preserve other vital organs like the kidneys if this cancer is causing urinary retention and compromising renal function.

WELCOME TO HCM! You have finished your chemo and radiation therapy.I can understand that you may think that your abnormal pap smear is related to breast cancer . The fact is that cervical screening is designed to pick up minor changes before any problems develop. Having an abnormal result is not unusual. Approximately 1:20 women have test results that show some abnormality and it is extremely rare that an abnormal change found on screening is actually cancer. An abnormal change shows small changes in cells which may be an early warning sign that over time could develop into cervical cancer. normally you get referred to colposcopy so they can look at your cervix under a microscope and can take a biopsy if they think its required.

Foamy urine is likely nothing to worry about if it happens only occasionally and isn't getting progressively more noticeable. It may just mean that you urinated rapidly, maybe with more concentrated urine as in mild dehydration. You could drink more water to see if it goes away. However, persistently foamy urine can be a sign of protein in your urine (proteinuria), which requires further evaluation.

Brand names for these beads include TheraSphere® and SIR-Spheres®. Once infused, the beads lodge in the blood vessels near the tumor, where they give off small amounts of radiation to the tumor site for several days. The radiation travels a very short distance, so its effects are limited mainly to the tumor. Long-term data on this treatment isn't yet available, but it has been shown to help tumors shrink.Possible complications after embolization include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, infection in the liver, gallbladder inflammation, and blood clots in the main blood vessels of the liver.

At the centre/bottom of the ribcage it feels like someone is turning and pushing inside making me feel like I want to be sick and I become hot and clammy. Sometimes, when the pain becomes more severe it feels like it travels up my neck and my neck becomes achey. I recently visited A & E regarding this, which they gave me an ECG (which was clear), and X-ray (which was clear) and 5 lots of bloods were taken (which were all clear). They say its a few things it could be and have put me on Omeprazole for now but am awaiting an ultrasound before they suggest an colonoscopy (if i ve got it right). Is there a chance it could be Gallstones???","Doctor":"Most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms.If you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. Pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. Sometimes the pain is more severe. It may be steady, or it may come and go. Or it may get worse when you eat.  You may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. In this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. Your doctor may order imaging tests. These take pictures of the inside of your body. An ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. This test does not hurt.Your ultrasound may not show gallstones. But if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. In this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. Then a machine takes X-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine.  If you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment.If your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. You may never have another attack. Waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems.If you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. A second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks.Many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. Doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. For this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. You will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. Sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. It will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery.

I have been suffering from chest pains that shoot across my chest for over a year, and lately I have been getting milder versions of this pain throughout my chest, under both breasts (more on the left than the right), and I also have a severe pain under my left arm that causes my entire arm (including hand/fingers) to go numb. I also feel like I have something stuck in my throat constantly and it won t go away. I have had x-rays and an MRI that are normal. My dr. has run all kinds of blood work and everything is normal. I have also had a mammogram that was normal. She thinks I may have a hiatus hernia but I am waiting to have an upper and lower endoscopy to see if there is anything there. All chest/heart tests have also come back normal. Could all of this be releated to a hernia??? Most of the time when I take an attack it feels like I have a golf ball on fire in my throat and I get severe pain in my chest, upper abdomen, and upper back. Also, if I bend over a certain way I the pain under my ribs on the left is so severe that I actually can t breath. My Dr. put me on Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and that does absolutely nothing, so she put me on Pariet 20 mg once daily and that only dulls the pain when I have an episode of severe throat pain. I have alot of heartburn and no reflux . Any suggestions would be very welcomed at this point.","Doctor":"Any time an internal body part pushes into an area where it doesn't belong, it's called a hernia.The hiatus is an opening in the diaphragm -- the muscular wall separating the chest cavity from the abdomen. Normally, the esophagus (food pipe) goes through the hiatus and attaches to the stomach. In a hiatal hernia (also called hiatus hernia) the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening.There are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding and paraesophageal (next to the esophagus).Many people with hiatal hernia have no symptoms, but others may have heartburn related to gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Although there appears to be a link, one condition does not seem to cause the other, because many people have a hiatal hernia without having GERD, and others have GERD without having a hiatal hernia.People with heartburn may experience chest pain that can easily be confused with the pain of a heart attack. That's why it's so important to undergo testing and get properly diagnosed.Most people do not experience any symptoms of their hiatal hernia so no treatment is necessary. However, the paraesophaeal hernia (when part of the stomach squeezes through the hiatus) can sometimes cause the stomach to be strangled, so surgery is sometimes recommended. Other symptoms that may occur along with the hernia such as chest pain should be properly evaluated. Symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn, should be treated.U can try syrup mucaine gel 2 tsf thrice daily before food for 7 days."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, This question is in relation to my mothers health. My mother is sixty three, she has been having hot flushes from the age of forty eight.

Some women have hot flashes for a very short time during menopause. Other women may have hot flashes at least to some degree for life. To prevent hot flashes, your mother should avoid these triggers: Stress,Caffeine, Alcohol,Spicy foods,Tight clothing, Heat and Cigarette smokeOther things she can do to keep hot flashes at bay include:    Stay cool. Try deep, slow abdominal breathing ,exercise dailyYour mother can go in for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) under the expert guidance of a gynaecologist or an endocrinologist.You both and your doctor may decide that hormones are or are not needed for a short time to help with symptoms of hot flushes.Hot flushes are linked to lower estrogen levels.I hope this will help you!"},{"Patient":"What type of doctor do I need to see on a regular schedule after half of your thyroid has been removed then one week later found out it contained Papillary cancer stage one?

The size of pancreas is usually not more than 15 cm . Head , body and tail are the main parts of pancreas . Usually the benign carcinoma rarely  develops in head  ,if present may be malignant so get  a surgery for this part , however final decision will be taken  by a surgeon .

The most common prescription anti-parasite medications for pinworms are Mebendazole and Albendazole.You may have mild gastrointestinal side effects during the course of treatment, and you often need to take at least two doses to get rid of the pinworms completely.

My surgeon is not surprised because I had radiation on that side 15 years ago when I had my first breast cancer diagnosis. Is there anything I can do to help speed up the fluid reabsorption - heat, massage, (I m wearing the surgical vest for compression)?","Doctor":"The main cause of action for large seromas is to aspirate the fluid content and in some instances, one may need multiple aspirations until the fluid accumulation subside. Insertion of a draining tube attached to a vacuum device is the preferred choice in many instances of extensive surgeries and in such instances, the draining fluid will be monitored daily in order to find out if the volume of accumulated fluid has gone down to reasonable levels. Once it reaches a minimum amount, the doctors would decide on removing the draining tube as the body itself is able to absorb the small amount of leakage that may take place after removing the draining tube.In the event of an infected seroma, one may need to take intravenous antibiotics as oral antibiotics may not be adequate in order to settle an infected wound. In such instances, the patient may also have to be given pain relievers and anti-inflammatory agents in order to reduce the swelling as well as to ease the discomfort.Application of a tight dressing and asking the patient to wear a tight bra with padding in the case of breast related surgeries have also contributed to lessening the incidence of seroma formation. Avoiding unnecessary movements which can aggravate the tissue damages could also help in minimizing the potential for fluid collection.Regards and take care"},{"Patient":"My Mother Mrs. Pressanna (50 yrs) has recently has been diagnosed with  Colon Cancer with multiple liver metastasis - stage 4.

The pain you are feeling in your abdomen (near pelvic bone) during your periods is perfectly normal. Please keep in mind that pain in such area and back pain are common during the menstrual cycle. You should examine further the lump in your right hand to determine whether it is a simple lipoma or infected skin, which need specific treatment.

The tumor was the size of a marble.  What is satellite cancer?  Is it highly likely that she has more cancer?","Doctor":"Dear Sir/ MadamThanks for your query.A satellite cancer is a tumor around the primary tumor (not farther than 1 inch) and has come from the primary tumor only. A micro-metastsis is a more scientific term. It denotes a tumor away from the primary tumor although originating from the primary itself. It is not detected at the time of removal of primary tumor by any modality because of its very small size but grows on later in life. Exact diagnosis depends upon matching of tumor characteristics with the primary.None can deny that she can have more tumor in future. They may or may not represent part of primary tumor. About the possible chances, best is to discuss with your pathologist & oncologist.SincerelySukhvinder"},{"Patient":"having problems getting answers hope you can help, not even sure if im in the correct specialty. was in the hospital in March 2012 with what they diagnosed me with an abcessed lymph node . had a sore in my mouth and gave me antibiotics and said if it doesnt get better in 5-7 days to return. within the week i was back in the ER. they drew blood and told me i needed to see a specialist and that i had lymphoma . with no followup instructions or a PCP, i went to the larger hospital in the city. they set me up with an ENT, she told me she wanted to do a biopsy of my swollen lymph node, but couldnt without my PCP to check it out first. so i got a PCP and followed up with him, he found another swollen node on my neck and told me he was going to send me back to the ENT for a biopsy. went back to the ENT to get the biopsy (unaware they were residence and i would be seeing different doctors each time) the new ENT came in and told me he doesnt think its lymphoma, he thinks i might have leukemia , sends me to give 7 more tubes of blood and another chest xray . only after looking at my CT with contrast. pushed back my biopsy for 2 weeks and i still dont get results for another month. i have been to 7 different doctors and feel like im being ignored. i have swollen lymph nodes all around my neck, fatigue , feeling of fever without having one, random pains, headache for weeks, i would just like to know if im seeing the right physician or am i getting the answers i need or should i find different doctors? i want to know what is wrong with me and its been a year and it is only getting worse","Doctor":"Hi!

Most fibroadenomas are left in situ and monitored by a doctor, or the patient in question. Some are treated by surgical excision. They are removed with a small margin of normal breast tissue if the preoperative clinical investigations are suggestive of the diagnosis. A small amount of normal tissue must be removed in case the lesion turns out to be a phyllodes tumour on microscopic examination.Because needle biopsy is often a reliable diagnostic investigation, some doctors may decide not to operate to remove the lesion, and instead opt for clinical follow-up to serially observe the lesion over time using clinical examination and mammography to determine the rate of growth, if any, of the lesion. A growth rate of less than sixteen percent per month in women under fifty years of age, and a growth rate of less than thirteen percent per month in women over fifty years of age have been published as safe growth rates for continued non-operative treatment and clinical observation.Some fibroadenomas respond to treatment with ormeloxifene.Fibroadenomas have not been shown to recur following complete excision or transform into phyllodes tumours following partial or incomplete excision.Regards and take care"},{"Patient":"My mother was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in January 2012.

Studies have shown that if you have anemia and heart failure, your risk of death and complications are increased appreciably with as much as 30 percent to 60 percent additional risk of death and hospitalization from heart failure.When hemoglobin is below 8 g/dl, death is not far from occurring thus a transfusion is required.I suggest your father takes 2 unit of packed red blood cell transfusion immediately as his heamoglobin is already 8.2 g/dl so it is maintained above 8 g/dl.1 unit PRBC transfusion increases haemoglobin level by 1 g/dl.Regards and take care"},{"Patient":"My mother has been having painful foot leg and hand cramps and they are becoming unbearable. She had chemotherpy last year the final dose being december the cancer was of the bowel and her latest 6 month test says she is in remission, would the chemo be responsible for her symptoms and is there anything she can do to relieve them ? they seem to be worse at night.","Doctor":"Your mother is suffering from CIPN meaning chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.Peripheral neuropathy is disorder of nerves apart from the brain and spinal cord. Patients with peripheral neuropathy may have tingling, numbness, unusual sensations, weakness, or burning pain in the affected area. Oftentimes, the symptoms are symmetrical and involve both hands and feet. Because the symptoms are often present in the areas covered by gloves or stockings, peripheral neuropathy is often described as having a “glove and stocking” distribution of symptoms.Chemotherapeutic drugs cause peripheral neuropathy, including the plant alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel , platinum-based compounds (cisplatin,carboplatin and oxaliplatin).Your mother has bowel cancer and is most probably using chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin which causes the ocuurence of CIPN is as high as 70 to 90%.CIPN takes time to get reduced.It takes about 6 months to 1 year after completion of chemotherapy to get reduced totally.Your mother can take tablet Lyrica 75 mg twice daily after food for 1 month.It contains pregabalin which will help her to reduce her painful condition."},{"Patient":"Hi I m a 41 year old women for the past six weeks I ve had almost constant nausea and belching after eating.

No,you should not be worried.doctors may be suspecting lymphoma because it is essential to rule out lymphoma in such case,however till FNAC or biopsy shows some suspicious cells there is nothing which suggests lymphoma Especially when it is regressing in size,it could be just reactive lymph node or may be due to some local infective lesion.

Antihypertensives such as clonidine have shown modest benefit in tamoxifen induced hot flashes.U can try the following non pharmacologic measures to reduce hot flashes.They are dressing in layers, use of cotton clothing and bedding, strategic placement of electric fans, and the carrying of cold drinks. Reusable cooling bandanas containing polymer crystals may be helpful. They can be soaked in cold water for 10–30 minutes and tied around the neck for a long-lasting cooling effect.

The liver team will now have met to discuss their view. Is it the case, if the chemo shrinks the liver cancer, that he can have an operation?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,He can have the surgery. However, the team of the liver will actually have to meet. The liver is responsible for the production of most clotting factors. The state of the liver is therefore very important to ascertain to what degree he can tolerate surgery without bleeding excessively. Based on findings of the liver function tests and other tests, management could then be adjusted, either by injecting specific factors if they are insufficient, or maybe giving some extra time for him to come up to acceptable levels to be eligible for an uneventful surgical procedure.

Robotic prostatectomy gives the best chance for cure with minimum complications. High chances of node positive disease though.Other option that you are considering of doing nothing will land up in Watchful waiting i.e. hormonal treatment when you develop extensive disease. That option is exercised in older patients or if you have some other diseases making you unfit for surgery.At your age, give yourself a chanceGood luck"},{"Patient":"Hi, today during a wrestling tournament I was hit in the stomach and the wind was knocked out of me.

This may have been caused by the effects of the brain cancer which can affect the breathing pattern which, in turn, affects the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. When she was put on a ventilator, her breathing would have been better controlled.

I've got a bump in my left inguinal area which is oval in shape and about 2cm x 1 cm. The skin over the bump is very smooth and a bluish-grey hue with a black circular lesion in the middle which is only about 1mm in diameter. The skin over this black spot seems to be slightly rougher, but it is not ulcerating and I can't tell if it's umbilicated.The bump first appeared over a year ago, maybe even two years, and I want to say that it began as an ulcerating erythematous pustular lesion (like a pimple, perhaps infected with staph) although it's been awhile so I can't say for certain. Regardless, it has not been swollen or pruitic since the initial erythema resolved over a year ago. It really hasn't changed much during that time either. It's possible it's gotten ever, ever so slightly larger, but I really can't say. It also seems as if that black spot at one time used to be deeper under the skin (but faintly visible) and is now at the surface as I mentioned earlier.I have no sexual history and my PMH is not significant for anything other than a benign parotid tumor about 7 years ago. I'm a medical student spending my third year in a small community away from home and there aren't really any physicians out here that I'd feel comfortable showing/asking about it (since I'm rotating with most of them).

Only with the ct report we cant tell whether it is benign or malignanat. We want more information. Best way to diagnose is to observe under microscopy about the cells charecteristics.To diagnose whether it is benign or cancerous you can opt1. FNAC. Under USG guidance. One of the good way to diagnose solid tumors.2. Laparoscopy. Can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. The best way.3. Doppler scanning to see the blood supply. Non invasive and can tell whether benign or cancerous.

(FYI he is only 49 years old....) It has been a roller-coaster of emotions for both of us, which social workers discussing \\"quality vs quantity\\" of life, arranging for a hospital bed to be delivered to our house, etc. Two days after being released from the hospital (where they had moved him to the palliative care unit - not a good sign.....) he was given a schedule for chemo and radiation treatments. We attended a chemo class yesterday and found out his schedule calls for doctor visits 2 and 3 times a week, as well as a five-week period where he will go everyday (M-F) for radiation treatments. Now we are both confused. When we heard the six month diagnosis we were planning on how this time would be spent (trips to the beach, fishing, etc) but now with the treatments scheduled, we are thinking that perhaps the six month diagnosis has changed - is there still hope for survival??? is what we keep playing out in our heads, thinking surely the doctors would not prescribe these intensive treatments if he was surely going to die by January??? Family members, friends, and, of course, my dear sweet husband and I are holding on to any glimmer of hope there may be....but we want to be realistic. Why would a doctor tell him he has six months to live.....and then prescribe tons of chemo and radiation???","Doctor":"Hi welcome to health care magic forum.Because,chemo and radioth is necessary to achieve even those 6 months. i understand your concerns, but pancreatic cancer is one of the most dangerous and has very poor prognosis. radioth and chemo is the last option for palliative treatment and it can only slightly prolong lifetime. so many patient even decide not to treat it if they consider that 3 or 4 more months are not worth of fighting. this is up to you. in both cases prognosis is poor and he is not able to live for 1 year.but as i said if he wants these 6 months he needs therapy. if not, he can hope for 2-3 month of life.Hope I have answered your query."},{"Patient":"Hi.

I have been trying my best to stay healthy, but despite my best efforts, it has been really a struggle to keep my stress levels down since I also take care of my little boy who has special needs.  I had been having a lot of discomfort on my right side and it was discovered last November that my right ovary has also developed a cyst.  My primary physician Rx vit. D3 as well as some iodine and the ultrasound shows that it is not cancerous, but recently I have been experiencing a lot of pain once again.  I guess my question is:  If I have to have this last remaining ovary removed, will this force me into premature menopause?  And if yes, will taking hormones be risky for my heart?  I currently see a cardiologist for an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure.  Thank you so much for your time.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Healthcaremagic.Just a simple cyst in  left ovary usually does cause a severe pain abdomen. Please repeat an ultrasound abdomen.Cyst in ovary may cause severe pain if it  undergo torsion.If nothing found then do an MRI abdomen.Right side abdominal pain may be due to Appendicitis, colitis, Internal Hernia,etc.Now you have only right ovary left.if this is also removed, definitely it may cause premature menopause. Because removal of both ovaries may result in depletion of oestrogen and progesterone.Thus Hormone replacement therapy becomes essential to decrease the side effects of depletion of hormones.Earlier it was thought that HRT increases the heart attack, deep vein thrombosis and stroke.But now it it is concluded that HRT significantly reduces the risk of mortality, heart failure, or heart attack, without any apparent increase of breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis or stroke.So better consult cardiologist and taking HRT is essential before removal of your right ovary.Hope this Helps.Take care.Regards,Dr.Manjeth"},{"Patient":"Over the last 2 months I've been dizzy and had fatigue upon waking up and throughout the day.

The lesions of leukoplakia cannot be rubbed off which rules out the condition.Frankly speaking you first need confirmed diagnosis as leukoplakia is a premalignant lesion, i.e. in which cancer is more likely to occur with chance of  oral squamous cell carcinoma. Most of oral leukoplakias will not turn malignant, however some hold greater risk than than others. No interventions have been proven to reduce the risk of cancer developing in an area of leukoplakia,but if stop smoking and limit alcohol consumption to reduce her risk. Sometimes the white patch will shrink and eventually disappear after stopping smoking,but this may take up to a year.Management usually involves regular check of the lesion to detect any possible malignant change early."},{"Patient":"Moderate dyskaryosis , i have just been informed from my smear last week that I have abnormal cells. 6 years ago the same happened and I had to have 3 quarters of my cervix removed.

A year ago i was diagnosed adenomiosis and had severe problems with my periods due to low progesterone and high estrogen. During ultrasound they found a adenomiosis which was proved by endometrial diagnostic ablation. I tried progesterone but i have mastopatic breasts and after this hormone it turned into pre- cancerous state and i had it removed from my breast. So i had to stop any hormones. I rather dont have any effects of adenomiosis- maybe smt little back pains and smt painful intercourse. What is more several doctors did my ultrasound and sometimes they see adeno and smt not. Im 45 - i had last period in may and my hormone levels are : progesterone 0,2, estrogen  93 so i think i start menopause. Im so afraid it may turn into cancer that i beggged my gin for partial histerectomy via minilaparotomy on august 7th. I have IBS. I dont know what to do.- am i really menopausal or is it only stress, i cant take hormones and dont want to, i dont need to lower estrogen as it is very low, and most of all- i know that not all women stop adeno after menopause and it takes ling time to stop the process with only menopause. Is IBS a problem after hysterectomy? I know i should wait but i cant go to hospital any time from my work. im a teacher and now its good time. i lost over 15 monts crying and visiting doctors , im afraid as my grandparents, and father died of cancer. What should i do? please help me- thank u. AAAA","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for consulting us.Adenomyosis is not a precancerous condition & It regresses after menopause.The point to remember is that this is a histopathology diagnosis. Sometimes it can be seen on ultrasound & sometimes not. If you have had an endometrial biopsy & it is normal then you have no point in getting afraid of cancer as far as your womb is concerned. However, if symptoms are unbearable you may try medical treatments other than progesterone or even surgery. There is an option of trying GnRH analogues for short period before going for surgery. This will help you in differentiating that your symptoms are due to adenomyosis or due to IBS. As if IBS is the cause of your symptoms you will not get any pain relief from surgery.Hope I have given you some helpful clues.Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi there.My friend is 68 years old and two months ago he underwent a partial splenectomy because of cancer.We both live in North Thailand hours away from the hospital and doctor who preformed the surgery and there is no home help available along with the fact that when a patient is admitted to hospital it is not the nurses that tend to them but family members because the lack of help.He has lost so much weight and has only left the bed to go to the toilet with the help of a friend.He was considering traveling back to the UK for post op treatment and care but he is unfit to fly and now the doctor who performed the surgery wont clear him for travel nor chemotherapy.He cannot eat solids either so my question is this .I want him to begin to gain weight and I thought that a  high calorie diet is required such as whole milk and some milkshakes with fruit along with V8 drinks might help to give him what he needs but I'm fearful that this could be dangerous.We are pretty limited here for certain foods but if your suggestion can help me decide and work to get him on his feet again I would be very grateful for he has no one else and I work full time as a teacher.Yours sincerely AAAAA","Doctor":"Hi, it appears that if the patient is not on supports like oxygen, E.C.G.monitoring, stomach tube, and if he can walk with support usually the flight people may not have any objection, to carry him, any how enquire directly.

You should visit a surgeon and schedule a CT scan of the head and neck region to see if there is some problem in the brain.Hoping for the best."},{"Patient":"I just urinated and thought my urine looked like tea or blood.

How do you explain this difference? What do these genes code for normally? In a healthy person, what role are the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes playing, and how do they do it?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,I will explain to you briefly the difference between tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.Oncogenes are coded by proteins called proto-oncogenes.Proto-oncogenes are encoded by two alleles.Mutation of any one of the alleles converts proto-oncogene to oncogene.Oncogene is responsible for particular malignancy.The role of proto-oncogene in health is to keep a check on uncontrolled growth of cells.Tumor suppressor genes are encoded by two alleles.Mutation of both these alleles is required for development of malignancy.Tumor suppressor genes in health also prevent development of malignancy.Mutation of these genes may be genetic or is caused by chemicals, physical damage like radiations, etc.Thanks and take careDr Shailja p Wahal"},{"Patient":"my father is in hospice diagnosis lung cancer with mets to right hip, liver and lymph nodes. he was sleeping 20 hours per day at the beginning of the week and now is up all night very restless has fallen twice since going to inpatient hospice and receiving morphine, Haldol, Ativan and valium.

The radiologist recommended a repeat ultrasound in three months.  I have read that breast cancer can spread to the thyroid.  Since my cancer is in situ based on the biopsy, is it still possible it has spread to the thyroid?

You are diagnosed with breast cancer which is estrogen and progesterone receptive (ER and PR positive). This is a good sign. Any breast cancer of size more than 1 cm can spread to other organs. But breast cancer spreads more commonly to liver, ovary (krukenbegs tumor), lungs, bones (vertebra) and brain. you said that you have been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule. The chances of breast cancer being spread to thyroid is very rare. This thyroid nodule might be a different entity. An ultrasound can tell us the nature of the thyroid nodule.

It has been 2 weeks since then. He still urinates with blood but this morning he urinated with bright red blood dripping after urination. Is this part of the manifestations of his bladder metastasis? Or could it be something else?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for your query.Passing blood in the urine may be due to many causes. But mostly it might be due to bladder tumors and kidney tumors. sometimes due to stone disease and also after chemotherapy (cystitis). You had already mentioned that your brother is having colon cancer infiltrating into bladder. So now his problem of blood in the urine is mostly due to this infiltration. The chances of new bladder tumor to occur is rare but still may occur. you can get an ultrasound of the abdomen to see if there are any other lesions in the bladder apart from this infiltration. If there are any other lesions then they an be further worked up.Good luck."},{"Patient":"My father in law is 82 and we have just been told he has a primary tumour on his kidney and lesions on the brain and lung this bame to light only 4 weeks ago after having a fit that was first mistaken for a stroke but then after having 3 more siezures and a ct scan we were told this news also that there was no treatment is this type of cancer rapid ?

I had BCG treatments following the removal of the Tumor. It was supposed to be an outpatient surgery however it took much longer than it was supposed to because of the bleeding and cutting involved.  Today I had another Cystoscopy and he saw a growth that requires it to be removed again.  Why wouldn't a 2nd Cystoscopy be performed prior to the treatments to insure that all Cancer was removed visually at least prior to wasting 6 weeks of BCG treatment only to discover growth?  It makes no sense to me why one would assume everything was removed if it was that extensive.  Is it an ego thing that the doctor wouldn't consider looking to check his work to insure everything was good prior to jumping into BCG therapy?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare magic.Thank you for the query.It i hard to say was it necessary to do cystosopcy. because bcg is considered to stregthen immune respones and prevent tumor recurence. This is important even when there are no signs of tumor because there can be micrometastasis or tumors which arent visible. SO BCG would be helpful in such circumstances. All in all there is more benefit of bcg than cost. ANd it isnt so important to establish that there is tumor recurence.Wish you good health.

I don't have any symtoms - am 74 years old and everything is working okay. I am very concerned that surgery will fix something that is not broken.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.I am sure your doctors have made you aware of your kidney cancer after confirming diagnosis.Cancers are easy to treat and curable when detected early. You are in a better position to be detected with a 2.3 cms cancer. Further delay may enlarge the cancer and make the treatment process long and painful.The incision is best decided by the operating surgeon as you already have a scar.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My  father is 74 years old. He is being diagonsed with Metastatic Cancer Prostate with obstructive uropathy and renal failure.A stent is fitted in his right kidney and the feeding is done through nose. Now the situation is this that creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 3.4 . What I want to know is it advisable to put a tube in left kidney, so that waste fluid can come out and condition be improved.","Doctor":"Hi,The best treatment for renal failure is dialysis. Dialysis in your father can be done via an AV fistula or by a central line. I dont understand where the stent was placed in the kidney. Was it in the ureter or in the artery supplying to the kidney. If it was in the artery supply. It is possible that he has renal artery stenosis. If it was in some other location, it could mean something else.Anyway, creatinine levels are not that indicative of a person's health. Some people are even able to lead active lives like swimming and cycling with creatinine at 4 or 5. What you need to see is how your father is doing. Is he energetic. If he is energetic, ignore the creatinine readings and focus on other aspects of his treatment.Dr Vineet"},{"Patient":"Hi,I'm a 22-year-old female. My period is coming up probably in about a week (my breasts are always sore around this time) and I've noticed a pain in my left armpit. I believe there is a small lump where the pain is coming from, about the size of a pea. I believe this has happened before prior to my period, though not consistently. Could this be normal? Or is this a sign of breast cancer? I'm very worried. Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your question.Sore breast before periods and during the period is normal process and is due to hormonal changes before periods. The small lump in your left armpit could be a small lymph node. Pain in lymph node could be due to inflammation of the lymph node secondary to breast changes .Chances of this lymph node of being secondary to breast cancer are very, very rare but can be only ruled out by physical examination of breast and FNAC of this small lump.Hope this answers your question"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Ioana and I have pain on the right breast  on the distal, towards the arm.

Thank you for your question! I'm really sorry about your brother. You have to remember that the brain is a very compact organ enclosed by hard bone - so there is actually very little space for anything when a tumor grows. A tumor of 7cm will cause displacement of brain tissue, nerves, and fluid which can exert pressure on neighboring or even distant structures. The loss of bladder control may be directly due to the tumor which may be directly or indirectly impinging on neural pathways to your brother's bladder. I hope I was able to answer your question.

Thank you for your question. Personally and professionally, I am also leaning towards a kidney stone or a benign lesion. Urinary bladder carcinoma occurs very rarely (4 for every 100,000 in men and 1 for every 1000 in women) and is commonly diagnosed in individuals over 40 years (median age of diagnosis is 65 years). The most common presenting symptoms are microscopic hematuria (blood only seen when a urine sample is placed under the microscope) and frequent urination. On the other hand, gross hematuria (visible blood in the urine) commonly is a sign of a stone - which may or may not be seen in x-rays. There are stones that are too small to be detected by x-rays or are made up of substances that make them invisible to x-rays. I would suggest that, through a urologist, you undergo other and more sensitive tests: ultrasound or CT scan/MRI. Take care and I hope you feel better soon!

A rectosigmoidoscopy, an examination to explore the nature of the rectum and sigmoid colon could be very beneficial.

My dad had a cancer tumour in his kidney.  I believe the cancer is referred to as \\"upper tract euretherial carcenoma\\".  the kidney was removed, however; the cancer has spread to his lymph nodes.  Subsequently a year later it has now shown up in his chest. He was just recently hospitalized June 8th complaining about chest pain and difficulty swallowing. Note that a few months ago he lost his voice due to the lymph nodes encroaching on his voice box.  On June 12th he had an episode where he had some issues breathing and his oxygen levels were low, but subsequently he ended up doing better now. They put him on antibiotics and steroids and they told us that he got pneumonia due to aspiration.  They said that the cancer has caused complications in that he has a possibility of aspirating at anytime and has been put on a thickened food and fluid diet.  We are trying to get a certain ENT doctor to check him to see if anything can be done with his throat larynx to help him, but the initial ENT that was there a few days ago was not very helpful.  I suspect that all of the doctors are not putting in much of an effort because they feel he is pretty much done and it’s not worth doing anything.  I suspect that it may be due to the fact that my father’s goals of cares status was put as an M1 although we initially had him at R1.During his hospital stay (he is actually still in the hospital but this Wednesday we have a mtg with the staff, unit nurse, some doctors etc regarding the next steps) my dad has had a ct-scan of his chest and it would appear that the lymph nodes are still growing at a rate of about half a cm per every 6 weeks. It is referred to as mediastinal lymph nodes in his chest.  I think the lymph nodes are around 3 to 3.5 cm (they have not done a bronchyoscopy due to the high risk factor according to the doctor)  I just spoke with my dad’s medical oncologist who says that he is definitely not fit enough for chemo and doesn’t feel like a crio therapy or crioabration is the solution since it is too deep and is not isolated to a specific node but several in the chest area.  Another Dr. that saw my dad was a little more optimistic than the rest. He looked at his charts and couldn’t  understand why he looked this bad. He said that the lymph nodes in his chest are growing and there is cancer there, however; the rest of his body is ok. He blood tests are ok, the cancer has not spread anywhere else whatsoever.  What I am seeking are some suggestions. Some alternatives, or other procedure that may be feasible.  I am seeking something more specific such as including names of Doctors if there is a specific procedure only certain doctors do. So their contact info if possible.

He is now completly incontinent. He is unable to eat and drinks very little, however is vomiting a lot of black liquid regularly. Can you tell me, is this the final stage of the cancer? When will the doctors start the morphine to put him out of his misery? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi there, Vomiting black liquid seems most likely as altered blood though bile may be brownish sometimes as well. It looks like he is in final stage of cancer. Morphine is a pain killer and if he is not in pain he is unlikely to be started on it. The perception that morphine is given to put someone out of misery, is rather for pain really. Many patients morphine is given short time and is stopped when pain is relieved. Do speak to your hospice nurse and get a clear picture and usually they explain the situation on day to day basis.

I found two hard lumps in my right breast, along with swollen milk ducts three months ago. I am not breastfeeding , nor am I pregnant. My only child is three years old, never breastfed. My maternal grandmother died of breast cancer at the age of 54. I went to my doctor, who gave me a referral for an ultrasound , due to the lumps being palpable. My doctor explained that she thought they were simply fibroadenomas, but that she was not completely sure. I went for my ultrasound two weeks after. The results came back normal. I was then referred to a breast specialist, as my doctor wanted to verify that there were no other tests needed. I was cleared by the specialist, breast exam normal. I was told by the specialist that she believed my milk ducts became clogged, and that it was nothing to worry about. Since then, my milk ducts have became clogged quite a few times. I can actually squeeze them, and sometimes they will pop, feeling like a water balloon bursting inside my breast. A week ago, I barely brushed against my left nipple , and had a watery greyish-green discharge come from one duct. It lasted about 3 days, only when stimulated. My ducts are swollen again, to the point that my breast feels heavier than the other. My nipple is extremely sensitive, and becomes errect without stimulation. I have tried warm compresses and began takin aleve for the pain. The pain is radiating from my nipple throughout my entire left breast. There are times when I have to just hold my breast due to the constant pain. I do not have nipple retraction, nor do I have an orange peel look, yet.","Doctor":"Hi there, In case the ultrasound is normal then I'll not worry about being cancer. I think you have done all the right things, yet if you are in pain or discharge is persisting, don't be shy to report to your doctor again and seek remedy. Regards"},{"Patient":"I am a 42 year old mother of 2. I noticed a lump above my left collarbone back in August. Went to GP and she said that she wasn t concerned about it and I should go back and see her if it became the size of a golfball. It was about the size of a peanut. A couple weeks later went to Urgent care and was tested for Strep throat(negative) because my throat and neck hurt. Was given antibiotics for sinus infection . I was later referred to ENT by the GP for a CT scan of sinus. This only showed a small polyp in left maxifacial which ENT said was not causing blockage but I did have swelling in my nose and was given another round of antibiotics. A few weeks later I felt like something was pushing against my neck and was constantly pulling at my shirts because it felt like they were on my neck. Went back to GP and she sent me for ultrasound of Thyroid. This showed 2 nodules on my right thyroid 9mm and 1cm. the 1cm looks to be cystic. GP also ran TSH and T4 and antibodies test which all came back normal, but thyroid was enlarged. I asked for a CBC and found out my WBC was 15.5. GP gave broad spectrem antibiotic for 2 weeks. Retested a moth later and WBC is now 11 which is still a little high. Saw ENT on Monday he saw no need for fine needle biopsy because the largest nodule is cystic. Ordered a soft tissue CT for enlarged lymph nodes which showed that I have several borderline nodes with the largest being on the right side but none were reactive to the dye. I didn t even know I had a enlarged node on the right side as I can t feel it. I was given the option to moniter them? Or have a biopsy of one of them. I am at a loss as to what to do or where to turn. It seems that every fall I feel sick and have a elevated WBC, but they never know why. In 2010 WBC was 13, 2011 it was 12.2 and this year 15.5. Should I be concerned about cancer, Hashimotos or where to turn for infection? What kind of doctor or specialist should I see? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank You","Doctor":"Hi there, I understand your doctors have found out some small lymph nodes and either they can be monitored or can be biopsied. Both the options are reasonable and it depends on how anxious you are really. Just tell the doctor to recommend you the  better option of the both (I think monitoring would be fine if the lymph nodes are too small to feel) All your blood tests are fine and these tests fluctuate always and is a normal thing. I'm sure your ENT doctor is doing a fine job and be guided by him. Regards"},{"Patient":"My Father-Inlaw finished Throat Cancer treatment a year ago this November.

I am already waiting for surgery but am wondering if this means a more in depth surgery or is it something more I need to be concerned about like cancer tumor instead of a calcified buldge that the last MRI showed back in august.","Doctor":"Hi there, please read the report again and see the conclusion. Multiplanar mean multi planes of acquisition and multi sequence is meaning that they did multiple sessions of their tests (which is done in each and every MRI, not only yours). So this is just technical jargon and hence no need to get alarmed.

At first they would move slightly when pushed on but are going rock hard now. She had an ultra sound done yesterday but didn t seem to be too worried and was told they couldn t tell what they where. I am worried as her gp thinks she has carcinoid cancer or syndrome but won t do an MRI or ct scan. Please guide me as what we should do now!","Doctor":"Hi there, Are you sure its carcinoid? They usually arise in gut or lung and may be you mean to say carcinoma? Kindly rediscuss with your GP and confirm if there are some miscommunications. You can always take a second opinion with a surgeon if you are worried. Take care"},{"Patient":"hi i was just wondering because my mother has stage 4 cancer . She takes alot of hydrocodone , which as you know contqains alot of tylenol . The nurses,(from hospice) offerred her many options and a couple were roxicets (prn) My question is, I was under the assumption that Roxicets contained no acetomidephine. Upon doing research, I discovered that, my assumption was incorrect. Which medication in that classifactions contain no acetomidephine?","Doctor":"Hi there, Acetaminonophen is paracetamol or crocin and is considered one of the safest drugs out there. There has been concerns of liver toxicity with very high intake and may be prolonged intake like for years, otherwise its a very well tolerated medicine. It is a common ingredient of pain killer combos used in carcinoma patients. In case you still want to know drugs without acetaminophen , some of commonly used are codeine, tramodol, ibugesic , mefenamic acid , diclofenac etc.Take care"},{"Patient":"This examination was performed after detecting architectural distortion at the left breast in a previous mammogram dated February 26, about 2 weeks ago. The current examination revealed no mass lesion or cyst at either breast in both T1 and fast T2 pulse sequences. The body coil axillary views revealed no significant lymphadenopathy at either side. The post IV contrast injection series show diffuse glandular enhancement estimated to be about 60% as the examination is performed during the last week of menstrual period. Focal intense enhancing spot is seen at the medial aspect of the left breast lower down at the junction of the anterior and middle thirds. The time intensity kinetic curve over this spot shows dye accumulation and delayed rapid washout segment. Impression: Bilateral fibroadenosis with suspicious area at the left breast medial aspect lower down at the junction between the anterior and middle thirds,BIRADAS 4. could You dr explain to me this report .....???","Doctor":"Hi there, It seems MRI is picking up an abnormality which needs further evaluation. The report BIRADS 4 means there is some probability of being malignant (range from 3% to 94%) which literally means that biopsy has to be done. Most probably your doctor will recommend a biopsy by needle to look into it.Take care"},{"Patient":"I am a 47 years old female who passed a breast cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy ), I have some dizziness and done MRI, the result is: Some T2 hypersignal foci are seen in deep and periventricular white matter and centum semiovale. This appearance is not specific but can indicate microvascular ischemic changes. Please help me to know what does it mean and is it serious or not? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi there, These changes may mean that the small blood vessels of brain have ruptured or clotted in very small areas. These findings are common in elderly population with longstanding hypertension or diabetes. Your dizziness may be explained by this finding.

Rather than giving in to the feeling of hopelessness, try to visit cancer support groups or survivor meetings and volunteer in hospitals and try to help the people who need help. Small things like even giving directions and chatting people up can make a huge difference.

I ve also been having upper right abdominal discomforts which is slightly better now although now i have occasional sharp stabbing pains in those areas.I also have frequent diarrhea and spasms all over my body and sometimes terrible headaches which can just sometimes come like an explosion and for some seconds I will be confused. My injuries also take longer to heal and I ve seen an ENT, done a CT Scan of my head, abdomen and pelvis which all came out fine. The CTScan of my head only revealed concha bullosa which all the doctors dismissed as nothing. I have also done two liver function tests , an ESR and two Complete Blood Counts. The tests are all okay but the LFT showed my direct bilirubin was slightly elevated though my eyes aren t yellow (even two years after). The first CBC showed my RDW was slightly elevated, the MCHC was slightly low and the Monocytes was very high at 16.9% (upper limit of normal range is 10%). In the second CBC test about a month after, all tests were normal but the lymphocytes were slightly low. I have also done bleeding tests as well as a Coagulation Profile which shows my blood doesn t clot easily despite that all clotting ingredients are normal. I also have these painless nodes (about the size of a peanut) under my jaw and they have never increase in size for over 6yrs now. I also once had an itchy dark patch over my left eye lid for close to a year but it disappeared about three years ago. It also seems I can t concentrate too easily and sometimes forget things. I m very worried right now and do not know what to expect. Could it be Cancer?","Doctor":"Hi there, None of the symptoms and signs you have mentioned is pointing towards cancer.

I know stage 4 is a killer how long would you think she had?  I live in Salt lake she lives in Sacramento","Doctor":"hi,thank you for your query.i'm sorry for your sister's health.stage IV ovarian carcinoma is the stage at which metastasis has reached far off organs.Ovarian cancer that has reached Stage IV is the most deadly form of the condition.i am sorry to say that less than five percent of the women diagnosed with Stage IV ovarian cancer survive for five years after the cancer is discovered.all the treatments done during this time are aimed at reducing the tumour bulk as removing it completely becomes nearly impossible.generally a cytoreductive surgery is done to reduce tumour size.Cytoreductive surgery performed in Stage IV ovarian cancer patients is nearly always followed with aggressive chemotherapy treatment in an attempt to destroy the cancerous cells left in the abdomen following the surgery. The most common chemotherapy drugs administered during this phase of treatment are paclitaxel and a platinum compound such as Platinol or Paraplatin.thank you,you can contact me for any further queries."},{"Patient":"sir,i m giving you a report on usg /histopathology.. smears show squamous cells consisting of superficial and intermediate squamous cells admixed with inflammatory cells and degenerated cells.clusters of benign endocervical cells are also present.No dysplastic or malignant cells seen..my age is 48..is there any matter of worry about the cancer or tumor plz answer me..i will be very thankful to u..sir","Doctor":"Hi there, The report is normal and shows the shedding cells which is completely common finding..

Can you please tell me why this is?","Doctor":"Hi, It appears to be due to hernia, that is why when that part of intestine is stretched by moving, or sneezing, it is stretched and you are getting pain.                        I advise you to consult a surgeon for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to have U.S.scaning for confirmation.                        Probably you need to have surgery for complete relief.

I am 61 and have never had anything like this happen, ever. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi there,It seems that you need an urgent medical attention. I hope you are eating and taking fluids as what you are mentioning may be most likely due to low blood sugar or hypoglycemia.

The doctors said that because of her young age, they can t do anything until she is 2 years old and if more lesion breaks out they need to check for cancer . Could there be any other diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hi there, You need to specify where the lesions were? Body is too vague but by the description of yellow fluid being drained it sounds like collection of fluid more due to some infective process than cancer.

They told that it is an adenoid cystic carinoma.Is it dangerous even after surgery and radiation.can you please say which level of tumor it is.we are afraid that it is a cancer,is it curable.","Doctor":"Hi there, This is a rare type of carcinoma commonly occurring in salivary glands of head and neck region. Lymph nodes are negative which is a good thing but in view of perineural invasion she would be most likely advised post operative radiotherapy as this tumor has high likelihood of coming back locally. This type of cancer grows slowly and is considered resistant to therapies, but of course timely treatment would help in good control and cure rates.

She is suffering from a bunch of side effects...diarrhoea, severe pain in the legs, etc. For the past two days, she has been rambling and speaking incoherently. If someone asks a question, she can give a coherent reply, but goes back to rambling. i) Can incoherent speech be a side effect of medication? What could possible reasons be? ii) Also, what would the estimated survival time for such a patient?","Doctor":"Hi there, She seems to be delirious. It can be because of side effects of medications, but also can be a sign of electrolyte imbalance (salt levels in blood), or high level of toxins (like urea/ creatinine) or even infection. I would recommend you to see the oncologist or nephrologist as early as possible as many times these conditions can be easily corrected by doing blood tests and treating accordingly or with change in medications as the case may be.

Whenever there is pain after breast reconstruction surgery, first issue to rule out is recurrence of cancer. Get her examined by the operating surgeon. Once recurrence is ruled out then other reasons of pain could be looked into.

It is definitely worth to treat him for this otherwise the tumor will keep on growing with him having problems of bleeding, pain, infection etc and he would suffer from it.

Red cell to 6 , 2 units. I wish someone would give me at least some kind of prognosis since he has 5 more chemo treatments scheduled, and I know this happens every time. How many times can the human body take these counts, withour death?","Doctor":"Hi there, The benefit versus toxicity of chemotherapy is always a debatable and difficult situation and naturally brings anxiety to care givers and physicians alike. If we were to not give chemo then disease will progress relentlessly and he would be suffering from disease progression. Chemotherapy may cause low red cells and low platelets but thankfully we have medical measures for them and can support the body Also according to side effects, oncologists would adjust the dose. No one can tell how much chemo human body can take as many times patients are given third line or fourth line chemo, it really depends on the bone marrow reserve and the general condition of the patient.

How about the possibility of using the cyberknife to get all of the miscroscopic cells out that keep growing back.","Doctor":"Hi there,Cyberknife and other machines like rapidarc, linacs etc are various machines/ techniques to give radiation only. They may vary in their capacity to accurately deliver in millimeters precision but they all can only be used where radiation has some proven efficacy. In Papillary thyroid carcinomas radiotherapy by external beam has limited data and your oncologists and clinicians have to deliberate if there is a role for external beam radiotherapy and if yes then in your case there may be a role of cyberknife.

I ve been told that with traditional cancer treatments the medicine often does not reach the cell. In your experience what is the success/ failure rate of traditional treatments? Also how much of a difference would a treatment that can deliver the medicine directly to the cell make to your patients?","Doctor":"Hi there, Traditional cancer medicines are harmful in many ways. They cause delay in people seeking modern treatment. Even if one starts on treatment , they may stop it believing in traditional treatment methods etc. Once the cancer progresses beyond any cure and patients suffer in pain etc, they return to hospitals and then its too late for modern medicine to offer anything but pain relief and palliative care. The traditional cancer doctors are usually very nice talkers and give plenty of time and listen to patients and more or less play with vulnerable patients emotions and then once they fail they put the blame back on the patients for not doing things exactly according to their instructions etc.... Also people are cheated financially in the process. Any person advertising alternative or traditional methods and claiming cure should be prosecuted.

One can take antihistamines for itching for symptomatic relief. If there is fungal infection of skin of perianal region, one may need antifugals as well.

On the right side of my tongue, I had a grayish spot with little freckles around it. A week later the left side had some discoloration as well. I m scared and can t sleep much waiting on the pathology report to come back. Since yesterday, the swelling went down, I m able to speak and my tongue has white stuff on it and theres lots of bruising . I m afraid it might be cancer.","Doctor":"Hi there,I understand your anxiety and concern, but nothing short of biopsy report can conclusively tell if it is a cancer or not. I'm happy that you got biopsy done and did the right thing. Now we just wait for the report and in the mean time try to develop a healthy lifestyle, do some light exercise or try walking for 1 mile or so evening or morning. Improve your diet. Take care"},{"Patient":"My 11 month old son had a chest xray recently and I got a call back from the er saying they noticed a spot on his 3rd left rib. They said cartilage did not form to bone as it should and they are giving us an urgent referral to an  to run more tests. I am dying here waiting for the call and I have been searching online for anything at all like she described and nothing comes up except cancer . I know you can t diagnose cancer but is there anything else it could be? The er doctor was concerned.","Doctor":"Hi there,As you rightly pointed out I can't comment on if its cancer or not. What I can tell you is it would be very very rare indeed for a 11 month old to develop a bone or cartilage cancer.......So let them investigate but chances would be overwhelmingly against cancer. All the bestRegards"},{"Patient":"Yesterday...the third time in six months I developed severe chills or rigor. Prior to the onset of the shakes my hands were so cold that I put on gloves in a 72 degree room. Then I was shaking uncontrollably. I didn t seem to have a fever and just went to bed to keep warm. After an hour it stopped leaving me with very sore back muscles. After about 24 hours of feeling drained with little energy. After waking up after sleeping off the chills I noticed a slight difficulty in swallowing . After the gradual 24 hour recovery I feel fine...just normal. Like I said, this happened three times with an interval of about three months. I m 76 and as a kid had measles mumps and chicken pox ...very healthy until I came down with stage four bladder cancer . It had spread to my liver and lungs and the doctors told me that only 3% of patients respond as well as I did to chemo . That was over 3 1/2 years ago and I m now minus a bladder and prostate , but supposedly cancer-free and go in for an annual CT scan and examination by my doctor at the James Cancer Hospital at The Ohio State University.","Doctor":"Hi there,I'm happy to know that you have done well after treatment and are on regular followup.Chills and rigors are usually caused by infection. When the bad bacteria finds way to get into blood circulation, the body fights by secreting proteins and chemicals and most of the times alongside chills, fever is present. In case its happening repeatedly do check temperature by thermometer and report to the doctor. Regards"},{"Patient":"i am fed through the stomach dont eat or drink not for about three and a half years to 4 years i live on 5 bottles of resource 2.0 plus fibre. also drink1 litre of water a day had cancer of throat . but i seem to be urinating more often, during the night i go nearly every 2 hours even through the day.is there a reason this should happen, i am 73 years old but really fit","Doctor":"Hi there, The reason for frequency of urination may not be related to throat cancer at all. You may be having enlarged prostate or urinary infection. Report to doctor and get your prostate examined and urine analysis as well. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi i just had a abdominalpelvic ct with oral and iv contrast and it said Small non specific nodular densitiy in the right lower lobe Colonic diverticulosis Mild mesenteric panniculitis Non specific retrocrural lymph node Can you please let my know my dr is in vacasion for two weeks thanks","Doctor":"hello user,Your CT scan report has 2 conditions which need to be treated and might require surgical resection as per your gastroenterologists advice.The CT scan report suggests you are having some inflammatory focus in a part of your intestine which gives nutrition to intestine, but the presence of lymph node is not good sign, thats why you are requested to move to another surgeon and get your CT scan reports checked.hope my info helped youregards,Dr Hari Om ChandrakarMBBS"},{"Patient":"Hi please can you help me in November 2012 I had a 15 cm sarcoma cancer removed including most of my pelvis and replaced with metal screws into my spine and pelvis area while recovering at home and trying to recover I used a hot water bottle on my back but because of the epidural I was unable to feel until my friend noticed a huge blister had formed I then allowed it to heal and then a week or two ago I pulled off a scab that looked like I tooth root and thereafter it was open with a small hole with water coming out! Yesterday I had a plaster over it and today I removed it take note having had a bath with this on I then removed it and there was pus comming out no stench just pus but I am in serious pain from my lower back to my behind I a, struggling to walk what can this be what can I do ? Please can you give me advise thank you NB: the little hole is just next to the one metal screw which I have always been able to feel even after my surgery which gets inflamed in cold weather but never really caused me unbearable pain","Doctor":"Hi there,It seems you are having what we call as fistula which is an abnormal opening outside from internal cavity. You need to report to your operating surgeon as early as possible and get it thoroughly evaluated. You may be at risk of catching infection as well. Take care, Regards"},{"Patient":"Hey i have been having alot of symptoms including night sweets swollen lymphnodes weight loss loss of appetite lost about 35-40 pounds unintentionally i recently had a ct scan and it revealed i have a hypnotic cyst as well as an involving cyst i was wondering if lymphoma involves these symptoms and should i still get a biopsy done on my lymphnodes","Doctor":"Hi there,You should see a doctor and follow medical advise, not all swollen lymph nodes are lymphoma and in case the doctor feels its due to infection, then probably after a course of antibiotics it may disappear. The decision to go or not go for biopsy would be best taken along with the medical opinion as to if it is needed at all.Regards"},{"Patient":"I was on Humira for 6 months. I had told the dr. that I was subject to diverticulits, but she said it would not be a problem. Well, it was and I ended up with an infection so severe I had to have my sigmoid removed and had I not I would only have lived three to five months. That was in Nov. Now I have lymphoma and kidney cancer and I only have one kidney. What do I do now?","Doctor":"Hi there,Humira is known to cause severe infections. Are you still on it? What is the type and stage of lymphoma. Also for kidney cancer, what was the stage and pathology report. Have you not seen oncologist for the above conditions. Kindly give more details for me to be able to comment anything definitively. For lymphoma there are various options ranging from observation to chemotherapy to transplants. For Renal carcinoma for post operative patients again one may be kept of observation alone to chemotherapy or immunotherapy options.Take care"},{"Patient":"Just 6 months ago my father(64 years old) had an surgery of colo rectal cancer and he had gone through both chemotharapy and radiation after surgery. But after surgery also he frequently passes stool after every half an hour. Please suggest what kind food he can have and will he be as normal as before or he will suffer from frequenty passing stool for whole life.","Doctor":"Hi there,The frequency and consistency of the stool will not be same as for normal people since the lower part of intestine/ rectum has been bypassed. Take help of stoma nurse or stoma society in your area. Follow precautions like emptying bag when one third full (stool/urine/gas). Take well balanced diet and plenty of water.

You should see your doctor if the symptoms persists.It sounds like you are having  hypersensitive airways after flu. Also possible is infection of the lungs and bronchitis as you are continuing to smoke. With past history of double malignancy and in case of doubt if the doctor doesn't think its because of infection, getting a plain Chest xray is not a bad idea either.Regards"},{"Patient":"yes, myhusband take chemo and had a rash , try all kind of med s . cream etc now he has blister and some are breaking and his tshirt is stuck on his back and has raw skin so its hard to pulll off plus the shower water hurt and I can t get him into the tub becasue his legs, arm are swollen too.... and the knees have rash too he said every thing hurt... he had chemo Monday B12 short and Tuesday we went to the Hospital for 2 pts of blood.","Doctor":"Hi there, If the removing shirt has become too painful I don't see any other option than to go to hospital and take expert help.
