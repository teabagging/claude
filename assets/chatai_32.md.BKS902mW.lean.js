I can understand your son's situation and problem. Your son is having blunt chest trauma due to football hitting. Usually this does not cause any major internal damage. But since he is having reddish stool, we should rule out internal damage like stomach injury or lung injury. So better to get done chest x ray to rule out lung injury. If chest x ray is normal than no need to worry for lung injury. Get done stool microscopic examination. If it is positive for red blood cells than he needs upper GI scopy for the diagnosis of stomach injury. If stool examination is normal than no need to worry much. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your situation and problem. Any kind of smoke (whether it's cigarette smoke or hookah smoke) can cause irritation in the airways. This irritation can sometimes produce inflammatory reaction and edema and cause bronchitis. This bronchitis is the main reason for trouble breathing, cough, expectoration etc. So better to quit hookah smoking as soon as possible. Consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only.

I can understand your situation and problem. Scar tissue in lungs is permanent. It will remain same and will be seen as it is life long. Since it is not a disease or infection, no treatment is available or required for it. For your visa problem, we need to prove that this lesion is inactive and non infectious. And for this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax with Contrast 2. Bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both these are negative for infectious disease than you can definitely argue with visa authority about not having active, infections disease and your lesion on x ray is old, healed, inactive scar lesions.

Shortness of breath and chest pain are also seen in lung diseases like bronchitis and asthma.

The congestion starts to come back and about mid day I have been getting sinus pressure and headaches. I have started to notice a tightness in my right jaw as well. Could this be a serious concern? Should I see a dr or is it just bronchitis that will go away soon? I have noticed a slight improvement in the chest congestion but the jaw pain has me worried","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concerns.Cough of 2 weeks is commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. Get a chest x ray done, a normal rules out lung infection.

I can understand your situation and problem. You are having morbid obesity. And so possibility of dyslipidemia is high in your case.

Treatment of this is weight reduction and anti coagulant therapy with warfarin or Coumadin. These anti coagulant drugs cause gastritis.

So recovery is also delayed. Usually recovery is expected after 2 months of regular treatment. Tuberculosis causes pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). And this causes chest pain and arm pain. She is on treatment since 1 month and so it is very early to see improvement. In my opinion, she should take treatment for 1 more month because usually 2 months are required for  clinical and symptomatic improvement in tuberculosis. If after 2 months, she is still having pain than get done chest x ray and sputum report to rule out drug resistant tuberculosis. But at present, wait for 1 more month. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing her good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello. My wife is suddenly having difficulty exhaling. She has never smoked, nor does she have asthma. She hasn't been ill or had any type of cold.

And so it is raised if inflammation is there in the body. Bilateral hilar prominence is commonly seen in bronchitis, tuberculosis (due to hilar lymphnode enlargement), sarcoidosis etc. And in all these conditions cause raised ESR. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) and CT thorax. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. CT thorax is needed to rule out tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.Wish you good health .

He went to the emergency room and they took an x-ray and basically rushed him out of the door due to his lack of insurance. His symptoms are extreme pain, with no bruising or swelling. It hurts when he lays down and even when he swallows. He was prescribed Ibuprofin 800 as well as a muscle relaxer but the pain does not let up. Is there anything else he can do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your friend's situation and problem. He is having chest pain on swallowing and lying down, and not improving with painkiller (ibuprofen) so possibility of GERD related pain is more. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Lying down position makes reflux more easy. So better to keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. Ask him to avoid painkiller drugs. Start proton pump inhibitors (antacid).  Ask him to avoid stress and tension, avoid hot and spicy food, avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Ask him to quit smoking and alcohol if he has these habits. He will mostly improve with all these.. If not improving than consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) scopy. Hope I have solved your query.

The physician decided to measure his VC. Describe the apparatus and method used for taking this measurement. Define the following terms used in the description of lung volumes: TV, IRV, ERV, RV, and VC","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand concern. TV is tidal volume. IRV is inspiratory reserve volume. ERV is expiratory reserve volume. RV is residual volume and VC is vital capacity. All these are lung volumes and capacities at different phases of respiration (inspiration & expiration). Since patient is having past history of pneumonia, it is better to check lung condition at present before recruitment. Past history of pneumonia can cause permanent lung damage and decrease in lung functions. So better to check before recruitment. Volume of air during normal breathing is TV. Volume of air present in the lungs after deep forceful inspiration is IRV. Volume of air expired after deep inspiration is ERV. Volume of air moving in and out after forceful breathing is VC. Volume of air present in the lungs after forceful expiration is RV. All these calculations are made by spirometer. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your patient.

Since your stress test is negative, no need to worry for any major cardiac diseases as a cause for your chest fluttering. In my opinion, your symptoms are mostly due to uncontrolled GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). You need to follow certain lifestyle modifications along with drugs to control GERD symptoms. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Go for walk after meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. With all these and drugs, you will definitely improve. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"my husband has been experiencing dizzy spells,light headedness,chest PRESSURE,blacking out,and burning in the stomache after eating.been to 2 emergency rooms,paramedics checked him out doctor visists and medical clinics and noone can give him an answer.What can be causing this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your husband's situation and problem. Possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more because his symptoms are more after eating. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain, burping, burning stomach, chest tightness, pressure etc. So ask him to avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid smoking and alcohol if he has these habits. Ask him to start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Walk after meals is helpful to prevent GERD. Don't worry, with all these he will definitely improve. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My mother has been diabetic since 1987. Her age is 70 years and Weight 55 Kgs. As of now she is on insulin shots 26 Unit in night and 45 Units in morning along with Glycomate GP 2 Forte 1 tb in morning. The Blodd is well under control since last 7-8 months after induction of insulin. THe last reading taken was 60 in fasting and 114 in PP. The local Dr has advised to reduce the night dosage to 22 units and keep the morning dosage same. Recently she started taking Blood Pressure medicine since las 7-8 months. Even the BP is under control. She is taking Telminorm AM once daily in morning. Yesterday I took the reading of BP and found that it was 131/60 with pulse rate as 105. This seems to be a matter of concern to me. After consultation with local Dr, she has been advised to take Telminorm 80 instead of Telminorm AM. My question is that is Telminorm 80 having more power than Telminorm AM ? I am of the opinion that some lower dosage medicine shd be prescribed.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to 'Ask a Doctor' service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I think 131/60 BP Is fine, it's not too elevated and the change of medicine with not help. Although her pulse rate is elevated and change will not reduce pulse rate also. Regarding your question, telminorm Am has two BP medicine and telminorm 80 has only one component so potency strength wise there is not much difference.My advise is just monitor the resting BP and pulse rate and if BP goes above 140/90 then increasing the medicine would be needed. Also pulse rate is persistently high, then get her thyroid and hemoglobin tested and beta blocker medicine will be needed.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Sagar Makode"},{"Patient":"this afternoon when bent over almost in a stretch to touch my toes, it felt like an organ or something was pushing out from underneath my rib cage about an inch to the right from the center.  it didn't hurt but took about a minute or so for it to go away.  this isn't the first time it's happened.  any advice?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic.

No pneumonia after angioplasty is not common. But it is mostly due to hospital acquired infection. His breathlessness is also due to pneumonia. Another possibility is heart failure.

I understand your concern. The flush of adrenalin and noradrenalin in the system, characteristic of panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder, is accompanied with rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, shortness of breath, sometimes dizziness and other symptoms, such as chest pain. Panic attacks do not have a known cause, there are only theories regarding this issues. However, they have known triggers and, I assume, you know them best. It is a public speech or performance, going in crowded places, or going into an elevator, that trigger the panic attack and the common question in one's head \\"how am I going to get out if something terrible happens?\\" \\"I am going to faint in front of all these people?\\" \\"Am I going to die?\\" \\"Is something terrible happening to me?\\" etc. All the symptoms from this point on are attributed to the mechanism described above. But, if these are very worrisome events to you and they affect somehow your quality of life, school or sleep, I encourage you to see a psychiatrist and discuss about a course of sedatives to treat this situation. Also, I recommend you to get an EKG just to exclude any cardiac origin to this problem. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"i have been having pain in the middle of my chest off and on for a few months now. over the past week or so i am having worse chest pains that last most of the day off and on. sometimes it is sharp pain today it is dull and achy and my back is sore too","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to HCM. I understand your concern. Well, I am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the ribcage. There is angina. It is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. It is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. An EKG obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. Then there is pleuritic chest pain. This kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. No radiation like in anginal pain. It arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the ribcage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. In this regard, I would recommend a chest X-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. In case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echo cardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. Other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. In the end, stress can also cause chest pain. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Best regards, Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"I'm taking Ramipril for high Blood Pressure and have been suffering with a mucus cough for a couple of weeks now.

Jackie Gaskin","Doctor":"Hi,how is your blood pressure is it controlled or not.Take electronic bp apparatus and try to monitor bp and pulse rate and make a chart.Considering your bp is normal and you r having angina, you should be started tab nitroglycerin 2.6 at 8 am and 4 pm. Also if your pulse rate is higher than 70 then dose of bisoprolol can be increased. Simvastatin should not be stopped. first start nitroglycerin and review back. we can later modify other drugs."},{"Patient":"Yesterday I was drinking a sip of water when I choked and couldn t breath.

Should I go to the hospital. Oh and the evening before I nearly fainted.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely go to hospital and consult doctor. By your history and description, possibility of either heart disease or lung disease is more. So better to get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. Get done respiratory system examination and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out lung disease. If all the above mentioned reports are normal than sometimes stress and tension can cause similar symptoms. So if you are having stress or tension than avoid it and be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright but first consult doctor and rule out cardiac and Pulmonary causes. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Fatigue, difficulty in breathing and wheezing are seen in lung infection, bronchitis etc. So chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis.

I can understand your wife's situation and problem. Wheezing since 8 years is commonly seen with asthma or bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) for the diagnosis of asthma and bronchitis. PFT will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. She is taking only budecort . It contains budesonide. It is inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).  Along with ICS, inhaled bronchodilators are also useful for control of wheezing. Oral antihistamine and anti allergic drugs are also beneficial.

His chest X ray examination shows \\"Prominent Bronchovascular markings are seen in both lungfields.\\" He is having the cough problem since last 15 days. Please suggest what is the clinical significance of X Ray reading. Thanking You","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for this x ray report. Prominent bronchovascular markings (BVM) are commonly seen due to viral infection, bronchitis etc. Normally bronchus appear black on chest x ray. So it can not be seen. But in case of viral infection and bronchitis (inflammation), wall of bronchus becomes edamatous and visible on chest x ray. Along with bronchus, blood vessels also engorged and visible on x ray. So togather they are known as prominent bronchovascular markings. In children, viral infection is more common.

My mother had a biopsy this morning in England and after it was over and she was in recovery her left lung collapsed and blood went into both her lungs (not a huge amount). They put her on oxygen, but because she has asthma, her blood became acidic because of high carbon dioxide levels. The have her on a oxygen mask which is on firmly and have inserted a drainage tube. When I asked about her oxygen saturation levels they said she was at 99%, but wanted her to be closer to 82%. Am I missing something? I thought normal oxygen saturation levels should be between 95-100%. I know this as I have just gone through 6 weeks of my colleagues Mum in ICU who died from Lung Cancer and who worked as a nurse. So I speak a lot of time talking over treatment with the doctors as I was the one who remained calm. My Mother is 82, very active, does have a slow heart because they lasered off an extra valve and is not overweight. I am trying to control things from here as I have an hysterical sister!!! I just spoke with them again and they said she is definitely more alert, than she was 4 hours ago.","Doctor":"The oxygen needs to be on the lower side in order to control her carbon dioxide levels and also control her acidosis. If she is more alert now then it indicates that her carbon dioxide levels are lower and probably she is improving."},{"Patient":"Yes, I am a 47 year old woman who is concerned lately about my overall health.  I have been seeing a urologist for the past 4 years regarding gross hematuria or blood in my urine.  He has run all sorts of tests to rule things out and cannot determine where the blood is coming from.  Upon a recent ultrasound of my kidneys, they found that I also have hemangiomas on my liver.  The blood in my urine was originally found by my primary care doctor during a physical.  I had been feeling overly tired and still do.  I am also hypothyroid.  During an MRI of my neck for an unrelated injury, they found I had tumor on my left thyroid gland.  It was removed and I was placed on Levoxyl.  About a 8 months later and having neck surgery for 3 ruptured discs I began having swallowing problems, a larger tumor was found on my right thyroid.  A gastroenterologist removed the gland and said everything was contained and other than trying to regulate my thyroid medicine I am doing well.  I then developed a rash on my face.  I have been tested 3 times for lupus each time the results are negative thank goodness.  My primary care doctor is in the process of checking my thyroid levels again to see if my medicine needs adjusting which seems to happen quite frequently.  I am a very active and busy lady and attribute my aches and pains to getting older however lately, I am totally exhausted even after sleeping 7- 8 hours.  I have been having chest pains that come and go...it almost feels like a charlie horse in the middle of my chest.  My hair is falling out, my bones hurt if that is possible, I am cold all the time, I've been getting night sweats, my color is pale.  I am waiting to be seen this next week by my doctor.  I was just curious if a lupus test can show up negative and a patient actually has it or signs of it.  Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated","Doctor":"Your symptoms suggests that you probably have anemia and it would  be ideal if you could consult hematologist to look  for the cause. Also fatigue can also be related to hypothyroidism. A negative lupus test does not rule out lupus , about 2% have a negative lupus test. That is if you have done a ANA test and is negative do go ahead and get anti-ro/ssa, antiphospholipid antibody if not done earlier."},{"Patient":"I am 62 years old,1.6meters and fairly lightweight.

Since then, I have been prescribed 50mg Atenolol and the heart palpitations are gone, but I still have periodic pain in my left chest, but never due to exertion. Lately, I feel a whooshing sensation under and to the left of my right nipple. How common is pain associated with Mitral Valve, and is regurgitation a possible suspect?","Doctor":"Hi,Palpitations may be caused by mitral valve prolapse, but pain is not typical for the prolapse and most probably has another cause. It may be a neuromuscular pain and caused by costochondritis or spine problems.

I also feel very dizzy.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. But better to first get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases because they present with similar symptoms. So first get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal than no need to worry for heart diseases. Stress and anxiety are the causes for your symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions, try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. So don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Should I let it go a day or so and see if it gets any better? I just took some alieve to hopefully help with the pain.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. You are mostly having musculoskeletal pain due to over stretching. So no need to worry much for this. This will mostly improve with following in 1-2 days. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise.. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. If not improving with all these in 2 days than consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Can you please suggest, whether the medicine suggested are perfectly okay or need to take the 2nd opinion?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No, you should not directly start these drugs. Eosinophils are raised in allergy, filariasis, parasitic infection and drug induced. Allergy is most likely cause for high eosinophils. Hetrazan is antifilarial drug. No need for this drug because possibility of filariasis is less in your case. In filariasis, eosinophils are markedly raised while in your case they are mildly raised. So no need to take Hetrazan. Deriphyllin is bronchodilator. It is given in asthma. So if you are not having breathlessness than no need for deriphyllin. In my opinion, you should only take combination of antihistamine and anti allergic drugs. These will control your allergy and hence reduce the eosinophils. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I had a TB test done on June 5, 2012 and had the results read on June 7, 2012 which was 0mm.

Could I have TB?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for tuberculosis in your case. You are showing delayed reaction and it is suggestive of either vaccination or immunity against tuberculosis. You had montoux test (MT).  In which tubercular antigens are injected in the skin. If reaction develops within 48-72 hours than possibility of TB infection is more. After 48-72 hours, if reaction occur than this suggests previous vaccination with BCG or immunity against tuberculosis. So in your case, you developed skin reaction after 6 days, so you are not having infection. So no need to worry for tuberculosis in your case. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

No need to worry much because your heart and lung related diseases because your work up for them is done during hospitalization and it is negative. Possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more in your case. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central, sub sternal chest pain. This can also cause gaseous discomfort. Follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.

Chest pain with spider veins on rib cage is commonly seen with lung conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis or lung cancer. So better to get done chest x ray first.

He also drinks like a fish, almost every night. Mostly Busch beer. I don't want it to be anything major. What do you think it is?

It is a self limiting situation and resolves on its own. Alcohol is a renowned nerve toxin and may lead to motor and sensory neuropathy also.So, limitation of alcohol intake is certainly advised. But as you said the other problem is gas and left sided chest pain, in view of all the risk factors like alcoholism and smoking, your friend surely needs a health check-up. As the sensation of gas in heart can be angina and coronary artery disease. Start at least with blood sugar( fasting, PP), fasting lipid profile, ECG.chest X-ray, Blood pressure measurement.

I have never suffered from any kind of heart diseases before (that I know of). I'm a 26 year old european woman. What can it be that causes this pain?

You didn't tell about any other symptom like cough,fever or increased sputum production. But as you say blowing nose leads you to left sided chest pain, it seems you have increased sputum production. If it is yellowish white in color, most probably a pneumonia or bronchopneumonia with pleuritic chest pain could be the diagnosis. Proceed with an x-ray chest pa view and a complete hemogram. It will lead to a definitive diagnosis.

It seems from your problem that your upper respiratory tract infection has converted to lower respiratory tract infection. If the culture report is available, its better to use antibiotics accordingly. Steam inhalation with salt added to water will definitely soothe you. Logenges will help you in sore throat.

What was the other associated symptoms?  What is your age and sex is another important question. Do you have any other symptoms like wt loss, fever , joint pain , swelling of feet ,etc...or any history of diabetes or hypertension.

Smoking cessation should be done as soon as possible in any case. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).

Post infectious bronchitis is also a possibility and coughing is common symptom in it. So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) and if it shows obstructive defect than he may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi, for the past few months, it has been difficult to breathe, my chest feels really heavy and i find myself gasping for air a lot of the times. and recently, little pimple-like spots appeared on my hands, are the 2 symptoms linked? if so, what is the cause? and if not, what are the causes?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern.Breathing difficulty with heaviness in chest since few months is mostly due to either Pulmonary (bronchitis) or cardiac (heart failure) causes. Bronchitis is mostly due to viral infection. You are also having skin lesions on hands. Viral infection can cause skin lesions. So we need to first rule out bronchitis in your case. So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If PFT is normal, get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart failure. So your chest symptoms and hand lesions can be due to viral bronchitis. But we need to rule out cardiac diseases as well. So consult doctor and discuss all these. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, I woke up this morning and found that I could not laugh, cough, or breath deeply without feeling pain down the right side of my rib cage.  I didn't take much notice and dismissed it as sleeping awkward, throughout the day walking, sitting and sometimes talking has been a bit of an effort.  I have also discovered that I cannot lie on my right side.  Do I need to be concerned?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of pleuritic chest pain is more in your case. Chest pain with coughing, laughing, deep breathing etc is characteristic of pleuritic pain. It can due to inflammation of pleura. And lung infection is the most common cause for this. So better to get done chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal than no need to worry for major lung disease. Musculoskeletal pain can be the cause. So avoid movements causing pain. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright. First rule out lung infection. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I feel on some rocks a little over a year ago, and I'm pretty sure I broke a rib though I never went to see a doctor.  My rib still bothers me it feels like someone is pushing their finger in my rib all the time.

Even if you have fractured rib, by the time it must have healed. But healing might not be proper because you have not taken proper treatment for this. So possibility of malunion (inappropriate healing) of fractured rib is more in your case. So in my opinion, you should get done chest x ray to rule out this. Treatment is conservative only. Wear rib belt to avoid mobilisation of segments. This will improve healing in alignment. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected site. All these will give you symptomatic relief. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 32 yrs old male 5.7ft 2 70kgs. I smoke 2 cig every day.

I can understand your concern. Since your extensive cardiac work up is normal, no need to worry for heart diseases for your pain. You are active smoker. And so you are at high risk of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).  Cigarette smoke actually causes laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. So acid content of stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning central chest pain, belching, nausea etc. So get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) scopy for the diagnosis of GERD. If this is present than you need to start proton pump inhibitors. Quit smoking as soon as possible because it is not good habit. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

He sleeps about 15 hours a day and is beginning to be confused about daily things such as what day it is, where he is supposed to be going etc. He is also continuously cold and has tingling in his hands. His doctor says he doesn't need oxygen but it sounds like CO2 retention to me. An advice?","Doctor":"Hello I have gone through your question and understand your concern. COPD patients often suffer with hypercapnia that is CO2 retention. Let me explain you the cause of symptoms in brief for better understanding. Due to decreased alveolar function (lung function) from COPD carbon dioxide is retained in body leading to increased CO2 in blood. Once the CO2 levels increases, blood starts binding more to CO2 than oxygen and thus Ph of blood changes to acidic leading to respiratory acidosis. Decreased oxygenation to tissue leads to poor tissue function causing mental confusion, tremors, slow breathing and eventually causes permanent damage to vital tissues like brain. This may lead to coma or sudden death due to respiratory failure.Oxygenation along with monitoring of vitals with regular arterial blood gas test is necessary for patients going into symptoms of CO2 retention. Kindly seek medical help, you may even consider setting up oxygen line and supply at home for patients with COPD. Good luck.Hope your concern is answered.

I can understand your concern. Increased bronchovascular markings are seen in bronchitis or viral infection. It is not suggestive of pneumonia. It suggests inflammation. Normally, airways are black and not seen clearly on chest x ray. They appeared black on x ray.

It's irregular, but this is the second day it has been happening.  No shortness of breath, dizziness or any other symptoms i can notice.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Muscular twitching, fluttering etc are common in trace elements deficiency like calcium, magnesium etc. It is also common in vitamin d3 and vitamin b 12 deficiency. So get done serum calcium, magnesium, vitamin d3 and vitamin b 12 levels. And if any of these is deficient than you need supplements. If all are normal than get done ecg to rule out arrhythmia because arrhythmia can rarely cause feeling of muscular fluttering. So consult doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi i am 19 years old, i run cross country and track. lately (past week or so) I have had bad headaches, dizziness, nausea, and felt extremely weak and tired. during some of our workouts (which i am normally fine with) I have had a hard time breathing.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are having recent travel history, possibility of either lung infection or bronchitis is more for your symptoms. Your symptoms like headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea and breathing difficulty are common in both of these conditions. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. So first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with a DVT and then a few days later they found I had multiple Pulmonary Embolisms.  I have had trouble breathing for a couple of years and it continues to get worse.  Lately I feel very bloated after eating or drinking just a small amount and worsening acid reflux.  An upper GI showed no GERD.  A barium x-ray showed some reflux.  I am currently on Warfarin.  Today I was told that the CT scan also showed a hepatic hemangioma. It is possible that the Hepatic Hemangioma is pressing on my lungs (causing shortness of breath) and on my stomach (causing the fullness and bloating)?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No, hepatic hemangioma is unlikely to press lung and stomach and cause symptoms. Hepatic hemangioma is actually accidental finding in most of the time and it is asymptomatic. Rarely large hemangioma can cause pressure symptoms. So if the size of your hemangioma is less than 5 cm than it is unlikely to cause these symptoms. In my opinion, Pulmonary embolism and warfarin are causing all these symptoms. Pulmonary embolism causes restrictive lung disease and this is the likely cause for your shortness of breath. Warfarin is known to cause severe gastritis and bloating. So hemangioma is unlikely cause. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, i suffer from breathlessness and a tight chest. My voice trail off at the end of a sentence during conversations. I pant after climbing up stairs. Sometimes, I have difficulty speaking as if I've run some distance. I would really appreciate your suggestion. Regards,","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having breathlessness on minimal exertion. This is common symptom in cardiac and Pulmonary diseases. So better to consult doctor and get done ecg, 2d echo to rule out cardiac diseases. If these are normal than get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out Pulmonary causes. So, better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

He also suggested doing nothing because I am not having problems breathing, I am 81 years old.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of thickened pleura and non expanding lung is more. It is common sequale after pleural effusion. No drugs are available for this thickened pleura. It is mechanical obstruction. And hence surgical removal of pleura is needed. But this surgery is quite risky and life threatening. So it is not recommended in asymptomatic patient like you. So since you are asymptomatic, no treatment is required for this. You can do chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises for lung expansion. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I saw my primary MD and he wasn't really impressed, but I'm having a hard time wearing a bra :/ without increased pain and the Ibuprofen/Naproxyn don't seem to do much to relieve it completely....Any ideas?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion you should consult orthopedic doctor to rule out costochondritis. Xiphoid process pain is commonly seen in costochondritis. It is inflammation of cartilagious joint. Tight fitted undergarments, local trauma etc are causes for this. So better to consult orthopedic doctor. Wear appropriate size undergarments. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i suffer from copd since 3 years, a lot of calcification is observed in my lungs and i suffer from extreme breathlessness, i have been taking wysolone 30mg per day since 2months however i am becomimg more breathless everyday and my face is swelling can u please advise thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. You are taking very high dose if oral steroid (wysolone) since long time (2 months). Oral steroids can cause facial edema. They can also damage kidneys and decrease urine output. So breathlessness and facial swelling are seen. End stage COPD can also cause similar symptoms by severe Pulmonary hypertension. So in my opinion, you should immediately consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, PFT (for severe of COPD), 2d echo (for severity of Pulmonary hypertension) and kidney function test. If possible, avoid oral steroids and increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My husband blood pressure, gets very high in the mornings. He also experiences light headiness & dizziness throughout the day. He is on Lisinopril with HCTZ.

Right away bleeding profusely &nurse called for help with a ER doctor, ICU nurse, & another nurse. Nurse had strattle her & put direct pressure on the groin area with her hands approximately 25-30min. After this a waiting period again of 2 1/2 hours then she stayed overnight discharged next day. One week later groin area & left leg extremely black & blue & swollen 3x times it s size. Took to ER ultrasound discovered she now has a pseudo aneurysm. I m now suspecting this was caused when nurse took line out .... or was done with angioplasty ..... what caused this????? After this time she spent 6 days in hospital now sent home & has appointment for another ultrasound in 6 weeks & possibly another procedure of some kind. So what is going on Dr s are pretty tight lipped & are not explaining much which I find really unusual.","Doctor":"Hi,this is the complication of the procedure. Pseudoaneurysm is basically bulging of the wall of the artery where the puncture it to enter into the artery, most of the case it seals within a day or two. However sometimes artery bulges out at the site leading to pseudoaneurysm. The treatment for this is tight pressure or compression at the site. From your site restrict her activities to minimal for few weeks. Sometimes if it's big then surgery is needed to repair it."},{"Patient":"My mom is having some wheezing problem. And recently she went for check-up and for all the tests and doctor said that her lungs are functioning only for 25%. Sometimes she is having pain in the ribs and near the chest, hand. And she got some swelling over there. Is there any remedy for that?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your mother's situation and problem. Lung functioning only 25% means she is having either obstructive or restrictive lung disease. And in both these conditions, lung infection is common. So possibility of chest pain is mostly due to lung infection. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray, CT thorax and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray and CT scan are needed for the diagnosis of lung Infection and restrictive diseases. PFT is needed to rule out obstructive diseases. So better to first diagnose herself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Just recently I coughed and shortly afterward felt that fluttery feeling of a palpitation.  Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, coughing can cause tachycardia (high pulse rate) and fluttering feeling in heart. Coughing is commonly due to upper or lower respiratory tract infection. And tachycardia is common in infection. Coughing itself causes strain and exertion to the body. So all these cause tachycardia. So better to consult doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray to rule out lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). You need antibiotics, antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright.

You are having COPD, acid reflux and not taking any treatment, so possibility of chest pain due to worsening acid reflux or lung infection is more. Lung infection is very common in COPD patients due to poor lung defense. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray to rule out lung infection. If your chest x ray is normal than no need to worry for lung infection. You should start treatment for COPD and acid reflux.

Welcome to HCM and thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. However, I will explain some of the forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. First, there is angina. Angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or \\"squeezing\\" feeling, localized in the mid chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. This is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). If this is your case, you should perform an EKG and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. Second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. This kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. It is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. Also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). This kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. If this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest X-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. There is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. If this is the case, you can use over the counter pain killers. I hope I was thorough with my answer. Best regards. Dr. Meriton"},{"Patient":"Hi...

I have gone through your question and am here to help. Based on the description that you have given, it seems that you have a throat infection that is caused by a Streptococcus group of bacteria. But this bacteria is possibly resistant to the Amoxicillin. Also, another issue can be the dose at which the Amoxicillin was given and if you took it correctly.The right dose or amount is to take 500 mg of Amoxicillin 3 times a day for 3 days. Failing to do so can result in a resistant strain of bacteria. I recommend that you see a Doctor as soon as possible and get a culture and sensitivity done.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac cause for your left sided chest pain. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal than no need to worry for heart diseases. You are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) associated chest pain. In GERD, along with drugs, you need to follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out cardiac diseases. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I can understand your husband's situation and problem. Rcinex is having rifampicin and isoniazid. Both are hepatotoxic and cause jaundice. So better to stop Rcinex in your husband's case. Start hepatoprotective anti tubercular drugs like ethambutol, levofloxacin and streptomycin. Get done liver function tests alternate day. Once liver enzymes and bilirubin are normal, you can start Rcinex. During this period ask him to drink plenty of fluids orally. Avoid oily and spicy food.

Balasubramanian","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, presence of scar tissue on chest x ray is strong reason to reject your visa. Visa authority can reject your visa due to having possible active chest infection like tuberculosis because of scar on chest x ray. So we need to prove that this x ray finding is due to old, healed tb and not due to active tuberculosis. For this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done CT thorax with Contrast and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both are negative for tube than you can argue with visa authority that x ray lesions are due to old, healed, inactive scar and not due to active, infectious tuberculosis. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I just recently took and finished an antibiotic regement for a UTI, so I am not sure if that makes any difference.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Sternum is attached with ribs by cartilagious joint. It is not fixed and hard joint. It is somewhat mobile joint. This mobility is important in rib cage movements during respiration. On forceful movements, these cartilagious joints can make noise. So you are mostly hearing this noise. No need to worry for this because this is normal. Better to avoid such forceful pressure because it can damage these joints. Since you recently had cold and pain on deep breathing, better to get done chest x ray to rule out lung pathology. If chest x ray is normal than no need to worry for this noise.

I can understand your situation and problem. Asthma patients are prone for recurrent chest infection. This is due to poor lung defense. In your case, I advice sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about appropriate effective antibiotic therapy. By this we can fasten the recovery and prevent drug resistance. Also get done adult Pulmonary vaccination with pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines. This will prevent recurrent lung infection. Mucolytic, expectorant and antioxidants drugs are also effective.

Fluid in chest can be due to hydrothorax or hemothorax. For confirmation, aspiration of the fluid is needed. And if it is clear or slightly yellow coloured than it is hydrothorax (pleural effusion). But if it is red, hemorrhagic in colour than it is hemothorax. So better to consult doctor and get done aspiration of this fluid. Possibility of simple pleural effusion is more because hemothorax is common after chest trauma, malignancy etc. So hemothorax is unlikely in her case.

Throbbing chest pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal cause. But better to rule out cardiac cause first because left sided chest pain is the common presenting complain in heart diseases. So get done ecg and 2d echo first. If both are normal than no need to worry for cardiac diseases. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. So avoid strenuous exercise and heavyweight lifting. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright.

He also suffers from anxiety disorder and mild depression which he takes medication for. He looks healthy until he tries to do anything strenuous and becomes short of breath, dizzy and sometimes nauseous.

I can understand your husband's situation and problem. Since his extensive cardiac and Pulmonary work up is normal, possibility of stress and tension related breathlessness is more. Stress, anxiety and depression can cause shortness of breath. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your husband's case and start working on its solution. Counselling sessions are also important along with drugs for control of symptoms. He is also having emphysema (mild), so prophylactic inhalers containing inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are also helpful to relieve breathlessness.

It takes almost 1-2 weeks for complete recovery. For symptomatic relief in viral URTI, follow these steps. 1. Avoid oily and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid hard to chew food. 2. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. 3. Start antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. 4. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. You will mostly improve in 1-2 weeks.

It's a small indent in the middle of the chest, around where the chin hit","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. If you are not having any symptoms like cough, breathlessness, chest pain, hemoptysis (blood in sputum) etc, than no need to worry for this small indentation. Sternal area is somewhat depressed in normal individual also. So slight indentation is acceptable and no treatment is required if patient is asymptomatic. So no need to worry for this.

Here lately mainly in morning when I move (walk, pick up something,etc.) myheart starts beating really fast and hard. I feel like its going to jump out my chest and it makes it hard to breath. Could it be a cause of my fibro or neuropathy? I also take cymbalta and gabapenten.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No, these symptoms are not due to fibromyalgia or neuropathy. Possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. But better to first get done ecg to rule out cardiac diseases. If ecg is normal than no need to worry for heart diseases. Stress and anxiety cause tachycardia, palpitation, chest pressure and heaviness. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out cardiac cause. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

My father tried to do CPR whiting less than 3 minutes she had bled from her nostrils and had vomited a bile. The last 3 months of her life she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis, the hospital overdosed her with cortisone injections. She was bleeding for several months, except the day of her passing. Doctors questioned 11 months earlier whether she had Lymphoma, Hodgkin. Doctors were puzzled, my mom suffered for her last 11 months. Was her bleeding after passing and bile coming typical for her situation?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Pulmonary fibrosis itself can not cause bleeding from nose or bilious vomiting. She has been given excessive steroids. So this can cause gastric ulcers, gastroparesis and gastritis. All these can cause vomiting, bleeding etc. So mostly excessive steroid injection and it's side effects is cause of her bilious vomiting and bleeding. Hope I have solved your query.

Chest pain with dizziness is commonly seen in high blood pressure and heart disease. So better to first get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg and 2d echo. If all are normal than no need to worry for hypertension and cardiac diseases. Stress induced GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can also cause central chest pain and dizziness.

I can understand your concern. Forecox is having anti tubercular drugs. And it is best to take them on empty stomach in morning. These drugs show excellent therapeutic effect if taken on empty stomach. But at the same time these drugs are known to cause gastritis, nausea and vomiting. So in my opinion, you should take these drugs on empty stomach. If you are not developing side effects like nausea, vomiting, gastritis etc than continue taking them empty stomach. But if you develop sever gastritis and vomiting than take them after light breakfast or after proton pump inhibitors (antacid). Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Fever on antibiotic suggestive of persistent infection. So you need to change the antibiotic. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, sputum culture and sensitivity report. Sputum culture will identify the causative organism. And sensitivity report will guide about appropriate effective antibiotic treatment. By this we can fasten the recovery and prevent drug resistance. Also start inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). These will also help in suppression of inflammation and fever. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

Deriphyllin is also having many side effects,so better to avoid it if possible. She is improving with antibiotics. So no need to worry much. Pneumonia takes almost 10-15 days for recovery.

It comes and go s at random times, and lasts about 20 minutes. I can breathe, but there s a lot of pressure. Should I see a doctor, or is it normal? Thanks for the help, I appreciate it a lot.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Central chest pain, chest pressure on Breathing etc are seen in bronchitis. So PFT is must for the diagnosis. If PFT is normal than GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is another possibility. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central chest pain, pressure in chest etc. So avoid stress and tension. Start proton pump inhibitors. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out bronchitis. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"So I went to the ER Saturday night for tightness in my chest and shortness of breath . While I was there they took a chest xray and told me I have bronchospasm. They didn t take any blood or anything else. They sent me home with steroids and an inhaler. I am a smoker.I decided to quit... My question is how long will this bronchospasm last?~ When should I start feeling better?~","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Smokers are prone to develop bronchospasm. And common reason for this is acute bronchitis. Usually with treatment, it takes almost 1-2 weeks to cure bronchospasm. Smoking cessation should be the priority to fasten the recovery and prevention of further bronchospasm. After this episode subsides, get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to know about your lung function and any abnormality. If your PFT is normal than only smoking cessation is required. So wait for 1-2 weeks to resolve this bronchospasm. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am just recovering from a 3 week viral infection that caused throat pain, voice hoarseness, sinus congestion, and chest congestion with cough. Just when I think I am finally feeling better, I have developed sharp pain in my right parietal lobe region that only lasts a few seconds but is severe with a lingering soreness. The pain increases with movement. I don t palpate any tenderness over the region other than a small raised bump. I do have a cold blister in my right nares. I am concerned that the cold sore in my nares is related to the parietal lobe pain. Should I have this evaluated?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Possibility of connection between nose problem and parietal lobe pain is very less. But in rare cases, uncontrolled, severe sinusitis can cause meningeal infection and brain damage. But since you are improving in sinusitis, possibility of this is also very low. So no need to worry much. Avoid stress and tension. Take simple painkiller like ibuprofen. Your parietal lobe pain will mostly improve. But if you are still having pain than better to get done CT thorax and CT PNS (paranasal sinuses) to rule out internal brain pathology. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. You are having thrombophlebitis. It is inflammation of vein. Tenderness and swelling suggest this. This is common after radiation therapy. Actually radiation causes destruction to cells and this causes inflammatory reaction. So take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Apply ice packs on swollen vein. You will mostly improve in 3-4 days. But if you are not improving than consult doctor and rule out infection.Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Since you are not improving with treatment, better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection (pneumonia). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may require higher antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I get occasional chest pain.  It helps if I drink water but the pain is scary and I feel it in my chest and up into the sides of my neck/jaw.  Sometimes it feels like someone tied a rope around my ribcage under my breasts.

Possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more in your case because your pain is subsided after drinking water. But better to get done ecg to rule out cardiac cause. If ecg is normal than no need to worry for heart attack. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest tightness, chest pressure, chest pain etc. So start proton pump inhibitors. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

The doctor gave her an inhaler and took an EKG saying that it is something to do with her mucuous plug.  Can you tell me how serious this is?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your daughter's situation and problem. Possibility of bronchitis is more in her case because of doctor's description regarding mucus plug. No need to worry for heart diseases. Bronchitis is due to infection. It causes inflammatory reaction in airways and so mucus plugging occur. It is easily treated by antibiotics, mucolytic and expectorant drugs. All these are needed to remove mucus plugging. Inhalers are also needed to control inflammation. So discuss about these drugs with your doctor because this will fasten the recovery. Don't worry, she will be alright. No need to worry for bronchitis as it is easily treatable. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your daughter.

You are having blunt chest trauma. And this can cause rib fracture, pneumothorax, Pulmonary contusions, muscular injury etc. All these cause chest pain on breathing. Since you are also having breathlessness and dizziness, possibility of pneumothorax or Pulmonary contusions is more. So get done chest x ray to rule out these complications.

I can understand your concern. Spots on chest x ray can be due to infections like pneumonia or tuberculosis, cancer etc. But possibility of infection is more in his case because of young age (18 years) and symptoms like cough, fever, sweating, hemoptysis (blood in sputum). Rapidly developing spots on chest x ray is another thing favouring infection because cancer does not grow rapidly.

I can understand your concern. Since your cholesterol, heart beat are normal, possibility of cardiac cause for chest pain is less. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is likely cause for your symptoms. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain after eating and on lying down position. GERD is common in patients with depression and obesity. So GERD is more likely. Treatment is proton pump inhibitors. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. For weight loss, avoid fatty and oily food. Do regular aerobic exercise like swimming, cycling and jogging.

Is there anything that can be done if the blood flow to his feet has been stopped to reestablish blood flow when pointed out this early.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your brother's situation and problem. Septic shock causes hypotension and decrease in tissue perfusion. So first and foremost treatment of Septic shock is control of infection through effective antibiotic. Cardiac inotropic drugs are also needed to elevate the blood pressure. Warmers and compression stocking are also advisable to increase blood flow to lower limbs. High Flow oxygen is also beneficial to improve tissue perfusion and hence blood flow in lower limbs. So discuss all these with his doctor ND start appropriate treatment. First and most important thing is to control sepsis (infection). Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Meningitis is less likely because of absence of headache. Possibility of viral Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is more. Viral fever often causes weakness, lethargy, low energy etc. So weakness in lower limb is mostly due to viral infection. Usually viral infections are self limiting in 1-2 weeks time.

I am a stay at home mom so I am constantly cleaning my house, running errands and taking my daughter to and from softball several times a week.  Most days from the time I wake up I am on my feet until around 8PM.  I rarely drink soda and hardly ever add salt to my food.  Most days I drink water or Crystal light. For years I have been battling anxiety. I don’t take medicine for it because I would really like to kick it on my own. I will remove myself from situations that are causing the anxiety, take deep breaths and meditate. Doing that helps a little but I never stops the anxiety. On a scale from 1-10 I am around a 5 almost all of the time and a 6-9 when I am having attacks. I think the attacks are brought on from the constant stress I am under and they even come at random unexplainable times. My question to you is do you think that my consistent anxiety could be a result of my high blood pressure and if so would it be more beneficial for me to begin treating the anxiety first with medication rather than taking blood pressure medicine?  I am very hesitant to start taking blood pressure medication do to the fact that I am young and fairly healthy (I do smoke around a half of pack a day). This could be nothing but another thing that has been happening is my toes will turn blue/purple when I am sitting down. My feet do not have to be cold for this to happen. When I asked my doctor about this she told me that she couldn’t explain it which kind of makes me question her judgment on other things. I know she never really takes the time to sit down and truly listen to what I have to say and that is why I am so desperate for a 2nd opinion.","Doctor":"hi,Smoking has ingredients which causes vasoconstriction which leads narrowing of blood vessels, leading to decreased blood supply to periphery and bluish discoloration and tingling.For the same reason it also increases your blood pressure.Now you decrease your smoking your bp And other symptoms will decrease. but bp remains elevated you need to treat it whatever may b the reason.

I can understand your concern. Yes, nutcracker esophagus is a possibility. It is due to sudden spasm of esophagus. Another possibility is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of vomiting, chest pain etc. So for the diagnosis of both these conditions, you need upper GI (gastrointestinal) scopy.

He is on an anti-immunesuppressent drug for Sarcoidosis, so his immune system is basically non-exsistent.  Ought he to stop work and go to his ~GP. Many thanks Linda Reed","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your son's situation and problem. Left sided chest pain is commonly seen in cardiac diseases. So better to first get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out cardiac causes. If both these are normal than we need to rule out lung infection.

So get done chest x ray to rule out lung infection. If all these tests are normal than no need to worry major pathology. His pain may be due to musculoskeletal pain only. So ask him to apply warm water pad on affected areas and take painkiller and muscle relaxant. But first rule out cardiac cause Pulmonary causes. Hope I have solved your query.

Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Go for walk after meals. Loose weight if you are obese. 4. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux.

I took my last does before bed last night around 9:00 p.m.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Better to avoid drinking alcohol while you are sick or on treatment. Alcohol causes immunosuppression and so chances of infection is high. It also interacts with drugs and so therapeutic effects can be decreased. Hydromet syrup will stay in the body for 16-18 hours. So better to avoid alcohol in your case. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your friend's situation and problem. Calcification on chest x ray is suggestive of old, healed, non active lesions. These are basically scar lesions from previous lung infection. They remain as it is life long. So for visa purpose, we need to prove that these lesions are not active infectious lesions. For these he need to consult pulmonologist and get done CT thorax with Contrast and bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage). If both are negative for active infection, than he cannot argue with visa authority about not having active, infectious disease and his lesions of chest x ray are old, inactive lesions. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am a 68 year old male. I am 6''4\\" and weigh 83kgs.

I can understand your concern. Since you had bypass heart surgery, we need to rule out cardiac cause first for your chest pain. So better to get done ecg, 2d echo and Angiography to rule out heart diseases. If all these are normal, than no need to worry for heart related diseases. Your chest pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal pain. So better to take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out recurrence of cardiac disease. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i have almost constant chest pain . Sometimes light sometimes extreme sharp pain in either side of my chest. I also get an ache in the lower left side of my neck, not sore but uncomfortable. I also notice it seems to worsen or be brought on by the slightest strain when using the toilet. I have had a camera down my throat and have been placed on nexiam 40mg for approx 2 months now.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern.By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related chest pain is more. But better to first rule out cardiac cause for chest pain. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal than no need to worry for cardiac diseases. You are taking nexium. It is having pantoprazole. Better symptomatic relief, along with pantoprazole, you need to follow these lifestyle modifications. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walk after meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Avoid smoking and alcohol, if you have these habits. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I can understand your situation and problem. Left sided chest pain is commonly seen in heart diseases. So better to first get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal, than no need to worry for cardiac diseases. Sometimes, stress and tension related GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can also cause left sided and central chest pain. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic and proton pump inhibitor drugs too. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out cardiac diseases.

When I do, green phlegm come up.  In the meantime, I have one child with an ear infection and another with sinusitis.  Could this be bronchitis? I do not have a fever.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, this can be bronchitis. Your symptoms like cough, greenish phlegm, chest tightness etc are seen in bronchitis. You are also having exposure with sinusitis and ear infection patients. So this can transmit infection in you. So possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. Consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroid and antibiotic drugs. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been having anxiety this whole night, but just an hour ago, I started getting pressure in my throat. I ignored it, but it has gotten much worse. It feels like sharp pain, as well as pressure in my throat and upper chest. Almost like trapped gas? I am not sure if I need to go to the ER or not","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. You are mostly having stress and anxiety induced GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is because of laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest tightness, central chest pain and gaseous feeling. So avoid stress and tension. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions, try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. So if you are improving with all these than no need to go to ER. Better to relax and keep calm. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

They are not characteristics of asthma. Asthma patients usually present with cough, wheezing and shortness of breath. But better to get done PFT to rule out asthma. If PFT is normal, no need to worry for asthma. Cardiac disease like arrhythmia can cause similar symptoms. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal, than no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm.

Since your PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) is normal, no need to worry for asthma. Possibility of lung Infection or pleural effusion is more in your case. Constant coughing is seen in both of them. Pleural effusion can cause diaphragm irritation. Diaphragm and shoulder joint share common nerve supply. So diaphragm irritation can cause referred pain in shoulder.

I can understand your sister's situation and problem. I don't think they are checking pancreas. They might be checking for atypical or fungal infection. Cancer patients are usually immunosuppressive. And chemotherapy further decrease the immunity. So possibility of infection is much higher in cancer patients. Not only infection, possibility of atypical infection like fungal, parasitic, tuberculosis, atypical bacterias etc is more in cancer patients. So to prevent recurrent pneumonia, we should get done bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture to identify the organism. Sensitivity report is also needed to guide the effective antibiotic therapy. So she is mostly transferred to other hospital for further investigation like bronchoscopy and BAL analysis. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your sister.

You are having blunt chest trauma due to fall in Bath tub. By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal injury is more.

Better to start painkiller, anti inflammatory and muscle relaxant drugs. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Don't worry, you will be alright in 1-2 weeks. If not improving after 1-2 weeks or worsening than get done chest x ray to rule out internal damage. Hope I have solved your query.

How to get rid from nausea.No appetite for food . what else medicine/vitamins should be taken with akt4,kindly advice YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Your symptom nausea is not due to pleural effusion directly but it is due to drugs you are taking. You are taking anti tubercular drugs for your pleural effusion. AKT 4 is having rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. All these drugs are having side effect of severe gastritis and gastritis is the cause for your nausea. Gastritis is also likely cause for your decrease in appetite. To prevent this you should take proton pump inhibitors and antiemetic drugs before AKT 4. This will reduce AKT 4 induced gastritis. Along with AKT 4, you should take multivitamin containing folic acid, vitamin b12 and vitamin b 6. High protein diet and protein powder are also recommended in patient suffering from tuberculosis. These are needed to improve immunity and fasten the recovery. So consult your doctor and discuss about starting these drugs. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Yes, possibility of recurrence of tuberculosis is more in your case. You are having past history of tuberculosis thrice, having high ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and fever with cough, all are suggestive of recurrence of tuberculosis. So you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray. If chest x ray is suggestive of tuberculosis than you need sputum or BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture and sensitivity to rule out MDR (multi drug resistant) tuberculosis as rusk of MDR tb is high in recurrence cases.

In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). As pain can be due to either pneumonia or worsening of asthma. So chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection (pneumonia). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of worsening of asthma.

By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause central chest pain, chest tightness and pressure. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Loose weight, if you are obese. Quit smoking if you are smoker. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Started lifting again after a 3-4 month break. I noticed today that from beginning to end I was feeling moderately winded. Like I was breathing fine but felt like I wasn t getting enough oxygen or something. Didn t feel dizzy but I did feel a bit cloudy. This happened last time I lifted but managed to become more sporadic the more i worked out, where I would have great days and bad days. Did some research on pulmonary hypertentison, not sure if that s the culprit. I just turned 23, I weigh 125lbs, I ve always been mostly active, eat plenty of fruits and veggies.

Just increased heart rate and the feeling that I m breathing fine just not getting the oxygen. Any ideas? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are having allergies, possibility of early bronchitis is high in your case. Untreated allergies can cause airflow limitation. And this is the main cause for bronchitis and feeling of not taking enough oxygen.

I can understand your situation and problem. No, this is not anxiety related. By your history and description, possibility of recurrent lung infection or bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. And if it is present than you need higher antibiotics because you are not improving with penicillin. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis.

I can understand your situation and problem. Since you had cardiac surgery in the past, we should first rule out cardiac cause for your symptoms. Your symptoms like intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath etc are commonly seen in heart diseases. So first get done ecg, 2d echo and if needed coronary Angiography to rule out heart diseases. If all these are normal than get done chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. As bronchitis can also cause similar symptoms.

I can understand your concern. Yes, there are chances of tuberculosis recurrence in 5-10% cases even after successful completion if treatment. Common causes for TB recurrence are 1. Diabetes or patient is on immunosuppressive drugs like steroids or chemotherapy drugs. 2. HIV infection and AIDS disease. 3. Poor nutritional and immunodeficiency. 4. Smokers. So to avoid recurrence of tuberculosis eat healthy food, maintain good immunity, avoid steroids, quit smoking as soon as possible if you are smoker, regularly check your sugar levels to rule out diabetes, avoid stress and tension.

Is it true sirwhat action shall we take to save my father","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your father's situation and problem. Interstial lung disease (ILD) is very broad term. It is actually group of diseases. Amongst ILD, IPF (idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis) is the most common amongst ILD. And it is having worst prognosis amongst all ILD. So first confirm with your doctor whether he is having IPF or not. Prognosis of ILD is also depends on severity on PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). So also get done PFT. Newer drugs like perfinodone, N acetyl cysteine (NAC), Picnovit etc are giving good prognosis in ILD. Perfinodone is the only US FDA approved antibiotic drug. NAC and picovit are proved antioxidants which improves lung inflammation. Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are also useful. So first know the type of ILD and discuss about these drugs with pulmonologist. With recent advances, prognosis of ILD is more than 10 years. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your mother's situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of respiratory failure is more. COPD patients tend to have type 2 respiratory failure.

I had an abnormal chest CT about 8 months ago and it showed a few Bullae on my upper right lung. He said beginnings of emphysyma. Also, my left lower lung shows scarring/nodule (granuloma) from histoplasmosis. I used to live in Ohio Valley when I was young. Doctor thought everything was benign and not to worry and to have another CT in 6 months to compare. Since that time he retired and I m going to another doctor in a few weeks to follow up. My regular doctor had to order CT and I had that done about 3 weeks ago and am awaiting definitive results. They would only tell me that scarring appears the same but they mentioned in right lung opacities. Is that the emphsyma or something else entirely like cancer? I am really worried and no one will help me any sooner with diagnosis until info in a few weeks. They didn t give me any specifics about opacities. Any info you can help me with would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. I m 45 years old by the way, female, and history of smoking and Im trying to quit.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Opacity on chest x ray can be due to pneumonia, nodule, cyst or malignant mass. But opacity word is not used for bullae. You are having opacity in resent CT at the same site where bullae were seen in previous scan. You are active smoker. And so risk of development of malignant mass at the site of bullae is very high. So, you need to wait for the CT report and if this is mass than you need biopsy and histopathological examination to rule out malignancy. Quit smoking as soon as possible. It is not good habit.

I exercise regularly and am a healthy weight?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, your symptoms are mostly due to alcohol ingestion. Since you are improving with heart condition, no need to worry for cardiac cause for these symptoms. Alcohol ingestion causes GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Alcohol causes laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. And because of this patient can have palpitations and coughing.

Artificial circuits such as the heart-lung machine can also damage blood cells. These factors may affect the blood's ability to clot after surgery. Avoiding the heart-lung machine can alleviate this blood trauma.Lower infection rate: A smaller incision means less exposure and handling of tissue, which may reduce the chances of infection.Available to more patients: Some patients are poor candidates for traditional bypass surgery because their illness is too widespread, their heart is too weak, or because they will not accept blood products. Some patients are able to receive this life-saving surgery through minimally invasive techniques.Less cost: The cost of minimally invasive cardiac surgery may be approximately 25% less than the cost of conventional surgery.You can consider the option of micas"},{"Patient":"I am pregnant with my fourth child, almost 24 weeks.

I feel better when I take this drug but feel chest congestion again when give up this drug. Normally my congestion starts when I am in rest position. My congestion is severe in places with high number of pollen. Kindly let me know what my problem is. Is it pollen allergy or something else? And one more thing, I often suffer from chest infection as well. I am smoker but I have reduced smoking. I don’t smoke more than 3 cigarettes per day. Kindly let me know my disease and how to cope with this problem. Thanks very much.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, possibility of pollen allergy and related allergic bronchitis is high in your case. You are chronic smoker. And due to smoke, lung defense is reduced in your case. So recurrent chest infection is common in smokers. So you should quit smoking as soon as possible. Your symptoms are worsen after pollen exposure and you are relieved with montelukast (anti allergic drug). This clearly suggest that you are having allergic bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Oral combination of antihistamine and anti allergic drugs is also important in your case. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Quit smoking as soon as possible.  Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

It can cause ground glass appearance of lungs on CT scan (white paint like as you mentioned). It also causes breathlessness on exertion. And hence PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) and blood reports like complete blood count, serum calcium level, ACE level etc are needed. The most confirmatory test is lung biopsy. Sarcoidosis can also affect retina and hence eyesight problem he is having can also be due to sarcoidosis.

Forceful nose blowing causes contraction of intercostal muscles. And this can be painful sometimes. So musculoskeletal pain is more likely. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. Bronchitis is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection. And symptoms like brownish mucus discharge and chest tightness are seen in bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis.

I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. But better to first rule out cardiac cause for your central chest pain. So get done ecg. If ecg is normal, than no need to worry for heart diseases. You are mostly having stress induced GERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms like central chest pain. So better to avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs.

Since you are allergic to weeds and molds, asthma can be the cause for your chronic cough and chest pain. You are also having bloated feeling. And asthma can aggravate reflux disease which can be the cause for your bloated feeling and central chest discomfort. So get done PFT. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Antihistamine and anti allergic drugs combination is also helpful in your case. For bloating, proton pump inhibitors are needed.

You are having foreign body (piece of pasta) aspiration. And by no means this thing is going to absorb in your body. You need to get it removed as soon as possible. Foreign body aspiration is more common in right side because right sided bronchus is wider, straight and more in line with trachea. And you are also having symptoms more on right side. So possibility of right sided aspiration is high. Foreign body causes local site inflammatory reaction. So lumen will be blocked and hence distal collapse of lung is seen. This is the reason for chest discomfort and breathlessness. So better to consult pulmonologist immediately and get done bronchoscopic evaluation and removal of foreign body.

You may need antibiotic, mucolytic and expectorant drugs. Mucolytic drugs will dilute the thick mucus and makes it easy to cough out. So first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should not go to work and take proper rest at home for atleast 1-2 weeks. Viral infection is the most common cause for acute bronchitis. And you are still having hacking cough and breathlessness on exertion, this means you are not fully recovered. Viral infections are usually self limiting and take almost 1-2 weeks for resolution.

Can Pleurisy be detected on an X-Ray right off, or is it something that you have to ask a Doctor to look for?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your husband's situation and problem. Pleurisy is inflammation of pleura. And common causes for pleurisy are pneumonia, pleural effusion, tuberculosis, Pulmonary contusions etc. And all these diseases have characteristic x ray and ultrasound appearance. So if his all scans are normal, possibility of all these diseases can be ruled out. And hence chances of pleurisy are also less. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more in your husband's case. So ask him to avoid heavyweight lifting. Avoid strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs are also helpful. Warm water pad application on affected area is also beneficial. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your husband.

Your all symptoms are due to anxiety. Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution.

Anti inflammatory and anti pyretic drugs are used for fever. And these drugs are known to cause gastritis. If gastritis is severe than pain on swallowing , burning chest pain, indigestion etc are seen. So better to avoid fever drugs. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. You are taking correct medicines for gastritis. So continue nexium and mylanta. Recovery is expected in 1-2 weeks.

But better to first rule out cardiac cause for your chest pain as you are obese. Obese patients tend to have higher cholesterol level. And possibility of Coronary artery obstruction due to cholesterol deposition  in coronary arteries is high. And this can cause chest pain. So better to get done ecg and 2d echo first. If both are normal than no need to worry much for heart diseases. Weight loss should be done as soon as possible. And excess fat tissue can cause inflammatory reaction at the site of stretch marks. So first rule out cardiac cause and start weight reduction. Once you loose weight, inflammation will decrease and pain will also decrease. At present you can take simple painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

In this condition, activation of the left ventricle of the heart is delayed, which causes the left ventricle to contract later than the right ventricle.Ejection fraction less then 35% is a indication of icd  in patients with LBBB,as patient with compromised ejection fraction are more suseptible to arrythmia and sudden cardiac death whose ecg shows lbbb.Its a class 1 indication for ICD, so you should get a icd implanted as early as possible .thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi this is pretty complex In march I was eventually diagnosed with a dvt (after seeing 5 doctors) this then progressed into a PE in which two clots were found on my lungs. I spent 5 days in hospital on high dose of deltaparin and discharged on the lower dose of 15,000 units because I self harm by blood letting.I was again later diagnosed having suffered another PE where three new clots were found and a shodow on my lower left lung.They placed an ivc filter in. I went to have this taken out and they had found that it had dislodged and was filled with clots as well as a large clot sat on the filter estimated to be around 5 cm. Again I was Put on 15,000 units of deltaparin.Last night I was admitted for a transfusion and every professional I saw I explained my concern about having had another PE (same symptoms as before) no one took me seriously because I am on deltaparin. They gave me an X-ray which showed nothing but it never has. Clots have only shown up on a ct scan.They basically said because I'm on deltaparin there is nothing more that they would do.My chest pain is worsening (I have been discharged today) I'm finding breathing more difficult. What do I do? Do I have to be dead to get help?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. You are having recurrent Pulmonary embolism despite of optimal anticoagulant treatment.

I just saw my gasto doctor and she said it felt muscular after my exam but I am freaking out thinking its a heart attack","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of worsening of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more in your case. But better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Your pain is mostly due to GERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. So along with drugs, you need to do following lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux disease. 6.

I can understand your son's situation and problem. His Pulmonary contusions are definitely due to blunt chest trauma because of fall. But blunt chest trauma can not cause lung nodule. In my opinion, this lung nodule is just a chance (accidental) finding. At his age of 27 years, benign lung cyst is the most likely cause for this nodule. Lung malignancy is extremely unlikely. Follow up with CT scan of thorax after 6 months is advised. This is to see for nodule activity. If nodule is of same size of decreasing than no need to worry, it is simple benign cyst. But if it is increasing in size than biopsy is advised. So at present, no need to worry for this nodule. Get done repeat CT after 6 months. Hope I have solved your query.

My little one says I sound like a sick duck. When I cough my chest gets tight, I can barely get a breath in, and I feel like I m going to pass out from being dizzy afterwards. I do have asthma and was in the hospital with my daughter the whole time. Could I have caught what my little one has?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, possibility of spread of infection is high in your case. Asthma patients have higher chance of lung Infection. Since you are asthmatic and your symptoms like cough, breathlessness etc favours possibility of lung Infection more. Your child recently had pneumonia and you are taking care of him. Lung infection spreads through droplet infection by coughing and sneezing. So you might be infected through your child's pneumonia. So better to consult doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray to rule out pneumonia. You may need antibiotics, mucolytic and expectorant drugs. Inhaled bronchodilators are also needed if you are having breathlessness. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Im a 44yr old female with heart rate off and on during day of 100-120 even at rest. Sometime awaken at night at 160. Had cardiac work up 6. Mo ago and was good with just some mild to moderate tricuspid cave regurge.  I'm am very stressed and anxious a lot and take 2.5 mg of Valium to calm down when awaken by fast heart rate.  I tend to get palpatations just before cycle. Could hormone fluctuations contribute to this?","Doctor":"Himild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation is normal and is nothing to worry about until the patient is symptomatic,Tachycardia, also called tachyarrhythmia, is a heart rate that exceeds the normal resting rate. In general, a resting heart rate over 100 beats per minute is accepted as tachycardia in adults.heart rate 120-160 comes in tachyacrdia.Tachycardia can be part of the body's normal response to anxiety, fever, rapid blood loss or strenuous exercise.In yourcase highh anxiety levels are respopnsible for tachycardia.now lets come to effect of hormones on tachycardia,Jusyt before the cycle there is change in estrogen and progestrone levels in the body , this has a direct effect on the body, these changes can be a cause of tachycardia, how ever in your case anxiety levels prove to be the cause of tachycardia."},{"Patient":"I just had a CT and it said tMild scarring is ween at both lung bases with interstitial prominence. This is more prominent of the right middle lobe. Mild biannual pleural thickening with interstitial prominence is noted. I also have a 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that they want to watch for one year. I think i am more frightened about what is the interstitial prominence than the nodule at this time.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Your CT picture is more suggestive of early interstitial lung disease (ILD). Better to first get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to know if any restrictive lung defect present or not. Treatment for ILD is as follows. 1.  Avoidance of smoking if you are smoker. 2. Avoidance of chemicals, fumes, dust at work place if you have these exposure. 3. Start mucolytic, expectorant and antioxidants drugs. 4. Start anti fibrotic drug (perfinodone). It is the only available drug to reverse early fibrosis. 5. Start inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). 6. Get done repeat CT scan after 3 months to see progression of fibrosis and size of nodule. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I went because the color of my skin had become yellow and I had a sever cough. The Urine showed positive Bilirubin, trace ketones and the blood test came back all good for my liver, pancreas and kidney but showed mild anemia. I have also had a chest x-ray and that is clear yet my doctor says I have pneumonia. I still have fatigue and pain in my chest, mid and lower back I have lost 6 pounds in the last week and my appetite is still low. No fever and I am drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated. In July I was told I had gallstones which the first doctor who ordered the blood and urine thinks is the problem but my primary has dismissed that and says its pneumonia. Still not feeling good and not sure who to believe at this point. Please let me know what questions you have and I appreciate your opinion.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. You are mostly having gall stones. Your all blood and urine reports are suggestive of gall stone and related jaundice. By definition, pneumonia is considered only when there is consolidation on chest x ray. Your chest x ray is normal. So pneumonia is not possible. So you are having gall stone, not pneumonia.

I still have a low grade fever, been out of work for seven days. Im not feeling better what do I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). It is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. Main treatment of bronchitis is inhaled treatment So you may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

I had right lower spine pain with my pneumonia but it now appears to be worse with additional symptoms as stated above.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Pneumonia causes pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). This is the cause for pain in pneumonia patients. Since you are having worsening of pain with worsening of other symptoms, we need to rule out worsening of pneumonia. So better to get done repeat chest x ray and compare it with your previous x ray. If it shows worsening of pneumonia than you may need higher antibiotics. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Looks like a wedge, I am worried because I am a thyroid cancer survivor and am aware that rai puts me t higher risk of other cancers. Why does this result mean?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are thyroid cancer survivor, possibility of lung metastasis is there. Cancer patients are immunocompromised. So opportunistic infections are common. And lung is most common organ for such infection. And upper lobe lesions are common in tuberculosis. So tuberculosis should also be ruled out. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax. It is much more superior than chest x ray in diagnosis of metastatic lung nodule. 2. Sputum for AFB (acid fast bacilli-bacteria causing tuberculosis). 3. Bronchoscopic evaluation for confirmation of cancer and infection. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

My pain seems to be worse after I eat (but not always).  I have normal bowel movements.  I have been taking probiotics for 2 weeks.  Any ideas?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of acute gastritis is more. You are having pain in the stomach area. Your pain is worse after eating food. These all suggest acute gastritis. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Go for walk after meals. You will mostly improve in 1 week with all these. If not improving then consult doctor and get done ultrasound examination of abdomen to rule out internal abdominal pathology. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Any ideas?Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Since your cardiac work up and chest x ray are normal, no need to worry for major heart or lung related diseases. Chest pain on specific movement suggest possibility of musculoskeletal pain more. So better to avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Apply warm water pad on affected site. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. You will mostly improve in 1-2 weeks. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Yes, all these symptoms can be due to lung collapse. Since you recently had lobectomy, other possibilities are also there. Possibility of pleural effusion due today surgical leak, pneumonia, tuberculosis etc are there. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. Chest x ray 3. CT thorax if needed. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I feel like its hard for me to control my breathing and then my heart starts beating really fast, it's never happens before. Just a little concerned. Could you give me an idea of what it may be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Breathlessness and tachycardia (rapid heart rate) are commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray to rule out lung infection. 3. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. If all these investigations are normal than probably anxiety is the cause. Stress, tension and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. First rule out Pulmonary causes.

I can understand your situation and problem. You are having hypertension at very young age of 20 years. This is known as essential hypertension. And in young individuals stress is the most common cause for this. Stamlo beta is having amlodipine and metoprolol. Both drugs are first line treatment for hypertension in young patients. Metoprolol is beta blocker and it is having additional effect of relieving stress and anxiety. So this will help you in both, decreasing blood pressure and relieving anxiety, stress. So this combination is good for you. Also avoid excess salt and do stress relieving exercises like yoga, pranayam etc. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Yes, you should definitely consult doctor tomorrow because possibility of bronchitis is high in your case. Bronchitis is mostly due to infection and it is contagious through droplet infection by coughing, sneezing etc. So you might caught infection from your daughter because she had bronchitis before 1 week.

Is my condition now contagious even it's minimal?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Upper lobe lung lesions can be due to tuberculosis or pneumonia. Treatment of tuberculosis is for atleast 6 months. And treatment for pneumonia is for 10-14 days. So it is better to get done repeat chest x ray after 14 days of antibiotic treatment. If you are having simple pneumonia than it will be cleared in new x ray. But if it is tuberculosis then it will not clear. This is the reason why pulmonologist called you after 14 days with fresh chest x ray. So get done repeat chest x ray after 14 days. You may also need bronchoscopic evaluation to rule out tuberculosis. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Is this because of medicine that I have consumed???","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No, your symptom of running nose is not due to Almox tablet. Almox is amoxicillin. It is penicillin group of antibiotic. It does not cause running nose. You are mostly having viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). This is the cause for your cough and running nose. So better to drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Avoid dust and pollution. Start antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. Usually viral infection is self-limiting in 1 - 2 weeks. So recovery in your case is expected in 2 weeks.

By your history and description, possibility of inhalation induced bronchitis is more in your case. Bleach contains chlorine, fluorine etc. These chemicals, on inhalation, cause irritation and inflammation. And these all lead to bronchitis. Bronchitis causes breathing difficulty. Best treatment is inhalation of fresh air and avoidance of exposure. Antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs are advised if coughing and pain are present. Inhaled bronchodilators are needed if patient is having breathlessness. So you needs inhaled treatment with antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright.

Musculoskeletal pain can be the cause for his Throbbing pain. So ask him to avoid heavyweight lifting, strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain and bad postures during sleep. Warm water pad application on affected area is also beneficial in this case. Painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs are also effective.

Amongst infection viral infection with Influenza virus is more common. So she might be having viral tracheatis. Ask her to drink plenty of fluids orally and keep herself hydrated. Avoid dust and smoke exposure. She should start antihistamines, anti inflammatory and painkiller drugs. Usually recovery is expected in 1-2 weeks time.

The bathroom door closed, I immediately felt a sting in my throat and my tongue felt sore..... although the MSDS states that it is not toxic, it does state that it should not be inhaled...Could this have been an irritant and the cause of my cough?  What should I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, chemicals when inhaled, can cause bronchitis. It is known as inhalational bronchitis. Cleaning solutions are mostly containing chlorine, fluorine etc. And these chemicals, on inhalation cause inflammation and irritation in airways. So bronchitis is common after such incidence. Your all symptoms are suggestive of bronchitis only. These are usually self limiting, once you come out of the room and inhale fresh air. But sometimes antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs are needed to suppress cough and inflammation. In severe cases where patient is having shortness of breath, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are also needed. So in my opinion, you should inhale fresh air, start antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. You will mostly improve with these. If not improving then you may need inhaled treatment.

I will be very much thankful to you, if you can provide me any information related to this.","Doctor":"Hi,Aside from the bone marrow, which is traditionally considered a source for stem cells, we may find stem cells in the periphery.The stem cell program at the Texas Heart Institute is focused primarily on treating heart failure, be it related to a recent myocardial infarction or a chronic disease state.There's a lot of effort to understand all the effects of these different cell types, including the potential mechanisms of action-1)One of the proposed mechanisms of cellular therapy is angiogenesis; the idea that bone marrow cells may be able to secrete multiple potentially angiogenic substances as well as transdifferentiate into cells that create new blood vessels is fairly well established in pre-clinical studies.2)myogenesis, which is a little bit more controversial, especially when we talk about transdifferentiation of bone-marrow-derived cells into heart muscle cells. We know that there may be dedicated precursors of cardiomyocytes in the myocardium. We are still trying to determine if the transplanted cells themselves differentiate, or if paracrine effects from the transplanted cells stimulate stem cells already resident in the heart to differentiate.Hi but these things are still under reserch and long term trials are still awaited. i would suggest you to go for a left ventricular assisted device before heart transplantation.Its much more succesful."},{"Patient":"I just experiences a shark pulsing pain on my left ribcage side and it was felt in my front and back.

By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more in your case because at your age of 22 years, cardiac diseases are not common. But better to get done ecg to rule out heart related diseases. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for cardiac diseases. You are mostly having musculoskeletal pain. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected site. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. You will mostly improve in 1 week. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

A member of my family thought it would be a good idea to store it in the oven without telling me about it. Therefor, when I went to preheat the oven without knowing this I ended up burning the plastic george foreman in up to 425 degree temperatures which warped the plastic cover of the grill and created an awful smelling odor. Which leads me to believe that some sort of gases were released as a result of burning the george foreman. So, my question is do you think gases were released, were these gases dangerous to any substantial extent if they did exist, and is it ok to use the oven I burnt the plastic in again after a self cleaning functionality is done. Also its been three days since the even and when you open up the oven you can still smell burnt plastic.

I can understand your situation and problem. Possibility of stress related GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more in your case. Since your cardiac work up is normal, no need to worry for major cardiac diseases. Stress cause GERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause central chest pain, tightness, heaviness, burping etc. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Don't worry, you will mostly improve with all these treatment.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult doctor and get done 1. Chest x ray to rule out lung pathology. 2. Ultrasound examination of neck to rule out lymphnode enlargement or other mass lesion. Lung infection and lung malignancy (if you are smoker) are common cause for chest pain and neck pain and distention. Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection and lung malignancy.

Acute lung infection causes hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia etc. Diarrhoea and vomiting are common cause for electrolyte disturbance. But they are not the only cause.

She has been going to Columbia Presbyterian In NYC and they are recommending a lung reduction. The doctor, Ginsberg, is not covered by her insurance thought the hospital is. She was told to see a Dr. Billinger in Stony Brook University and has an appointment to see him. We were told only Columbia did this procedure and now Stony Brook is in the picture. we want the best treatment and result from this and want to know how we can find out if the Dr Billinger is proficient in the lung reduction procedure and would she be better served at Columbia.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. COPD is progressive Pulmonary disease. Surgery like lobectomy, Pulmonary resection are advised and known as lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). But it is recommended only after failure of optimal non surgical treatment. Optimal nonsurgical treatment includes smoking cessation, chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). If after doing all these, patient is still symptomatic than one can go for surgical treatment. Decision about surgery should be taken after in depth discussion with doctor because surgery is not always beneficial to the patient.

Thanks."},{"Patient":"my 11 year old son was given a chest xray in the emergency room the other day because he has been having chest pain. The xray showed subsegmental atelectasis in the right lower lobe. I was wondering how I should follow upmon this because he is still experiencing chest pain that comes and goes while at rest.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your son's situation and problem. Atelectesis is partial collapse of lung tissue. Subsegmetal atelectesis is commonly due to collection of thick secretions in smaller airways. And infection is the most common cause for secretions. So your son needs broad spectrum antibiotic to cover infection. Mucolytic, expectorant and antioxidants drugs are needed to dilute the thick secretions, so that these are easily coughed out. Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are also helpful in this condition. So consult doctor, discuss all these and start appropriate treatment for your son. Hope I have solved your query.
