Otherwise, the triangle is not directed.Provide an estimate for the number of non-directed triangles.In every non-directed triangle, there is exactly one vertex such that the team represented by this vertex has beaten the other two. We will count the non-directed triangles according to the \\"winning\\" vertex.Let the teams be represented by the points A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n}, and let d_{i} denote the number of wins for A_{i}.

First, when 6 points in a plane are the 5 vertices of a regular pentagon and its center, all triangles formed by these 6 points are isosceles triangles, so the required positive integer ( n geqslant 7 ). Next, if there exist 7 points in a plane (where no three points are collinear) such that all triangles formed by these 7 points are isosceles triangles. Let the set of these 7 points be ( E ). Without loss of generality, assume the two farthest points in ( E ) are ( A ) and ( B ). Draw arcs centered at ( A ) and ( B ) with radius ( AB ) intersecting at points ( M ) and ( N ). Let ( l_{1} = overparen{M A N} cup overparen{M B N} ), and ( l_{2} = ) line segment ( M N ). Take any ( P in E, P neq A ), ( P neq B ), then ( triangle P A B ) is an isosceles triangle. Thus, at least one of the following three cases holds: (1) ( P A = P B leqslant A B ); (2) ( P A = A B geqslant P B ); (3) ( P B = A B geqslant P A ), so ( P in l_{1} cup l_{2} ). Since no three points in ( E ) are collinear, there are at most 2 points of ( E ) on ( l_{2} ), so at least ( 7 - 2 - 2 = 3 ) points of ( E ) are on ( overparen{A M} ), ( overparen{B M} ), ( overparen{A N} ), ( overparen{B N} ) (excluding endpoints). Without loss of generality, assume there is a point ( C in E ) on ( overparen{B N} ) (where ( C neq B ), ( C neq N )), and ( overparen{B C} ) contains no points of ( E ). Draw arcs centered at ( A ) and ( C ) with radius ( A C = A B ) intersecting at points ( M' ) and ( N' ). Let ( l_{3} = overparen{M' A N'} cup overparen{M' C N'} ), and ( l_{4} = ) line segment ( M' N' ). Similarly, all points of ( E ) belong to ( l_{3} cup l_{4} ). Therefore, ( E subseteq (l_{1} cup l_{2}) cap (l_{3} cup l_{4}) ), and ( overparen{B C} ) contains no points of ( E ). So, ( E subseteq overparen{M' B} cup overparen{C N} cup {A} cup {O} cup {T} cup {R} ), where ( O ) is the intersection of ( l_{2} ) and ( l_{4} ), ( T ) is the intersection of ( l_{2} ) and ( overparen{M' A} ), and ( R ) is the intersection of ( l_{4} ) and ( overparen{A N} ). Let ( S_{1} = overparen{M' B} cup {T} ), ( S_{2} = overparen{C N} cup {R} ), then ( S_{1} cup S_{2} ) contains at least ( 7 - 3 - 1 = 3 ) points of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). So, ( S_{1} ) or ( S_{2} ) contains at least 2 points of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). Without loss of generality, assume ( S_{2} ) contains 2 points ( P ) and ( Q ) of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), then there are only two cases: (1) ( P in overparen{C N} ), ( Q in overparen{C N} ). Since ( triangle P B C ) is an isosceles triangle and ( P B > B C ), we have ( P C = B C ). Similarly, from ( triangle Q B C ) being an isosceles triangle, we get ( Q C = B C ). So, ( C P = C Q ), i.e., ( C ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( P Q ), but the perpendicular bisector of ( P Q ) only passes through ( A ) and not through ( C ), a contradiction. (2) ( P in overparen{C N} ), ( Q = R ). Similarly, we get ( P C = B C ). Since ( triangle R B C ) is an isosceles triangle and ( B R = B N > B C ), we have ( R C = B C ), so ( R C = P C = B C ). In ( triangle B C P ) and ( triangle B C R ), ( B C = B C ), ( P C = R C ), ( angle B C P geqslant angle B C N > angle B C R ), so ( B P > B R ). This contradicts ( B P leqslant B N = B R ).

The previous equation can be written as (b+a)(b-a)=a+b, from which dividing by a+b we get that b=a+1.

In triangle ABC, we have frac{cos C}{cos B} = frac{2a - c}{b}, which can be rewritten as cos C sin B = (2sin A - sin C) cos B by using the sine form of the Law of Sines.Then, we apply the sine sum formula sin(B + C) = sin B cos C + cos B sin C, and since sin(B + C) = sin A, we get sin A = 2sin A cos B.Since sin A neq 0 in triangle ABC, we divide both sides by sin A to obtain cos B = frac{1}{2}, which implies that B = frac{pi}{3}.2. We are given that a + c = 2. Using the cosine rule, we have b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac cos B. From part 1, we know that B = frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - ac.Since a + c = 2, we can express c = 2 - a, and substitute this into our equation for b^2 to obtain b^2 = a^2 + (2 - a)^2 - a(2 - a) = 4 - 3a(2 - a).To find the minimum value of b, we need to minimize b^2. Since 4 - 3a(2 - a) is a concave down parabola and its vertex corresponds to the minimum value, we can calculate the vertex to find the minimum value. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by a = frac{2}{3}, and thus, the minimum value of b^2 is 4 - 3(frac{2}{3})(2 - frac{2}{3}) = 1.Therefore, the minimum value of b is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"3.

Identify the Condition for Parallelism: For two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. The slope of a line in the form Ax + By + C = 0 is -frac{A}{B}. Therefore, for l_{1} and l_{2} to be parallel, we equate their slopes:   [   -frac{1}{-a} = -frac{a-1}{-12}   ]   Simplifying this equation gives us the relationship between a values that would make l_{1} and l_{2} parallel.2. Solve for a: Solving the equation for a:   [   frac{1}{a} = frac{a-1}{12} implies 12 = a(a-1)   ]   This simplifies to:   [   a^2 - a - 12 = 0   ]   Factoring or using the quadratic formula yields:   [   a = 4 quad text{or} quad a = -3   ]3. Analyze the Solutions:   - When a=4, the equations of l_{1} and l_{2} become x-4y+1=0 and 3x-12y-4=0, respectively. These lines are indeed parallel because they have the same slope but different intercepts.   - When a=-3, the equations of l_{1} and l_{2} become x+3y+1=0 and -4x-12y-4=0, respectively. After simplification, it's evident that l_{1} coincides with l_{2}, meaning they are not just parallel but the same line.4. Conclusion: Since the condition a=4 results in l_{1} and l_{2} being parallel, and considering that a=-3 also leads to a specific relationship (coincidence) between l_{1} and l_{2}, we conclude that \\"a=4\\" is a necessary and sufficient condition for l_{1} ∥ l_{2}.

Given that ( f ) is a differentiable function such that ( f(f(x)) = x ) for ( x in [0,1] ) and ( f(0) = 1 ). We need to find the value of the integral:   [   int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx   ]2. Since ( f(f(x)) = x ), ( f ) is an involution, meaning ( f ) is its own inverse. This implies that ( f ) is a bijection on ([0,1]).3. Let us consider the substitution ( t = f(x) ). Then, ( x = f(t) ) and differentiating both sides with respect to ( t ), we get:   [   dx = f'(t) , dt   ]4. Using the substitution ( t = f(x) ), the integral becomes:   [   I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx = int_0^1 (f(t) - t)^{2016} f'(t) , dt   ]5. Notice that ( f ) being an involution implies ( f(f(x)) = x ). Therefore, we can write:   [   I = int_0^1 (f(x) - x)^{2016} , dx   ]6. Now, consider the integral:   [   I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx   ]   and   [   J = int_0^1 (f(x) - x)^{2016} , dx   ]7. Since ( f ) is a bijection, we can change the variable in ( J ) by setting ( u = f(x) ). Then ( du = f'(x) , dx ) and the limits of integration remain the same because ( f ) maps ([0,1]) onto itself. Thus:   [   J = int_0^1 (f(f(x)) - f(x))^{2016} f'(x) , dx = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} f'(x) , dx   ]8. Since ( f ) is differentiable and ( f(f(x)) = x ), we have:   [   f'(f(x)) f'(x) = 1   ]   This implies that ( f'(x) ) is positive and ( f'(x) = frac{1}{f'(f(x))} ).9. Therefore, we can write:   [   J = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} frac{1}{f'(f(x))} , dx   ]10. Combining the integrals ( I ) and ( J ), we get:    [    I + J = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx + int_0^1 (f(x) - x)^{2016} , dx    ]11. Since ( (x - f(x))^{2016} = (f(x) - x)^{2016} ), we have:    [    I + I = 2I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx    ]12. Therefore, we conclude that:    [    2I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx    ]13. Solving for ( I ), we get:    [    I = frac{1}{2} int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx    ]14. Since ( I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx ), we have:    [    I = frac{1}{2} I    ]15.

To investigate divisibility by 11, it is significant which positions the replaceable digits occupy.First case. We replace two zeros in positions of the same parity (both even or both odd). For divisibility by 11, the sum of the two new digits must be divisible by 11, and since each digit is within the range [1 ; 9], the sum must be 11.

The first addend on the left side is divisible by 5, so the left side gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. On the other hand, the number 11 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. Finally, the expression 3^{c}, depending on the value of the number c, gives remainders 3, 4, 2, 1, which then cyclically repeat with a period of 4. We conclude that, for the right side to also give a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, the number c must be of the form 4c_{1} + 2, for some non-negative integer c_{1}. In particular, c is an even number.Now let's look at the remainders that the same expressions give when divided by 8. Since c is an even number, the number 11 cdot 3^{c} = 11 cdot 9^{2c_{1} + 1} gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 8. Therefore, the number 2^{a} cdot 5^{b} = 1 + 11 cdot 3^{c} must give a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. This is only possible if a = 2 (if a = 1, the left side gives a remainder of 2; if a geq 3, the left side is divisible by 8).Finally, let's look at the remainders that these expressions give when divided by 3. The right side is divisible by 3, so the number 2^{a} cdot 5^{b} = 4 cdot 5^{b} must give a remainder of 1. Since 5^{b} gives periodic remainders 2 and 1, we conclude that b is even, i.e., b = 2b_{1}, for some natural number b_{1}.The left side can now be factored using the difference of squares:left(2 cdot 5^{b_{1}} - 1right)left(2 cdot 5^{b_{1}} + 1right) = 11 cdot 3^{c}On the left side of the equation, we have the product of two consecutive odd numbers, and therefore they are relatively prime. Neither factor can be equal to 1, since they are at least 2 cdot 5^{1} - 1 = 9. Therefore, one factor must be equal to 11, and the other to 3^{c}.In the first case, we have 2 cdot 5^{b_{1}} - 1 = 11, which has no solution.In the second case, we have 2 cdot 5^{b_{1}} + 1 = 11, from which b_{1} = 1, i.e., b = 2. Then 2 cdot 5^{b_{1}} - 1 = 9 = 3^{c}, i.e., c = 2.Thus, the only solution to the equation is (a, b, c) = (2, 2, 2)."},{"problem":"Let be a circumcircle of radius  1  of a triangle whose centered representation in the complex plane is given by the affixes of  a,b,c,  and for which the equation  a+bcos x +csin x=0  has a real root in  left( 0,frac{pi }{2} right) .  prove that the area of the triangle is a real number from the interval  left( 1,frac{1+sqrt 2}{2} right] . [i]Gheorghe Iurea[/i]","solution":"1. Circumcircle and Complex Plane Representation:   Given that the circumcircle of the triangle has a radius of 1, we can represent the vertices of the triangle in the complex plane as points (a), (b), and (c) on the unit circle. This means (|a| = |b| = |c| = 1).2. Equation with Real Root:   The equation (a + b cos x + c sin x = 0) has a real root in (left(0, frac{pi}{2}right)). This implies that there exists some (x) in this interval such that the equation holds true.3. Area of the Triangle:   The area (A) of a triangle with vertices on the unit circle can be given by the formula:   [   A = frac{1}{2} left| text{Im} left( a overline{b} + b overline{c} + c overline{a} right) right|   ]   Since (|a| = |b| = |c| = 1), we can write (a = e^{ialpha}), (b = e^{ibeta}), and (c = e^{igamma}) for some real numbers (alpha), (beta), and (gamma).4. Using the Given Equation:   The given equation (a + b cos x + c sin x = 0) can be interpreted as a vector equation in the complex plane. Since (x) is in (left(0, frac{pi}{2}right)), both (cos x) and (sin x) are positive.5. Geometric Interpretation:   The equation (a + b cos x + c sin x = 0) suggests that the vectors (a), (b cos x), and (c sin x) form a closed triangle in the complex plane. This implies a certain symmetry and relationship between the angles of the triangle.6. Area Calculation:   The area of the triangle can also be expressed using the sine of the angles between the vectors. For a triangle inscribed in a unit circle, the area can be given by:   [   A = frac{1}{2} left( sin theta_1 + sin theta_2 + sin theta_3 right)   ]   where (theta_1), (theta_2), and (theta_3) are the angles at the vertices of the triangle.7. Range of the Area:   Since (sin x + cos x in (1, sqrt{2}]) for (x in left(0, frac{pi}{2}right)), the area of the triangle, which is (frac{1}{2} (1 + sin x + cos x)), will lie in the interval:   [   left( frac{1}{2} (1 + 1), frac{1}{2} (1 + sqrt{2}) right] = left( 1, frac{1 + sqrt{2}}{2} right]   ]8.

From the proportionality of segments of a right triangle, we get that CH^2 = AH cdot BH, i.e., AH cdot BH = 169. Since AH and BH are integers, the following cases are possible: AH = BH = 13, AH = 169 and BH = 1, AH = 1 and BH = 169.In the first of these cases, the hypotenuse AB, equal to 26, can be placed in 374 cdot 2 = 748 ways (400 - 26 ways of placement on each of the two given lines), and the position of vertex C is uniquely determined.In the second and third cases, the length of the hypotenuse is 170, and it can be placed in 2(400 - 170) = 460 ways.

Find the value of k.2. Find the length of line segment AB.","solution":"1. Since the focus of the parabola y^{2}=4x is F(1,0), and the line y=kx-1 passes through point F(1,0), we can substitute the coordinates of F into the equation of the line to find the value of k. This gives us 0=k*1-1, which simplifies to k=1. Therefore, the value of k is 1.2. Now that we know k=1, we can substitute this value into the equation of the line to get y=x-1. We can then substitute this expression for y into the equation of the parabola to find the x-coordinates of the points of intersection. This gives us (x-1)^{2}=4x, which simplifies to x^{2}-6x+1=0. The sum of the roots of this quadratic equation is given by x_{1}+x_{2}=6.The parabola y^{2}=4x has a parameter p=2.

Note that gamma < 90^circ (otherwise, the sum of the angles in the triangle would be greater than 180^circ).By the theorem on the angle between a tangent and a chord, the angle between the tangent and AB is gamma, and the angle between the tangent and BC is 2gamma. Therefore, the distance d_A from point A to the tangent is AB sin gamma = 2R sin^2 gamma. Similarly, the distance d_C from point C to the tangent is BC sin 2gamma = 2R sin^2 2gamma.Thus, frac{12}{5} = frac{d_C}{d_A} = 4 cos^2 gamma, from which cos^2 gamma = frac{3}{5}.

What is the radius of the smallest sphere containing all of them?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We have four balls of radius 1 placed in space such that each ball touches the other three. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain all four balls.2. Geometric Configuration:   The centers of the four balls form a regular tetrahedron with side length equal to twice the radius of the balls, i.e., 2 units. This is because each ball touches the other three, and the distance between the centers of any two balls is the sum of their radii (1 + 1 = 2).3. Finding the Center of the Tetrahedron:   The center of the smallest sphere containing all four balls will be the centroid of the tetrahedron. The centroid of a regular tetrahedron is equidistant from all its vertices.4. Distance from a Vertex to the Centroid:   To find the radius of the sphere, we need the distance from a vertex of the tetrahedron to its centroid. For a regular tetrahedron with side length ( a ), the distance from a vertex to the centroid is given by:   [   d = frac{a sqrt{3}}{3}   ]   Here, ( a = 2 ), so:   [   d = frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3}   ]5. Height of the Tetrahedron:   The height ( h ) of the tetrahedron (distance from a vertex to the opposite face) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the triangle formed by the height, the centroid, and the midpoint of a side:   [   h = sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{a sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{4 - frac{4}{3}} = sqrt{frac{8}{3}}   ]6. Distance from the Centroid to the Center of the Sphere:   The distance from the centroid of the tetrahedron to the center of the sphere is half the height of the tetrahedron:   [   OP = frac{sqrt{frac{8}{3}}}{2} = frac{sqrt{6}}{2}   ]7. Radius of the Sphere:   The radius of the sphere containing all four balls is the distance from the centroid to a vertex plus the radius of one ball:   [   R = frac{sqrt{6}}{2} + 1   ]8. Simplifying the Expression:   [   R = frac{sqrt{6}}{2} + frac{2}{2} = frac{sqrt{6} + 2}{2}   ]Therefore, the radius of the smallest sphere containing all four balls is:[boxed{frac{sqrt{6} + 2}{2}}]"},{"problem":"Find the least positive integer of the form [u]a[/u] [u]b[/u] [u]a[/u] [u]a[/u] [u]b[/u] [u]a[/u], where a and b are distinct digits, such that the integer can be written as a product of six distinct primes","solution":"1. We need to find the least positive integer of the form ( abaaba ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct digits, such that the integer can be written as a product of six distinct primes.2. Notice that ( abaaba ) can be factored as:   [   abaaba = aba cdot 1001   ]   where ( 1001 = 7 cdot 11 cdot 13 ). Therefore, ( abaaba ) can be written as a product of six distinct primes if ( aba ) is the product of three distinct primes.3. We need to find the smallest ( aba ) that is the product of three distinct primes. Let's check the values of ( aba ) starting from the smallest possible three-digit number:   - ( aba = 101, 131, 151, 181, 191 ) are prime numbers, so they cannot be products of three distinct primes.   - ( aba = 121 = 11^2 ) is not a product of three distinct primes.   - ( aba = 141 = 3 cdot 47 ) is a product of two primes, not three.   - ( aba = 161 = 7 cdot 23 ) is a product of two primes, not three.   - ( aba = 171 = 3^2 cdot 19 ) is not a product of three distinct primes.   - ( aba = 202 = 2 cdot 101 ) is a product of two primes, not three.   - ( aba = 212, 232, 252, 272 ) are divisible by ( 2^2 ), so they are not products of three distinct primes.   - ( aba = 242 = 2 cdot 11^2 ) is not a product of three distinct primes.   - ( aba = 282 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 47 ) is a product of three distinct primes.4. Since ( 282 ) is the smallest number of the form ( aba ) that is the product of three distinct primes, we have:   [   abaaba = 282282 = 282 cdot 1001 = 282 cdot 7 cdot 11 cdot 13   ]   which is indeed a product of six distinct primes: ( 2, 3, 7, 11, 13, 47 ).Conclusion:[boxed{282282}]"},{"problem":"3.

Let ( n geqslant 3 ) be an integer. A frog is to jump along the real axis, starting at the point 0 and making ( n ) jumps: one of length 1, one of length 2, (ldots), one of length ( n ). It may perform these ( n ) jumps in any order. If at some point the frog is sitting on a number ( a leqslant 0 ), its next jump must be to the right (towards the positive numbers). If at some point the frog is sitting on a number ( a > 0 ), its next jump must be to the left (towards the negative numbers). Find the largest positive integer ( k ) for which the frog can perform its jumps in such an order that it never lands on any of the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, k ).","solution":"We claim that the largest positive integer k with the given property is leftlfloorfrac{n-1}{2}rightrfloor, where lfloor xrfloor is by definition the largest integer not exceeding x.Consider a sequence of n jumps of length 1,2, ldots n such that the frog never lands on any of the numbers 1,2, ldots, k, where k geqslant 1. Note that we must have k0, then it must even be in a number a geqslant k+1, since it is not allowed to hit the numbers 1,2, ldots, k. So the frog jumps to the left only if it is in a number a geqslant k+1, and therefore it is impossible to reach numbers less than (k+1)-n=k-n+1. This means the frog only possibly lands on the numbers i satisfyingk-n+1 leqslant i leqslant 0 quad text { or } quad k+1 leqslant i leqslant n text {. }When performing a jump of length k, the frog has to remain at either side of the numbers 1,2, ldots, k. Indeed, jumping over 1,2, ldots, k requires a jump of at least length k+1. In case it starts at a number a>0 (in fact k+1 leqslant a leqslant n ), it lands in a-k and we must also have a-k geqslant k+1. So 2 k+1 leqslant a leqslant n, therefore 2 k+1 leqslant n. In case it starts at a number a leqslant 0 (in fact k-n+1 leqslant a leqslant 0 ), it lands in a+k and we must also have a+k leqslant 0. Adding k to both sides of k-n+1 leqslant a, we obtain 2 k-n+1 leqslant a+k leqslant 0, so in this case we have 2 k+1 leqslant n as well. We conclude that k leqslant frac{n-1}{2}. Since k is integer, we even have k leqslantleftlfloorfrac{n-1}{2}rightrfloor.Next we prove that this upperbound is sharp: for k=leftlfloorfrac{n-1}{2}rightrfloor the frog really can perform its jumps in such an order that it never lands on any of the numbers 1,2, ldots, k.Suppose n is odd, then frac{n-1}{2} is an integer and we have k=frac{n-1}{2}, so n=2 k+1. We claim that when the frog performs the jumps of length 1, ldots, 2 k+1 in the following order, it does never land on 1,2, ldots, k : it starts with a jump of length k+1, then it performs two jumps, one of length k+2 followed by one of length 1 , next two jumps of length k+3 and 2, ldots, next two jumps of length k+(i+1) and i, ldots, and finally two jumps of length k+(k+1) and k. In this order of the jumps every length between 1 and n=2 k+1 does occur: it performs a pair of jumps for 1 leqslant i leqslant k, which are the jumps of length 1,2, ldots, k and the jumps of length k+2, k+3, ldots, 2 k+1, and it starts with the jump of length k+1.We now prove the correctness of this jumping scheme. After the first jump the frog lands in k+1>k. Now suppose the frog is in 0 or k+1 and is about to perform the pair of jumps of length k+(i+1) and i. Starting from 0 , it lands in k+(i+1)>k, after which it lands in (k+i+1)-i=k+1>k. If on the contrary it starts in k+1, it lands in (k+1)-(k+(i+1))=-ik if k is odd, or in (k+1)-(2 k+2)=-k-1<1 if k is even, and its series of jumps is correct again.We conclude that the largest positive integer k with the given property is leftlfloorfrac{n-1}{2}rightrfloor."},{"problem":"Compute the number of subsets S of {0,1,dots,14} with the property that for each n=0,1,dots,6, either n is in S or both of 2n+1 and 2n+2 are in S.[i]Proposed by Evan Chen[/i]","solution":"To solve the problem, we need to compute the number of subsets ( S ) of ( {0, 1, dots, 14} ) such that for each ( n = 0, 1, dots, 6 ), either ( n ) is in ( S ) or both ( 2n+1 ) and ( 2n+2 ) are in ( S ).1.

We need to show that 4 spies can share all parts of the code with exactly ( 2 times 4 - 4 = 4 ) phone calls.      - Let the spies be labeled as ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ).   - The sequence of calls can be as follows:     1. ( A ) calls ( B ).     2. ( C ) calls ( D ).     3. ( A ) calls ( C ).     4. ( B ) calls ( D ).      After these 4 calls, each spy will know the entire code. Thus, the base case holds.2. Inductive Step:   Assume that for ( n geq 4 ), the minimum number of phone calls required for ( n ) spies to share all parts of the code is ( 2n - 4 ). We need to show that for ( n + 1 ) spies, the minimum number of phone calls required is ( 2(n + 1) - 4 ).   - Consider ( n + 1 ) spies. By the inductive hypothesis, the first ( n ) spies can share all parts of the code with ( 2n - 4 ) phone calls.   - Now, we need to integrate the ( (n+1) )-th spy into the network. The ( (n+1) )-th spy needs to make at least 2 phone calls: one to share its information and another to receive the information from the rest of the spies.   - Therefore, the total number of phone calls required for ( n + 1 ) spies is:     [     (2n - 4) + 2 = 2n - 2     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     2(n + 1) - 4     ]   This completes the inductive step.3.

Hence, a_{n}-a_{n-1}=1, which means the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term being 1 and common difference being 1.  Thus, a_{n}=n for ninmathbb{N}^*.  (II) b_{n}= frac {1}{(2a_{n}+1)(2a_{n}-1)}= frac {1}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}= frac {1}{2}( frac {1}{2n-1}- frac {1}{2n+1})  Therefore, T_{n}=b_{1}+b_{2}+ldots+b_{n}= frac {1}{2}[(1- frac {1}{3})+( frac {1}{3}- frac {1}{5})+ldots+( frac {1}{2n-1}- frac {1}{2n+1})]  = frac {1}{2}(1- frac {1}{2n+1})= frac {n}{2n+1}.  Since T_{n+1}-T_{n}= frac {n+1}{2n+3}- frac {n}{2n+1}= frac {1}{(2n+3)(2n+1)}>0,  T_n is monotonically increasing,  thus the minimum value of T_n is T_{1}= frac {1}{3}.

Finding the Slope of Line AB and Its Symmetric Line:   - The slope of line AB, denoted as k_{AB}, is calculated using the coordinates of points A and B. Since A is at (-2,3) and B is at (a,0), the slope is:     [     k_{AB} = frac{0-3}{a+2} = frac{-3}{a+2}     ]   - The line symmetric to AB about the x-axis will have a slope of the opposite sign, thus:     [     k = -k_{AB} = -left(frac{-3}{a+2}right) = frac{3}{a+2}     ]2. Equation of the Symmetric Line:   - With the slope k = frac{3}{a+2} and passing through point B(a,0), the equation of the symmetric line can be written as:     [     y - 0 = frac{3}{a+2}(x - a)     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     3x - (a+2)y - 3a = 0     ]3. Intersection with the Circle:   - The circle's equation is given by (x-3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1. The distance from the center of the circle (3,2) to the symmetric line must be less than or equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1.

Solving the Inequality:   - Solving the quadratic inequality for a, we find the range of values for a that satisfies the condition:     [     frac{1}{4} leq a leq 2     ]   - Therefore, the range of real numbers for a is boxed{[frac{1}{4}, 2]}, which corresponds to option A.So, the correct answer is boxed{text{A}}."},{"problem":"Let k > 1, n > 2018 be positive integers, and let n be odd.

Define Variables and Initial Setup:   Let ( A, B, ) and ( F ) be positive integers such that ( A < B < 2A ). Define ( C = B - A ). The flea can jump to the right by ( A ) or ( B ). Lavaman places lava in intervals of ( A ) consecutive integers, ensuring the intervals are disjoint and not adjacent, with at least ( F ) positive integers between any two intervals, and no lava at any integer less than ( F ).2. Part 1: Prove ( F = nA + C ) is sufficient:   - Safe and Lava Sections:     Consider a safe section of length ( nA + C + R ) where ( 0 le R < A ). Redefine the number line so that ( 1 ) is the beginning of this safe section. We need to show that from any of the first ( C ) positions, the flea can move to the first ( C ) positions of the next safe section.   - Jump Sequences:     Let ( R = kC + r ) where ( k ) and ( r ) are nonnegative integers with ( k ) maximal. Notice that ( n + 1 > k ) since ( frac{R}{n+1} < frac{A}{n+1} le C ). Consider the following sequences of moves:     [     [r + 1, C] stackrel{+(n-k)A + kB}{to} nA + kC + [r + 1, C] = nA + R + [1, C-r]     ]     and     [     [1, r] stackrel{+(n-k-1)A + (k+1)B}{to} nA + kC + [1, r] = nA + R + [1 + C-r, C] quad text{if } n ge k + 1.     ]     [     [1, r] stackrel{+(n+1)A}{to} nA + A + [1, r] = nA + R + [A-R+1, A-nC] quad text{if } n = k.     ]     These final positions lie in the interval ( nA + R + [1, C] ), fitting into the safe section. Another leap of length ( B = A + C ) gives the desired result.3. Part 2: Prove ( F = nA + C ) is necessary:   - Safe and Lava Sections:     Divide the number line into safe and lava sections. If Lavaman makes every safe section of length ( nA + C - 1 ), the flea cannot traverse ( C ) lava intervals. If the flea is on some position in ( [s, C] ) for some ( s le C ), it must pass through ( [s+1, C] ) or move no more.   - Jump Analysis:     The leap over the lava must be of length ( B = A + C ), so the flea must be in ( [nA, nA + C - 1] ) to make this jump. If the flea moves from ( [s, C] ) to ( nA + [0, C-1] ) in ( n-1 ) jumps, we need:     [     (n-1)(A+C) ge nA - C implies A le nC implies B - A ge frac{A}{n},     ]     which is a contradiction. Hence, at least ( n ) jumps are needed. ( n ) jumps of length ( A ) send ( [s, C] ) to ( nA + [s, C] ), so the flea must do exactly ( n ) jumps of length ( A ). Now ( nA + C ) is lava, so if the flea was at ( C ) initially, it cannot pass the lava. Otherwise, the flea jumps ( B = A + C ) to ( (n+1)A + C - 1 + [s + 1, C] ).   - Conclusion:     The flea starts at position ( 1 ) relative to its safe section within ( [1, C] ). After ( C ) lava intervals, the flea runs out of room. Hence, ( F = nA + C = (n-1)A + B ) is minimal.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ F = (n-1)A + B } )."},{"problem":"Example 2 Find the finite simple continued fraction of 7700 / 2145 and its successive convergents.","solution":"Solvebegin{aligned}7700 & / 2145=langle 3+1265 / 2145rangle=langle 3,2145 / 1265rangle & =langle 3,1+880 / 1265rangle=langle 3,1,1265 / 880rangle = & langle 3,1,1+385 / 880rangle=langle 3,1,1,880 / 385rangle = & langle 3,1,1,2+110 / 385rangle=langle 3,1,1,2,385 / 110rangle = & langle 3,1,1,2,3+55 / 110rangle=langle 3,1,1,2,3,2rangle = & langle 3,1,1,2,3,1,1rangleend{aligned}According to formula (2) in §2, list to find h_{n}, k_{n} (see Table 1) and the convergents h_{n} / k_{n}.

Construction of Sequence:   Consider the sequence 1, 2, ldots, n-1, 2333333n + 66666. This sequence is constructed such that the last term is significantly larger than the others, ensuring that it disrupts any potential arithmetic progression (AP) involving it.2. Induction Hypothesis:   We will use induction to prove the lower bound. Assume that for a sequence of length n-1, the least number of NOT-AP triples is left lfloor frac{n-2}{2} right rfloor.3. Base Case:   For n = 3, the sequence is 1, 2, 2333333 cdot 3 + 66666. The only possible triple is (1, 2, 2333333 cdot 3 + 66666), which is clearly a NOT-AP triple since 1 + (2333333 cdot 3 + 66666) ne 2 cdot 2. Thus, the base case holds with exactly 1 NOT-AP triple, which is left lfloor frac{3-1}{2} right rfloor = 1.4. Inductive Step:   Assume the statement is true for n-1. Now consider a sequence of length n. If the sequence obtained by removing a_1 and a_2 from {a_i} is an AP, then we are done by directly calling out enough non-AP triples. Suppose it is not an AP. By the induction hypothesis, there are at least left lfloor frac{n-3}{2} right rfloor NOT-AP triples within this subsequence.5. Adding a_1 and a_2:   Consider the triples involving a_1 and a_2. If (a_1, a_2, a_3) is an AP, then a_3 - a_2 = a_2 - a_1. This implies that (a_2, a_3, a_4), (a_1, a_3, a_5), (a_2, a_4, a_6), and so on, will also be part of the progression, eventually making {a_i} an AP entirely, which contradicts our assumption.6.

Lemma Proof: We start by proving the lemma: If for some prime ( p ) and natural ( t ), ( p mid 2^{2^t} + 1 ), then ( p > t ).   - Let ( k ) be the minimal integer such that ( p mid 2^k - 1 ). This implies ( k mid p-1 ).   - Since ( k mid 2^{t+1} ), we can write ( k = 2^r ) for some ( r leq t+1 ).   - If ( r leq t ), then ( 2^r mid 2^t ), which implies ( p mid 2^{2^r} - 1 mid 2^{2^t} - 1 ). This would mean ( p mid 2^{2^t} - 1 ), contradicting ( p mid 2^{2^t} + 1 ). Hence, ( r = t+1 ) and ( k = 2^{t+1} ).   - Therefore, ( p geq k + 1 = 2^{t+1} + 1 > t ).2. Analyzing the Divisibility Condition: We need to find all positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( (2^{2^n} + 1)(2^{2^m} + 1) ) is divisible by ( m cdot n ).   - Assume ( n geq m > 1 ). Let ( p ) be a prime divisor of ( m ). Then ( p leq m leq n ).   - From the lemma, if ( p mid 2^{2^m} + 1 ), then ( p > m ), which is a contradiction since ( p leq m ). Therefore, ( m = 1 ).3. Case ( m = 1 ): We need ( n mid 5(2^{2^n} + 1) ).   - For ( n = 1 ), ( 5(2^{2^1} + 1) = 5 cdot 5 = 25 ), and ( 1 mid 25 ), so ( (m, n) = (1, 1) ) is a solution.   - For ( n > 1 ), let ( p ) be a prime divisor of ( n ). By the lemma, ( p > n ), which is a contradiction. Hence, ( n = 5 ).4. Case ( n = 5 ): We need to check if ( 5 mid 5(2^{2^5} + 1) ).   - ( 2^{2^5} + 1 = 2^{32} + 1 equiv 2 pmod{5} ), so ( 5 mid 5(2^{32} + 1) ).   - Therefore, ( (m, n) = (1, 5) ) is a solution.5. Case ( n = 1 ): We need to check if ( 1 mid 5(2^{2^1} + 1) ).   - ( 5(2^{2^1} + 1) = 5 cdot 5 = 25 ), and ( 1 mid 25 ), so ( (m, n) = (5, 1) ) is a solution.The final answer is (boxed{(m, n) = (1, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1)})."},{"problem":"6.

Let n be the smallest positive integer such that S(n)+S(n+1)=2016. As the answer to the problem, write down a five-digit number such that its first two digits coincide with the first two digits of n and its last three digits coincide with the last three digits of n. For example, if mathrm{n}=1234567890, then the answer must be 12890.## Answer.59989## SolutionIf the number n does not end in 9, then S(n+1)=S(n)+1, and the sum S(n)+S(n+1) is odd, which means it cannot equal 2016. Therefore, the number n must end in 9. If it ends in one 9, then S(n+1)=S(n)-8, and thus S(n)=1012. The smallest number with such a sum of digits is 599...989 (the total number of 9s is 111). If the number of 9s at the end of n is not less than two, then by similar reasoning, the sum S(n) will be larger, and the number n will also be larger. Therefore, the answer is 59989.12.

Find the length of B T squared if T is the point where the incircle of A B C touches its side B C.## Answer.24","solution":"# SolutionLet R be the radius of the circumcircle of triangle KBM and r be the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC. First, we will prove that the centers of the circles mentioned in the problem statement coincide. Indeed, the center I of the incircle of triangle ABC lies on the bisector of angle BAC, which is also the bisector of the isosceles triangle BAM. This means that point I lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment BM. Similarly, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment BK. Therefore, it is the center of the circumcircle of triangle KBM. It is known that B T=frac{B C+B A-A C}{2}=frac{C K+A M-A C}{2}=frac{K M}{2}. Triangle K I M is isosceles: І mathrm{~K}=mathrm{I} M as radii of the circumcircle of triangle mathrm{K} B mathrm{~L}. Let the incircle touch side AC at point S.

Given a_1 = 1, we can find the general term formula:a_n = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n - 1}.(II) As a_{n + 1} = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{a_n b_n}, it follows that:left(frac{1}{2}right)^n = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{a_n b_n},which implies:b_n = n cdot 2^{n - 1}.Now, we can find the sum T_n:T_n = sum_{k = 1}^{n} k cdot 2^{k - 1}.Multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain:2T_n = sum_{k = 1}^{n} k cdot 2^k.Subtracting the two expressions, we get:-T_n = sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} 2^k - n cdot 2^n = (1 - n)2^n - 1.Thus,T_n = 1 + (n - 1)2^n.We want to find the minimum value of T_n such that T_n geq m always holds.

The derivative of f(x) is calculated as follows:f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{1}{3}x^3+ax^2-2x-1right) = x^2 + 2ax - 2.At x=0, we find the value of f(x) and f'(x) to determine the point of tangency and the slope of the tangent line:f(0) = frac{1}{3}(0)^3 + a(0)^2 - 2(0) - 1 = -1,f'(0) = (0)^2 + 2a(0) - 2 = -2.Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at x=0 is -2, and the point of tangency is (0, -1). Using the point-slope form of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line, we find the equation of the tangent line:y - (-1) = -2(x - 0),which simplifies to y + 1 = -2x.

Notice that from k-digit numbers satisfying the condition, we can form suitable (k+1)-digit numbers by adding one of the 8 permissible digits (not zero and not the one in the highest place) to the left. In addition, (k+1)-digit numbers can be formed from (k-1)-digit numbers by adding one of the 9 non-zero digits and zero to the left. There are no other options.

One can also construct a proof based on the idea that among numbers in which identical digits do not stand next to each other, there are roughly equal numbers of even and odd numbers (for example, the correspondence is built by replacing digits according to the rule d rightarrow 9-d).

Identify Tangent Points and Derivatives:    - For the curve f(x)=frac{a}{x}, let the tangent point be (x_{1}, frac{a}{x_{1}}), and its derivative is f'(x)=-frac{a}{x^{2}}.   - For the curve g(x)=2ln x, let the tangent point be (x_{2}, 2ln x_{2}), and its derivative is g'(x)=frac{2}{x}.2. Equation of Tangent Lines:   - The tangent line at (x_{1}, frac{a}{x_{1}}) for f(x) is y=(-frac{a}{x_{1}^{2}})(x-x_{1})+frac{a}{x_{1}}, which simplifies to y=(-frac{a}{x_{1}^{2}})x+frac{2a}{x_{1}}.   - The tangent line at (x_{2}, 2ln x_{2}) for g(x) is y=frac{2}{x_{2}}x+2ln x_{2}-2.3.

Thanks to Richard Rusczyk for this vector solution Use vectors origin A. Write the vector AB as B etc. Using the familiar BX/CX = AB/AC etc, we have Z = b B /(a+b), Y = c C /(a+c), X = (b B +c C )/(b+c). Hence Z - X = b B (c-a)/((a+b)(b+c)) - c C /(b+c), Y - X = - b B /(b+c) + c C (b-a)/((a+c)(b+c)). We have ( Z - X ) .

Hence bc(a 2 -2 B.C ) + 2 B.C (a 2 +bc) = 0, so B.C = -bc/2. Hence cos A = -1/2, so ∠A = 120 o .

Understanding the Problem:   - We need to consider all permutations of the set ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).   - For each permutation (s = (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)), we calculate (text{nimo}(s)) as the sum of indices (i) where (a_i > a_{i+1}).   - We then sum (2^{text{nimo}(s)}) over all permutations (s in S).2. Counting Permutations:   - The set (S) has (5!) (i.e., 120) permutations.3. Dynamic Programming Approach:   - We can use dynamic programming to build up the solution by considering smaller cases and extending them.4. Base Case:   - For (n = 1), there is only one permutation ((1)) and (text{nimo}((1)) = 0). Thus, (sum_{s in S} 2^{text{nimo}(s)} = 2^0 = 1).5. Recursive Case:   - For (n = 2), the permutations are ((1, 2)) and ((2, 1)).      - For ((1, 2)), (text{nimo}((1, 2)) = 0).     - For ((2, 1)), (text{nimo}((2, 1)) = 1).     - Thus, (sum_{s in S} 2^{text{nimo}(s)} = 2^0 + 2^1 = 1 + 2 = 3).6. General Case:   - For (n = 3), the permutations are ((1, 2, 3)), ((1, 3, 2)), ((2, 1, 3)), ((2, 3, 1)), ((3, 1, 2)), and ((3, 2, 1)).     - Calculate (text{nimo}(s)) for each permutation and sum (2^{text{nimo}(s)}).7. Pattern Recognition:   - We observe that each time we add a new element to the permutation, it can be inserted in any position, and the number of inversions (where (a_i > a_{i+1})) will change accordingly.8. Summing Over All Permutations:   - We need to sum (2^{text{nimo}(s)}) for all permutations of ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).9. Final Calculation:   - Using the recursive approach and dynamic programming, we can compute the sum for (n = 5).10.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the maximum number of points ( N ) on a plane such that any three points form a triangle with angles that are all natural numbers (in degrees).2. Analyzing the constraints: For any triangle, the sum of the angles is ( 180^circ ). Since the angles must be natural numbers, each angle must be an integer between ( 1^circ ) and ( 179^circ ).3. Convex hull consideration: Consider a point ( A ) on the convex hull of the set of points, and let ( B ) and ( C ) be the points adjacent to ( A ) on the convex hull. The angle ( angle BAC ) must be an integer.4. Bounding the number of points: If there are ( N ) points, then there are ( N-3 ) points inside the triangle ( triangle ABC ). For ( angle BAC ) to be an integer and for the triangle to have integer angles, the sum of the angles at ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) must be ( 180^circ ).5. Maximum angle consideration: If there are at least ( 178 ) other points inside ( angle BAC ), then ( angle BAC geq 179^circ ). This is impossible because the sum of the angles in any triangle is ( 180^circ ), and having one angle ( geq 179^circ ) would leave less than ( 1^circ ) for the other two angles combined, which is not possible.6. Constructing the maximum number of points: To construct the maximum number of points, consider placing ( 180 ) equidistant points on a circle. This ensures that any triangle formed by these points will have angles that are natural numbers. 7. Verification: With ( 180 ) points on a circle, the angles between any three points will be multiples of ( 1^circ ), ensuring that all angles in any triangle formed are natural numbers.Conclusion:The maximum number of points ( N ) for which any three points form a triangle with natural number angles is ( 180 ).The final answer is ( boxed{180} )"},{"problem":"For the inequality about x, |x-1|+|x-2|leq a^2+a+1, the solution set is empty.

Total Participation: Adding up the participants from the initial post, the first round, and the second round gives us 1 + n + n^{2} people in total.Given that after two rounds of spreading, a total of 1641 people participated, we can set up the equation as follows:[1 + n + n^{2} = 1641]This matches option D: 1+n+n^{2}=1641.Therefore, the correct option is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"For a>b>c>0, consider the quadratic equationx^{2}-(a+b+c) x+(a b+b c+c a)=0 text {. }(1) If the equation has real roots, prove that a, b, c cannot be the lengths of the three sides of a triangle;(2) If the equation has a real root x_{0}, prove that a>x_{0}>b+c;(3) When the equation has real roots 6 and 9, find the positive integers a, b, c.","solution":"(1) From the equation having real roots, we know the discriminant is non-negative, i.e.,begin{aligned}0 leqslant Delta & =(a+b+c)^{2}-4(a b+b c+c a) & =a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-2 a b-2 b c-2 c a & =a(a-b-c)-b(a+c-b)-c(a+b-c) & 0, hence a-b-c>0, i.e., a>b+c.This indicates that a, b, c cannot be the three sides of a triangle.Alternatively, the discriminant can be rearranged asbegin{aligned}0 leqslant Delta= & (a+b+c)(a-b-c) & -2 b(a-b)-2 c(a-c) & 0, hencesqrt{Delta}x_{0}>b+c.(3) By the relationship between roots and coefficients, we haveleft{begin{array}{l}a+b+c=15, a b+b c+c a=54,end{array}right.Thus,begin{aligned}a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} & =(a+b+c)^{2}-2(a b+b c+c a) & =225-108=1179, hence9^{2}c, hence b=4, c=1.

If we draw overline{O_1A} and overline{O_2B}, we form two [right triangles](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Right_triangle). As overline{AF} and overline{AD} are both [tangents](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Tangent) to the circle, we see that overline{O_1A} is an [angle bisector](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Angle_bisector). Thus, triangle AFO_1 cong triangle ADO_1. Call x = AD = AF and y = EB = BG. We know that x + y + 2r = 34. If we call angle CAB = theta, then angle DAO_1 = frac{180 - theta}{2}. Apply the [tangent half-angle formula](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Trigonometric_identities) (tan frac{theta}{2} = sqrt{frac{1 - cos theta}{1 + cos theta}}). We see that frac rx = tan frac{180 - theta}{2} = sqrt{frac{1 - cos (180 - theta)}{1 + cos (180 - theta)}}= sqrt{frac{1 + cos theta}{1 - cos theta}}. Also, cos theta = frac{30}{34} = frac{15}{17}. Thus, frac rx = sqrt{frac{1 + frac{15}{17}}{1 - frac{15}{17}}}, and x = frac{r}{4}. Similarly, we find that y = r/sqrt{frac{1 + frac{8}{17}}{1 - frac{8}{17}}} = frac{3r}{5}.Therefore, x + y + 2r = frac{r}{4} + frac{3r}{5} + 2r = frac{57r}{20} = 34 Longrightarrow r = frac{680}{57}, and p + q = 737.Solution 2Use a similar solution to the aforementioned solution. Instead, call angle CAB = 2theta, and then proceed by simplifying through identities. We see that frac rx = tan left(frac{180 - 2theta}{2}right) = tan (90 - theta). In terms of r, we find that x = frac{r}{cot theta} = frac{rsin theta}{cos theta}. Similarly, we find that y = frac{r sin(45 - theta)}{cos (45 - theta)}. Substituting, we find that rleft(frac{sin theta}{cos theta} + frac{sin(45 - theta)}{cos (45 - theta)} + 2right) = 34. Under a common denominator, rleft(frac{sin theta cos (45 - theta) + cos theta sin (45 - theta)}{cos theta cos (45 - theta)} + 2right) = 34. [Trigonometric identities](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Trigonometric_identities) simplify this to rleft(frac{sinleft((theta) + (45 - theta)right)}{frac 12 left(cos (theta + 45 - theta) + cos (theta - 45 + theta) right)} + 2right) = 34. From here, it is possible to simplify:rleft(frac{2 sin 45}{cos 45 + cos 2theta cos 45 + sin 2theta sin 45} +2right) = 34rleft(frac{2}{frac{17}{17} + frac{8}{17} + frac{15}{17}} + 2right) = 34rleft(frac{57}{20}right) = 34Our answer is 34 cdot frac{20}{57} = frac{680}{57}, and p + q = 737.Solution 3Let the point where CB's extension hits the circle be G, and the point where the hypotenuse hits that circle be E. Clearly EB=GB. Let EB=x. Draw the two [perpendicular](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Perpendicular) radii to G and E. Now we have a [cyclic quadrilateral](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Cyclic_quadrilateral). Let the radius be length r. We see that since the cosine of angle ABC is frac{15}{17} the cosine of angle EBG is -frac{15}{17}. Since the measure of the angle opposite to EBG is the [complement](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Complement) of this one, its cosine is frac{15}{17}. Using the law of cosines, we see that x^{2}+x^{2}+frac{30x^{2}}{17}=r^{2}+r^{2}-frac{30r^{2}}{17}This tells us that r=4x.Now look at the other end of the hypotenuse. Call the point where CA hits the circle F and the point where the hypotenuse hits the circle D. Draw the radii to F and D and we have cyclic quadrilaterals once more.Using the law of cosines again, we find that the length of our tangents is 2.4x. Note that if we connect the centers of the circles we have a rectangle with sidelengths 8x and 4x. So, 8x+2.4x+x=34. Solving we find that 4x=frac{680}{57} so our answer is 737.Solution 4[AIME I 2007-9b.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:AIME_I_2007-9b.png)By Pythagoras, AB = 34.  Let I_{C} be the C-excenter of triangle ABC.  Then the C-exradius r_{C} is given byr_{C}= frac{K}{s-c}= frac{240}{40-34}= 40.The circle with center O_{1} is tangent to both AB and AC, which means that O_{1} lies on the external angle bisector of angle BAC.  Therefore, O_{1} lies on AI_{C}.  Similarly, O_{2} lies on BI_{C}.Let r be the common radius of the circles with centers O_{1} and O_{2}.  The distances from points O_{1} and O_{2} to AB are both r, so O_{1}O_{2} is parallel to AB, which means that triangles I_{C}AB and I_{C}O_{1}O_{2} are similar.The distance from I_{C} to AB is r_{C}= 40, so the distance from I_{C} to O_{1}O_{2} is 40-r.  Therefore,frac{40-r}{40}= frac{O_{1}O_{2}}{AB}= frac{2r}{34}quad Rightarrow quad r = frac{680}{57}.Hence, the final answer is 680+57 = 737.Solution 5[AIME I 2007-9c.gif](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:AIME_I_2007-9c.gif)Start with a scaled 16-30-34 triangle.

The height, h, and radius, r, are found via A=frac{1}{2}times 16stimes 30s=frac{1}{2}times 34stimes h=frac{1}{2}times rp, where p is the [perimeter](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Perimeter).Cut the figure through the circle and perpendicular to the hypotenuse.  Slide the two pieces in opposite directions along the hypotenuse until they are one diameter of the circle apart.  Complete the two partial circles.The linear dimensions of the new triangle are frac{46s}{34s}=frac{23}{17} times the size of the original.  The problem's 16-30-34 triangle sits above the circles.  Equate heights and solve for r=6s:frac{240s}{17}timesfrac{23}{17} =  frac{240}{17}+12s20stimes 23 =  20times 17+stimes 17times 17s = frac{340}{171}r = 6s = frac{680}{57}The answer is 737.Solution 6[AIME 2007 -9.PNG](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:AIME_2007_-9.PNG)Using [homothety](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Homothety) in the diagram above, as well as the [auxiliary](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=Auxiliary&action=edit&redlink=1) triangle, leads to the solution.Solution 7A different approach is to plot the triangle on the Cartesian Plane with C at (0,0), A at (0,30), and B at (16,0). We wish to find the coordinates of O_1 and O_2 in terms of the radius, which will be expressed as r in the rest of this solution. When we know the coordinates, we will set the distance between the 2 points equal to 2r. All points r units away from overline{AB} are on the line with slope -frac{15}{8}, and y-intercept 30+ frac{17}{8} rO_1 will have x-coordinate r and likewise O_2 will have y-coordinate rplugging this into the equation for the line mentioned in the sentence above gives us:O_1 = left(r,frac14 r+30right) and O_2 = left(frac35 r+16,rright)By the distance formula and the fact that the circles and tangent, we have: left(16-frac25 rright)^2 + left(30-frac34 rright)^2 = (2r)^2which simplifies into the quadratic equation: 1311 r^2 + 23120 r - 462400 = 0And by the quadratic equation, the solutions are: frac{-23120 pm 54400}{2622}The solution including the \\"-\\" is extraneous so we have the radius equal tofrac{31280}{2622}Which simplifies to frac{680}{57}. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is boxed{737}Solution 8 (simple algebra)It is known that O_1O_2 is parallel to AB. Thus, extending O_1F and GO_2 to intersect at H yields similar triangles O_1O_2H and BAC, so that O_1O_2 = 2r, O_1H = frac{16r}{17}, and HO_2 = frac{30r}{17}. It should be noted that O_2G = r. Also, FHGC is a rectangle, and so AF = frac{47r}{17} - 30 and similarly for BG. Because tangents to a circle are equal, the hypotenuse can be expressed in terms of r: [2r + frac{47r}{17} - 30 + frac{33r}{17} - 16 = 34] Thus, r = frac{680}{57}, and the answer is boxed{737}.NoteWhen drawing the diagram, it may seem that H lies on circle O_1, but it is actually not: H lies inside of circle O_1. We can see this from the similarity ratios: frac{O_1O_2}{BA}=frac{HO_1}{CB}=frac{HO_2}{CA}. Taking a look at the first equation (tfrac{O_1O_2}{BA}=tfrac{HO_1}{CB}), frac{2r}{34}=frac{HO_1}{16} which simplifies to frac r{17}=frac{HO_1}{16}. Indeed, HO_1 does not equal r, instead, HO_1=frac{16}{17}r. ~BakedPotato66Solution 9Let the radius of the circle be r. It can be seen that Delta FHO_{1} and Delta O_{2}GJ are similar to Delta ACB, and the length of the hypotenuses are frac{17}{8}r and frac {17}{15}r, respectively. Then, the entire length of HJ is going to be (frac{17}{8}+frac{17}{15}+2)r = frac{631}{120}r. The length of the hypotenuse of Delta ACB is 34, so the length of the height to AB is frac{16*30}{34} = frac{240}{17}. Thus, the height to Delta HCJ is going to be frac{240}{17} + r. Delta HCJ is similar to Delta ACB so we have the following: frac{frac{631}{120}r}{34} = frac{frac{240}{17} + r}{frac{240}{17}}. Cross multiplying and simplifying, we get that r = frac{680}{57} so the answer is boxed{737}.~Leonard_my_dude~"},{"problem":"Given that the moving circle M is tangent to the line y=2 and externally tangent to the fixed circle C: x^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=1, find the equation of the trajectory of the center of the moving circle M.","solution":"[Analysis]From the given conditions, since the moving circle M is tangent to the line y=2 and externally tangent to the fixed circle C: x^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=1, it can be concluded that the distance from the moving point M to C(0,-3) is equal to its distance to the line y=3.

Let the sides be ( a = x ), ( b = y ), and ( c = AD = 30 ).7. The semi-perimeter ( s ) is:   [   s = frac{x + y + 30}{2}   ]8. The area ( K ) of the triangle is given by:   [   K = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}   ]9. To find ( K^2 ), we use:   [   K^2 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)   ]   Substituting ( s = frac{x + y + 30}{2} ), we get:   [   K^2 = left( frac{x + y + 30}{2} right) left( frac{x + y + 30}{2} - x right) left( frac{x + y + 30}{2} - y right) left( frac{x + y + 30}{2} - 30 right)   ]   Simplifying each term:   [   frac{x + y + 30}{2} - x = frac{-x + y + 30}{2}   ]   [   frac{x + y + 30}{2} - y = frac{x - y + 30}{2}   ]   [   frac{x + y + 30}{2} - 30 = frac{x + y - 30}{2}   ]   Therefore:   [   K^2 = frac{(x + y + 30)(-x + y + 30)(x - y + 30)(x + y - 30)}{16}   ]10. Using the identity ( (a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2 ), we get:    [    K^2 = frac{((x + y)^2 - 900)(900 - (x - y)^2)}{16}    ]11.

Lower Bound Argument:   Consider ( |X| = 2n - 2 ). We construct the subsets ( B_i ) as follows:   [   B_1 = {1, 2}, B_2 = {3, 4}, ldots, B_{n-1} = {2n-3, 2n-2}, B_n = {1, 3}   ]   In this case, any subset ( Y ) of ( X ) with ( |Y| = n ) will have at least one ( B_i ) such that ( |Y cap B_i| geq 2 ). Therefore, ( |X| = 2n - 2 ) is not sufficient.3. Proving ( |X| geq 2n - 1 ):   We need to show that ( |X| geq 2n - 1 ) is necessary. Assume ( |X| = 2n - 1 ). We will prove that there exists a subset ( Y subseteq X ) with ( |Y| = n ) and ( |Y cap B_i| leq 1 ) for all ( i ).4. Constructing the Subset ( Y ):   Choose ( Y ) such that ( |Y| ) is maximized and ( |Y cap B_i| leq 1 ) for all ( i ). Suppose ( |Y| leq n - 1 ). Then ( |X setminus Y| geq n ).5. Contradiction Argument:   For each ( a in X setminus Y ), there exists ( 1 leq t(a) leq n ) and ( x_a in Y ) such that ( (a, x_a) in B_{t(a)} ). If not, we could add ( a ) to ( Y ) and get ( |Y'| > |Y| ), contradicting the maximality of ( |Y| ).6. Distinct Subsets:   If ( a neq b ), then ( B_{t(a)} neq B_{t(b)} ). Since ( |X setminus Y| geq n ), we have at least ( n ) distinct subsets ( B_{t(a)} ). Thus, ( |X setminus Y| = n ).7. Final Contradiction:   The subset ( X setminus Y ) satisfies ( |(X setminus Y) cap B_i| = 1 ) for all ( i ) and ( |X setminus Y| = n ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( |Y| ) must be exactly ( n ).8.

A valid 2017-tuple is n_{1}=cdots=n_{2017}=29. We will show that it is the only solution.We first replace each number n_{i} in the circle by m_{i}:=n_{i}-29. Since the condition a-b+ c-d+e=29 can be rewritten as (a-29)-(b-29)+(c-29)-(d-29)+(e-29)=0, we have that any five consecutive replaced integers in the circle can be labeled a, b, c, d, e in such a way that a-b+c-d+e=0.

What is the maximum number of edges that a plane, not passing through its vertices, can intersect?#","solution":"The plane does not intersect at least one edge in each face.## SolutionThe answer is 66. We need to prove that this number is possible, and that a larger number is impossible. First, let's prove the latter. Each face of the polyhedron is intersected by the plane in no more than two edges, meaning that at least one edge belonging to the face remains unintersected. Therefore, in each face, the unintersected edges constitute no less than a third of the total number of edges (in that face). Summing up all these inequalities for all faces, and considering that each edge belongs to two faces, we obtain the desired statement. We will provide an example of a convex polyhedron, 66 edges of which are intersected by a certain plane, not passing through its vertices. Consider a regular 100-gon in the plane; consider a segment of its contour - a broken line (L) consisting of 32 sides; denote its vertices as ( mathrm{C}_{1}, mathrm{C}_{1}, ldots, mathrm{C}_{33} ). Through the center (O) of the 100-gon, draw a segment ( mathrm{AB} ) perpendicular to the plane such that (A) and (B) lie on opposite sides of the plane at equal distances from it. Construct a polyhedron: two of its faces are triangles ( mathrm{AC}_{1} mathrm{~B} ) and ( mathrm{AC}_{33} mathrm{~B} ), and the other faces are triangles of the form ( mathrm{AC}_{mathrm{i}} mathrm{C}_{mathrm{i}+1} ) and ( mathrm{BC}_{mathrm{i}} mathrm{C}_{mathrm{i}+1} ). This polyhedron has exactly 99 edges.

With one question about any 50 numbers, you can find out the order of these 50 numbers relative to each other.

We will construct a set a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{100} for which we cannot, by asking two more questions, uniquely determine the order of the numbers. Consider the situation where all numbers mentioned in both the first and second questions are in the same positions in the answers.As the desired set, we will take the set where k_{i}, l_{i} in {a_{2i-1}, a_{i}}, i=1,2, ldots, 50, and, moreover, in each quartet (a_{4m-3}, a_{4m-2}, a_{4m-1}, a_{4m}),m=1,2, ldots, 25, no comparisons of adjacent pairs of numbers from this quartet were made in the first two questions. We will show that such a set exists.Let X be the set of numbers that did not appear in the first two questions. The following cases are possible:k_{2m-1}=l_{2m-1}, k_{2m}=l_{2m},k_{2m-1}=l_{2m-1}, k_{2m} neq l_{2m},k_{2m-1} neq l_{2m-1}, k_{2m} neq l_{2m},k_{2m-1} neq l_{2m-1}, k_{2m}=l_{2m},For these cases, we will construct quartets (a_{4m-3}, a_{4m-2}, a_{4m-1}, a_{4m}) as follows: (k_{2m-1}, *, *, k_{2m}), (k_{2m-1}, *, k_{2m}, l_{2m}), (k_{2m-1}, l_{2m-1}, k_{2m}, l_{2m}),(k_{2m-1}, l_{2m-1}, *, k_{2m}), where * can be any number from the set X that did not appear in the questions and in the construction of previous quartets.Thus, it is shown that after two questions, a situation is possible (regardless of the asker's desire) where no pair (a_{i}, a_{i+1}) for i not divisible by 4 is covered. Each of the 100 numbers is part of at least one uncovered pair, and therefore, must appear in at least one of the subsequent questions.Suppose that in this situation, all uncovered pairs can be covered in two questions; then each of the 100 numbers must appear in exactly one of such questions. Considering quartets of the form (a_{4i-3}, a_{4i-2}, a_{4i-1}, a_{4i}), i=1,2, ldots, 25, note that if one number from such a quartet appears in a question, then the other three must also (otherwise, not all pairs of adjacent numbers in this quartet will be covered). But then the number of numbers in the set about which the question is asked must be divisible by 4. Since 50 is not divisible by 4, we have a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the order of the numbers 1,2, ldots, 100 in a row with four questions.We will show how to do this in five questions. The first question is about the set M_{1}={1,2, ldots, 50}, the second is about the set M_{2}={51,52, ldots, 100}. The set M_{3} will consist of the 25 leftmost numbers of the set M_{1} and the 25 leftmost numbers of the set M_{2}, and the set M_{4} will consist of the 25 rightmost numbers of the set M_{1} and the 25 rightmost numbers of the set M_{2}. The answer to the question about the set M_{3} will clearly determine the numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{25}, and the answer to the question about the set M_{4} will determine the numbers a_{76}, a_{77}, ldots, a_{100}.

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b). Immediately, we understand that O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}, O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}, and O B = |b| = -b.Let's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point D with coordinates (0 ; d) (Fig. 12). The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D. We get -x_{1} cdot x_{2} = -b cdot d, from which, replacing x_{1} cdot x_{2} with 12b by Vieta's theorem, we get d = 12.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_3890a5f9667fd1ab5160g-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)Fig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7It remains to note that triangle BTD is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point M, has coordinates (0 ; 3).

The number of ways to place the two commands L and R on 8 positions is C_{8}^{2} cdot C_{2}^{1}: C_{8}^{2} is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 8, and C_{2}^{1}=2 is the number of ways to place the commands L and R on these two positions. On the remaining 6 positions, 3 U commands can be placed in C_{6}^{3} ways. Therefore, N_{1}=C_{8}^{2} cdot C_{2}^{1} cdot C_{6}^{3}=1120;- boldsymbol{k}=mathbf{2}. Here, there are two L commands, two R commands, and two U and two D commands. For L and R, there are C_{8}^{4} cdot C_{4}^{2} ways to place them. On the remaining 4 positions, 2 U commands can be placed in C_{4}^{2} ways. Thus, N_{2}=C_{8}^{4} cdot C_{4}^{2} cdot C_{4}^{2}=2520.By reasoning similarly, it can be shown that N_{3}=N_{1} and N_{4}=N_{0}.

We will use combinatorial methods and probability calculations to achieve this.1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a rectangular chocolate bar divided into two halves: dark chocolate on the left and white chocolate on the right.   - We randomly select 4 points on the top segment (P_0P_5) and label them (P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4) from left to right.   - Similarly, we randomly select 4 points on the bottom segment (Q_0Q_5) and label them (Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4) from left to right.   - The segments (P_1Q_1, P_2Q_2, P_3Q_3, P_4Q_4) divide the chocolate bar into 5 smaller trapezoidal pieces.   - We need to find the probability that exactly 3 of these pieces contain both dark and white chocolate.2. Case Analysis:   - We need to consider the possible ways the points can be distributed such that exactly 3 pieces contain both dark and white chocolate.   - This can happen in two main cases:     - Case 1: The points on both the top and bottom segments are split in a (1:3) ratio around the midline.     - Case 2: One segment has a (2:2) ratio and the other segment has a (4:0) ratio.3. Case 1: (1:3) Ratio on Both Sides:   - The probability of selecting 1 point on the dark side and 3 points on the white side for the top segment is (frac{binom{4}{1}}{16}).   - Similarly, the probability for the bottom segment is also (frac{binom{4}{1}}{16}).   - Since this can happen in two ways (either the first point is on the dark side or the last point is on the dark side), we multiply by 2.   - Therefore, the probability for this case is:     [     frac{binom{4}{1}}{16} times frac{binom{4}{1}}{16} times 2 = frac{4}{16} times frac{4}{16} times 2 = frac{1}{8}     ]4. Case 2: (2:2) Ratio and (4:0) Ratio:   - The probability of selecting 2 points on the dark side and 2 points on the white side for one segment is (frac{binom{4}{2}}{16}).   - The probability of selecting all 4 points on one side (either all dark or all white) for the other segment is (frac{binom{4}{0}}{16}).   - Since this can happen in two ways (either the top segment has the (2:2) ratio or the bottom segment has the (2:2) ratio), we multiply by 2.   - Additionally, for each of these, there are 2 ways to choose which side has the (4:0) ratio (all dark or all white), so we multiply by another 2.   - Therefore, the probability for this case is:     [     frac{binom{4}{2}}{16} times frac{binom{4}{0}}{16} times 2 times 2 = frac{6}{16} times frac{1}{16} times 4 = frac{3}{32}     ]5. Total Probability:   - Adding the probabilities from both cases, we get:     [     frac{1}{8} + frac{3}{32} = frac{4}{32} + frac{3}{32} = frac{7}{32}     ]6. Final Answer:   - The probability that exactly 3 pieces of chocolate contain both dark and white chocolate is (frac{7}{32}).   - Therefore, (m = 7) and (n = 32), and (m + n = 7 + 32 = 39).The final answer is (boxed{39})."},{"problem":"Kris is asked to compute log_{10} (x^y), where y is a positive integer and x is a positive real number.

In all cases, the conditions are chosen such that E L=A B / 6, i.e., the length E L is equal to the distance from point E to the line M P, and then the line of intersection of the cutting plane with the base plane is M P, with M P | A D.

First, calculate the cost for 30 people: 120 times 30 = 3600 yuan.   Since 3600 < 4000, it means the number of visitors exceeded 30.2. Let the total number of visitors be x.   Then, the per-person travel cost becomes 120 - 2(x - 30) yuan.3. Therefore, the equation for the total cost is x[120 - 2(x - 30)] = 4000.   Solving this equation, we get x = 40 or x = 50.4. When x = 40, the per-person cost is 120 - 2(40 - 30) = 100 yuan, which is greater than 90 yuan.   When x = 50, the per-person cost is 120 - 2(50 - 30) = 80 yuan, which is less than 90 yuan (discard this solution).Therefore, the answer is: the unit had a total of boxed{40} people for this visit to the World Expo."},{"problem":"Let the universal set U={1,2,3,4,5}, set M={1,3,5}, and set N={3,4,5}.

Such permutations must satisfy the original condition for n=k-1, and by the induction hypothesis, there are at most 2^{k-2} such permutations.It remains to prove that at most two permutations of 1,2, cdots, k can correspond to the same permutation of 1,2, cdots, k-1. Thus, the total number of permutations is at most 2^{k-2} times 2=2^{k-1}.Assume otherwise, then there exist three permutations of 1,2, cdots, k that correspond to the same permutation of 1,2, cdots, k-1.By symmetry, assume this permutation of 1,2, cdots, k-1 is 1,2, cdots, k-1, and in the three permutations P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3} of 1,2, cdots, k, k is in the a, b, c(1 leqslant a < b < c leqslant n) positions.Consider the numbers a, b, k.In the permutationP_{1}={1,2, cdots, a-1, k, a, a+1, cdots, k-1}the order of these three numbers is k, a, b, with a lying between the other two;In the permutationP_{2}={1,2, cdots, b-1, k, b, b+1, cdots, k-1}the order of these three numbers is a, k, b, with k lying between the other two;In the permutationP_{3}={1,2, cdots, c-1, k, c, c+1, cdots, k-1}the order of these three numbers is a, b, k, with b lying between the other two.Thus, each of these three numbers has once lain between the other two, which contradicts the problem's condition.Therefore, the assumption is false, and when n=k, m leqslant 2^{n-1} also holds.Thus, we have proved that m leqslant 2^{n-1}.Next, provide an example where m=2^{n-1}.Construct permutations of 1,2, cdots, n as follows:First, place 1, and when 1,2, cdots, r(1 leqslant r leqslant n-1) are all placed, place r+1 at the leftmost or rightmost position of the first r numbers.

For this sum to equal 60, 2k+1 must be an odd divisor of 60, and n=frac{60}{2k+1}>k must hold.This yields the following solutions:For 2k+1=3, n=20>1, so 60=19+20+21 andfor 2k+1=5, n=12>2, so 60=10+11+12+13+14+15.For the only other odd divisor 2k+1=15 of 60, we get n=4, which is less than k=7.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that if we color ( n ) arbitrary vertices of a cube in red, there will be at least one vertex of the cube which has all three of its adjacent vertices colored in red.2. Analyzing the Cube:   A cube has 8 vertices and each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices. We need to ensure that at least one vertex has all its neighbors colored red.3. Considering ( n leq 4 ):   If ( n leq 4 ), we can color the vertices in such a way that no vertex has all three of its neighbors colored red. For example, we can color any 4 vertices on one face of the cube. In this case, no vertex on the opposite face will have all its neighbors colored red, and no vertex on the same face will have all its neighbors colored red either.4. Considering ( n = 5 ):   We claim that if ( n = 5 ), there will always be a vertex with all its neighbors colored red. To prove this, we use the Pigeonhole Principle.5. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:   The cube can be divided into two sets of 4 vertices each, corresponding to the \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\" faces of the cube. If we color 5 vertices, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these sets must contain at least 3 red vertices.6. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: One face has exactly 3 red vertices.     - Without loss of generality, assume the \\"top\\" face has 3 red vertices. The possible configurations of these 3 vertices will always leave at least one vertex on the \\"top\\" face with all its neighbors colored red.   - Case 2: One face has exactly 4 red vertices.     - If the \\"top\\" face has 4 red vertices, then any vertex on the \\"top\\" face will have all its neighbors colored red.7. Conclusion:   Since in both cases (3 or 4 red vertices on one face), there will always be a vertex with all its neighbors colored red, we conclude that ( n = 5 ) is the smallest number satisfying the condition.The final answer is (boxed{5})."},{"problem":"Find the four smallest four-digit numbers that meet the following condition: by dividing by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 the remainder is  1.","solution":"1.

Combine the congruences:   Notice that all the moduli (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are factors of 60. Therefore, we can combine these congruences into a single congruence:   [   x equiv 1 pmod{60}.   ]   This is because the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 60.3. Express ( x ) in terms of ( n ):   From the combined congruence, we have:   [   x = 60n + 1,   ]   where ( n ) is a natural number.4.

Answer: angle A B C=60^{circ}, S_{triangle A B C}=36 sqrt{3}, R=2 sqrt{13}.","solution":"Solution. The median of a right triangle drawn from the vertex of the right angle is equal to half the hypotenuse. Since F M and E N are medians of triangles A F H and C E H, then H M=A M=F M=2, C N=E N=H N=5. Let angle A H F=angle C H E=alpha. Then angle E H F=180^{circ}-alpha, angle E B F=alpha (since in quadrilateral B F H E angles E and F are right). Next, we find: angle M F H=alpha (triangle M F H is isosceles), angle N E H=alpha (triangle N E H is isosceles), angle E N H=180^{circ}-2 alpha. Since E N | F M, angles M F H and N E H are equal as alternate interior angles, from which alpha=180^{circ}-2 alpha and alpha=60^{circ}.

A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, while a losing position is one where the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.1. Base Cases:   - If there are 0 chips left, the player to move loses because they cannot make a move. Thus, 0 is a losing position.   - If there are 2, 4, or 5 chips left, the player to move can take all the chips and win. Thus, 2, 4, and 5 are winning positions.   - If there are 1 or 3 chips left, the player to move cannot take a valid number of chips (since they must take 2, 4, or 5 chips). Thus, 1 and 3 are losing positions.2. Inductive Step:   - Assume we know the winning and losing positions up to some number ( n ). We need to determine the status of ( n+1 ).   - If ( n+1 ) is a losing position, then the player to move cannot force a win. This means that for all possible moves ( s in {2, 4, 5} ), the resulting position ( n+1-s ) must be a winning position.   - Conversely, if ( n+1 ) is a winning position, then there must be at least one move ( s in {2, 4, 5} ) such that the resulting position ( n+1-s ) is a losing position.3. Pattern Recognition:   - By examining the positions modulo 7, we can identify a pattern:     - ( 0 mod 7 ) is a losing position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 1 mod 7 ) is a losing position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 2 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 3 mod 7 ) is a losing position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 4 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 5 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 6 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).4. Generalization:   - We can generalize this pattern to all numbers:     - ( 7k ) and ( 7k+1 ) are losing positions.     - ( 7k+2, 7k+3, 7k+4, 7k+5, 7k+6 ) are winning positions.5.

The formula to calculate the sales volume in June, given the sales volume in April and the growth rate, is 256(1+m)^2.Given that the sales volume in June is 400 units, we set up the equation:[256(1+m)^2 = 400]Solving for m, we get:[(1+m)^2 = frac{400}{256} = frac{25}{16}][1+m = pmsqrt{frac{25}{16}}][m = pmfrac{5}{4} - 1]We find two possible values for m: m_1 = 0.25 and m_2 = -2.25.

The profit per unit would then be (y-35) yuan. According to the given information, for every 1 yuan reduction in price, the monthly sales volume increases by 20 units. Therefore, if the price is reduced from 58 yuan to y yuan, the increase in sales volume is 20(58-y) units. Given that the sales volume in June (and predicted for July) is 400 units, the total sales volume after the price adjustment is 400 + 20(58-y) = 1560 - 20y units.The total profit is given by the product of profit per unit and the total sales volume, which should equal 8400 yuan. Therefore, we have:[(y-35)(1560-20y) = 8400]Expanding and simplifying the equation, we find the values of y that satisfy it. Solving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for y: y_1 = 50 and y_2 = 63.

Find the maximum value of positive integer N such that, regardless of the students' sitting positions, at the end there is a set S consisting of N students satisfying the following property: every  two of them have never been sitting together.","solution":"1. Model the Problem as a Graph:   - Consider each student as a vertex in a graph ( G ).   - Each desk with two students sitting together can be represented as an edge between two vertices.   - Since there are 26 students and each desk has 2 students, we have 13 edges in the graph.2. Graph Properties:   - The graph ( G ) is a 2-regular graph because each vertex (student) is connected to exactly two other vertices (students they have sat with).   - We need to ensure that after the students change seats, no two students who were previously sitting together are now sitting together.3. Bipartite Graph Argument:   - A 2-regular graph can be decomposed into two perfect matchings (one for each seating arrangement).   - We claim that ( G ) is bipartite. A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.4. Proof of Bipartiteness:   - Assume for contradiction that ( G ) is not bipartite. Then ( G ) contains an odd cycle.   - In a 2-regular graph, an odd cycle would imply that there is a vertex with two edges of the same color (representing the same seating arrangement), which contradicts the problem's conditions.   - Therefore, ( G ) must be bipartite.5. Partitioning the Graph:   - Since ( G ) is bipartite, we can partition the vertices into two sets ( A ) and ( B ) such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.   - Each set ( A ) and ( B ) will have equal sizes because the graph is 2-regular and has an even number of vertices (26 vertices).6. Conclusion:   - The maximum value of ( N ) such that there exists a set ( S ) of ( N ) students where no two students in ( S ) have ever sat together is the size of one of the bipartite sets.   - Since the graph is bipartite and has 26 vertices, each set ( A ) and ( B ) will have ( frac{26}{2} = 13 ) vertices.The final answer is ( boxed{13} )."},{"problem":"Given cos alpha - sin alpha = frac{1}{2}, then sin alpha cos alpha = (    )A: frac{3}{8}B: frac{1}{2}C: frac{3}{4}D: frac{3}{2}","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the basic relationships between trigonometric functions of the same angle.

Linear Independence Over (mathbb{Z}/2mathbb{Z}):   - The sum of vectors modulo 2 results in a zero in coordinate ( i ) if and only if ( i ) belongs to an even number of the sets in the sum.   - Since there is always at least one ( i ) which belongs to an odd number of those sets, the sum is not the zero vector.   - Therefore, the vectors ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_k ) must be linearly independent over the field (mathbb{Z}/2mathbb{Z}).4.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to count the number of non-decreasing tuples of integers ((a_1, a_2, dots, a_{16})) such that (0 leq a_i leq 16) for all (i), and the sum of all (a_i) is even.2. Reformulating the Problem:   We can visualize the problem using lattice paths. Mark a dot at points ((i, a_i)) for each (1 leq i leq 16). If (a_{16} < 16), draw a vertical line from ((16, a_{16})) to ((16, 16)). This gives us an up-and-right lattice path from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)). The height of column (i) under this path is (a_i), so the sum of (a_i) is the area under the path.3. Analyzing the Parity of the Sum:   Consider the first (odd, odd) point in the path. To reach this point, the path must have either:   - (1) a vertical segment followed by a horizontal segment, or   - (2) a horizontal segment followed by a vertical segment.      Flipping between (1) and (2) changes the area under the path by exactly 1. Therefore, one configuration has an even area, and the other has an odd area. This bijection shows that exactly half of the paths with at least one (odd, odd) point have an even area.4. Paths with No (Odd, Odd) Points:   If there is no (odd, odd) point, every column must have an even height. If (i) is odd, then (a_i) must be even. If (i) is even, even columns cannot have odd height, as this would create an (odd, odd) point in the next column. Thus, every path with no (odd, odd) point has an even area.5. Counting the Paths:   Let (A) be the number of paths with no (odd, odd) point. The total number of paths from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)) is (binom{32}{16}). The number of paths with no (odd, odd) point is (binom{16}{8}).6.

Therefore, the normal vector overrightarrow{m} is (3, 1, -1).Step 2: Finding a Direction Vector of Line lThe equation of the line l is given as x=frac{y}{2}=-z. To find a direction vector overrightarrow{n} of this line, we can set one of the variables, say y=2, which gives us x=1 and z=-1. Thus, a direction vector of the line l is overrightarrow{n}=(1, 2, -1).Step 3: Calculating the Cosine of the Angle Between Line l and Plane alphaThe angle theta between the line l and the plane alpha can be found using the relationship between the sine of the angle and the dot product of the normal vector of the plane and the direction vector of the line.

For the given inequality to have a solution set of {x|xneq -frac{1}{a}}, it implies that the quadratic equation ax^{2}+2x+a = 0 must have exactly one real root, corresponding to x = -frac{1}{a}. This is because the solution to the inequality excludes only one particular value of x, indicating that the quadratic does not change its sign except at that point.2. The condition for a quadratic equation to have exactly one real root is that its discriminant Delta = 0. For the equation ax^{2}+2x+a = 0, the discriminant Delta is given by Delta = b^{2}-4ac. Substituting a = a, b = 2, and c = a yields Delta = (2)^{2}-4(a)(a) = 4-4a^{2}.3. Setting the discriminant equal to zero to find the value of a that satisfies this condition, we have 4-4a^{2} = 0.4. Solving for a, we get 4a^{2} = 4, which simplifies to a^{2} = 1.5. Taking the square root of both sides gives a = pm 1. However, given the solution set {x|xneq -frac{1}{a}} and the nature of the inequality ax^{2}+2x+a > 0, we also conclude that a > 0 to ensure the inequality holds for values of x other than -frac{1}{a}.6.

These triangles can also be degenerate. In each of these triangles, the (non-strict) triangle inequality holds: the distance between the blue and the red point is at most equal to the sum of the distances between the blue and the green and between the red and the green point. We count all these triangle inequalities (one for each triangle that can be formed with a blue, a red, and a green point). We count each distance between a red and a blue point c times (since with a fixed blue and red point, you can still choose c points as the third, green vertex), each distance between a green and a red point b times, and each distance between a blue and a green point a times. We thus get37 c leq 30 b + aSince a + b + c = 10, it follows that 37 c leq 30 b + (10 - b - c) = 10 + 29 b - c, so 38 c leq 10 + 29 b. In other words,frac{38 c - 10}{29} leq bWe can also apply the triangle inequality differently: the distance between the green and the red point is at most equal to the sum of the distances between the red and the blue and between the blue and the green point. If we add up all these inequalities, we get30 b leq 37 c + aThis gives 30 b leq 37 c + (10 - b - c) = 10 + 36 c - b, so 31 b leq 10 + 36 c, orb leq frac{10 + 36 c}{31}Combining (9) and (10) givesfrac{38 c - 10}{29} leq frac{10 + 36 c}{31}so 31(38 c - 10) leq 29(10 + 36 c). Simplifying gives 134 c leq 600, so c leq 4. We now go through the possibilities for c one by one.Suppose c = 1. Then (10) gives b leq frac{46}{31} < 2, which implies b = 1. We get (a, b, c) = (8, 1, 1).Suppose c = 2. Then (9) and (10) give 2 < frac{66}{29} leq b leq frac{82}{31} < 3, so there is no integer b that satisfies this.Suppose c = 3. Then (9) and (10) give 3 < frac{104}{29} leq b leq frac{118}{31} < 4, so there is no integer b that satisfies this.Suppose c = 4. Then (9) and (10) give 4 < frac{142}{29} leq b leq frac{154}{31} < 5, so there is no integer b that satisfies this.The only triplet that could possibly satisfy the conditions is thus (8, 1, 1). We now show that we can indeed choose 8 red points, 1 blue point, and 1 green point in the plane such that all conditions are met. We use a standard coordinate system. Choose the blue point at (0, 0) and the green point at (1, 0). Choose red points at (i, 0) with 2 leq i leq 8. Choose one more red point such that this point, together with the green and blue points, forms an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 2. The sum of the distances between red points and the blue point is now 2 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 8 = 37. The sum of the distances between red points and the green point is 2 + 1 + 2 + cdots + 7 = 30. The distance between the blue point and the green point is 1.We conclude that the only solution is (8, 1, 1)."},{"problem":"Find the standard equations of the following curves:1.

Identify the Center of the Circle: Given that the center of the circle is on the line x-3y=0, we can represent the coordinates of the center as left(3b,bright), where b is a parameter to be determined.2. Determine the Radius of the Circle: Since the circle C is tangent to the negative half-axis of the y-axis and its center's y-coordinate is b, which must be negative for the circle to be tangent to the negative y-axis, the radius of the circle is the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the center, which is -3b (since b<0).3. Formulate the Equation of the Circle: With the center at left(3b,bright) and radius -3b, the equation of the circle can be written as:   [   left(x-3bright)^{2}+left(y-bright)^{2}=left(-3bright)^{2}   ]4. Incorporate the Length of the Chord: The chord cut by circle C on the x-axis is 4sqrt{2} in length.

Then, since the circles are constructed on the sides of the trapezoid AB, BC, and CD as diameters, the angles angle AOB, angle BOC, and angle COD are right angles. Therefore, points A, O, C lie on the same line and points B, O, D lie on the same line, meaning that O is the intersection point of the diagonals of the trapezoid.Let the midpoints of sides AB, BC, and CD be K, L, and M respectively. Since KL and LM are the midlines in triangles ABC and BCD, KL parallel AC and LM parallel BD. Thus, KL perp LM, meaning that triangle KLM is a right triangle. Moreover, KL = frac{AC}{2} = 6, and KM = frac{AD + BC}{2} = 10, so by the Pythagorean theorem, LM = 8. Therefore, BD = 2LM = 16.Instead of reasoning with midlines, we can consider triangles BOC and AOD, which are similar with a ratio of 8:12 = 2:3. Since AC = 12, then OC = frac{2}{5}AC = frac{24}{5}.

This step is implicit in the analysis since we directly jump to using the sum of the numerators equals or greater than 9, leveraging the common denominator (a-c) which is the sum of (a-b) and (b-c).

Consider that the area is just the quarter-circle with radius 20 minus an isosceles right triangle with base length 20, and then doubled (to consider the entire overlapped area)2.

Applying this to the given series:   [   frac{1}{1 cdot 2} + frac{1}{2 cdot 3} + frac{1}{3 cdot 4} + dots + frac{1}{2014 cdot 2015}   ]   becomes:   [   left( frac{1}{1} - frac{1}{2} right) + left( frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} right) + left( frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} right) + dots + left( frac{1}{2014} - frac{1}{2015} right)   ]2. Observe the telescoping nature of the series:   Most terms cancel out:   [   left( frac{1}{1} - frac{1}{2} right) + left( frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} right) + left( frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} right) + dots + left( frac{1}{2014} - frac{1}{2015} right)   ]   The series simplifies to:   [   1 - frac{1}{2015}   ]3. Combine the remaining terms:   [   1 - frac{1}{2015} = frac{2015}{2015} - frac{1}{2015} = frac{2015 - 1}{2015} = frac{2014}{2015}   ]   Thus, ( frac{m}{n} = frac{2014}{2015} ), where ( m = 2014 ) and ( n = 2015 ).4. Calculate ( m + n ):   [   m + n = 2014 + 2015 = 4029   ]5. Find the remainder of ( (m+3)^{1444} ) modulo ( n ):   We need to find ( 2017^{1444} mod 2015 ).6. Use Euler's theorem:   Euler's theorem states that if ( a ) and ( n ) are coprime, then:   [   a^{phi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n}   ]   where ( phi ) is the Euler's totient function. First, calculate ( phi(2015) ):   [   2015 = 5 times 13 times 31   ]   [   phi(2015) = phi(5) times phi(13) times phi(31) = (5-1)(13-1)(31-1) = 4 times 12 times 30 = 1440   ]7. Simplify the exponent using Euler's theorem:   Since ( 2017 equiv 2 pmod{2015} ):   [   2017^{1444} equiv 2^{1444} pmod{2015}   ]   Using ( phi(2015) = 1440 ):   [   2^{1444} = 2^{1440 + 4} = (2^{1440})(2^4) equiv 1 cdot 2^4 pmod{2015} = 16   ]The final answer is ( boxed{16} )"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],L={key:0},E={key:1};function N(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(x,null,w(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),y(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",E,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",L,"See more"))],8,z)):v("",!0)])}const M=f(D,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-d1a9d92f"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/12.md","filePath":"quotes/12.md"}'),O={name:"quotes/12.md"},R=Object.assign(O,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[_(M)]))}});export{G as __pageData,R as default};
