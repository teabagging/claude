Multiplying through by sin B, we get: bcos A + sqrt {3}bsin A - sin Csin B - sin Asin B = 0. Considering that sin C = sin (A + B) due to the angle sum in a triangle and using the sine of sum identity, we get: sin Bcos A + sqrt {3}sin Bsin A - sin Acos B - cos Asin B - sin A = 0. After simplifying, we have: sqrt {3}sin Bsin A - sin Acos B - sin A = 0. Given sin A neq 0, we can divide the whole equation by sin A, yielding: sqrt {3}sin B - cos B = 1.

A permutation of the numbers 1,2,3, ldots, n in some order is called funny if each number, starting from the second from the left, is either greater than all the numbers to its left or less than all the numbers to its left. For example, the permutation 3,2,1,4,5,6 is funny, while the permutation 3,1,2,4,5,6 is not. Find the number of all different funny permutations of the numbers 1,2,3, ldots, n.","solution":"Answer: 2^{n-1}.Let's denote the numbers of our permutation from left to right as a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}.Solution 1. We will start from the end. The last number a_{n} of a funny permutation is either greater or less than all the numbers in the set 1,2,3, ldots, n, so it is either 1 or n. The second-to-last number a_{n-1} of a funny permutation is either greater or less than all the numbers in the set 1,2,3, ldots, n except a_{n}, i.e., it is the smallest or largest element in the set 1,2,3, ldots, n-1 or in the set 2,3, ldots, n. In each case, there are exactly two choices, and the options for the last two numbers of the permutation look like this: (n-1, n), (1, n), (2,1), (n, 1). It is not difficult to verify that for any k=n, n-1, ldots, 2,1, the first k numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} of the permutation form an interval of k consecutive numbers from the set 1,2,3, ldots, n, and the number a_{k} is the minimum or maximum in this interval—there are two possibilities, except for the very first number a_{1}, for which only one possibility remains. In total, we get exactly 2^{n-1} possible choices.Grading criteria for Solution 1.

Let a_{1}=m, where m is one of the numbers 1,2, cdots, n. Any number a_{k} less than m will, by condition, also be less than all numbers less than m and standing to the left of a_{k}, so all numbers in the funny permutation less than m form a decreasing subsequence. Similarly, all numbers greater than m form an increasing subsequence. Any mutual arrangement of these subsequences satisfies the condition and leads to a funny permutation.Therefore, any funny permutation is completely determined by the value of its first element m=1,2, ldots, n and the positions of m-1 places where the numbers m-1, m-2, ldots, 1 are placed in decreasing order from left to right among the n-1 members of the funny permutation, except the first. The remaining places are automatically filled with the numbers m+1, m+2, ldots, n in ascending order. Therefore, for a fixed m=1,2, ldots, n, the number of funny permutations is the number of combinations C_{n-1}^{m-1}, and the total number of them is the sum C_{n-1}^{0}+C_{n-1}^{1}+ldots+C_{n-1}^{n-1}=2^{n-1}.Grading criteria for Solution 2.

We will start from the beginning, considering how the set A_{k}=left{a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}right} of the first k numbers of a funny permutation changes as k=1,2,3, ldots, n increases. As a_{1}, we can take any natural number from the interval 1,2,3, ldots, n, and A_{1}=left{a_{1}right}. Suppose that on the k-th step, the numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} have already been chosen, and let m_{k} and M_{k} be the minimum and maximum of them, respectively.We will prove that the next a_{k+1} must be either m_{k}-1 or M_{k}+1. Indeed, if m_{k} < M_{k}, then a_{k+1} must be either m_{k}-1 or M_{k}+1 because any other choice would violate the condition of the funny permutation. If m_{k} > M_{k}, this is impossible, so on each step, the difference between M_{k} and m_{k} increases by at least 1. The number of steps is n-1, and the final difference between M_{n} and m_{n} does not exceed n-1, so on each step, it increases by exactly 1. From this, it immediately follows that for each k=1,2,3, ldots, n, the set A_{k} consists of some k consecutive numbers from the interval 1,2,3, ldots, n, and A_{k+1} is obtained by adding a number adjacent to this interval on the left or right.

Substituting, we get the equation (x+y+c)(y+c)+(y+c) c+c(x+y+c)=0, which, after rearrangement, is a quadratic in c:3 c^{2}+(2 x+4 y) c+left(x y+y^{2}right)=0The discriminant, 4 x^{2}+4 x y+4 y^{2}=2left(x^{2}+y^{2}+(x+y)^{2}right), is non-negative.Express the quantities appearing in the condition using the new variables, x and y: a-b=x, b-c=y, c-a=-x-y, and(a+b+c)^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+2 a b+2 b c+2 c a=(using the fact that a b+b c+c a=0 by the condition and further simplifying)begin{aligned}& =a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-a b-b c-c a=frac{(a-b)^{2}+(b-c)^{2}+(c-a)^{2}}{2}= & =frac{x^{2}+y^{2}+(x+y)^{2}}{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+x yend{aligned}Thus, the conditions of the problem are satisfied for the polynomial P if and only if for any real pair of numbers x, y,P(x)+P(y)+P(x+y)=2 Pleft(sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+x y}right)(Note that the third term on the left originally is P(c-a)=P(-x-y), which can now be written as P(x+y) because P is an even function.)For the polynomial Q(x), this means thatQleft(x^{2}right)+Qleft(y^{2}right)+Qleft(x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x yright)=2 Qleft(x^{2}+y^{2}+x yright)In the equality, two polynomials in x stand, whose coefficients are polynomials in the variable y. Suppose that the polynomial Q(x) is of degree n and let n>1. The leading coefficient of Q(x) can be divided by (1), so it can be assumed that it is 1. Since (1) is an equality of two polynomials, the coefficients of every power of x on both sides are equal. It is worth paying attention to the x^{2 n-2} term. If the coefficient of x^{n-1} in Q(x) is lambda, then the coefficients of x^{2 n-2} on both sides of (1) are:lambda+0+left(lambda+n y^{2}+binom{n}{2} cdot 4 y^{2}right)=2left(lambda+n y^{2}+binom{n}{2} cdot y^{2}right)Rearranging, we get 2 cdotbinom{n}{2}=n, and thus n=2 for n>1. This means that n leq 2, so Q(x) is at most a quadratic polynomial, and P(x) is at most a quartic even polynomial with a zero constant term: P(x)=alpha cdot x^{4}+beta cdot x^{2}.We will show that these polynomials satisfy the problem's condition. It is sufficient to verify this in the two special cases when P(x)=x^{4} and P(x)=x^{2}. It can be easily verified that the sum of two solutions and a scalar multiple of a solution is also a solution, so we can obtain all polynomials of the given form from the above two special polynomials.If P(x)=x^{4}, thenbegin{aligned}& 2 P(a+b+c)-P(a-b)-P(b-c)-P(c-a)= = & 2(a+b+c)^{4}-(a-b)^{4}-(b-c)^{4}-(c-a)^{4}= = & 12left(a^{3} b+b^{3} c+c^{3} a+a b^{3}+b c^{3}+c a^{3}right)+6left(a^{2} b^{2}+b^{2} c^{2}+c^{2} a^{2}right)+ & +24left(a^{2} b c+b^{2} a c+c^{2} a bright)= = & 6(a b+b c+c a)^{2}+12left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}right)(a b+b c+c a)=0end{aligned}If P(x)=x^{2}, thenbegin{aligned}& 2 P(a+b+c)-P(a-b)-P(b-c)-P(c-a)= = & 2(a+b+c)^{2}-(a-b)^{2}-(b-c)^{2}-(c-a)^{2}= = & 2left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+2 a b+2 b c+2 c aright)-left(a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a bright)- & -left(b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b cright)-left(c^{2}+a^{2}-2 c aright)=6(a b+b c+c a)=0end{aligned}This completes the solution, the sought polynomials can be written in the form P(x)=alpha cdot x^{4}+beta cdot x^{2}, where alpha and beta are arbitrary real numbers."},{"problem":"3.

According to the problem, the pollution index at the park is the sum of the pollution indices from both chemical plants, which can be expressed as:frac{1}{x} + frac{4}{30-x}To minimize the pollution index, we need to find the value of x that minimizes this expression. By analyzing the symmetry of the situation or using calculus (finding the derivative and setting it to zero), we can determine that the pollution index is minimized when the distances are in the same ratio as the square roots of their pollution intensities. Since the square root of the pollution intensity of A is 1 and of B is 2, the ratio of distances should be 1:2. Therefore, the park should be built at a distance that divides the 30 km in a 1:2 ratio, which means:x = frac{30}{1+2} = 10Thus, the park should be built boxed{10} km away from chemical plant A."},{"problem":"11.6.

Therefore, if we construct a green sphere with center G_{i} and radius sqrt{1+d_{i}^{2}}-r, it will touch all the red spheres. Moreover, all points of contact will be distinct, as they lie on segments of the form R_{j} G_{i}, which do not have common points except the endpoints. Thus, in our construction, there will indeed be 1008^{2} blue points.Remark. All red spheres in this example are obtained from each other by rotation around the line ell.

The angle bisectors of angle ADB and angle DAC intersect at the center O_1 of the circle inscribed in triangle AOD, and the angle bisectors of angle ACB and angle DBC intersect at the center O_2 of the circle inscribed in triangle BOC. Therefore, points O_1 and O_2 lie on the bisectors of the vertical angles angle AOD and angle BOC, which means that points O, O_1, and O_2 lie on the same line.Consider the rhombus PO_1QO_2 from the problem statement. In it, we have angle PO_1O_2 = angle PO_2O_1. But angle PO_2O_1 is the external angle for triangle OO_2C; therefore, angle PO_2O_1 = angle PCO + angle O_2OC = (angle ACB + angle BOC) / 2. Similarly, angle PO_1O_2 = angle PO_1O = angle PDO + angle O_1OD = (angle BDA + angle AOD) / 2. Thus, angle BDA = angle ACB = angle CAD. Therefore, triangle AOD is isosceles (AO = OD) and, similarly, BO = OC. Hence, triangles AOB and COD are equal, and AB = CD.The second solution. Denote the vertices of the rhombus as P, O_1, Q, O_2, as in the first solution. Since quadrilateral PO_1QO_2 is a rhombus, the distance between the lines O_2P and O_1Q is equal to the distance between the lines O_1P and O_2Q, that is,AC sin (angle CAD / 2) = BD sin (angle BDA / 2)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_7572b475b56baa9062b2g-06.jpg?height=339&width=424&top_left_y=514&top_left_x=867)Fig. 1Since vertices B and C are equidistant from line AD, we haveAC sin angle CAD = BD sin angle BDADividing the second obtained equality by the first and using the identity sin alpha = 2 sin (alpha / 2) cos (alpha / 2), we getcos (angle CAD / 2) = cos (angle BDA / 2)Since both angles angle CAD and angle BDA are less than 180^circ, we get that angle CAD = angle BDA.

Therefore, the faces can only be triangles and quadrilaterals. Let e be the number of edges, and let the number of triangular faces be k. Then the number of quadrilateral faces is 5-k. Counting the edges of the solid face by face, we get twice the number of edges, that is,2 e=3 k+4(5-k), quad text { from which } quad k=20-2 eTherefore, k is even, and since k leq 5, only k=0,2,4 are possible.The case k=0 does not provide a solution. Indeed, there is no convex polyhedron with 5 quadrilateral faces. If 4 quadrilateral faces meet at a vertex, the fifth would need to connect to 8 edges, which is impossible. If, however, only 3 quadrilateral faces meet at each vertex, then counting the vertices face by face, the number of vertices would be frac{5 cdot 4}{3}, which is also impossible, as the result is not an integer.In the case k=2, we are talking about a solid bounded by two triangles and three quadrilaterals. Here, three quadrilateral faces cannot share a vertex, because the two triangles connected by an edge cannot fit their remaining four edges into 6 edges of quadrilaterals. Thus, the two triangles lie \\"opposite\\" each other. Such a solid can be, for example, a triangular prism, or generally, a truncated 3-sided pyramid.In the case k=4, a quadrilateral face is connected to a triangular face on each of its sides. This polyhedron is a quadrilateral-based pyramid.Therefore, there are two types of convex polyhedra with 5 faces.Remark. Some solvers used Euler's theorem for convex polyhedra, which states that f+v=e+2, where f is the number of faces, v is the number of vertices, and e is the number of edges. This gives v=e-3. Since at least three edges emanate from each vertex, 3 v leq 2 e, or v leq frac{2 e}{3}. From these two relationships, frac{2 e}{3} geq e-3, and thus e leq 9. Considering that the number of vertices is at least 5, since the only 4-vertex solid is clearly the tetrahedron, it follows that e geq 8. Therefore, two cases are possible: e=8 or e=9. The solution can now be completed similarly to the above.In this way, it can also be investigated how many types of convex polyhedra with 6 faces exist. The answer is that there are seven.The solution to the problem is also known for polyhedra with 7, 8, and 9 faces, but not for those with more than 9 faces."},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the definite integral:int_{sqrt{3}}^{sqrt{8}} frac{d x}{x sqrt{x^{2}+1}}","solution":"## Solutionbegin{aligned}& int_{sqrt{3}}^{sqrt{8}} frac{1}{x sqrt{x^{2}+1}} d x=int_{sqrt{3}}^{sqrt{8}} frac{1}{x^{2} cdot frac{1}{x} sqrt{x^{2}+1}} d x=int_{sqrt{3}}^{sqrt{8}} frac{1}{x^{2} sqrt{1+frac{1}{x^{2}}}} d x= & =-int_{sqrt{3}}^{sqrt{3}} frac{1}{sqrt{1+frac{1}{x^{2}}}} dleft(frac{1}{x}right)=-left.ln left|frac{1}{x}+sqrt{frac{1}{x^{2}}+1}right|right|_{sqrt{3}} ^{sqrt{8}}= & =-ln left|frac{1}{sqrt{8}}+sqrt{frac{1}{(sqrt{8})^{2}}+1}right|+ln left|frac{1}{sqrt{3}}+sqrt{frac{1}{(sqrt{3})^{2}}+1}right|= & =-ln left|frac{1+sqrt{9}}{sqrt{8}}right|+ln left|frac{1+sqrt{4}}{sqrt{3}}right|=-ln left|frac{4}{2 sqrt{2}}right|+ln left|frac{3}{sqrt{3}}right|= & =-ln sqrt{2}+ln sqrt{3}=ln sqrt{frac{3}{2}}end{aligned}Source — «http://pluspi.org/wiki/index.php/������������ %D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%98%D0%BD % mathrm{D} 1 % 82 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 5 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 3 % mathrm{D} 1 % 80 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{~B} 0 % mathrm{D} 0 % mathrm{BB} % mathrm{D} 1 % 8 mathrm{~B}+4-17 »Categories: Kuznetsov's Problem Book Integrals Problem 4 | IntegralsUkrainian Banner Network- Last edited on this page: 17:10, 3 March 2009.- Content is available under CC-BY-SA 3.0.Created by GeeTeatoo## Problem Kuznetsov Integrals 4-18## Material from Plusi"},{"problem":"Example 11.

The family of circles equation that passes through the intersection points A and B is given by:x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+6y + lambda(x^{2}+y^{2}-6x)=0Now, we need to find the value of lambda such that the equation represents the common chord of the two circles. Since the common chord is a straight line, its equation can be found by setting the discriminant of the quadratic equation in x and y to zero, which is formed by the family of circles equation.First, let's rewrite the family of circles equation:(1+lambda)x^2 + (1+lambda)y^2 - (4 + 6lambda)x + 6y = 0Now, setting the discriminant of the quadratic equation in x to zero:(-4 - 6lambda)^2 - 4(1+lambda)(6y) = 016 + 48lambda + 36lambda^2 - 24y - 24lambda y = 0Since this equation should hold for all y, we equate the coefficients of y and y^0 to zero:begin{cases}-24 - 24lambda = 0 16 + 48lambda + 36lambda^2 = 0end{cases}Solving for lambda, we get lambda = -1.

It is important to carefully examine the problem to avoid making substitution errors. Since the given function is a piecewise function, we only need to determine the range in which 2+log_{2}3 falls and substitute it into the corresponding expression.SolutionFirst, we simplify 2+log_{2}3 using the properties of logarithms:2+log_{2}3=log_{2}4+log_{2}3=log_{2}(4times3)=log_{2}12Since 12 is between 8 and 16, log_{2}12 is between 3 and 4, i.e., 2+log_{2}3in(3,4).According to the definition of the piecewise function, when xin(3,4), we have f(x)=f(x+1). Therefore,f(2+log_{2}3)=f(2+log_{2}3+1)=f(3+log_{2}3)Now, we use the property of logarithms to simplify 3+log_{2}3:3+log_{2}3=log_{2}8+log_{2}3=log_{2}(8times3)=log_{2}24Substituting this into the function, we obtain:f(3+log_{2}3)=(frac{1}{2})^{3+log_{2}3}=(frac{1}{2})^{3}(frac{1}{2})^{log_{2}3}=frac{1}{8}timesfrac{1}{3}=boxed{frac{1}{24}}"},{"problem":"Given that the asymptotic lines of a hyperbola with foci on the x-axis are y = pm sqrt{3}x, what is the eccentricity of the hyperbola?A: frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}B: 2C: frac{4}{3}D: 4","solution":"Let the equation of the hyperbola with foci on the x-axis be:frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1  (a > 0, b > 0)Given that the asymptotic lines of the hyperbola are y = pm sqrt{3}x,we have:frac{b}{a} = sqrt{3}Thus,frac{b^2}{a^2} = 3frac{b^2 + a^2}{a^2} = 4Recall that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 and e = frac{c}{a},we have:e^2 = 4e = 2Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is 2.Hence, the answer is boxed{B}.To find the eccentricity of the hyperbola, we first set up its equation and then use the given asymptotic lines to find the relationship between a and b.

Find all pairs of natural numbers a, b for which the set equality holds{a cdot[a, b], b cdot(a, b)}={45,180}where (x, y) and [x, y] denote the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of numbers x and y, respectively.","solution":"1. From the given equality, it follows that the number b is odd (otherwise both numbers on the left would be even), and thus the number a is even (otherwise both numbers on the left would be odd). The equality of sets must therefore be satisfied as follows:a cdot[a, b]=180 quad text { and } quad b cdot(a, b)=45 .Since the number a divides the number [a, b], the number 180=2^{2} cdot 3^{2} cdot 5 must be divisible by the square of (even) number a, so it must be either a=2 or a=6. In the case of a=2 (considering that b is odd), we havea cdot[a, b]=2 cdot[2, b]=2 cdot 2 b=4 bwhich means that the first equality in (1) is satisfied only for b=45. Then b cdot(a, b)=45 cdot(2,45)=45, so the second equality in (1) is also satisfied, and thus the pair a=2, b=45 is a solution to the problem.In the case of a=6, similarly, we geta cdot[a, b]=6 cdot[6, b]=6 cdot 2 cdot[3, b]=12 cdot[3, b],which means that the first equality in (1) is satisfied precisely when [3, b]=15. This is satisfied only by the values b=5 and b=15. However, only the value b=15 satisfies the second equality in (1), which is now in the form b cdot(6, b)=45. The second solution to the problem is thus the pair a=6, b=15, and no other solutions exist.Answer: The sought pairs are two, namely a=2, b=45 and a=6, b=15.Another solution. Let d=(a, b). Then a=u d and b=v d, where u, v are coprime natural numbers, so [a, b]=u v d. From the equalitiesa cdot[a, b]=u d cdot u v d=u^{2} v d^{2} quad text { and } quad b cdot(a, b)=v d cdot d=v d^{2}we see that the number a cdot[a, b] is a u^{2}-multiple of the number b cdot(a, b), so the given set equality can only be satisfied as we wrote the relations (1) in the original solution. These can now be expressed by the equalitiesu^{2} v d^{2}=180 quad text { and } quad v d^{2}=45 text {. }Therefore, u^{2}=frac{180}{45}=4 or u=2. From the equality v d^{2}=45=3^{2} cdot 5 it follows that either d=1 (and v=45) or d=3 (and v=5). In the first case, a=u d=2 cdot 1=2 and b=v d=45 cdot 1=45, in the second case, a=u d=2 cdot 3=6 and b=v d=5 cdot 3=15.Note. Since the given equality immediately implies that both numbers a, b are divisors of the number 180 (even their least common multiple [a, b] is such a divisor), it is possible to provide a complete solution by various other methods based on testing a finite number of specific pairs of numbers a and b. We can speed up this process by first determining some necessary conditions that the numbers a, b must satisfy. For example, the refinement of the set equality to a pair of equalities (1) can be (even without using the argument about the parity of the numbers a, b) explained by the general observation: the product a cdot[a, b] is divisible by the product b cdot(a, b), because their quotient can be written in the formfrac{a cdot[a, b]}{b cdot(a, b)}=frac{a}{(a, b)} cdot frac{[a, b]}{b}i.e., as a product of two integers.For a complete solution, award 6 points. If the justification of the equalities (1) is missing in an otherwise complete solution (arguments (a, b)<[a, b] or (a, b) mid[a, b] alone are insufficient), deduct 1 point.

From this equation, the coordinates x_{1} and y_{1} of the points of intersection with the axes O x and O y are obtained, specifically, x_{1}=2 x_{0} and y_{1}=2 y_{0}.

Among the following events, the one with the highest probability of occurring is:A: Both numbers are evenB: The sum of the numbers is oddC: The sum of the numbers is less than 13D: The sum of the numbers is less than 2","solution":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the total number of outcomes when a fair dice is rolled twice. Since a dice has 6 faces, rolling it twice would give us a total of 6 times 6 = 36 possible outcomes. This will be our denominator for calculating probabilities.For Event A (Both numbers are even):The even numbers on a dice are 2, 4, and 6. When considering both rolls to be even, we can pair each even number with every other even number, including itself. This gives us the pairs (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4), (2,6), (6,2), (6,4), (4,6), and (6,6). Counting these, we find there are 9 such events. Thus, the probability of event A happening is P(A) = dfrac{9}{36} = dfrac{1}{4}.For Event B (The sum of the numbers is odd):An odd sum occurs when we pair an even number with an odd number. The odd numbers on a dice are 1, 3, and 5. Pairing each odd number with each even number (and vice versa), we get the pairs (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (4,1), (4,3), (4,5), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (6,1), (6,3), and (6,5). Counting these, we find there are 18 such events. Thus, the probability of event B happening is P(B) = dfrac{18}{36} = dfrac{1}{2}.For Event C (The sum of the numbers is less than 13):Given that the highest number on a dice is 6, the maximum sum we can get from rolling the dice twice is 6 + 6 = 12. This means that all possible outcomes will result in a sum less than 13. Therefore, the probability of event C happening is P(C) = dfrac{36}{36} = 1.For Event D (The sum of the numbers is less than 2):The minimum sum we can get from rolling the dice twice is 1 + 1 = 2. There are no outcomes where the sum is less than 2, making this an impossible event. Therefore, the probability of event D happening is P(D) = dfrac{0}{36} = 0.Comparing the probabilities of the four events, we find that the event with the highest probability is the sum being less than 13, which has a probability of 1.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given the set A = {x mid x = 2k + 1, k in mathbb{Z} } and B = {x mid 0 < x < 5 }, find A cap B.","solution":"This problem tests our understanding of intersections and their operations.

For this, we introduce the concept of a cycle. Suppose in the permutation, the number at the b_{1}-th position is b_{2}, the number at the b_{2}-th position is b_{3}, cdots, the number at the b_{k-1}-th position is b_{k}, and the number at the b_{k}-th position is b_{1}, then b_{1} rightarrow b_{2} rightarrow cdots rightarrow b_{k} rightarrow b_{1} is called a cycle. In particular, if the number at the b_{1}-th position is b_{1}, then b_{1} rightarrow b_{1} is also a cycle. Thus, each permutation can be decomposed into several non-intersecting cycles. Let the number of cycles in the permutation a=left(a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}right) be denoted as f(a).

Define the Lagrangian:   [   mathcal{L}(x, y, z, lambda) = frac{1}{4} x^2 + 2y^2 + 16z^2 + lambda left( frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} + frac{z}{c} - 1 right)   ]5. Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero, we get:   [   frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial x} = frac{1}{2} x + lambda frac{1}{a} = 0 implies lambda = -frac{1}{2} ax   ]   [   frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial y} = 4y + lambda frac{1}{b} = 0 implies lambda = -4by   ]   [   frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial z} = 32z + lambda frac{1}{c} = 0 implies lambda = -32cz   ]6. Equating the expressions for (lambda), we get:   [   -frac{1}{2} ax = -4by implies ax = 8by   ]   [   -4by = -32cz implies by = 8cz   ]7. Solving these, we find:   [   x = frac{8by}{a}, quad y = frac{8cz}{b}   ]8. Substituting (a = 2b) and (b = 2c) into (a + b + c = 1), we get:   [   a = frac{4}{7}, quad b = frac{2}{7}, quad c = frac{1}{7}   ]9. Using these values, we find:   [   x = frac{16}{49}, quad y = frac{4}{49}, quad z = frac{1}{49}   ]10. Substituting (x), (y), and (z) into (f(x, y, z)), we get:    [    fleft(frac{16}{49}, frac{4}{49}, frac{1}{49}right) = frac{1}{4} left(frac{16}{49}right)^2 + 2 left(frac{4}{49}right)^2 + 16 left(frac{1}{49}right)^2    ]    [    = frac{1}{4} cdot frac{256}{2401} + 2 cdot frac{16}{2401} + 16 cdot frac{1}{2401}    ]    [    = frac{256}{9604} + frac{32}{2401} + frac{16}{2401}    ]    [    = frac{256}{9604} + frac{48}{2401}    ]    [    = frac{256}{9604} + frac{192}{9604}    ]    [    = frac{448}{9604} = frac{1}{21.5}    ]11. Therefore, the maximum possible integer value of (left(frac{1}{4} x^2 + 2y^2 + 16z^2right)^{-1}) is:    [    leftlfloor frac{1}{frac{1}{21.5}} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 21.5 rightrfloor = 21    ]The final answer is (boxed{21})."},{"problem":"29.52.

Find all Fib-unique.","solution":" Part (a)We need to prove that every positive integer can be represented as a sum of several distinct Fibonacci numbers. We will use strong induction to prove this statement.1. Base Case:    - For ( k = 1 ), the statement is trivially true because ( 1 ) is a Fibonacci number itself.2. Inductive Step:   - Assume that for all ( k leq j ), the statement is true. We need to show that it holds for ( k = j + 1 ).   - If ( j + 1 ) is a Fibonacci number, then we are done because it can be represented as itself.   - If ( j + 1 ) is not a Fibonacci number, then there exist Fibonacci numbers ( f_n ) and ( f_{n+1} ) such that ( f_n < j + 1 < f_{n+1} ).   - Consider ( j + 1 - f_n ). Since ( f_n < j + 1 ), we have ( j + 1 - f_n < j ). By the inductive hypothesis, ( j + 1 - f_n ) can be written as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers:     [     j + 1 - f_n = f_{alpha_1} + f_{alpha_2} + ldots + f_{alpha_i}     ]     where ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_i geq 1 ) and they are distinct.   - Also, all the terms ( f_{alpha_i} neq f_n ) since ( j + 1 - f_n < f_{n+1} - f_n = f_{n-1} < f_n ).   - Therefore, we can write:     [     j + 1 = f_n + f_{alpha_1} + f_{alpha_2} + ldots + f_{alpha_i}     ]     which completes our inductive step.Thus, by induction, every positive integer can be represented as a sum of several distinct Fibonacci numbers. Part (b)We need to find all positive integers that are *Fib-unique*, meaning they can be represented as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers in a unique way.1. Fibonacci Numbers:   - If ( n ) is a Fibonacci number and ( n neq 1 ), then it can be represented as itself and also as a sum of other Fibonacci numbers. For example, ( 13 = 13 ) and ( 13 = 8 + 5 ). Hence, Fibonacci numbers (except 1) are not Fib-unique.2. Non-Fibonacci Numbers:   - Consider the set of positive integers that are not Fibonacci numbers. Let ( n_1, n_2, ldots ) be the elements of this set, and let ( n_1 = 4 ).   - We show that these numbers can be written uniquely as the sum of distinct and non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.   - Base Case: For ( n = 4 ), it can only be written as ( 1 + 3 ).   - Inductive Step: Assume that for all ( n_i leq n_k ), the statement holds where ( i leq k ). Consider ( n_{k+1} ).     - By the Zeckendorf's theorem, every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of distinct, non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. This implies that non-Fibonacci numbers have a unique representation in this form.Thus, the Fib-unique numbers are all positive integers that are not Fibonacci numbers, except for ( n = 1 ).The final answer is all positive integers that are not Fibonacci numbers, except for ( boxed{ n = 1 } )."},{"problem":"Find the fourth term of the arithmetic sequence log_{3}(2x), log_{3}(3x), log_{3}(4x+2), ldots.Options:A: 3B: 4C: log_{3}18D: log_{3}24","solution":"Since it is given that log_{3}(2x), log_{3}(3x), log_{3}(4x+2), ldots form an arithmetic sequence, we can use the property of an arithmetic sequence where the sum of the first and third terms is equal to twice the second term.

Different drawings differ by at least one cell in the table, either plus or minus. The symbol in a given specific cell is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the number of swaps performed in each 2 times 2 square containing that cell. Each 2 times 2 square contains exactly one corner cell of the table, and each such square has its own unique corner cell. The parity of the number of swaps in each square corresponds to the symbol in its unique corner cell (if there is a cross in the corner cell, the number of swaps was odd; if there is a circle, the number of swaps was even). Therefore, each combination of symbols in the table uniquely corresponds to a combination of circles and crosses in the corner cells of the table. Since the number of different combinations in four cells is 2^{4}=16, there are 16 drawings in total.Second method. One can create a transition table and show that when swaps are performed multiple times, cycles arise, and some drawings transition into others. The images below show all possible ways to place crosses and circles, and the number of corresponding drawings in one group.

Thus, the midpoint of AB is left(-frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2}+bright).Since this midpoint lies on the line x+y=0, we have -frac{1}{2} + left(-frac{1}{2} + bright) = 0, hence b=1.

Let his father have a_{1} sons, his grandfather a_{2}, and so on up to the founder of the lineage, who had a_{n}.

If we replace three twos with two threes, the sum of the numbers remains the same, but the product becomes 9, which is again an increase.

And we know that operatorname{gcd}(2p, 2q)=2, so d must be a divisor of 2.Since every prime factor of |p-q| or p+q must, due to the given equation, also be a prime factor of the other, we now know that |p-q| and p+q are both powers of 2 (not equal to 1). But the greatest common divisor is 2, so the smaller of the two powers of two (and that must be |p-q|) is equal to 2. Thus, |p-q|=2 and p+q is a power of 2. Therefore, there is exactly one number between p and q, namely frac{p+q}{2}. Since p+q is a power of 2, p+q is not divisible by 3. So frac{p+q}{2} is also not divisible by 3.

What is the minimum number of socks to be taken out to be sure of having taken out at least one pair of identical socks? Note that the drawer is so messy that it is not possible to search inside. Proof: It is a matter of finding a minimum, so we need to show both that the proposed number is a solution and that any smaller number is not a solution.By the pigeonhole principle, if 2020 socks are taken out, then we are sure to have taken out two identical socks. On the other hand, it is possible to take out 2019 distinct socks: the number sought is 2020.## Notation.We denote lceil xrceil the unique integer satisfying x leqslantlceil xrceil<x+1. Thus, lceil 3rceil=3,lceil 1.7rceil=2,lceilpirceil=4 and lceil-2.7rceil=-2.Proposition 3 (Precise Pigeonhole Principle).Given n drawers and l socks placed in these drawers, there exists at least one drawer containing at least leftlceilfrac{k}{n}rightrceil socks.## Example 4.Paris has two million inhabitants. A human being has, at most, 600,000 hairs on their head. What is the largest number of Parisians that can be found who have exactly the same number of hairs on their head?Proof: Here, the drawers are the numbers of hairs and the socks are the Parisians. We then have 2,000,000 socks for 600,001 drawers (don't forget the bald Parisians, at the risk of having trouble with the SPPC, the Society for the Protection of Bald Parisians): the pigeonhole principle ensures that it is possible to find leftlceilfrac{2000000}{600001}rightrceil=4 Parisians who have exactly the same number of hairs.Proposition 5 (Infinite Pigeonhole Principle).Given n drawers and an infinite number of socks, there exists at least one drawer containing an infinite number of socks.## Example 6.Show that there are infinitely many numbers composed only of 0 and 1 in decimal notation that are divisible by 2019.Proof: Consider the set of integers consisting only of the digit 1 in decimal notation: {1,11,111,1111, ldots}. By the pigeonhole principle, since the set of possible remainders by Euclidean division by 2019 is finite, there exists an integer 0 leq r<2019 such that there are infinitely many integers written only with 1s such that the remainder in the Euclidean division by 2019 is r. But then the difference between two of these numbers will be composed entirely of 0s and 1s in decimal notation and will be divisible by 2019. Moreover, the consideration of the number of digits ensures that we have an infinite number of such integers. We could have also simply multiplied such a number by a power of 10 to have an infinite number.Now, we need to learn to recognize the drawers and the socks..."},{"problem":"Given that the line y=ax+a is tangent to the curve y=ln x+b, the minimum value of 5a-b is ______.","solution":"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the conditions for the line y=ax+a to be tangent to the curve y=ln x+b at some point (x_{0}, ln x_{0}+b), where x_{0} > 0.

In other words, it is necessary that for all 1 leq i leq n+1 the two numbers n+2-i and i admit the same number of factors 2 in their prime decomposition.We want to show that n+2 is a power of 2.

It must then be that 2^{l} divides n+2-2^{l}, and since n+2-2^{l} leq 2^{l}, this is only the case if n+2=2^{l+1}.It remains to prove that all numbers of the form n=2^{k}-2 are indeed solutions. For this, it suffices to prove that binom{n}{i} equiv i+1(bmod 2) for all 0 leq i leq n. Indeed, if this is the case, we then havebinom{n}{i}+binom{n}{j} equiv i+j+2 equiv i+j quad(bmod 2)We will prove this property by induction on i. For i=0 and i=1, we clearly have binom{n}{i} equiv i+1(bmod 2). Suppose now that the property has already been proven up to i-1. If i is odd, we multiply the previous number by frac{n+1-i}{i}, and since the numerator is even while the denominator is odd, we indeed have that binom{n}{i} is even. If i is even, we multiply binom{n}{i-2} by frac{n+1-i}{i-1} cdot frac{n+2-i}{i}. The first fraction is a quotient of two odd numbers, and since n+2=2^{k}, the second fraction can also be written as a quotient of two odd numbers, so since binom{n}{i-2} is odd, binom{n}{i} is also odd.Another solution: Look at the Sierpinski triangle and notice with equations like above that you need a series of the form (1,0,1,0,1, ldots, 1,0,1).

Let's proceed step-by-step.1. Identify the Midpoints and Arcs:   - ( M_a ), ( M_b ), and ( M_c ) are the midpoints of sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) respectively.   - ( T_a ), ( T_b ), and ( T_c ) are the midpoints of the arcs ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) of the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) that do not contain the vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) respectively.2. Define the Circles:   - Let ( w_a ), ( w_b ), and ( w_c ) be the circles with diameters ( M_aT_a ), ( M_bT_b ), and ( M_cT_c ) respectively.3. Common External Tangents:   - Let ( p_a ) be the common external tangent to ( w_b ) and ( w_c ) such that ( w_a ) lies on the opposite side of ( p_a ) than ( w_b ) and ( w_c ).   - Similarly, define ( p_b ) and ( p_c ).4. Properties of the Midpoints and Arcs:   - Since ( M_a ) is the midpoint of ( BC ) and ( T_a ) is the midpoint of the arc ( BC ) not containing ( A ), the line ( M_aT_a ) is perpendicular to ( BC ) and passes through the circumcenter ( O ) of ( triangle ABC ).5. Diameters and Radii:   - The length of the diameter ( M_aT_a ) is equal to the distance between ( M_a ) and ( T_a ).   - The radius of ( w_a ) is half of this distance, i.e., ( frac{M_aT_a}{2} ).6. Tangents and Similarity:   - The tangents ( p_a ), ( p_b ), and ( p_c ) are determined by the external tangents to the circles ( w_b ) and ( w_c ), ( w_c ) and ( w_a ), and ( w_a ) and ( w_b ) respectively.   - These tangents form a triangle that is similar to ( triangle ABC ) because the configuration of the circles ( w_a ), ( w_b ), and ( w_c ) is symmetric with respect to the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ).7. Ratio of Similitude:   - The ratio of similitude is determined by the ratio of the distances between the midpoints of the sides of ( triangle ABC ) and the midpoints of the arcs.   - Since the circles ( w_a ), ( w_b ), and ( w_c ) are defined by the midpoints and the arc midpoints, the ratio of similitude is ( frac{1}{2} ).Therefore, the lines ( p_a ), ( p_b ), and ( p_c ) form a triangle similar to ( triangle ABC ) with a ratio of similitude of ( frac{1}{2} ).The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{2}})."},{"problem":"Which of the following functions is both an even function and has a zero point?A: y=2^x-2B: y=x^3C: y=lnxD: y=x^2-1","solution":"To determine which of the given functions is both an even function and has a zero point, we analyze each option step by step:- Option A: y=2^x-2  To check if it's an even function, we replace x with -x and see if the function remains unchanged:  y(−x) = 2^{−x} − 2  This is not equal to y(x) = 2^x - 2, so it is not an even function.

Define Variables and Rewrite the Inequality:   Let ( n = 2005 ), ( A = sum_{i=1}^n a_i ), and ( B = sum_{i=1}^n b_i ). The given inequality is:   [   (a_i x - b_i)^2 ge sum_{j neq i} (a_j x - b_j)   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   (a_i x - b_i)^2 ge sum_{j neq i} (a_j x - b_j)   ]   Expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   a_i^2 x^2 - 2a_i b_i x + b_i^2 ge (A - a_i)x - (B - b_i)   ]   Rearranging terms, we obtain:   [   a_i^2 x^2 - (2a_i b_i + A - a_i)x + (b_i^2 + B - b_i) ge 0 quad forall x in mathbb{R}   ]2. Case When ( a_i = 0 ):   If ( a_i = 0 ) for some ( i ), the inequality becomes:   [   b_i^2 ge sum_{j neq i} b_j   ]   This implies:   [   b_i^2 ge B - b_i   ]   Solving for ( b_i ), we get:   [   b_i^2 + b_i - B ge 0   ]   This quadratic inequality holds if ( b_i ) is sufficiently large. However, if ( a_i = 0 ), then ( A = 0 ) must hold, and ( b_i ) must be large enough to satisfy the inequality.3. Case When ( a_i neq 0 ):   If ( a_i neq 0 ), the inequality is a quadratic in ( x ) with leading coefficient ( a_i^2 > 0 ). For the quadratic to be non-negative for all ( x ), its discriminant must be non-positive:   [   (2a_i b_i + A - a_i)^2 le 4a_i^2 (b_i^2 + B - b_i)   ]   Expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   4a_i^2 b_i^2 + 4a_i b_i (A - a_i) + (A - a_i)^2 le 4a_i^2 b_i^2 - 4a_i^2 b_i + 4a_i^2 B   ]   Simplifying further, we obtain:   [   4a_i A b_i le 4a_i^2 B - (A - a_i)^2   ]4. Summing Up the Inequalities:   If all ( a_i ) are positive, we can divide by ( 4a_i A ) and sum over all ( i ):   [   b_i le frac{a_i}{A} B - frac{(A - a_i)^2}{4a_i A}   ]   Summing these inequalities for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ), we get:   [   B le B - sum_{i=1}^n frac{(A - a_i)^2}{4a_i A}   ]   This implies:   [   sum_{i=1}^n frac{(A - a_i)^2}{4a_i A} le 0   ]   Since the sum of non-negative terms is zero, each term must be zero, implying ( A = a_i ) for all ( i ). This leads to a contradiction unless ( a_i = 0 ) for all ( i ).5. Conclusion:   Therefore, we can have at most one ( a_i ) that is non-positive, and the rest can be positive. This means we can have at most ( 2n - 1 = 4009 ) positive numbers among ( a_i ) and ( b_i ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 4009 } )."},{"problem":"10.

The numbers in the rows below are the sums of the two numbers above them (because the multiplicity of the factor 2 in the product is the sum of the multiplicities of the factor 2 in each multiplier).In this way, we have marked the multiplicities of the prime factors 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of each number in the circles in the two diagrams. Specifically, the multiplicity of 2 in the prime factorization of the number at the bottom is 10, and the multiplicity of 5 is 15, so it should have 10 trailing zeros.Answer: It can have 10 consecutive zeros."},{"problem":"2.

By symmetry and the properties of the fifth roots of unity, the quadrilateral formed by (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) is an isosceles trapezium. This is because the opposite sides are equal in length, and the angles between adjacent sides are equal, but not all sides are equal in length (which would be required for a square or rhombus).Conclusion:The quadrilateral (ABCD) formed by the vertices (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) is an isosceles trapezium.The final answer is ( boxed{ text{Isosceles Trapezium} } )"},{"problem":"8.

Using the binomial coefficient C_n^k to represent the number of ways of choosing k successes (heads) from n trials, and (frac{1}{2})^n representing the probability of any specific sequence of heads and tails occurring (since we have a fair coin), we can compute the probabilities as follows:The probability of getting heads 4 times and tails 2 times is:boxed{C_{6}^{4} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{4}left(frac{1}{2}right)^{2}}The probability of getting heads 5 times and tails 1 time is:boxed{C_{6}^{5} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{5}left(frac{1}{2}right)^{1}}The probability of getting heads 6 times and tails 0 times is:boxed{left(frac{1}{2}right)^{6}}Now we sum these probabilities to find the total probability:[begin{aligned}& C_{6}^{4} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{6} + C_{6}^{5} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{6} + left(frac{1}{2}right)^{6} &= 15 left(frac{1}{2}right)^{6} + 6 left(frac{1}{2}right)^{6} + 1 left(frac{1}{2}right)^{6} &= frac{15}{64} + frac{6}{64} + frac{1}{64} &= boxed{frac{22}{64}} &= boxed{frac{11}{32}}end{aligned}]So the probability that heads appears more often than tails when a fair coin is tossed 6 times is boxed{frac{11}{32}}."},{"problem":"Simplify first, then evaluate: [left(x-yright)left(x+2yright)-left(x+yright)^{2}]div y, where left(x-2right)^{2}+|1+y|=0.","solution":"To simplify and evaluate the given expression [left(x-yright)left(x+2yright)-left(x+yright)^{2}]div y with the condition left(x-2right)^{2}+|1+y|=0, we proceed as follows:First, we simplify the expression inside the brackets:begin{align*}[left(x-yright)left(x+2yright)-left(x+yright)^{2}] &= (x^2 + 2xy - xy - 2y^2) - (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) &= x^2 + xy - 2y^2 - x^2 - 2xy - y^2 &= -3y^2 - xy.end{align*}Next, we divide the simplified expression by y:begin{align*}(-3y^2 - xy) div y &= (-3y^2 div y) - (xy div y) &= -3y - x.end{align*}Given the condition left(x-2right)^{2}+|1+y|=0, we can deduce that:- left(x-2right)^{2} = 0 implies x-2 = 0, so x = 2.- |1+y| = 0 implies 1+y = 0, so y = -1.Substituting x = 2 and y = -1 into the simplified expression -3y - x, we get:begin{align*}-3(-1) - 2 &= 3 - 2 &= 1.end{align*}Therefore, the simplified and evaluated expression is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"12cdot102 Find all integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation 3 cdot 2^{x}+1=y^{2}.(41st Moscow Mathematical Olympiad, 1978)","solution":"［Solution］When x=0,y^{2}=4, quad y= pm 2 .If (x, y) is a solution to the given equation, then (x,-y) is also a solution.

For ( n ) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square.

But this in turn means that the point Q has the same power with respect to the two circles we started with, and hence lies on the radical axis of those two circles, that is, the line B C (the radical axis is the locus of points of equal power with respect to two given circles). So Q is the intersection of A C and both S_{1} T_{1} and S_{2} T_{2}, which proves that the intersection point defined in the problem is the same for both circles.Since the location of P is independent of the circle through B and C we can, without loss of generality, choose the circle with B C as diameter.

Since each tri-domino has three faces, and the 3 times 3 square has nine, if it were possible to construct such a square using tri-dominos, the number of tri-dominos used would be exactly three. Below we will show that it is impossible to do so!If we wanted to construct a 3 times 3 square by joining tri-domino pieces, then one of the three square faces of the tri-domino would have to occupy the position numbered 5 in the square drawn in the figure above. We thus have the following cases:First case: The face positioned over the number 5 is a central face of a tri-domino.In this case, we have four possibilities for the position of the tri-domino:- It occupies the positions 4,5,8;- It occupies the positions 2,5,4;- It occupies the positions 2,5,6;- It occupies the positions 6,5,8.Let's now exclude the first of these possibilities. If it were true that the three square faces of a tri-domino occupied the positions 4,5,8, then the only way to position a second tri-domino over the remaining part of the 3 times 3 square would be to place it over the faces 2,3,6 of this square. In this case, the faces of the 3 times 3 square numbered 1, 7, and 9 would remain uncovered. However, it is impossible to position the third tri-domino over these three faces!This excludes the first of the listed possibilities. The other three possibilities presented can be excluded in a similar manner.Second case: The face positioned over the number 5 is not a central face of a tri-domino.In this case, we have the following possibilities for the position of the tri-domino:- It occupies the positions 5,2,1;- It occupies the positions 5,2,3;- It occupies the positions 5,6,3;- It occupies the positions 5,6,9;- It occupies the positions 5,8,9;- It occupies the positions 5,8,7;- It occupies the positions 5,4,7;- It occupies the positions 5,4,1.Let's now exclude the first of these possibilities. If it were true that the three square faces of a tri-domino occupied the positions 5,2,1, then we would have two possibilities for the positioning of a second tri-domino:i) A second tri-domino would be positioned over the positions 4,7,8.In this case, the faces of the 3 times 3 square numbered 3, 6, and 9 would remain uncovered. However, it is impossible to position the third tri-domino over these three faces.ii) A second tri-domino would be positioned over the positions 8,9,6.In this case, the faces of the 3 times 3 square numbered 3, 4, and 7 would remain uncovered. However, it is impossible to position the third tri-domino over these three faces.Thus, the cases i) and ii) listed above are excluded, and as a consequence, the possibility that a tri-domino be positioned over the positions 5,2,1. The other seven listed possibilities can be excluded in a similar manner.We conclude that it is impossible to form a 3 times 3 square by joining tri-domino pieces.b) A 4 times 4 square can be divided into 16 1 times 1 square faces as shown in the figure below:| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 || 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 || 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |Here we are assuming that each of the numbered square faces from 1 to 16 has the same area as each of the three square faces used to construct the tri-domino. Since each tri-domino has three faces, if it were possible to construct such a square using tri-dominos, the total number of faces in this square should be a multiple of the number 3. Since 16 is not a multiple of 3, it is impossible to join tri-dominos to form the square.c) We have already seen in items a) and b) that it is impossible to join tri-dominos to form 3 times 3 and 4 times 4 squares, respectively.We use an argument analogous to that in item b) to show that it is also impossible to form a 5 times 5 square. Indeed, this is a consequence of the fact that such a square would have a total of 25 1 times 1 square faces, and 25 is not a multiple of 3 (see the solution to item b)).However, we will show that it is possible to form a 6 times 6 square. Indeed, as stated in the problem, it is possible to join two tri-dominos to form a 2 times 3 rectangle as illustrated below:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_cc59d970f26105cc4ca1g-29.jpg?height=191&width=266&top_left_y=236&top_left_x=998)We can repeat this procedure five more times to form a total of six such 2 times 3 rectangles.

This is true because the distance between two parallel lines is constant along their lengths, and any segment perpendicular to one of the lines and ending on the other will have the same length. Therefore, B is correctly identified as correct in the solution.- Statement C: It describes the distance from a point outside a line to the line as the point's distance to the line.

Conservation of Momentum:   The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. For the given problem, we have:   [   mv_0 = mv_0' + Mv_1   ]   where (v_0) is the initial velocity of the particle with mass (m), (v_0') is the final velocity of the particle with mass (m), and (v_1) is the final velocity of the particle with mass (M).2.

First of all, note that 20 and 19 are relatively prime. This means that the line does not intersect any vertex of a unit square in the interior of the grid.Now, consider the diagonal from (0,0) to (20,19).

Redefine the sequence ( U_n ) based on the given conditions:   [   U_n = begin{cases}    ar^{n-1} & text{if } n = 4m - 3 text{ or } n = 4m - 2,    -ar^{n-1} & text{if } n = 4m - 1 text{ or } n = 4m    end{cases}   ]   where ( m ) is a positive integer.2. Group the terms in sets of four:   Notice that every four terms form a pattern:   [   (ar^{4m-4}, ar^{4m-3}, -ar^{4m-2}, -ar^{4m-1})   ]   For example, the first four terms are:   [   (a, ar, -ar^2, -ar^3)   ]   The next four terms are:   [   (ar^4, ar^5, -ar^6, -ar^7)   ]   And so on.3. Sum the terms within each group of four:   The sum of each group of four terms is:   [   ar^{4m-4} + ar^{4m-3} - ar^{4m-2} - ar^{4m-1}   ]   Factor out the common term ( ar^{4m-4} ):   [   ar^{4m-4}(1 + r - r^2 - r^3)   ]4. Sum the series up to the 2008th term:   Since 2009 is not a multiple of 4, we need to handle the last term separately. The sum of the first 2008 terms can be written as:   [   S = sum_{m=1}^{502} ar^{4m-4}(1 + r - r^2 - r^3)   ]   This is a geometric series with the common ratio ( r^4 ):   [   S = (1 + r - r^2 - r^3) sum_{m=0}^{501} ar^{4m}   ]   The sum of the geometric series is:   [   sum_{m=0}^{501} ar^{4m} = a frac{1 - (r^4)^{502}}{1 - r^4}   ]   Therefore:   [   S = a(1 + r - r^2 - r^3) frac{1 - r^{2008}}{1 - r^4}   ]5. Add the 2009th term:   The 2009th term is ( ar^{2008} ). So, the total sum ( S_{total} ) is:   [   S_{total} = a(1 + r - r^2 - r^3) frac{1 - r^{2008}}{1 - r^4} + ar^{2008}   ]6. Simplify the expression:   Combine the terms:   [   S_{total} = a left( frac{(1 + r - r^2 - r^3)(1 - r^{2008})}{1 - r^4} + r^{2008} right)   ]   Simplify the numerator:   [   (1 + r - r^2 - r^3)(1 - r^{2008}) = 1 + r - r^2 - r^3 - r^{2008} - r^{2009} + r^{2010} + r^{2011}   ]   Therefore:   [   S_{total} = a left( frac{1 + r - r^2 - r^3 - r^{2008} - r^{2009} + r^{2010} + r^{2011}}{1 - r^4} + r^{2008} right)   ]   Combine the terms:   [   S_{total} = a left( frac{1 + r - r^{2009} + r^{2010}}{1 + r^2} right)   ]Thus, the sum of the first 2009 terms is:[boxed{frac{a(1 + r - r^{2009} + r^{2010})}{1 + r^2}}]"},{"problem":"Example 10 Let 1995 x^{3}=1996 y^{3}=1997 z^{3},begin{array}{l}x y z>0, text { and } sqrt[3]{1995 x^{2}+1996 y^{2}+1997 z^{2}} =sqrt[3]{1995}+sqrt[3]{1996}+sqrt[3]{1997} . quad text { Then } frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}+frac{1}{z}=end{array}Then frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}+frac{1}{z}=","solution":"Solution: Let 1995 x^{3}=1996 y^{3}=1997 z^{3}=k, obviously k neq 0.

There are 8 elements in total - 8 cards. These elements are represented in Fig. 3, marked with numbers from one to eight. Elements 1-4 are kings, represented by the symbols otimes, and elements 5-8 are aces, represented by the symbols O. In forming different combinations, all 8 elements participate, and the combinations differ from each other only in the order of the elements; therefore, these combinations represent permutations of 8 elements.

In this case, the aces (elements 5-8) can be permuted in all possible ways, occupying the remaining 4 free places. The number of these ways is P_{4}=4 !.Consider what positions the elements 1-4 can occupy if they are next to each other and arranged in a certain order. On Fig. 3, the possible positions of these elements are shown by the signs V. As can be seen from the figure, there are 5 such positions. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the four kings in a row so that they are next to each other and in a certain order is 4!.5=5!.The number of ways to permute the four kings among themselves is P_{4}=4 !.Combining each first way of arranging the cards (kings are next to each other and in a certain order) with the second (kings are next to each other but in any order), we get: m=5!4!.The sought probability of event A isP(A)=frac{m}{n}=frac{5!cdot 4!}{8!}=frac{1}{14}"},{"problem":"Given that the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is 120^circ, and the magnitudes of the vectors are |overrightarrow{a}|=1 and |overrightarrow{b}|=2, find the projection of the vector overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b} onto the direction of vector overrightarrow{b}.","solution":"This problem involves the definition of the dot product of two vectors and its application to vector projections.The projection of overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b} onto overrightarrow{b} is given by:|overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|costheta=|overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|frac{(overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b})cdotoverrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}||overrightarrow{b}|}=frac{overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b}+|overrightarrow{b}|^2}{|overrightarrow{b}|}where theta is the angle between overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{b}.Using the given information, we can calculate the dot product overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b} as follows:overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b}=|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|cos(120^circ)=1times2timescos(120^circ)=-1Substituting this value into the projection formula, we get:frac{overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b}+|overrightarrow{b}|^2}{|overrightarrow{b}|}=frac{-1+4}{2}=boxed{frac{3}{2}}"},{"problem":"# Problem 7.

First, let's express (a) and (b) in terms of (x) and (y):   [   a = sqrt{1 + x^2}, quad b = sqrt{1 + y^2}   ]3. We are given (x + y = 1). Let's introduce new variables (m) and (n) such that:   [   a + x = m, quad b + y = n   ]   This implies:   [   a = m - x, quad b = n - y   ]4. Using the given (x + y = 1), we can write:   [   a - x = frac{1}{m}, quad b - y = frac{1}{n}   ]   This implies:   [   2x = m - frac{1}{m}, quad 2y = n - frac{1}{n}   ]5. Adding these two equations, we get:   [   2(x + y) = m + n - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n}   ]   Since (x + y = 1), we have:   [   2 = m + n - frac{1}{m} - frac{1}{n}   ]6.

For which p will Vasya win regardless of Petya's actions?","solution":"Answer: n notin{1,2,4,6}.Solution. Number the glasses from left to right with numbers from 1 to n. For n=1 and n=2, a draw is obvious. If n is 4 or 6, Petya first fills the first glass with lemonade. For n=4, Petya can then fill one of the two last glasses and, thus, will not lose. For n=6, Petya fills the last glass (if it is empty) on his second move, and then one of the two middle glasses; if the last glass was filled by Vasya, Petya fills the third glass, and then the fifth. In any case, Petya will not lose.Now consider n notin{1,2,4,6}. We will prove two statements.1) If Vasya fills the glass with number 1 on his first move, he will always have a move. Let's call a segment a set of glasses standing between two consecutive glasses with lemonade. By the condition, each segment is non-empty, and any glass in the segment is either empty or contains compote. Let k geqslant 2. After Petya's k-th move, k-1 segments are formed. By this point, Vasya has filled k-1 glasses, including the first one, which does not belong to any segment. Therefore, there will be a segment where all the glasses are empty. Vasya can then fill one of them with compote.2) If Vasya fills the glass with number 1 on his first move, he cannot lose. Indeed, by 1), Vasya will always have a move and, thus, will achieve at least a draw.Let's describe Vasya's winning strategy. On his first move, Vasya always fills the edge glass (let's assume it is the first one; otherwise, we can renumber the glasses in reverse order). By 2), it is sufficient to show that Vasya can avoid a draw. Consider two cases.a) n is odd. Vasya can play arbitrarily. A draw is impossible because in this case, the last glass would have been filled by Petya, which contradicts 1).b) n=2 m n p u ~ m geqslant 4. On his second move, Vasya must fill a glass with an even number greater than 2. This is possible because there are at least three glasses with such numbers, and thus one of them is empty. Vasya can then play arbitrarily. Suppose the game ends in a draw. Then m glasses with lemonade are placed in positions 2,3, ldots, 2 m. They must be on even positions, as no two glasses stand next to each other.

In any case, each V_{i}(i geqslant 3) uses at most one new element.In total, at most 1+k different new elements are used.After a series of operations of adding new elements, let A_{1}^{prime}, A_{2}^{prime}, cdots, A_{k+2}^{prime} become A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k+2}.

Also, no more than 1+k new elements are used, so the largest element does not exceed s_{k}+1+k=s_{k+2}.Thus, the conclusion holds for n=k+2.Therefore, the conclusion holds for all positive integers n.In particular, when n leqslant 89, bys_{n} leqslant 44 times 45<2014 text {, }there exist subsets A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n} that satisfy the conditions.In summary, the maximum value of n is 89."},{"problem":"From the digits 0 to 9, select any 3 digits to form a three-digit number without repeating digits. The probability that this number is divisible by 3 is ______.","solution":"To solve this problem, we first select any 3 digits from the digits 0 to 9 to form a three-digit number without repeating digits.  The total number of basic events n = C_{9}^{1} A_{9}^{2} = 648.  Next, according to the problem, we divide the 10 digits into three groups:  Digits that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 are 1, 4, 7; digits that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 are 2, 5, 8; digits that are divisible by 3 are 3, 6, 9, 0.  To ensure the resulting three-digit number is divisible by 3,  we can discuss it in categories: permutations within each group, and selecting one from each group.  Therefore, the number of three-digit multiples of 3 are:  (A_{3}^{3} + A_{3}^{3} + A_{4}^{3} - A_{3}^{2}) + (C_{3}^{1}C_{3}^{1}C_{4}^{1}A_{3}^{3} - C_{3}^{1}C_{3}^{1}A_{2}^{2}) = 228,  ∴ The probability p that this number is divisible by 3 is p = frac{228}{648} = frac{19}{54}.

Let's break down the problem step by step.1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have ( n ) points inside a unit square.   - We need to cover the entire interior of the unit square with ( k ) rectangles such that:     - The sides of each rectangle are parallel to the sides of the unit square.     - Each point in ( S ) is not in the interior of any rectangle.     - Each point in the interior of the unit square but not in ( S ) is in the interior of at least one of the ( k ) rectangles.2. Initial Observations:   - If there is only one point in ( S ), we can cover the unit square with 2 rectangles by splitting the square vertically or horizontally, avoiding the point.   - For ( n ) points, we need to generalize this idea.3. General Strategy:   - For each point in ( S ), we can create two rectangles to cover the space around the point while avoiding the point itself.   - This suggests that for ( n ) points, we might need ( 2n ) rectangles.4. Detailed Calculation:   - Consider a point ( P_i ) in ( S ) with coordinates ((x_i, y_i)).   - We can create two rectangles:     - One covering the area to the left of ( P_i ) and extending vertically from the bottom to the top of the square.     - Another covering the area to the right of ( P_i ) and extending vertically from the bottom to the top of the square.   - This ensures that ( P_i ) is not in the interior of either rectangle.5. Covering the Entire Square:   - To ensure that every point in the interior of the unit square but not in ( S ) is covered, we need to extend this idea to all ( n ) points.   - For each point, we need two rectangles, one on each side of the point.6. Bounding the Number of Rectangles:   - For ( n ) points, we need ( 2n ) rectangles to cover the space around each point.   - However, we need to ensure that the entire interior of the unit square is covered without any gaps.7. Final Adjustment:   - To cover the entire interior of the unit square, we need to add two more rectangles to cover the remaining uncovered areas at the boundaries.   - Therefore, the total number of rectangles required is ( 2n + 2 ).Conclusion:The smallest positive integer ( k ) such that for any set ( S ) of ( n ) points in the interior of the unit square, there exists a set of ( k ) rectangles satisfying the given conditions is ( boxed{2n + 2} )."},{"problem":"10.

Let's break down the solution step by step.1. Constructing a ( 2m )-interesting meeting:   We partition the ( 3m ) people into three groups ( A, B, ) and ( C ) with ( m ) people in each group. Let's denote the people in group ( A ) as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_m ), in group ( B ) as ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_m ), and in group ( C ) as ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_m ).   - Each person ( B_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq m )) will shake hands with ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_i ) and all ( m ) people in group ( C ).   - Therefore, the degrees of people in group ( A ) will be ( 1, 2, ldots, m ) respectively, and the degrees of people in group ( B ) will be ( m+1, m+2, ldots, 2m ) respectively.   - This construction ensures that the ( 2m ) people in groups ( A ) and ( B ) form a ( 2m )-interesting meeting, and there are no triangles (sets of 3 people who all shake hands with each other).2. Proving that ( 2m+1 ) is the minimum value:   Suppose we have a ( 2m+1 )-interesting meeting. Consider the person with degree ( 2m+1 ), call this person ( X ).   - Since ( X ) shakes hands with ( 2m+1 ) people, there are ( m-1 ) people who do not shake hands with ( X ).   - Among the ( 2m+1 ) people who shake hands with ( X ), there must be at least ( m ) people with degrees greater than ( m ) (since the degrees range from ( 1 ) to ( 2m+1 )).   - Let ( Y ) be one of these people with degree greater than ( m ) who shakes hands with ( X ). Since ( Y ) has a degree greater than ( m ), ( Y ) must shake hands with another person ( Z ) among the ( 2m+1 ) people who also shake hands with ( X ).   - Therefore, ( X, Y, ) and ( Z ) form a triangle, as they all shake hands with each other.This proves that in any ( 2m+1 )-interesting meeting, there exists a set of 3 people who all shake hands with each other.

Integrating this, we get:     [     f(x) = C,     ]     where ( C ) is a constant.   - Case 2: ( g(x) neq 0 ) for some ( x in mathbb{R} ):     Assume there exists some ( a in mathbb{R} ) such that ( g(a) neq 0 ). Since ( g(x) ) is non-increasing, we need to consider the following sub-cases:          - Sub-case 2.1: ( g(a) > 0 ):       Since ( g(x) ) is non-increasing, ( g(x) geq g(a) > 0 ) for ( x leq a ).

For ( x geq a ), we have:       [       left( frac{1}{g(x)} right)' = -frac{g'(x)}{g(x)^2} geq 1.       ]       Integrating both sides from ( a ) to ( x ):       [       int_a^x left( frac{1}{g(t)} right)' dt geq int_a^x 1 , dt,       ]       which simplifies to:       [       frac{1}{g(x)} - frac{1}{g(a)} geq x - a.       ]       As ( x to infty ), the left-hand side tends to ( infty ), which is a contradiction because ( g(x) ) would become positive for sufficiently large positive ( x ).4. Conclusion:   Since both sub-cases lead to contradictions, the only possibility is that ( g(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ). Therefore, ( f'(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), which implies that ( f(x) ) is a constant function.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = C } ), where ( C ) is a constant."},{"problem":"3.

If the graph does not intersect the x-axis, this implies that the function has no real roots other than x = 0. To satisfy this requirement, the exponent must be negative, because for positive x, x^n is always positive for every real number n.   2. If the graph does not intersect the y-axis except at the origin, this implies that y cannot be real when x = 0. However, when x = 0, the function becomes y = 0^{m^2 - 2m - 3}. To satisfy the condition, the exponent m^2 - 2m - 3 must not be zero or positive, since 0 raised to such exponents would result in y=1 or y=0, and the graph would intersect the y-axis.   3. The graph being symmetric about the y-axis implies that the function must be even. This occurs when the exponent is an integer multiple of 2 (an even number). Since the exponent, in this case, must also be negative (as determined previously), the exponent cannot be zero or any positive even number. Otherwise, it would create an even function graph that intersects the axes.Thus, we must find a negative, even exponent for the function that also does not intersect the axes.

The inequality m^2 - 2m - 3 < 0 translates to:m in (-1, 3).Since m must be an integer (as m in mathbb{Z}), we consider only the integer values in this interval, which are m = 0, m = 1, and m = 2.The only value that would allow the function to be symmetric about the y-axis (an even function) is m = 1, because it is not an even number (and thus not contributing to symmetry).

To prove that this is the case, we first prove that the boundary of every half-disk intersects the quarter-circle with radius 2 , and then that the half-disk is internally tangent to the quarter-circle at that point. This is sufficient because it is clear from the diagram that we need not worry about covering the interior of the quarter-circle.Let O be the origin. For a given half-disk D_{y}, label the vertex on the y-axis A and the vertex on the x-axis B. Let M be the midpoint of line segment overline{A B}. Draw segment O M, and extend it until it intersects the curved boundary of D_{y}. Label the intersection point C. This construction is shown in the diagram below.We first prove that C lies on the quarter-circle, centered at the origin, with radius 2 . Since M is the midpoint of overline{A B}, and A is on the y-axis, M is horizontally halfway between B and the y-axis. Since O and B are on the x-axis (which is perpendicular to the y-axis), segments overline{O M} and overline{M B} have the same length. Since M is the midpoint of overline{A B}, and A B=2, O M=1. Since D_{y} is a half-disk with radius 1 , all points on its curved boundary are 1 away from its center, M. Then C is 2 away from the origin, and the quarter-circle consists of all points which are 2 away from the origin. Thus, C is an intersection of the half-disk D_{y} with the positive quarter-circle of radius 2 .It remains to show that the half-disk D_{y} is internally tangent to the quarter-circle. Since overline{O C} is a radius of the quarter-circle, it is perpendicular to the tangent of the quarter-circle at C. Since overline{M C} is a radius of the half-disk, it is perpendicular to the tangent of the half-disk at C. Then the tangents lines of the half-disk and the quarter-circle coincide, and the half-disk is tangent to the quarter-circle.

To determine the existence of real roots, we will assess the discriminant of the quadratic equation.For a quadratic equation of the form ax^2+bx+c=0, the discriminant is given by Delta = b^2-4ac. Real roots exist if and only if Delta geq 0.In our case, the quadratic equation is x^2+(a-1)x+1 = 0, so the discriminant is: Delta = (a-1)^2-4(1)(1)  Delta = a^2-2a+1-4  Delta = a^2-2a-3 For the proposition to be false, the discriminant must be negative, i.e., Delta < 0: a^2-2a-3 < 0 This is a quadratic inequality.

Let ( f(0) = c ) and ( g(n) = f(n) - f(0) ) for all ( n ). The functional equation can be rewritten as:[g(g(m) + n + c) + g(m) = g(3m) + g(n) + 2014]Setting ( m = 0 ) gives ( g(n + c) = g(n) + 2014 ), in particular, ( g(kc) = 2014k ) for all ( k in mathbb{Z} ). Taking ( n = -c ) gives ( g(g(m)) + g(m) = g(3m) ). Therefore, ( g(g(m) + n + c) = g(g(m)) + g(n) + 2014 ), and by replacing ( n ) with ( n - c ), we get ( g(g(m) + n) = g(g(m)) + g(n) ). Replacing ( m ) with ( c ), we obtain ( g(n + 2014) = g(n) + g(2014) ).Thus, ( g(n + 2014c) = g(n) + c cdot g(2014) ), but ( g(n + c) = g(n) + 2014 ), so ( g(n + 2014c) = g(n) + 2014^2 ). This implies that ( c cdot g(2014) = 2014^2 ). Setting ( m = n = c ) in the initial equation gives ( g(2014 + 2c) = 4 times 2014 ), so ( g(2014) = 2 times 2014 ), thus ( c = 1007 ), and ( g(n + 1007) = g(n) + 2014 ) and ( g(1007k) = 2014k ) for all integers ( k ). For example, ( g(1007g(m)) = 2014g(m) ). On the other hand, the equation ( g(g(m) + n) = g(g(m)) + g(n) ) allows us to show ( g(kg(m)) = kg(g(m)) ) for all integers ( k ), so ( g(1007g(m)) = 1007g(g(m)) ). We deduce that ( g(g(m)) = 2g(m) ), and then ( g(3m) = 3g(m) ).Now, we have ( 3^{varphi(1007)} g(n) = g(3^{varphi(1007)} n) ). And ( 3^{varphi(1007)} = 1007ell + 1 ) for some integer ( ell ), by Euler's theorem (( varphi ) denotes the Euler's totient function), so[3^{varphi(1007)} g(n) = g(1007ell n + n) = g(n) + 2014ell n = g(n) + 2 times (3^{varphi(1007)} - 1) n]Thus, ( g(n) = 2n ) for all integers ( n ).The only solution is therefore ( f(n) = 2n + 1007 ), which is easily verified to satisfy the problem statement.## 2 Arithmetic## 1 Cyclotomic PolynomialsThis course is mainly derived from the analogous course proposed during the summer olympic training organized in Montpellier in 2014 and its course notes.

Thus, for the arithmetic progression left{frac{n}{{a}_{n}}right}, we have:begin{align*}frac{n}{{a}_{n}} &= frac{1}{{a}_{1}} + n - 1 &= n + 2end{align*}Therefore, we deduce that {a}_{n}=frac{n}{n+2}.Step 3: Calculate the Product a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{n}For ngeqslant 2, we have:begin{align*}a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{n} &= frac{1}{3} cdot frac{2}{4} cdot frac{3}{5} ldots frac{n}{n+2} &= frac{2}{(n+1)(n+2)} &= 2left(frac{1}{n+1} - frac{1}{n+2}right)end{align*}Note that {a}_{1}=frac{1}{3}=frac{2}{2×3} also fits this pattern.Step 4: Sum the SeriesThe sum a_{1}+a_{1}a_{2}+ldots +a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{n} can be expressed as:begin{align*}&= 2left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} + ldots + frac{1}{n+1} - frac{1}{n+2}right) &= 2left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{n+2}right) &= 1 - frac{2}{n+2} lt 1end{align*}Step 5: Determine the Minimum Value of mGiven that a_{1}+a_{1}a_{2}+ldots +a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{n} lt 1, we have 2m-1 geqslant 1.

This solution will turn out to be the only one. If (x, y) is a solution then (-x, y) also is a solution therefore we can assume that x geq 1. We add 1 to both sides and factor: y^{3}=x^{4}+x^{2}+1=left(x^{2}+x+1right)left(x^{2}-x+1right). We show that the factors x^{2}+x+1 and x^{2}-x+1 are co-prime. Assume that a prime p divides both of them. Then p mid x^{2}+x+1-left(x^{2}-x+1right)=2 x. Since x^{2}+x+1 is always odd, p mid x. But then p does not divide x^{2}+x+1, a contradiction. Since x^{2}+x+1 and x^{2}-x+1 have no prime factors in common and their product is a cube, both of them are cubes by a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Therefore, x^{2}+x+1=a^{3} and x^{2}-x+1=b^{3} for some non-negative integers a and b.As x geq 1 the first equation implies that a>x^{frac{2}{3}}. But since clearly b<a we getx^{2}-x+1=b^{3} leq(a-1)^{3}=a^{3}-3 a^{2}+3 a-1 leq a^{3}-3 a^{2}+3 a leq a^{3}-2 a^{2}=x^{2}+x+1-2 a^{2}<x^{2}+x+1-2 x^{frac{4}{3}}when 2 a^{2} leq 3 a^{2}-3 a, i.e. a^{2} geq 3 a which holds for a geq 3. Clearly a=2 is impossible and a=1 means x=0. We got x^{2}-x+1<x^{2}+x+1-2 x^{frac{4}{3}} which means 0 leq 2 x-2 x^{frac{4}{3}}. Hence x=1, but then 3 would be a cube, a contradiction.Remark. There are many ways to guess the factorization x^{4}+x^{2}+1=left(x^{2}+x+1right)left(x^{2}-x+1right). Writing x^{4}+x+1=left(x^{2}+1right)^{2}-x^{2} we immediately obtain it. Another way to see it is to write p(x)=x^{4}+x^{2}+1 and notice that p(0)=1 cdot 1, p(1)=3 cdot 1, p(2)=7 cdot 3, so there probably is a quadratic factor q(x) for which q(0)=1, q(1)=3, q(2)=7 (clearly, there cannot be linear factors). It is easy to see then that q(x)=x^{2}+x+1 and the factorization can be completed with the long division. One more way is to write x^{4}+x^{2}+1= left(x^{2}+a x+bright)left(x^{2}+c x+dright) and compare the coefficients.It is well-known that if s and t are co-prime integers whose product is a perfect k th power, then s and t both are perfect k th powers. The proof goes like this. Let a=p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} ldots p_{h}^{alpha_{h}}, b=q_{1}^{beta_{1}} ldots q_{ell}^{beta_{ell}} and x=r_{1}^{gamma_{1}} ldots r_{m}^{gamma_{m}} be the prime factorizations of a, b and x. In the prime factorization of x^{k}, every exponent is divisible by k, so the same must hold for the factorization of s t. But s and t are co-prime, so the exponents of primes in s and t must be divisible by k. Therefore s and t are perfect k th powers."},{"problem":"A real number  to  is randomly and uniformly chosen from the  [- 3,4]  interval.

Factor the Polynomial:   Given the polynomial ( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 ), we need to determine the conditions under which all roots are real. We start by factoring the polynomial:   [   P(x) = (x+1)(x^2 + (a-1)x + 1)   ]   This factorization is valid because the constant term is 1, and the polynomial can be expressed in this form.2. Discriminant Condition:   For the quadratic ( x^2 + (a-1)x + 1 ) to have real roots, its discriminant must be non-negative.

Condition for ( a + b ) to be an integer:   [   a + b = frac{x}{p} + frac{y}{q} = frac{xq + yp}{pq}   ]   For ( a + b ) to be an integer, ( pq ) must divide ( xq + yp ).

Continuity and connectedness:   The function ( varphi ) is continuous because the arcsine function is continuous.

Image of a continuous function over a connected set:   Since ( varphi ) is continuous and ( X ) is connected, the image ( varphi(X) ) is also connected.

For the part where x geqslant 1, the function is defined as f(x) = {log_{frac{1}{3}}}x. Since the base of the logarithm (frac{1}{3}) is between 0 and 1, the logarithm function is decreasing. This means that as x increases, f(x) decreases. The logarithm of 1 in any base is 0, so {log_{frac{1}{3}}}1 = 0. For any x > 1, {log_{frac{1}{3}}}x will be negative because the function is decreasing. Therefore, for x geqslant 1, f(x) leq 0.2. For the part where x < 1, the function is defined as f(x) = 3^x. The function 3^x is always positive and increases as x increases. However, since x < 1, 3^x < 3^1 = 3.

This can be calculated using the conditional probability formula: P(B|A) = frac{P(A cap B)}{P(A)} We first find P(A), the probability that player A draws 2 black balls. Since there are 8 black balls to begin with, and player A draws 2 without replacement, the number of possible successful outcomes for A is the number of ways to choose 2 black balls from 8, which is the combination C_{8}^{2}.Next, we find P(A cap B). After player A has drawn 2 black balls, there are 6 black balls left.

If we replace m_{k+1}, m_{j} with m^{prime}{ }_{k+1}, m^{prime} j_{j}, the value of M increases, leading to a contradiction.(ii) If m_{i+1}-m_{i}=1 for all i=1,2, cdots, n-1, then sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} = n m_{1} + frac{1}{2} n(n-1) = 1994 = 2 times 997 Rightarrow n(2 m_{1} - 1 + n) = 4 times 997. Since n and 2 m_{1} - 1 + n are one odd and one even, and 2 m_{1} - 1 + n > n, and 997 is a prime number, the only solution is n=4, 2 m_{1} - 1 + n = 997, giving m_{1} = 497 = 495 + 22. If we take m^{prime} = m_{k+2} - 2, then m_{k} < 2 and m_{k+2} > 4. Hence, 2 m^{prime} > m_{k+2}. Replacing m_{k+2} with 2 and m^{prime}, the value of M increases, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, m_{1} = 2.(II) From (I), we can assume the number of points of each color is 2, 3, ..., k-1, k+1, k+2, ..., n, n+1, n+2 (k leqslant n-1).We have frac{1}{2}(n+1)(n+4) - k = 1994.This gives left{begin{array}{l}n^{2} + 5n - 3984 > 0,  n^{2} + 3n - 3982 leqslant 0 .end{array}right.Solving, we get 61 leqslant n < 62.Taking n=61, we have k = frac{1}{2}(n+1)(n+4) - 1994 = 31 times 65 - 1994 = 21. Therefore, 1994 points can be colored with 61 colors, with the number of points of each color being 2, 3, cdots, 19, 20, 22, 23, cdots, 61, 62, 63. In this case, the resulting polygon is a 61-sided polygon, and the number of such polygons is the maximum.

For n geqslant 3, looking modulo 4 we find that m is even. We then use LTE in the case p=2 and m even, and v_{2}left(3^{m}-1right)= v_{2}(3-1)+v_{2}(3+1)+v_{2}(m)-1 geqslant 3, which is absurd!iii) Case 3^{m}-2^{n}=7: we rewrite this as 3^{m}-1=2^{n}+8. The cases m=0,1,2 give us (2,1) as a solution. For n geqslant 3, modulo 8 we get a contradiction.In conclusion, the solutions are (0,1),(1,2),(2,2) and (2,1)."},{"problem":"Write the digits from 0 to 9 in a line, in the order you choose.

For the sum to be maximum, the digit 0 should not appear in the tens and, therefore, must be the last; furthermore, the smallest of the digits 1,2, ldots, 9 should not appear in the units and, therefore, the 1 must be the first. We conclude that the sum is maximum for any choice where 1 is the first digit and 0 is the last. In this case, the sum of the units will be 0+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=44 and the sum of the tens will be 10+20+30+40+50+60+70+80+90=450; the maximum sum is then 450+44=494.Algebraically, we can write this argument as follows.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of pairs ((A, B)) of subsets of a set (M) with (n) elements such that (A subseteq B).2. First Solution (s1):   - We can use the binomial theorem to solve this problem.   - For each element in (M), there are three choices:     1. The element is in neither (A) nor (B).     2. The element is in (B) but not in (A).     3. The element is in both (A) and (B).   - Therefore, for each element, there are 3 choices, and since there are (n) elements, the total number of pairs ((A, B)) is (3^n).3. Second Solution (s2):   - Consider the set (M) with (n) elements.   - For any pair ((A, B)) for (n), it can be mapped to three pairs:     1. ((A, B))     2. ((A, B cup {n+1}))     3. ((A cup {n+1}, B cup {n+1}))   - This means the number of such pairs becomes three times as much when we add an element.   - For (n = 0), the answer is 1 because ((emptyset, emptyset)) is the only pair.   - Therefore, the answer is (1 times 3^n = 3^n).4.

Both are frustums of cones in this case. The formula for the volume of a frustum of a cone isV=frac{pi h}{3}left(r_{1}^{2}+r_{1} r_{2}+r_{2}^{2}right)where h is the height of the frustum, r_{1} and r_{2} are the radii of the base and top circles, respectively.For the masonry volume, this results inV=frac{pi h}{3}left(R_{1}^{2}+R_{1} R_{2}+R_{2}^{2}right)-frac{pi h}{3}left(r_{1}^{2}+r_{1} r_{2}+r_{2}^{2}right)with R_{1}=frac{D_{u}}{2}=5.60 , text{m}, R_{2}=frac{D_{o}}{2}=3.90 , text{m}, r_{1}=frac{d_{u}}{2}=5.00 , text{m}, and r_{2}=frac{d_{o}}{2}=3.75 , text{m}.

He was pressed to say how he did it, and he especially wanted to demonstrate his art again, which he was happy to do.The matter troubled me all day, and in the afternoon, I sat down and pondered until I discovered the mathematical regularity that enabled Jörg to perform this \\"math trick\\" and proved it algebraically.So how must one proceed? Our task is as follows:Write any three-digit number whose hundreds place is two greater than the units place. Subtract from it the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits in the original number. Add 12 to the result; then, in sequence, perform the following further arithmetic operations with the respective results: division by 70; multiplication by 12, and take the square root! The result is 6.1. How is it possible to predict the result of the arithmetic operations for any number as the initial value?2. Is a general solution possible where the hundreds place is n greater than the units place? (n=1,2, ldots, 9)","solution":"1. If a=100 x+10 y+z is any three-digit number, then according to the condition stated in the problem, x=z+2, so a=100(z+2)+10 y+z=100 z+200+10 y+z.For the number with the digits reversed, we have: b=100 z+10 y+x=100 z+10 y+z+2. Subtracting b from a, we get: a-b=198. We see that through the subtraction, all the digits of the number a fall out of the calculation, and the result is always 198, regardless of the choice of the number a. The further calculations serve only to obscure this fact.2. Generally, if x=z+n with n=1,2, ldots, 9,a-b=100 z+100 n+10 y+z-(100 z+10 y+z+n)=100 n-n=99 nThe result 99 n of course includes the special case 1(n=2, 99 n=198). On this basis, a mathematical \\"magic trick\\" can be built without much memorization.## Solution by Ernst Hennig:Let the units digit be x, the tens digit y, and the hundreds digit x+n with n=1,2,3, ldots, (9-x). The number is thus100(x+n)+10 y+xand the number with the digits reversed is 100 x+10 y+(x+n). The difference between the two numbers is D= 100 n-n=99 n.This difference thus has a constant value, independent of the choice of digits, 99 n, which depends only on the magnitude n.From here, Jörg can choose two paths. The simpler one is as follows:1. Jörg adds the number 10+n (i.e., 11,12,13, ldots) to the difference not named by him. This results in99 n+10+n=100 n+10=10(10 n+1)which gives 110, 210, 310, ... He then divides this number by 10 n+1, i.e., by 11, 21, 31, ... The result is always 10.2. A bit more challenging for the mathematical magician is the second path, which represents the full generalization of the number game (but only makes sense for n geq 2).3. Requirement: Add the number 100(n-2)+10(n-1)+n (i.e., 012,123,234, ldots) to the difference D. Result: 210(n-1).4. Requirement: Divide the result by 70! Result: 3(n-1), i.e., 3,6,9, ldots5. Requirement: Multiply the last result by 12(n-1)! The resulting number is 36(n-1)^{2}.6. Requirement: Take the square root of the last result!

Arrange the written numbers in non-decreasing order: a_{1} leqslant a_{2} leqslant ldots leqslant a_{n}. Since the number a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3} is written, then a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3} geqslant a_{1}, hence a_{2}+a_{3} geqslant 0. Similarly, we get a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_{n} leqslant a_{n}, hence a_{n-2}+a_{n-1} leqslant 0. Therefore, 0 geqslant a_{n-2}+a_{n-1} geqslant a_{2}+a_{3} geqslant 0; thus, a_{2}+a_{3}=a_{n-2}+a_{n-3}=0.

For A, when the three points are collinear, the plane is not determined, so A is incorrect;  For B, when the two lines are skew lines, they do not determine a plane; hence B is incorrect;  For C, since three lines intersecting in pairs without a common point determine a plane, when three lines intersect in pairs and share a common point, they do not necessarily lie in the same plane, such as the edges at a corner of a wall; hence C is incorrect;  For D, from the analysis of C, it is known that D is correct.  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{text{D}}.

The equation of an asymptote is given by y=frac{b}{a}x. The distance from F_{1} to this asymptote can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line, yielding frac{bc}{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}. Given the conditions, this distance equals b.2. Let M be the symmetric point of F_{1} with respect to the asymptote, and let F_{1}M intersect the asymptote at A. Given that M is the symmetric point, the distance |MF_{1}| is twice the distance from F_{1} to the asymptote, which gives us |MF_{1}|=2b.3. Since A is the midpoint of F_{1}M and O (the center of the hyperbola) is the midpoint of F_{1}F_{2}, OA is parallel to F_{2}M. This implies that angle F_{1}MF_{2} is a right angle, making triangle MF_{1}F_{2} a right triangle.4. Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle MF_{1}F_{2}, we have MF_{1}^2 + F_{1}F_{2}^2 = MF_{2}^2. Substituting the known lengths, we get 4b^2 + 4c^2 = c^2, which simplifies to 3c^2 = 4b^2.5.

Substituting into b_1 cdot b_2 cdot ldots cdot b_n=(-10)^n times (frac{1}{2})^{1+2+ldots+(n-1)}=(-10)^n times 2^{-frac{n(n-1)}{2}}=f(n).

Find the volume of the tetrahedron K L M N. Round your answer to the nearest hundredth if necessary.","solution":"Answer: 0.66 (exact value: frac{sqrt{11}}{5}).Solution. We will solve the problem in a general form. Let BC = SA = a, AC = SB = b, AB = SC = c. The faces of the tetrahedron SABC are equal triangles (such a tetrahedron is called equifacial). Draw a plane through each edge of the tetrahedron, parallel to the opposite edge (see Fig. 2). These six planes uniquely determine a parallelepiped, called the accompanying parallelepiped for the tetrahedron SABC. The edges of the tetrahedron are the diagonals of the faces of the parallelepiped, and the edges of the parallelepiped are equal to the segments connecting the centers of the opposite faces of the parallelepiped (the midpoints of the skew edges of the tetrahedron). Since the opposite edges of the tetrahedron are equal, the diagonals of the parallel faces of the accompanying parallelepiped are also equal, so its faces are rectangles, and the parallelepiped itself is rectangular. Denoting the lengths of the edges of the parallelepiped by x, y, z, we get x^2 + y^2 = a^2, y^2 + z^2 = b^2, z^2 + x^2 = c^2. Adding these three equations, we find x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2}, from which x^2 = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2}, y^2 = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2}, z^2 = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2}. Therefore, the volume of the accompanying parallelepiped is V = xyz = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} sqrt{(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}, and the volume of the original equifacial tetrahedron is V_{SABC} = frac{1}{3} V = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} sqrt{(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_72d2011c4e3388928cb1g-5.jpg?height=455&width=554&top_left_y=683&top_left_x=134)Fig. 1![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_72d2011c4e3388928cb1g-5.jpg?height=494&width=560&top_left_y=644&top_left_x=751)Fig. 2![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_72d2011c4e3388928cb1g-5.jpg?height=462&width=537&top_left_y=674&top_left_x=1388)Fig. 3From the problem statement, it follows that the tetrahedron KLMN is also equifacial. Express the lengths of the edges of the parallelepiped accompanying the tetrahedron KLMN in terms of the lengths x, y, z of the edges of the parallelepiped accompanying the tetrahedron SABC. Denote (see Fig. 1) by Q and R the midpoints of the edges SC and AB, and by F and G the feet of the angle bisectors of the faces SAB and CAB, respectively. Let l be the line passing through points Q and R. Since l is perpendicular to the faces of the accompanying parallelepiped (see Fig. 2), l perp SC and l perp AB. Rotate the tetrahedron SABC by 180^circ around the line l. In this case, the tetrahedra SABC and KLMN (and the parallelepiped accompanying SABC) will map onto themselves. Since the vertices M and L will map to each other, the segment ML is perpendicular to the line l and intersects it at its midpoint - point D. Similarly, we get KN perp l, E = KN cap l, KE = EN. Also note that the edges SC and AB are used equivalently in the reasoning, so QD = RE.Let Pi be the plane passing through point Q and perpendicular to the edge SC. Consider the orthogonal projection of the tetrahedron SABC onto the plane Pi (see Fig. 3). Points A', B', F', G', K', N' are the orthogonal projections of points A, B, F, G, K, N onto the plane Pi, point Q is the orthogonal projection of points S and C, the segment QR lies in the plane Pi, and since R is the midpoint of AB, R is the midpoint of A'B', and similarly, E is the midpoint of K'N', and R is the midpoint of F'G'.Point K, being the center of the circle inscribed in triangle SAB, divides the bisector SF in the ratio frac{FK}{FS} = frac{c}{a+b+c}. Since the ratio of lengths is preserved under orthogonal projection, frac{FK}{FS} = frac{F'K'}{F'S'}, and since KN perp QR and AB perp QR, K'N' perp QR and A'B' perp QR. Therefore, K'N' | A'B' and frac{RE}{RQ} = frac{F'K'}{F'S'} = frac{FK}{FS} = frac{c}{a+b+c}. Therefore, the edge DE of the parallelepiped accompanying the tetrahedron KLMN is DE = RQ - RE - DQ = RQ - 2RE = zleft(1 - frac{2c}{a+b+c}right) = z frac{a+b-c}{a+b+c}. Similarly, considering the pairs of edges SA, BC and SB, AC, we get that the other edges of the parallelepiped accompanying the tetrahedron KLMN are frac{b+c-a}{a+b+c} and x frac{a+c-b}{a+b+c}, respectively. Therefore, the volume of the tetrahedron KLMN is V_{KLMN} = frac{(b+c-a)(a+c-b)(a+b-c)}{(a+b+c)^3} V_{SABC} = frac{sqrt{2}}{12} cdot frac{(b+c-a)(a+c-b)(a+b-c)}{(a+b+c)^3} sqrt{(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)}. For a = 8, b = 7, c = 5, we get V_{KLMN} = frac{sqrt{11}}{5} approx 0.66.Remark. The problem can be solved in other ways as well. For example, to find the lengths of the edges of the tetrahedron KLMN, one can proceed as follows: find the lengths of the bisectors SA_1 and SC_1 of triangles BSC and ASB, respectively, as well as the lengths of the segments BA_1 and BC_1. Then find the angle B in triangle ABC, and then the segment A_1C_1 in triangle BA_1C_1. In triangle SA_1C_1, use the cosine theorem to find the angle S and, knowing in what ratio points K and L divide the bisectors SA_1 and SC_1, find the segments SK and SL. Finally, from triangle SKL, find the length KL. The other edges of the tetrahedron KLMN are found similarly."},{"problem":"Can you fill in 9 different natural numbers in a 3 times 3 grid (as shown in the figure) so that the product of the three numbers in each row, each column, and both diagonals equals 2005?

Rearranging x(x - 1) + 2yz = y(y - 1) + 2zx we get (x 2 - y 2 ) = (x - y) + 2z(x - y), so either x = y or (y - z) = 1 + (z - x) (1). Similarly, either y = z or (z - x) = 1 + (x - y) (2). So we must look at 4 possibilities. Obviously if x = y and y = z, then the triple is (0, 0, 0). If x = y and (z - x) = 1 + (x - y), then (x - y) = 0, (z - x) = 1, (y - z) = -1, so the triple is (0, -1, 1). If (y - z) = 1 + (z - x) and y = z, then (y - z) = 0, (z - x) = -1, (x - y) = 1, so the triple is (1, 0, -1).

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximum number of subsets of a set with 10 elements such that none of these subsets is a subset of another.

Suppose one of the students has received 1001 tickets, each with the number frac{1000}{1001}.

However, since it's stated as a binomial, the coefficient of x must be simplified to zero due to the condition provided. This leads to a contradiction in terms, indicating that the term involving x must actually be present, and the initial interpretation was incorrect. The correct interpretation is that for A to be a quadratic binomial, the coefficient of x must not vanish, which was mistakenly considered. Therefore, the correct step is:Given A=-2x^{2}-(k-1)x+1 is a quadratic binomial, it means all terms are present, but for clarification, the term involving x is specifically focused on, which should not disappear. Thus, the condition for A to be a quadratic binomial doesn't directly imply k-1=0 based on the disappearance of the x term but rather ensures that the coefficient of x is defined and non-zero. The mistake was in the interpretation of the binomial condition. However, following the original solution's logic without introducing new ideas but clarifying:- The condition for A to be a quadratic binomial doesn't inherently require any term to vanish but to ensure clarity and correctness in the explanation, we proceed with the solution provided without the misinterpretation:Since A is given as a quadratic binomial, and no terms are meant to vanish for it to remain as such, the original statement aimed to find the value of k that satisfies a certain condition related to the polynomial's structure. The mistake in interpretation does not alter the mathematical steps but the explanation's clarity. Therefore, we correct the explanation as follows:Given A=-2x^{2}-(k-1)x+1, for A to be a quadratic binomial, we consider the condition that affects its structure. The original solution directly finds k without explaining the disappearance or presence of terms, which was the point of confusion.For part (2):Given k=-1, we have C+2A=B. This leads to:[begin{align*}C &= B-2A &= -2(x^{2}-x+2) - 2[-2x^{2}-(k-1)x+1] &= -2(x^{2}-x+2) - 2[-2x^{2}-(-1-1)x+1] quad text{(substituting k=-1)} &= -2(x^{2}-x+2) + 4x^{2}+4x-2 &= -2x^{2}+2x-4 + 4x^{2}+4x-2 &= 2x^{2}-2x-6.end{align*}]Therefore, the corrected step-by-step solution for part (2), closely following the original solution's approach but ensuring clarity in each step, is:Given k=-1, and C+2A=B, we find C as follows:[begin{align*}C &= B-2A &= -2(x^{2}-x+2) - 2[-2x^{2}-(k-1)x+1] &= -2(x^{2}-x+2) + 4x^{2}+4x-2 &= 2x^{2}-2x-6.end{align*}]Thus, encapsulating the final answers:- For part (1), the value of k is boxed{1}.- For part (2), the polynomial C is boxed{2x^{2}-2x-6}."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],O={key:0},E={key:1};function M(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),n(x,null,w(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),y(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",E,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",O,"See more"))],8,z)):_("",!0)])}const L=f(D,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-62b4fa0b"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/54.md","filePath":"drive/54.md"}'),W={name:"drive/54.md"},R=Object.assign(W,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{G as __pageData,R as default};
