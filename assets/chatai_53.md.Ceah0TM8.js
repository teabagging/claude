Saw doctor yesterday (two days later), was prescribed augmentin forte (with repeat) and nurofen, and started on these immediately. The diagnosis was an infected cyst beside my nose, an area which is very hard to touch and spreading upward.  The swelling was worse this morning and has reached my jawline. My top gum on the same side is rigid and angry looking and I've just noticed a small head of pus in the gum over my eyetooth.  I was warned that headache, fever and vision problems needed hospital care.  The question is how long does it take for the above treatment to start working?  And has the infection also caused a dental abscess?  My face is very painful.","Doctor":"Hi, the type of swelling which you are mentioning that it started immediately 3 days ago and you visited the doctor yesterday it shows that it is some dental infection only which must have arisen from a carious tooth or any trauma on the front tooth. The dentist must have taken an x-ray of your tooth and then came to a diagnosis of infected cyst. The infection will take some time to heal, but only antibiotic is not the treatment, the cause of the infection should be treated it means root canal treatment of the causative tooth or extraction should be done. The pus discharge which is visible is the pus is making its tract to drain nothing to worry once  the treatment is over it will be all right."},{"Patient":"I had my teeth cleaned 6 days ago and have been in severe pain ever since.

Could that have something to do with the abscesses or trauma pls help","Doctor":"Hi, The dark purple veins running under the tongue are normal as they are present in everybody and maybe you have just noticed them. If they are not swollen or painful then there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Gum abcess is a completely different thing which needs to be treated by a dentist along with your other oral problems such as fractured teeth. The broken tooth maybe sharp and may cause ulcer but there is no correlation with the the veins running under your tongue.

If your daughter is still having the problem you visit to the dentist and ask him or her to take an x-ray to see weather the infection has subsided or not. If the adjacent tooth is also having infection he should have restarted the root canal treatment on the same day or prescribed and antibiotic.

I was taking penicillin for a week for an abscess in my molar. I went through the entire perscription and it was worse than when I started.

Antibiotic treatment for an abscess is most effective in the early days. If it has been for a while with abscess collection, then you would need a surgical intervention to drain the abscess and give you real relief. Antibiotics cannot make it into pus collection and are thus generally ineffective with collected abscesses.Please return to your dentist and get and xray done. If there is any collection let it be drained and probably be considered for a root canal treatment.I hope this helps and I wish you well.Thanks for using our services and feel free to ask more questions if need be.Dr. Ditah, MD"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,   On july 29th , I had teeth extraction and dummy teeth fixing.

It s worst when I smile or chew and move my cheek against it. I have no history of abscesses or even cavities on my upper teeth , though I have had a root canal on my lower left second molar.

There s also no pain in any of my teeth, or the gums themselves, only that region.

It does not at all feel normal.Could it be thrush and how is it treated, Maybe it is a bacterial infection? if so, if he gave me antibiotics, it might help me tongue and genital issues or narrow down if it might be fungal/yeast.finally although I do have problems in most of my bottom teeth, top seem fine except for a gum-line filling that fell out and a chipped front tooth yet he advised pulling all my teeth and even implied he would not do anything to help me like filling the filling that shows as near the front that fell out on a top tooth.I have severe diabetes and severe bruxism..he said teeth were bad even though hardly any signs or feelings of them not being ok on the top He did not really look at them or take xrays of them/ Mentioned bone loss.. I am afraid to get dentures as an upper partial made me gag all the time and I could not wear it..tonight they said even with dentures might not work and would be hard to keep in due to bone ridge loss.does pulling teeth on top that seem fine seem like a bad idea/ I do not think emotionally I can handle doing both or even one right now as so many other problems going on. One other time a dentist advised pulling both top and bottom but most I saw did not say pull the top.so it is about the bruise. swelling and hemotoma, the thrush or what not and the suggestion typo pull all my teeth both top and cotton (I had nearly no plague and no loose teeth)thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking the query,Dont worry follow the post extraction instructions given to you.Take complete course of antibiotics and analgesics.Take lukewarm saline and anttiseptic mouthwash rinses.Visit to the concerned Dentist and get the checkup done and take an x-ray of the affected area.Take care!"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have 2 bumps in the gum of my mouth on each side, they don't hurt, bleed, and I can't really feel them unless I touch them with my tongue or finger.

I heard it could take up to 2 years for this sensation to go away. Are there any treatments available for this type of condition?","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query.Actually, anesthesia is given in order to block the nerve which is responsible for appreciating pain sensations. Blocking of this nerve causes transient loss of sensation in the area around the teeth, the lower lip, chin and parts of the tongue on the same side. This way, you don't feel the pain of surgery.however, administration of anesthesia is a blind technique : sometimes, the needle accidentally punctures and injures the concerned nerve itself. Recovery of the injured nerve normally takes 6-12 weeks; though it may take even 3-6 months in some patients.You will be all right once complete recovery of the injured nerve takes place. There is no medicine to hasten the recovery.

Only the throbbing pain which is not continuous.If teeth grinding is the problem then you have to go for habit breakers and mouth-guards to avoid further damage to teeth and occlusal correction.It can be related to impacted wisdom tooth;then it has to be treated or gingival or  periodontal pockets if teeth are loose.Also caries or the infection in the tooth can also results in swelling and soreness.I would advice you not to take medicine just to get short term relief instead try to find out the cause with your dentist and accordingly take the treatment.Nothing to worry.

When it is dried it has a yellowish color and it is just a big cluster of tiny bumps....what is this?!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for your query. Novocaine as a drug usually does not have any side effects resulting in yellowish cluster of bumps. But after reading your symptoms I feel that the clusters may be due to trauma during the oral surgery due to pressure applied by the instruments which can happen as you were under anesthesia.I would suggest that you give it a week and massage with any normal lip gel. If after a week the problem still persists then please visit your surgeon for an examination.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi, recently my lips became very itchy,dry and red after using this lipgloss. after a few days, the redness was gone but my lips were still itchy. there were also black spots on my lips. now my upper lip and the outer lining of my lower lip looks extremely dark. what do i do? how to stop the itch and get rid of the darkness!?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking the query,According to your clinical symptoms i suppose that you have developed with allergy with the lip gloss, i would suggest you to stop the use.Apply a petroleum gelly on lips.Take a coruse of anti allergic like tab cetrizine TDS.If the symptoms worsen or persists get a checkup done by a skin specailist.Hope you find this as helpful,Regards"},{"Patient":"I have used smokeless tobacco for several years off and on and have formed pockets along the inside of my bottom lip.

Other signs would be a fever, warmth over the affected area, a stiff neck. Your difficulty in swallowing may indicate swelling in the back of your throat and around the area of the removed teeth which may be secondary to infection.

I appreciate any help you can give me without actually SEEING me. I'll try to explain my problem the best I can... I am a 57 year old female. I smoke, approx. 1/2-3/4 of a pack of cigarettes a day. I NEVER drink alcohol. My primary doctor has retired and I have not been able to find a replacement yet... however, I do have a specialist that I go to for arthritis pain... she has been absolutely NO help with this at all. My problem started almost 7 months ago. I was just sitting at the computer and all of a sudden my mouth started FILLING with blood. I had my daughter look at the inside of my mouth and she saw a small (approx. 2mm) raised spot where the blood was coming from, on the roof of my mouth... that first time it happened, and I had just started using a new prescription, Voltairen (sp?) Cream for arthritis pain... I was told by my specialist that the main side effect of this cream was excessive bleeding, so I was kind of leery about using it too often, and didn't... but every time I did use it the sore on the roof of my mouth would open up and it would start bleeding again... the bleeding would last off & on for 2- 3 days and then stop as quickly and unexpectedly as it started. Needless to say, I stopped using the cream and have not used it at all for at least 8 weeks. Then today the sore opened up and has been bleeding off and on all day, so it was NOT the cream, although I do not have as MUCH bleeding as I did when I was using it. Also, I get steroid injections in my back approx. every 3-4 months and just had one last week, but nothing else new or different. The slightly raised sore is located on the roof of my mouth, in the center & it feels like it's on the hard, not soft part... it hurts only if I put pressure on it. It stops bleeding when I use ice chips or rinse my mouth with cold ice water. I have also been under a great deal of stress this past week, and it also seems like whenever this problem has occurred in the past is when I'm having some type of stress or another. If it was not for the bleeding I wouldn't even know there was a problem, because it is so small and not raised or open until it's already started to bleed. I can't eat anything or drink anything hot or it will bleed. Please let me know what you think it is, or since I don't have a doctor, if I should go to the emergency room to at least have some tests done? Thanks, M~","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for your detailed information.Initially,the cause of bleeding from floor of mouth has to be evaluated.Discontinue and replace the drug causing allergic reactions.I would advice you to get a clinical evaluation by a dentist to rule out any chance of periodontal infection or deep caries associated.Maintain oral hygiene well.Plenty of fruits as well as vitamin c supplements has to be administered.Discontinue smoking.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Prescription amoxicillin without confirming if it is actually strep throat is a little premature but not poorly thought of.Having bleeding and swollen gums is a sign of gingival diseases. Your symptoms are hardly  related to herpes but could still be a viral condition.My suspicion is directly more towards oral candidiasis with gingivitis that might of viral or bacterial or fungal origin. You will require some mouth white antibiotics solutions and treatment for candida and stept throat combined. If it is herpes, then the infection will clear off on its own without the need for a treatment.

The line of treatment for this would be repeated placement of antimicrobial dressing at the extraction site...it is advisable if u can visit your dentist for the same.

This indicates that there is a problem in the common bile duct, which carries bile from the liver to the small intestines. Now you have similar pain in the right flank, no blood in the urine and no fever. I would advise in such a patient the following.MRCP to start with and before the ERCP is done.ERCP and Endoscopic ultrasonography will give a proper diagnosis.

First of all, when did your lump start? Is it painful? Is it hard or soft? Does the skin over the lump look normal or is there any change which makes the skin look different in comparison to the surrounding skin? How much has it increased in size?

The doctor asked to come back once the antibiotic is finished so that he could remove the wisdom tooth.","Doctor":"Thank you for your query in HCM forum. Pontalon (Mefenamic acid) is an analgesic of a specific group called NSAID. There are several analgesics available in this group which are having same  or more potency but less side effects than Mefenamic acid(MA). The use of MA has been reduced worldwide because of its comparatively more side effects than other NSAIDs. The actual dosage of MA is 500 mg 1st dose or maximum 2nd dose after 6 hours then 250 mg every 6 hourly not more that 7 days. Always take MA immediately after a meal,,in full stomach and with a full glass of water. You can not take the medicine every 4 hourly. You could have a severe stomach irritation and have permanent gastritis/ulceration with over dosage MA. Other several side effects may also arise. Practically you are taking higher doses than pharmacologically prescribed. There is no risk of kidney damage with 7 days dosage, But long term intake may damage your kidney. For any dental pain Paracetamol 1gm 4 hourly is enough and safest analgesic to get comfort from pain.

Usually one 'shot' of 1.8 ml (1 cartridge) of local anesthesia( lignocaine) is enough to numb a tooth for crown reduction. Of course, if it is delivered properly. In some case of rare inflammatory situation little more amount injection may be required. The rate of local absorption may vary a little from person to person. So some time should be given after injection before checking the numbness. Fear or apprehension may lead to lowering pain threshold that is feeling of more pain psychologically. And the patient asks for repeated injection.It seems while giving 2nd injection your dentist missed the angle of the needle and pushed the needle little deeper which touched your facial nerve and you felt a electric shock like feeling, and as the injection poured near facial nerve you had temporary facial muscle paralysis  which prevents you from closing eyes and tears drops down uncontrollably. Nothing to worry about that. This type of incident happens sometimes in a dental procedure. The eye and facial muscle comes back to normal state as soon as the action of injection is gone, roughly after 1 to 2 hours.

This 1 single tooth extraction is more painful. Is it normal to feel this much discomfort / pain. Could any nerve been damaged that sends signals to the right side of my face head?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM forum. The extraction of a molar tooth sometimes become very difficult due to lot of reasons, for example tooth root fused to the surrounding bone, or the tooth root is curved or broken crown of a badly decayed tooth etc. In such conditions some amount of bone needs to be removed or the root portion may need to be separated by drilling. Yah, this kind of procedure may take long time; even more than an hour, while uncomplicated molars can be extracted within a minute. When the bone is injured or drilled, there is always a chance of severe pain and swelling while most of the simple molar extraction may not need even a single analgesic. You are a bit unlucky that your extraction needed some amount of bone cutting and that causes all the problem that you are suffering. If  the bone cutting is done under cool water spray the trauma may be little less but I really do not know how exactly your bone is removed. Antibiotic like Clindamycin is fine, But I think you may need some particular anti inflammatory drugs like Serratiopeptidase 10 mg, 8 hourly  or Chymotrypsin 100000 unit , 6 hourly for 3 to 4 days to reduce your complications faster. These are sometimes used after a traumatic extraction of tooth. Consult your oral surgeon as soon as possible. Wishing you back to good health faster."},{"Patient":"I have a hard lump on the roof of my mouth. It is located beside the last molar on the left side of my mouth on the soft palate.

The gum over wisdom tooth is usually in the form of a flap which creates food lodgment leading to infection, pain and swelling in the region.

Ideally the wisdom tooth should be extracted for permanent solution.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello, i have noticed a black sport on tongue (upper left side, size of a peanut) and similar, but small spots, in the neighborhood (only on left side).  After couple of weeks of thorough tongue washing and dental hygiene, it is still there. May be a coincidence but I ate 8 boxes!! of altoids over a period of 2 weeks prior to noticing this spot. I used to crunch alotids on the left side primarily (because i was suffering from tooth ache on the right side). I got crown done on a tooth to the right side of my mouth around the same time frame. My dentist looked at it and thought it was just pigmentation but not sure why it would develop all of a sudden. My doctor did a blood test and found me slightly anemic (didn't find any cancer). He put me on iron tablets but primarily because he thought my 2 week altoid craving was result of pica (i think). I have taken couple of cipro 500mg few weeks before noticing the spot just to get rid of cold. This may have killed good bacteria, so I started taking probiotics (bayer truebiotic).  All of this happened in a period of 1-2 months.  I am giving all these details because I am not sure (and neither are my dentist and MD) as to which of those may have caused these black spots to appear. My MD mentioned that after taking iron tablets for couple of months, if it still doesn't go away, i should see an ENT specialist.","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to HCM forum. There are several reason that can cause black spots on the tongue. Practically without inspecting visually it is almost impossible to predict the correct diagnosis. A good picture may also help. But most common black spot on tongue which is of a pea size along with similar spot around it could be suggestive of \\"black hairy tongue\\". It is simply the elongated growth of the papillae present over the tongue and discolored by food stain and bacterial growth. Some times the elongation is so much that it looks like a bunch of hair over the tongue, hence its name. it is generally caused by some illness, some medicine intake and mostly due to some local constant irritation. Interestingly intake or using mouth wash containing MENTHOL for long time is one of the local factor of developing such condition. Which could happen in  your case as you were taking Altoids (peppermint/menthol) for long time with one side. Doctor prescribed iron tablets because iron deficiency is also sometimes blamed for this kind of condition. Antibiotics generally does not cause this condition until taken for long time  at a stretch.  Anyway, the condition is self limiting but may take time to regress. Continue your iron tablet, stop Altoids. Maintain your oral hygiene with proper brushing. keep your tongue clean gently using a tongue scraper or using your tooth brush. Do not use any commercial mouthwash, warm salt water mouth wash can be used instead. Hope your problem will be relieved soon.

In the first part, the student, as you said, is not wrong in giving lignocaine injection at rear part of the jaw. The nerve that supplies all the teeth of lower jaw enters into the mandible through a hole from that area. It is called nerve block to anesthetized the whole side of the jaw. If the injection is given just beside the tooth it will not penetrate the thickness of the jaw bone to reach to the nerve for the particular tooth and that does not numb your tooth. It is generally done in child patients till 6 to 7 years of age when the jaw bone is much thinner . In the second part your suffering of pain is little unusual. Post extraction pain is generally not so severe. There are commonly three reason of sever pain after extraction of tooth. firstly there could be laceration or fracture of the tooth supporting bony part of the jaw, Secondly the area could be severely infected and lastly it turned to so called 'dry socket'. You should visit to your dentist as early as possible for diagnosis and get proper treatment. And nothing of these are 'terribly wrong' in their occurrences. Any such pain can be controlled by using analgesics. Until you visit your doctor you can start Aceclofenac 100 mg two times a day.Take this drug in full stomach or take 15 ml of any liquid antacid before this medicine if you have the problem of acidity.

No pain afterwards.  Have white where my tooth was, think this is the blood clot.  Area looks healthy, not red or swollen.  From previous posts I see dry socket does not appear for a couple of days.  What I am asking is straight after the extraction and still today 23 hours later I have bad breath. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Thanks for sharing your concern in HCM forum. The whitish  area at your extraction site could be some food lodgment or some slough, which is not uncommon 24 hours after extraction of a tooth. The dry socket is a phenomenon which is still poorly understood to prevent it. It is a highly painful condition typically appear within 2nd to 4th day after extraction. As you have no pain , so still the area could not be considered as dry socket. You can start chlorhexidine mouth wash 4 to 5 times a day for one week and refrain from smoking for 3 to 4 days if you are a smoker, as a probable prevention of dry socket.Continue medicines prescribed by your doctor, if any. Continue your brushing teeth as usual avoiding injury to extraction site. Bad breath for couple of days after extraction in not uncommon. If you do not have any other oral problem, your bad breath will disappear with proper brushing and chlorhexidine mouth wash, and do not get tensed by thinking about dry socket. Its not a very common incidence. If something like that appears, consult your dentist. Get well soon."},{"Patient":"Recently, my gums and teeth have been red, swollen and hurt.

I go back to him on Monday for an impression for a night guard as I have went a few years without one but I called him today and explained that my mouth continues to hurt...his response was...did you get the hydrofloss machine yet and I said no I had not ordered yet - he said he could not clean my teeth until I start on the machine but will take a look again on Monday when I come in for my impression. Should I find a different dentist with a hygenist or do I continue to go to this guy. Isn t there something immediately that he can give me or do that will help my pain. I am flossing, brushing and using the pro health mouthwash instead of Listerine because of the alcohol may burn worse.

I have taken before and been fine, so sure it's doing what it is supposed to, but face seems to be swelling more than before since I have been on the pen.  Not sore to touch, just feels like the start of a balloon on my face around the infected area.","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM forum. It's very simple that penicillin has worked before to control your oral infection, doesn't mean that it will work for every time. Penicillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic i.e. it works on limited number of bacteria. This time you may have been affected by some kind of bacteria that is not controlled by penicillin. Facial swelling due to infection is generally 'not sore in touch', as the pus or fluid produced from infection( inflammation) is spread into the tissue spaces of the face and does not create much pressure on nerve endings. But the continued facial swelling may lead to grave consequences. You should IMMEDIATELY visit to dentist. Let him/her examine your problem properly and prescribe a proper antibiotic to control your infection. Do not try to treat infective facial swelling by yourself. You may invite a serious trouble by doing this.

I had a filling done in tooth #14 about a year ago and it is really sensitive to cold (even to saliva ejectors at times; I feel the cold air from it). My filling was apparently really close to the nerve and I was told that I’d be fine. Ever since the filling was done, (the filling is metallic by the way), was when I became sensitive to the cold (cold liquid doesn’t affect me, only when it is directly put onto my tooth –like when I go in for cleanings). My dentist has recommended a Root Canal procedure but the thing is, I don’t feel any pain with it except for the sensitivity. Any recommendations or explanations of this? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your question. The nerve in the tooth has only one response to any type of stimulus:  pain. Metallic and non-metallic fillings have a different expansion coefficient than natural tooth.  So if exposed to hot or cold it contracts and expands slightly different than the tooth and this can cause pain. Does this cold sensitivity last only a 1-5 seconds?  Or does it hurt 20-45 seconds after the cold has been removed from the tooth.  If the pain lasts only when the cold is on the tooth then you are fine and this is a natural response to having a restorative procedure.  The tooth will eventually calm down, this generally is within 2-3 weeks post operatively but can last up to a year or more.  If the sensitivity/pain lasts longer than a few seconds than that is a sign of irreversible pulpitis and you will need to have a root canal in the tooth. Try sensodyne toothpaste to see if this helps relieve the pain.  Also, try drinking cool water rather than cold and avoid touching it with ice.  I have had a sensitive tooth for 15 years in my mouth.  It's still sensitive to cold but has diminished over the years. Hang in there.  You could electively get a root canal but this compromises the strength of the tooth. Best wishes Dr. Ward"},{"Patient":"I have been having upper left abdominal pain for approx 12 yrs.

Last month I had my two bottom wisdom teeth extracted. Everything went pretty smoothly for the most part. Over the last month the pain has been non existent, swelling reduced, and no discomfort at all. That was until this past Monday morning when I awoke with the left side of my face swollen up to the size of a golf ball. I of course, went and seen the dentist that same day only for him to take two ex rays and have no idea what's wrong. It feels like a huge knot on my jaw bone. It is very painful and I can't open my mouth very much at all. The extraction itself has no problems, no pain, and no discomfort.  However, last week I found a white dot (almost like a sore) on the extraction site (on left side, same side as swelling) and Monday the dentist said that this was okay. Today is Wednesday and I can feel that the \\"white dot\\" has grown and I managed to open my mouth wide enough so I could shine a flashlight back there to take a look and what I found is that it has indeed grown to a pretty big, dark red, moveable bump.

After smoking, I felt some burning. No pain or bad taste, but it has a weird feeling. I also drank pop just now and wondered if that could be causing the sensation. I worry constantly about this area and my family is tired of me having them look at it to make sure it still looks like its healing. Just wondering what the burning sensation is.","Doctor":"Hi, Hold off on smoking a cigarette for at least two weeks from the time of the extraction. I would encourage you to quit smoking before the time of the appointment to help reduce the risk of post operative complications. Your body heals by forming a blood clot which is a matrix for the healing tissue and bone to form on. Cigarettes affect this in many ways, the suction you form on the cigarette itself can pull the clot from the socket and cause dry socket. The smoke is hot and irritating which can cause pain, delayed healing and also dry socket. The chemicals in cigarettes causes vasoconstriction, since the mouth heals through microvasculature, vasoconstriction can cut blood supply to the healing site and delay the healing or even cause failure of the clot from progressively healing. Visit the dentist and get it examined. Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 19 year old female. My wisdom teeth have been coming in for a while now. But haven t given me much trouble until recently.

A condition known as Pericoronitis results in pain and infection around the wisdom teeth and the infection can spread to other parts of the body.

When the body goes through an infection or illness, the lymph nodes tend to become swollen, including those located around the jawline. Being an integral part of the immune system, these lymph nodes work in overdrive when the body is under attack by creating beneficial antibodies, and they can become swollen since you had bites on your stomach.(or)  it can be abscess associated with your back tooth.Please visit a dentist for the needful ,or he might refer it to a physician.get well soonregards,dr.naveen"},{"Patient":"I had a root canal 10 years ago, now the same tooth has become infected.

I take no other drugs/alcohol and I have a very health lifestyle. How soon should I refrain from smoking?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the question. Smoking pure Cannabis not mixed with tobacco has never been directly associated with any pre/post operative complications in dentistry. However, certain combustion (burning) by products of almost all materials can be carcinogenic (cancer causing). Marijuana use is also implicated in Hypotension (reduced blood pressure). You should also bare in mind that Cannabis (Aka. Pot, Marijuana etc) is an illegal drug (narcotic) in almost all countries. If you are using Marijuana medicinally i.e if Medical use is permitted where you live, you should talk to your doctor before discontinuing the drug. Having said that, there is no ascribed safe period. In any case, don't go for you appointment 'high', stop using it at least 1 week before the surgery and abstain for at least 2 week post operative. The act of dragging on your joint/reefer/bong etc will cause negative pressure in your oral cavity that can lead to clot displacement. This can cause a painful condition called 'Dry Socket'.

My concern is that I have a tooth infection.A few months back I broke one of my teeth. Since I have no dental insurance I haven't been able to get it fixed yet. I plan on doing that as soon as I am able to, in a little under two weeks.I haven't had any pain in the tooth, nor sensitivity to heat or cold, since the accident. But lately I've been having pain near my collar bone, chest and upper back and semi frequent headaches. Occasionally I will also have mild pain in my gums and jaw and if I press under my jaw it's tender. But all these pains come and go and are never more than a mild annoyance, and some days (like yesterday) I don't have pain at all.I do know a lot of these pains can be cause by anxiety as well, which is why I have been hesitant to take myself to the ER or urgent care. Also, it may be unrelated but I'm having a longer than normal menstrual period. (day 8)I literally have no choice as to when I can see a dentist, and I don't have a primary care physician. I'm totally broke until I get my student loans, so even going to a dentist and paying for a cheap extraction is not an option right now. Should I go to urgent care, or can I wait it out?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to us.Since the tooth has broken few months back,i would advice you to get a thorough clinical examination done by a dentist.Chances of periapical infection is very high in this case.Tooth has to be either root canal treated or extracted depending on severity of lesion.Core-build up or crown has to be placed to correct the tooth fracture.Take complete course of amoxycillin to relieve underlying infection.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello!!

It may happen in 50% patients after the cleaning of root canal . The dentist has no control over it. There is no need of postponing your travel schedule. You should start an antibiotic like Augmentin or same type ( Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125mg) 8 hourly for 5 days.

Any short term swelling over human body is mostly related to an inflammation. As you have a painful swelling over back side of the lower jaw and the possibility of Mumps is discarded and that is reduced by Penicillin, then the swelling must be from an inflammation due to  infection of some localized structure. The source is mostly from the oral cavity as the other structures like muscles, cheek soft tissue,skin or bone does not get inflemmed or infected without a infection source or from trauma. I do not know what  your dentist said, but the the most common cause of such kind of painful swelling is from Impacted third molar tooth as you have stated that you have no other dental problems. Your dentist should take an OPG( a kind of full mouth radiograph) and hopefully find the source of infection or probable cause of inflammation which causes your facial swelling.

Can u give some advice to remove it ?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query, Several reasons exist for our teeth turning yellow. Some people are born with slightly yellow teeth naturally, and only unnatural dentistry, such as veneers, can fix them. It is perfectly normal for people to have slightly yellowish teeth. The problem is that the teeth become more yellow with time. The number one reason for the yellowing of teeth is staining from foods, drinks, or other substances introduced into the mouth. Teeth are made of four layers of tissues. The innermost layer is the cementum. It attaches the root of the tooth to the jaw bone. Next, is the pulp. The pulp contains the blood vessels and nerve-endings in the tooth.

My mother recommended that I call the dentist even if it's the weekend;  that I stop in the pharmacy and aask the pharmacist for over the counter first aid, and that I rinse with saltwater;I am miserable.  what should I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting H.C.M.If you are of the age group 17-24 years, an erupting or impacted wisdom tooth could be a cause to your pain. But evaluation of the other teeth of that region is also necessary to rule out any deep exposed caries or fractured tooth which is usually associated with such an acute pain. Meanwhile, you could take the following medication for your pain relief:1) Amoxycillin 500mg tab twicw daily2) Aceclofenac 50mg+paracetamol 500mg---1 tab twice daily (could be taken upto 3 times in case the pain is higher but keep an interval of 6-8 hours between two doses.)Warm saline rinsing would be helpful if the pain is due to wisdom tooth.Hope the above information is helpful."},{"Patient":"I am 31 and have stage 4 endometriosis .

Brush and floss more frequently. Scrape your tongue. Avoid foods that sour your breath. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and dry mouth, and Avoid caffeinated drinks and try to quit smoking. Green tea prevents the development of oral bacteria while yogurt helps with digestive problems that can cause halitosis. Crunchy fruits and vegetables such as carrots and apples reduce bad breath by removing plaque build up from your teeth. Fruits high in vitamin C also boost immunity and lower the risk of gum disease. Vitamin C also restricts the growth of bacteria in the mouth, but make sure your vitamin C is consumed through natural foods and not by supplements Regards."},{"Patient":"My husband used to grind his teeth in the nights. We went to a dentis and told regrding this. He said this can cause his teeth to be crooked if left like this. He prescribed some thing called Dental night guards. What are thse ? Is this useful for teeth grinding ?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for your questions. Crooked teeth that don't close together like puzzle pieces may result in the body wanted to get a more balanced bite.  This normally occurs in your sleep where you brain says, this doesn't feel just right, I need to make things better.  So your teeth start to grind to try and smooth down the bite to a more balanced fit.  This does not necessarily help your teeth, this can cause teeth to loosen if combined with poor oral hygiene, tooth sensitivity, sore jaw muscles, neck muscles and lower back muscles, pressure headaches, pain in the jaw joints, clicking of the jaw etc. A night guard is a device that is like a hard or soft retainer that seats on your teeth and has a nice balanced surface for your opposing teeth to rest on.  It's like a smooth ice skating rink for your teeth.  This device helps improve the grinding but may not stop it completely.  The good news is that your teeth will be grinding on a plastic device rather than your teeth and it will reduce the risk of losing tooth structure. These devices are great for grinding.  I prefer hard night guards because the firmness helps prevent them from breaking down and they don't flex like soft night guards which in your sleep may be perceived as food and induce more grinding.  I personally use a night guard and found that it has improved my bruxism condition greatly. They are well worth the money.

Can u give some advice to remove it ?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM forum,Scaling and polishing will remove the extrinsic yellow stains .Tooth brushing will not help in removing intrinsic stains so you can go for bleaching.Today, with proper patient selection, bleaching is a safe, easy, and inexpensive modality that is used to treat many types of tooth discoloration.Or can go for Partial (eg, laminate veneers) tooth coverage restorations which are used to treat generalized intrinsic tooth discoloration in which bleaching is not indicated or in which the aesthetic results of bleaching fail to meet the patient's expectations. Brush twice daily.Take care"},{"Patient":"i get tingling in my face lips neck and chest the day after i have had alchohol could you tell me what this meens","Doctor":"Hi . Tingling in the body and face/numbness as well may mean a neuropathy, commonly associated with chronic alcoholic intake. This may be due to vitamin deficiency which leads to neuropathy. If you notice this just the day after and not always, it could be some sympathetic reactions , which could be ignored. You must try to minimize alcohol intake and may need multivitamins. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I think my wisdom tooth is coming in and earlier today it was very swollen and just now I rinsed with hot salt water and i looked at it and picked up the flap gum with qtip and pus started coming out so what do I do now?","Doctor":"Hi, Ideally a wisdom tooth if not coming out completely or creating difficlty in cleaning due to improper positioning requires extraction by an oral surgeon. Sometimes food gets deposited in between the flap over the errupting wisdom tooth and the tooth itself and it is almost impossible to clean it out resulting pus formation due to infe4ction. As there is presence of pus in that area you need to do warm saline gargles 3-4 times/day along with a good chlorhexidine mouthwash. You may require antibiotics and an anti inflamatory drug to reduce the swelling and remove the infection. These are temporary measures, i would strongly recommend you to visit your dentist for further treatment ie: extraction or operculectomy (cutting of the flap) for better oral hygiene.

Unfortunately the cost involved and timespan of this treatment makes it unpopular with many patients. Your next option is to get veneers for both teeth adjacent to the gap.  This can only be done with a fairly small gap, which sounds about right in your case.  If the gap is too wide, the veneers will leave you with short fat looking teeth. Depending on existing fillings on teeth etc, your dentist might choose to make full crowns instead of veneers. From a cost point of view 1) Veneers 2) Crowns 3) Braces From a non-invasive point of view 1) Braces 2) Veneers 3) Crowns Lastly, if the aesthetics of the small gap does not bother you, there is no dental reason to close the gap.  It it is purely aesthetics, BUT, rather have the gap fixed with one of the above mentioned treatments than allowing tartar to build up and \\"fill\\" the gap again.  This will lead to soft tissue infection and bone loss around the teeth, which turns into a much bigger problem if left untreated."},{"Patient":"Hello, I keep getting really bad breath constantly, even after I brush my teeth or not eat anything for ages.

My history is the following: I had two impacting wisdom teeth , both lower set. First of all, root canal surgery was performed on the tooth in front of one of the wisdom teeth, removing the three nerves , and filling the root canals. A temporary filling was put in the cavity of the rest of the tooth. I then had surgery to remove both my lower wisdom teeth. During this procedure, the existing temporary filling in the cavity mentioned above was replaced. Since surgery, this temporary filling has fallen out of my tooth, and I have not yet had it replaced. I am booked to travel long haul in a few weeks, and have heard that travelling with an empty cavity can be dangerous owing to cabin pressure . Does this risk present a problem for a tooth with its root nerves removed and filled ? Many thanks for your kind advice. Kind regards, TO","Doctor":"helloyes travelling with a open cavity in mouth can lead to painso what i would suggest that you get a temporary filling done with your dentist and get your root canal completed as soon as possiblein the meanwhile you take the following to reduce infection1.levofloxacin 500 mg twice daily2.anti inflammatory like paracetamol twice daily both for 5 dayshope that helps"},{"Patient":"Sir u can help me how i can relive my Dental pain .","Doctor":"hello there, Dental pain is caused due to several reasons like dental decay , it is a bacterial carious process that infects the dental pulp or the tooth nerve tissue leading to pain and discomfort.

I had a tooth extracted about two weeks ago due to extreme swelling . I have been on two antibiotics since including Clyndamycin and Augmentin and I am curently on Arythmycin. The swelling is actually getting worse and the pain is almost unbearable. The pain has increased on the gumline where the skin meets the gum and the swelling has doubled in the past two days when prior it was going down. Since I have ruled out infection due to the antibiotics, what else could be going on?","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, Since you extracted your tooth due to extreme swelling, means there was severe infection in surrounding tissue & tooth being the main focus of the infection. What so ever  may be the reason, you first need to undergo incision & drainage if the swelling has been from more than two weeks. Remember one important thing, Long term use of Antibiotics drugs without swelling being drained properly with an incision or after extraction, makes that swelling to indurate or become hard ( called as Antibioma ) which then will take more than 3 months approximately to resolve completely. Get an x-ray done by visiting to your dentist to check whether there is any remaining root piece which might get infected & cause swelling & pain. If there is any remaining root piece in the socket, removal of the same would resolve the condition immediately, but if no root piece is there, then ideally incision & drainage should be properly done. For the same reason, you can visit Oral & Maxillofacial surgeon who may help you regarding this issue. Since swelling is doubled in past two days, that clearly means you cant rule out infection due to oral antibiotics. You may need Antibiotics given through intra venous rout which will have faster results in your case. But off course these drugs will be given to you only by your Oral surgeon or dentist.

Often wisdom tooth are impacted in the jaw bone due to which they fail to erupt in straight line axis with the adjacent tooth , they may be horizontal , tilted mesially or distally in the jaw which makes their eruption difficult leading to pain and swelling in the jaw bone. As the area is difficult to clean , the overlying gum or mucosa is more prone to infection and often gets inflammed know as pericoronitis. i suggest you to visit a dentist and get an OPG radiograph done , which will show the exact position of the tooth in the jaw and the related vital structures.

My top Jaw completely overlaps my bottow jaw. None of my teeth interlock, meaning that they do not fit into each other. I have to be honest when I say that I havent been to the dentist in a few years. The last time I went to the orthodontist, they made a mould of my jawline and then called me back because they wanted to give me an x-ray. However, my mother made up her mind and decided she did not want me to have one because she is worried about the amount of radiation that they emit (I personally think she was more concerned about the cost if there was anything wrong). Not even my molars or pre-molars fit into place. Physically whenever I close my mouth my top lip always stick out far over my bottom lip and my face has a sort of camel-like shape (not sure if thats related). Furthermore, when I eat/chew, I tend not to use my incisors of canines much and it is mostly always eating from the side (molars and pre-molars). Im seroiusly considering making a dendist appointment soon. Do you think there is anything wrong with my jaw and do you know what can be done. Thankyou for any help or advice :)","Doctor":"Hello,From the details provided,i assume that you have got a prognathic maxilla causing overlapping of jaws.You must visit an orthodontist and get orthodontic treatment done.If necessary ,orthognathic surgery may be required to correct the jaws.Dental x-rays usually exposes radiation which is to an affordable range by a human body.So,nothing to be worried.Meanwhile,avoid mouth opening too widely and check whether proper lip seal is attained.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have pain on my jaw line which is directly in line with a cavity I have in my tooth do you think is it related ?","Doctor":"Dear friend.Thanks for sharing your concern.Definitely, it is related.The pain due to tooth decay can be experienced in the jaw too.very deep cavities might cause abscess and spread in the alveolar bone causing periapical granuloma there.Therfore please do not ignore and get it examined and treated too.Hope it helps.Thanks.Take care."},{"Patient":"I noticed around a month ago due to stress I believe that I started to get canker sores on the inside of my lips, under my tongue, and on gums.

I have an old injury to my left tmj joint which required an intense reconstructive surgery about 15 years ago.

Because of my condition my endontist was not able to successful get all the root in one of my canals after trying for two hours. He decided to permantly fill the tooth. He gave me 600 mg of ibuprofen and 7.5 by 325 of Vicodin and told me to Alternate them for the inflammation and pain from the procedure and the trauma of the procedure to my ligaments. The pain in my jaw and ligament are less sensitive, but now my gland under my jaw is swollen and is very painful.

You need to go for oral prophylaxis in that case.Also follow certain instructions like:- 1. Floss first then brush your whole mouth including your gums, cheeks, roof of mouth, tongue and take a full 3 minutes brushing your teeth. 2. Sugar free Chewing gum: Since dry-mouth can increase bacterial build-up and cause or worsen bad breath, chewing sugarless gum can help with the production of saliva, and thereby help to reduce bad breath. Chewing may help particularly when the mouth is dry, or when one cannot perform oral hygiene procedures after meals. 3. Gargling right before bedtime with chlorhexidine mouthwash. 4. Maintaining proper oral hygiene, including daily tongue cleaning, brushing, flossing, and periodic visits to dentists and hygienists. Flossing is particularly important in removing rotting food debris and bacterial plaque from between the teeth, especially at the gum line.

He could not find anything visible either through an x-ray or exam. Both of the molars where the pain is have had root canals. He did find a cavity under the gum line on the bottom left and said the pain could be radiating from there. I was referred to a maxillofacial surgeon who pulled the tooth that afternoon.

Sunday night my lower legs became numb and I notice the numbness and tingling is also going into my arms and hands at times.

These ulcers can be due to various reasons like trauma to the tongue by accidental biting it between the teeth.                This may happen due to sharpened edges of the teeth which damages the corners of the tongue thereby producing ulcers on the same sites.                But, you should go for clinical evaluation so as to rule out presence of thrush or oral candidiosis which is a kind of fungal infection & can be treated by the use of Anti fungal drugs which are to be taken as per your dentist's advise.

A vaporizer or inhaling steam from a pan of boiling water (removed from heat) may also help. Warm compresses are useful to relieve pain in the nose and sinuses. Use of  nasal drops or sprays might be effective in controlling symptoms, however, they should not be used beyond their recommended use. Antibiotics or oral steroids may also be used. Other Treatment Options  Addressing potential triggers or contributing factors is a key first step in the management of sinusitis. To reduce congestion due to sinusitis, your doctor may prescribe nasal sprays (some may contain steroid sprays), nose drops, or oral decongestant medicine. If you suffer from severe chronic sinusitis, oral steroids might be prescribed to reduce inflammation --  if other medications have not worked. Antibiotics will be prescribed for any bacterial infection found in the sinuses (antibiotics are not effective against a viral infection). An antihistamine may be recommended for the treatment of allergies. Antifungal medicine may be prescribed for a fungal sinus infection. Immunoglobulin (antibodies) may be given if you have certain immune deficiencies.for all these you have to go through the dentist and for diagnosis of this firstly tap the teeth to see if you have paranasal sinus.some other diagnostic test-mucus culture,nasal endoscopy,x-rays,allergy testing,ct-scan of sinuses or bleed work. thank you( get well soon)."},{"Patient":"I am a healthy 53 year old woman who has just been diagnosed with a Klebsiella/Strep Group B oral infection.

A set of x-rays would help determine if a third molar is the culprit, and also what type of extraction would be necessary.  There is also a slight possibility that you may have capsulitis of the TMJ.

I am now 23. That and i noticed that about two of my lower front teeth had extremely sore gums under them, and they were turning red and inflamed slightly and such.  So i went to the dentist about 4 days ago and they prescribed me an antibiotic called clindamycin and lortabs and motrin 800.  I have been taking the antibiotics as it says on the bottle, every 8 hours.  The motrin as well.  But every day my gums have been getting more painful and spreading to just about the whole left side of my mouth with red sore gums and small white spots that i can easily scrap the white off of and then it looks like a baby ulcer.  I also have to riggid teeth on the left side that need to be surgically extracted (only one is painful) and i continue to rub my tongue across them to check everything out and i believe that is what is leading to the canker sores on my tongue...probably like 6 to 8. It was still in the early stage when i saw the dentist and he didn't make a big deal out of it.  He gave me a refferal to a specialist to have two teeth surgically removed, with a note at the bottom saying to go ahead and check out my wisdom teeth with he is in there.  By the way my back right wisdom tooth is coming in and it is highly irritated by all of this, with really swollen gums surrounding it and the gums seem to be real loose, and also a nice cluster of the little white spots reside on that gum area.

I wondered if you could help.  I've had a temperature for about three weeks now, accompanied by a fairly stiff neck and a throbbing, shooting pain from my neck on the left hand side into the base of my skull, on the left hand side.  The shooting pains happen about three times a minute.  My head feels very heavy and I have a general feeling of tiredness and feeling unwell, a slightly dizzy, underwater feeling, with sensitivity to bright daylight and the light from my computer screen and smartphone.  I thought it might be a tooth infection and I visited my dentist today, who told me that he doubts my symptoms were related to my tooth (which had a root canal treatment), but he's given me Metronidazole to take for 7 days to clear up any possible infection around that tooth, to see if it brings my fever down.  I have a doctor's appointment, but I could only get one in 8 days time.  The pain is really quite intense now and I would have sought help earlier, had I not been away on an acting job, that couldn't be interrupted, due to tight shooting schedules.  Should I wait until my appointment with my GP on 24th May or go to the A&E department of my local hospital, if you think it might need immediate attention?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking the query,The above symptoms which you mentioned can be because of tooth infection, to confirm this you need to take an x-ray, the infected tooth can be treated with root canal treatment.Since you cannot see the Doctor right now i would suggest you to take tab Aceclofenac along with metronidazole and tab paracetomol for fever TDS for three days.Hope this helps out.Regards.."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Restoration with shallow or medium depth cavity usually have less sensitivity. Crackers are sticky substances due to improper bonding between tooth and the restoration creates pressure and sensitivity in the tooth.

Painful after but manageable with ibuprofen.  Have been rinsing with natural antiseptic mouthwash after the first 5 days of salt water rinses.  It is feeling pretty good.  First couple of days had a whistle as I could practically breath through the hole into the area behind my cheekbone area!

Not really painful but still a strange sensation to touch, but I can brush around it ok.  But.. what I'm wanting to check on is that I have been dizzy from the first day. I expected that as a result of what was done to the tooth as well as the pressure on my jaw for an hour (I also have history of TMJ but after braces as a young adult no problem until a couple of months prior to this treatment then have had some clicking again and pain on same side as bad tooth, having to eat on opposite side seemed to aggravate it) Should I still be dizzy after 2 weeks?  Should the hole still be so prominent (hard around rim like it's healing well but very mushy feeling inside hole when I touch it with my tongue)  And how long before the hole should be expected to heal up?  Can I have an infection in jaw or cheek without pain that would be causing dizzyness?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for asking the query, Pain, swelling, dizziness, generalised weakness, are common side effects after tooth extraction. You dont worry about the symptoms as they will subside after somedays. After extraction a course of antibiotics and analgesic is required to prevent infection and promote healing.

A guy punch me in the face around the lower jaw area and blood instantly came from under the lower left canine tooth. I didn't think much of it because the area was not swollen nor painful until three days after the incident. I went to a dentist and they took x rays of the area. They said that the root of my 22nd tooth was fractured from the injury and referred me to a oral surgeon. When I went to the oral surgeon they took a panoramic x ray of my mouth/ jaw and they said from the looks of the x ray that the tooth wasn't fractured but the bone surrounding the tooth was fractured (alveolar bone). They consider the injury to be a green-stick fracture, minor and curable by a soft diet and pain medication. For two weeks straight I experienced unbearable pain. I had a clear, sometimes yellow, discharge coming from under the gums of the 22nd tooth. Furthermore, the lower left side of my jaw was swollen badly! During those two weeks I took my medication and had follow up visits to the oral surgeon because I was afraid that the yellowish/ clear discharge was a sign of an oncoming abscess. They told me that since I had a cut around the inner and outer gums of the canine tooth, that food and debris could be getting trapped with the cut and causing the discharge. From their the oral surgeon put me on an oral rinse called Peridex and took me to complete the course of my medication. Three weeks after the initial fracture date, the swelling begin to decrease and a soft lump begin to form around the lower part of my jaw/ chin area Also, a bump begin to form behind the 22nd tooth. Both formation are painless unless I irritate it. It hurts to chew on both the 22nd and 21st tooth. When you tap both of those teeth, it is sensitive. I have tried to burst the pimple like bump behind the tooth but nothing came out but blood. I applied antiseptic rinse to the area after I popped the bump. Also, I applied hot and cold compresses to the lump on my lower jaw/ chin but nothing seems to relieve the swelling. I research possible answer to my symptoms and some of the results I were given were question. Being that my jaw is fractured, the lump on my lower jaw/ chin area could be a soft callus which is a part of the bone healing process. My biggest fear is that the lower is enclosed pus that is leading to an abscess. I REALLY need someones opinion on this because all of the doctors I have went to have given me different diagnosis.

According to your history i can suspect some remnant of the infected pulp tissue has left unexplored during the root canal procedure or there is a missed canal due to which the infection has gone worse and it has spread to the underlying tissues. Because of the infection you are experiencing pain and discomfort. The infected tooth needs to be explored again for root canal procedure. you need to get an x ray done the affected area to confirm the presence of infection, approach a dentist for the treatment. Antibiotics and analgesics will give you temporary relief , once the tooth is devitalized by root canal procedure all the symptoms willl subside. i hope this helps , take care."},{"Patient":"My gums feel like they are swollen.

You see, for anesthetising a localised area for Dental extractions, LA (local anesthatic) solution, is infiltrated around the nerve supplying that particular area. Now, the Inferior Alveolar Nerve, & the Lingual Nerve, which infact both needed to be anesthetised in you case, lie to close together in the area where they can be accessed to be anesthetised by a syringe's needle, and since the area is quite small, your Lingual Nerve might have been nicked by the needle... Usually, no treatement is required, as the body is nomally able the repair such damages by itself, however, hot fomentation and a short course of vitamin B-complex (particularly vit. B6) should help... If not then steroid therepy may be required, for which you shoul consult your Physician."},{"Patient":"I am a 36 year old male went to a ent and had cat scans done rt maxillary sinus was almost swollen shut.

Recently, after a couple weeks of heavy restricting (I m an anorectic) , I d gotten down to my lowest weight at this height (BMI of 18.6) and then I binged one day, the total was about 800-900 calories but I exercised about 600 off, so I wasn t too worried about getting back on track. I heavily restricted the day after that (two days ago) and I found I had gained 2lb. I was trying not to freak out but ended up binging, which brought that day s total to about 1500. All day (pre-binge) I d been having these strange stomach pains that weren t like normal hunger pangs. It was dull ache that began to get worse and worse, like nothing I d ever felt before. In an attempt to calm myself down after my binge I told myself that those pains would probably go away. ....AND I took some Laxatives. And by some I mean 3 when the recommended dosage is 2. Normally when I take laxatives they take 6hrs to take effect and then my bowels release heavily about three times. It s uncomfortable only right before I, er, poo and then it goes away. But the stomach pains got worse and worse and they were topped with shaking, sweating and nausea . Eventually it got so bad I couldn t sleep. Originally I thought the pain had continued because I d eaten so much, but even with the laxatives, nothing I d eaten since that day had, well, come back out. Yesterday I ate 1200 calories to try and increase my metabolic rate . Today, I m still in immense pain, gained ANOTHER 2 pounds, and I don t know what to do. I ve eaten around 200calories today to see if it was hunger related, but nothing has changed. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? I took a bit of Pepto Bismol around 3:00am that night, some antacids and some beano (gas relief) but nothing helped. Please help.

This tooth has had multiple root canals over the past 25 years, each time with an infection flaring up during the treatment. The gum area swelled and the pain became quite extreme. I saw my dentist and was put on tylenol with codeine. I had to stay on the pain meds while going through consultations with an endodontist and an oral surgeon. I was put on penicillin during that time and was able to wean myself off the pain meds once the antibiotic kicked in and the swelling went down. I decided on extraction and while waiting for my appointment, I finished the antibiotics and the swelling came back, so I was given another round to make sure I had penicillin on board during the extraction. After the extraction, I went back on the pain meds, then off again a couple of days later. Then I got dry socket and was in extreme pain all over again, and had to go back on the tylenol with codeine, since ibuprofen did little to cut the pain. During all this time, I did my best to stretch out the dose of the pain meds, usually taking no more than 2 in a 24 hr period, and a lot of the time only taking it at night before bedtime. But there were times during this period when I had to take a pill every 6 hours with up to 3 per day. Last Friday, I started feeling like I was getting the flu or some other virus. Saturday night I took my last pill. Since then, I've felt really lousy, my symptoms being nausea, bloating, headache, loss of appetite, fatigue and now loose stool, pale in color. I assumed that being on two rounds of penicillin (I finished the second round on Sunday morning), that this may be a normal reaction to so many meds in my system. I have been taking a pro-biotic daily during the past two weeks. But I'm concerned that I'm not rebounding quickly, as I usually do, especially with all the rest, fluids and good eating I'm doing despite my lack of appetite. Should I be worried that the large amount of pain meds I took - as many as 39 pills over 3-4 weeks - has possibly caused any liver damage? Or am I right in thinking my immune system was stressed during this period and I've probably just contracted the flu or another tenacious virus?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking the query,Abdominal upset, nausea, headache is due to the use of antibiotics and analgesics prescribed to you.I would suggest you to stop the use of medications for couple of days.Take complete rest and follow the post extraction instructions given by the Dentist properly.Dry socket is painful condition and it takes a time of two weeks to heal completly, you probably have to visit the Dentist periodically to change the dressing.Take lukewarm saline gargles and antiseptic mouthwash rinses.Maintain a good oral hygiene.Visit the Dentist and get a new prescription of medications, take antacid along with analgesics.Hope this helps out.Regards..."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had maxillofacial surgery done many years ago.

The most common cause of pain from impacted tooth is the inflammation in the soft tissue covering over the offending tooth(Pericoronitis), mostly caused by food impaction in the soft tissue space over the tooth and/or bite injury over the soft tissue covering the impacted tooth, by upper molar tooth. As your third molar has remote possibility to be erupted in the mouth(as cover by bone and no space to be be erupted) the symptom like pain may frequently appear. The Third molar has no function for mastication(chewing) or maintaining occlusion, so it is always better to extract the tooth when it starts causing problem.

The spacing between front teeth is due to high frenal attachment resulting in midline diasthema. In such cases,frenectomy has to be done initially to relieve your frenal attachment. Z-springs along with orthodontic appliances are placed in such cases. To prevent tongue thrusting habit,tongue cribs are given. Without using orthodontic treatment,the defect cannot be corrected. Tongue cribs/z-springs are placed palatally/lingually. Maintain good oral hygiene. Please try to close your mouth properly while sleeping.

My query would be, would it be wise to lightly remove the pus within the swelling - only inside the mouth, with a needle or generally not so?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for choosing healthcaremagic forum. The swelling and pain are usually associated with post extraction of wisdom tooth. Please do visit a dentist for clinical and radiological examination of erupting tooth. If tooth is misplaced,it has to be removed. If there is  adequate space for tooth eruption,flap overlying tooth has to be removed to enhance tooth eruption. Please take complete course of antibiotics too. Gargle frequently using warm saline betadine rinse. Rinse mouth after every meals.

From the details you had produced,its clear that your wisdom tooth is erupting gradually. Your dentist has examined the area,and to enhance tooth eruption the flap overlying tooth can be shaved. So your dentist suggested the option to fasten tooth eruption. Usually this is not a complicated procedure as compared to that of extracting tooth. If the area is painful unbearably,you can get the flap removed. If NOT,FREQUENT WARM saline as well as betadine rinse suffices. Maintain good oral hygiene too. Rinse your mouth after every meals.

WHy?? I dont knoe the reason.. but am also feeling the same.. now i had a thought of taking resolution..for that What i should do first??","Doctor":"Hello & welcome, The gap between Upper Incisors is called as Mid-line diastema in dental language & is mostly seen in those individuals who have Thick Labial frenum. This may occur even with labial frenum with higher attachment between the upper two central incisors. Due to higher attachment, when patient smiles or talks, the labial frenum is stretched which in turn moves the central incisors apart from each other in opposite direction. Another reason for mid-line diastema is having a tongue thrusting habit. Here patient moves the tongue forward against the upper central incisor teeth while swallowing or even talking thereby causing bi-maxillary protrusion. Teeth goes on protruding creating the gap between them due to the pressure applied by the tongue. Periodontal or gingival infection specially in severe condition leads to bone resorption thereby creating the gap between the teeth. If oral hygiene is not maintained properly by the patient, then food & plaque accumulation is associated with gum & periodontal diseases. There is calculus formation on the teeth surface which may harbor the infection involving the periodontal fibers causing the teeth to move apart. Thumb sucking habit in childhood is also responsible for mid-line diaestema. Visit your Orthodontist as soon as possible. He will clinically examine the condition to exactly determine the cause of the gap & treatment will be depending upon the finding. You may have to undergo frenectomy if frenum attachment is thicker or higher in which only braces won't work alone.

Take Care Dr.Sushma Rajesh"},{"Patient":"hi my 19 month old boy started with a fever a week ago which subsided after 2 days then i noticed a foul smell coming from his mouth and i thought he may be teething ,i looked into his mouth and his gums all appeared swollen there were no signs of thrush , i started to brush his teeth and he started to bleed on contact with the brush, this has been going on for three days . i started antibiotics today thinking this may be gingivitis bc of the foul smell swollen gums and bleeding with brushing , on two occasions he has cried and his gums started to bleed during the crying episode .. is this gingivitis ? i have been using chlorhexidine spray and the swelling has settled a little along with the antibiotics, but because of the bleeding i just wanted to make sure i wasnt missing anything","Doctor":"Hello there, Thanks for your query. At the age of 19 months swollen gums are sign of eruption of deciduous/milk teeth,pain is because of pressure exerted by erupting teeth on the gums. Therefore there is no point to get worried. But during this period children more prone to infection,so maintain good oral and general hygiene. Fever may be because of viral infection,so do not give any medicine yourself, consult with a child specialist at the earliest and take a proper treatment. Hope this will be helpful. Take care.

Recently upon having severe pain, I consulted a dentist and after initial examination he took an xray of the affected tooth. It revealed the bottom of the tooth has completely damaged. He gave me antibiotics for five days and advised me root canal is the best solution to save the tooth. I underwent root canal treatment. It is more than two months now after the treatment but still I am having sensitivity and when touch slight movement is there in the tooth. Pus is also appearing in the jaw near the damaged tooth as small bubble. What shall I do, kindly advise me. Thanks, Philip Daniel Abu Dhabi","Doctor":"Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. sometimes some canal remain unexplored ,or by periapical route the infection is introduced into the canal,when incompletely obturated,without apex seal. This leads to reinfection in the canal. It can be very well treated again by opening and reentering the canal. Therfore please visit your dentist with your previous x rays and get yourself evaluated. The small abscess which you have mentioned in the history can also be drained through the opened canal and once when the infection subsides, it can be refilled with new antiseptic material. Meanwhile do warm saline rinses. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am just wondering what caused me to have my tongue to feel tasteless when eating. I think that one of the reasons is that I stuffed toothbrush with toothpaste (mint flavor) for to long as I got distracted by watching the television. Is it possible? And how long will it take for it to go away? It has been more than 20 hours after brushing my teeth yesterday night.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query. The tasteless feeling is due to the prolonged use or contact of toothpaste material on your tongue resulting in numbness. I would suggest you to rinse your mouth thoroughly using warm saline. Use chlorhexidine mouthrinse to gargle. Floss your tongue using tongue scrapers. Usually such numbness lasts for 24 hours only. Please be careful while brushing your teeth,and only a pea-sized amount of toothpaste is usually used for brushing your teeth. Drink plenty of water and fluids. If symptoms persists,please do visit your dentist and get a thorough evaluation done. Also,intake of spicy,salty food has to be limited. Take care."},{"Patient":"What can you tell me about someone who at the age of 24 has a total of 18 teeth, 7 of them they pulled in his eighth grade year that never grew back and were acclaimed to  betheir baby teeth, all accept the front bottom for are either rotted almost to the gum and even past it on some, a front right abscessed tooth where it seems to have just started to build up in the roof of their mouth in a Knott that is obviously painful and possibl fever on right side of head, yellow \\"snott\\" ?   honestly honestly honestly because they had a childhood where they weren't taught to brush correctly or everyday u have to know that fact also","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing, To be frank the hygiene of the mouth is to be graded as poor. This requires an immediate visit to the dentist. Full mouth clinical examination and X-rays have to be taken. First, i want you to know, that teeth can be saved even if they are decayed. There are many procedures which you will be guided to, by your dentist. Second, the infections arising from teeth are immediate concern and have to be treated by a course of antibiotics which your dentist will prescribe. They can even lead to major complications if not looked after on time. Third, as you told in your history some teeth never grew back, they might have been impacted in the bone. If teeth dont erupt on their own, they have to be surgically removed. If not, in some cases they might cause other complications and even develop cysts around themselves. Finally i would like to tell you that an early visit to the dentist can restore the whole dentition for the patient. Present teeth can be saved and crowned, infections cured and missing teeth replaced, to give a whole new set of shining white teeth. Its never too late.

Fever can also normally occur after a stressful procedure, and just as it came down, you will recover with other problems also with time.

Diabetes,hypertension,pregnancy,heart related diseases etc.... can affect the wisdom tooth extraction. You mentioned that you had a baby 14 weeks ago so your baby must be on breast feed,because 6 months after delivery exclusive breast feeding is recommended. This breast feeding may also affect your wisdom tooth extraction,because after extraction antibiotic and analgesic coverage is must to prevent infection of the extraction site and to promote the healing. Antibiotics  and pain killers during pregnancy and during breast feeding is not recommended as it can affect the growth and development of your baby.

I had to use the same regulator yesterday for my certification and this morning my gum has several small, shallow holes where the blisters burst or were rubbed away by the rubber. It is not swollen but it is tender when pressure is exerted. My teeth do not hurt, but under my chin behind the jaw bone is also tender. There is no swelling to speak of. The dive shop puts rented gear in a tank of Mean Green to disinfect everything before renting it out. I called to ask if they had heard of this situation occurring before and no one seems to know anything about this. Thanks for your help!","Doctor":"Hi, Sometimes when there is already bacteria in the teeth and the nerve of the tooth is also irritated then going under pressure like scuba diving or airplane/flight, can lead to pain in that particular tooth. I would recommend you to visit your dentist for the same. The dentist may take an xray to determine if there is a cavity or an old filling that needs to be changed. You maybe given a dosage of antibiotics for the same which will also help with the pain under your chin. The infection in the tooth may be the cause for lymphadenitis ie: infection of lymph nodes which you are feeling behind the jaw bone, under the chin resulting in tenderness. As for the ulcers, rubber regulators can abrade the mucosa and result in ulcers. They will go on their own once you use a betadine mouthwash (not an alcohol based one as it will cause irritation) along with warm saline gargles. Also you should include lots of green leafy vegetables to increase your vitamin intake and body resistance.

I Just go and brush it off in the morning and it doesnt happen again throughout the day so only happens when im sleeping??","Doctor":"Hello Asma, Bleeding gums can be a sign that you are at risk for, or already have, gum disease. However, persistent gum bleeding may be due to serious medical conditions such as leukemia and bleeding and platelet disorders. Bleeding gums are mainly due to inadequate plaque removal from the teeth at the gum line. This will lead to a condition called gingivitis, or inflamed gums. If plaque is not removed through regular brushing and dental appointments, it will harden into what is known as tartar. Ultimately, this will lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and jawbone disease known as periodontitis. Other causes are Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, scurvy, leukemia, Vitamin k deficiency. What to do now, practice night hygiene before sleeping and avoid eating too late in the night. Brush twice daily. Consult a dentist and/or a hematologist. Hope this helps and wish you the best"},{"Patient":"sometimes after i eat i get severe abdominal pain and cant use the bathroom ...the pain lasts for abt and hour or two until i can go then the pain finally goes a way...whats wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi.

I visited dentist few times and no help. I guess they are not able to understand exact problem and try to clean teeth’s every time. 2. The bad breath is severe when I have dry mouth , no talking/speaking with anyone while watching TV, enclosed areas (like car, meeting rooms etc.) 3. I feel nausea/vomiting during dentist visits when they ask to open my mouth for few minutes. But in few seconds I feel nausea. 4. From last two/three months, I get yellow tongue when I get up in the morning. 5. I have abnormal stools (sometimes colored stools) and sometimes anus burning. Most of times, my wife complain about bad smell after my stools. I don’t have any problem with my weight which is consistent 140 lbs from years. After reading various topics on Internet, I am now little worried whether I have some disease.

It can range from simple things like not drinking enough water to having Gastrointestinal problems. Having bad oral hygiene like having tartar which leads to many gum diseases like periodontitis or having decayed tooth also causes bad breath. Systemic disease like diabetes also causes bad breath. You need to see a dentist who will asses your condition and advise treatment accordingly.Discolouration of teeth are of two types, intrinsic[ inside] or extrinsic [outside]. Intrinsic stains such as tetracycline or fluoride are not related to bad breath .In order to correct these you can undergo bleaching or whitening of your teeth. Specialised treatment procedures like laminates or crowns may help in masking tough stains.Extrinsic stains are those caused due to tartar, pan chewing, cavities, etc. which can be related to bad breath.

I had surgery two weeks ago, and got a long cut (more like a long, deep gouge) along one of the mandibular tori from being intubated. The cut has slowly been healing with white granulating tissue being replaced with pink gum tissue, though it has not completely healed yet. I've been trying not to chew on that side, as eating irritates the cut. My jaw has been aching on that side the last couple of days. I went back to work recently and have to talk a lot (customer service), and I wondered if that has made the gum and jaw swollen. My bite feels a bit off on that side and the teeth ache if I apply pressure, though were not damaged as far as I can tell. I've been trying salt water rinses and a topical anesthetic for canker sores, and taking ibuprofen for the pain. Should I be concerned about the jaw ache?

I have had zero trouble out of this tooth until recently.  About a month ago I noticed that the crown felt loose and if I press straight up on the crown with my tongue, It feels like it is moving up (ever so slightly).  This tooth has not had a root canal and when I have seen x-rays of the tooth since then, I notice what looks like a tiny metal rod that goes down into what tooth was left.  I assume this was because there wasn't much tooth remaining after removing the filling material.

I have no swelling on my face and I have had a bad infection before so I realise it is no where as painful as that. Have you any idea what it could be? Laura","Doctor":"hi Laura thanks for asking your query swollen gums could be of multiple reasons like inflamation,infection,local irritant,trauma,food impaction,poor nutrition the best treatment for swollen gums is the removal of plaque and tartar Practice good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth twice a day and floss daily. Visit your dentist regularly and ask for tips to improve your technique. Over enthusiastic brushing and flossing can do more harm than good, leading to swollen bleeding gums. Eat well. A well-balanced diet, including plenty of vitamin C and calcium, may reduce the likelihood of developing red swollen gums. And drinking plenty of water helps remove food particles from your teeth after a meal. Avoid things that irritate the gums. Swollen sore gums may be aggravated by mouthwashes, alcohol and tobacco. Choose lukewarm or cool food and beverages instead of extremely hot ones that can be painful if you're nursing red swollen gums. Relax. Stress isn't just bad for your overall health, it can also lead to swollen sore gums. Being stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol, which leads to inflammation throughout the body -- even in your gum hope this will help thanks"},{"Patient":"I had my right molar removed over two months ago, the very last molar.

Everything has been fine but I have notice since the day of extraction that part of my gum is pushed outward toward my cheek and lip. When I look further you can see something hard and white pushing it out. I don't know if it is a bone or part of tooth that didn't come out. I know the dentist broke my tooth in half when pulling it but afterwards seeing the tooth it looked as if everything was there. Just wondering if it will heal on its own or if I need to go back to get it checked out.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to HCM, Thanks for writing to us. It's your dentist's obligation to help you throughout your extraction's healing process. So, if you prefer, you might request that they evaluate and treat your situation. Providing this type of treatment is usually quite easy for your dentist. After all, they'll be able to visualize the situation better than you and, of course, they have more experience and the proper tools. In some instances, they may feel that they must \\"numb you up\\" before they can remove the protruding fragment. And, in more involved cases, the removal process might include some type of minor surgical procedure (such as incising the gum tissue and reflecting it back so the fragment can be visualized and accessed more easily). Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health... Regards."},{"Patient":"Upper gastric pain, right greater than left. Under lower ribs. Have IBS. Had colonectomies. Just getting over IBS attack. Ate wrong food last evening (I normally rest from solids a bit before I eat most foods), but I goofed. I even had chicken last night! Today I have pain across the area just under ribs, mainly on right.side. Had colonectomy x2 a few years back for necrosis due to surgeon error a while before that. I am a bit more touchy what with FMS/IBS so just wanted to know about pain that feels more like IBS than anything else I can think of. I had a lot of pain for about three days starting last Thursday (three days ago approximately). I m fairly sure this is IBS due to eating on top of an already sore gut . I also have a diagnosed hiatal hernia . I do very well IF I watch what I eat and try to control stress. Just need a bit of assurance. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. Pain in IBS is generally caused due to bloating. The most commonly affected function in these diseases is transportation. In the stomach and small intestine, the symptoms of slowed transportation are nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating (the sensation of abdominal fullness), and abdominal distention (enlargement). The symptom of rapid transportation usually is diarrhea. In case you are suffering from severe pain in the right hypochondriac region then i would suggest you to consult a surgeon so that gall bladder involvement can be ruled out."},{"Patient":"I was put on Amox a little over a week ago for a possible tooth infection - a tooth which needed to be extracted.  After about 6 days on the Amox, I developed swollen lymph nodes on the back of my neck and just inside my hairline above my neck, both on the same side of my head as my problem tooth.  My dentist said we should go ahead and extract the tooth, but go ahead and finish the course of the Amox.  I had the tooth pulled 2 days ago, and I am having extreme ear pain and now a rash around the swollen lymph nodes.  I am taking 600-800 mg of Advil every 4 hours to try to alleviate the pain.

Last year it had been nearly 18 years. They were amazed I did not have even worse problems. I was able to afford half the work I needed at the time which was 4 fillings. I had a tooth that had been worked on and after about a month developed a large infection. Face totally swelled up.  Went back and they had to cut into the gum to drain. She had removed the filling and refilled it. She never mentioned to me the need to come back in the near future. About a month later I was eating a baked potato chip and part of the tooth broke off and part of the filling came out. Months later I began to notice a foul smell in my mouth and noticed the rest of the filling was loose. I tugged it out and out came a bunch of cotton stuffing that was yellow and disgusting smelling. The filling was also this porous white material which smelt just awful as well.  I've had this huge hole in my tooth for over a year now. No problems with it as I make sure to clean it out after every eating. I don't understand if that was a normal filling or what the dentist had planned for the tooth.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for asking the query, According to your history i suspect that a temporary filling with a medicated piece of cotton was given to you which came out.

I can literally scrap layers of gooey blood from my cheeks, teeth or inside my mouth anywhere. This has been a recent development. Started about 3 weeks ago with a sudden on set of fever. My teeth and mouth ached so badly I think I would have rather pulled them out. I assumed it was an infection and used antibacterial mouth wash to no avail(prescribed post wisdom tooth removal Jan 2012) . I am also noticing hard bumps at the base of my gum line mostly above my upper front, top teeth. I had the four quadrant gum cleaning a year ago (with wisdom teeth removal) and dentist says gum health is improving. My concern is the sudden onset. Prior to the quadrant gum cleaning I never experience this. I am not sue where to start as this is not just a little bit of blood. Its is dark gooey copious amounts every night and bleeding throughout the most of the day is occurring as well. I have a history of fibromyalgia (based on lack of factual evidence indicating a more finite diagnosis - not convinced as I feel it is a catch all). PC thinks sjogrens or RA will eventually be the diagnosis, but no SSa or SSb antibodies were detected during the parotid and minor salivary gland biopsy. Nor have any antibodies confirmed a diagnosis. I am in no hurry to have an ailment! However the bloody bloody mouth is concerning. My blood work is never normal and the bloody mouth is really concerning me. However my experience with doctors deters any seeking of advice. I addressed this with my PC on Friday and he seemed like it was normal. while addressing the white nodules forming on my gums. What can cause this? Sudden onset and with high fever (norm 97F. was 103f lasting abut 48hrs but gum pain continues and bloody mouth upon waking is what I am left with. Yet another symptom. I was similar to flu symptoms but obviously not such. Aching in my hips and legs along with wanting to rip my teeth out did not quite equate flu. I do have mild stenosis central spinal canal (C-5) along with osteophyte complexes-which also has never been addressed nor did anyone take the time to discuss the results. All is written of to chronic inflammation (in Dr lingo-i made it up)! Severe gastroparesis has also been diagnosed. Not slowed digestion but lack of. Severe dry eye and skin as well. Last but not least is the diagnosis for amenorrhea (cerebral originating at the pituitary gland) So freddy cougar bloody mouth upon waking, persistent now for a few weeks with hard noduals forming?I have suffered from gingivitis and nothing like this has ever occurred, and again the random onset is what is worrying me.

My bottom right wisdom came in last month was causing a lot of pain. I went to the doctor (dentist was closed) and she told me I had an infection and I needed to get these removed ASAP. She gave me a prescription for clindamycin. I took this 4 times a day for 7 days. After the second day (10 pills in) I started to have weird side effects, such as problems swallowing and notice some discoloration on my tongue. I went back to the doctor and she told me I had Oral Thrush and was given a prescription nystatin and needed probiotics. I did this and everything cleared up. Fast forward two weeks: I got all four wisdom teeth removed. I was given a prescription of azithromycin and a methylprednisolone pack. I also was informed to rinse my mouth out with warm salt water. On the last day of the antibiotic (day 5) I noticed a weird taste and that same discoloration on my tongue. I'm also taking ortho tri cyclen (birth control) and I have been on it for almost 7 years. I have about half of the nystatin and the probiotics (yogurt) left. I'm currently taking these again. I was informed by my mom I used to get Oral Thrush when I was younger since I was always on strong antibiotics, I'm allergic to all the \\"typical ones\\". After this long amount of information here is my question(s) (finally, sorry): - I know strong antibiotics/corticosteroids/birth control can cause Oral Thrush but is it this common to get it back to back? - Should I be worried I am getting Oral Thrush?

There is nothing to worry for getting it again as you might not have taken proper course of anti fungals earlier. The only point I want to make is that sometimes an underlying medical problem can also cause repeated occurence of thrush,like HIV infection,uncontrolled diabetes etc. You can repeat your anti fungal treatment again and should definitely inform your dentist,once he comes back.

Thanks for sharing your concern. your history suggests that you are worried about the complication,faced post extraction of third molars.

Since, presently you have no symptoms,please do warm saline rinses after food gently and observe for two more days. If the tooth ache persists then you can revisit your dentist for evaluation else no need.

It doesn't hurt to touch and isn't bleeding...it's smooth and doesn't stick out from the rest of my gums. I am worried though, because it is directly above a tooth that I had injured 4 years ago along with my left central incisor. Both of these teeth were shoved back to the roof of my mouth after accidentally running into someone's skull while playing capture the flag. The teeth stayed in tact and my dentist simply numbed my mouth and put the teeth back in place by using his two fingers and blotting it...after they were set in place, he placed an invisalign across my top 4 front teeth for about 2 months. I can still feel hot and cold with those two teeth, it's a little dull but I can still feel it. So all in all...red spot on gum right above the left lateral tooth, no pain or bleeding, just noticed it this morning, have had an injury on this tooth in the past but haven't had any problems with it in the past 4 years. I am incredibly nervous...","Doctor":"Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. Also thanks for giving complete history.I would like to explain you that according to the history given,it appears as though your lateral incisor is non vital and has developed periapical abscess. But since you have mentioned in your history that  there is no associated pain or swelling and also you can feel the sensation there, then definitely it could be a lesion due gum infection also. There is only two possibility here. Either it is a gum infection causing redness there due to pocket or the second and most likely reason being the tooth has turned non vital upon receiving the blow directly or indirectly. Therefore please make a visit to your dentist and a simple clinical evaluation along with an x ray will confirm the diagnosis. meanwhile you can do warm saline rinses. Hope it helps. Thanks.

I eat grains for lunch with vegetables and a protein for dinner with vegetables. In between I eat fruit and yogurt as snacks. I eat two eggs for breakfast with some salt added (but that is the only time I use salt). I think that I might be ingesting too much sodium. The vegetables I eat always come from cans.

He has indicated that I would need to do root canal treatment for both the affected teeth.He prescribed an antibiotic and a painkiller: Amoclan Forte 625mg (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid - 1 tablet twice daily for 5 days; Dolgit 400 (Ibuprofen 400mg) - 1 tablet twice daily for 5 days, if I the pain exists). He asked me to come bad for the next visit after completing the course for five days.I have completed the five days of medication. My next visit to the dentist is due today.My questions are:(1) Do I really need root canal treatment? How can I be sure? Are there any alternative treatments?(2) I have been told that I will need to come for two visits. Does root canal treatment take multiple visits? Can it be done in one visit? What all steps does it involve?(3) Is it possible that commercial reasons may have prompted the dentist to recommend root canal treatment instead of an alternative treatment that may cost much less?(4) I was told that if I delayed the root canal treatment, the infection would get worse. Is that right? I live in the UAE, and I would be on a visit to India two months later. Medical costs are much lower in India than in the UAE. Would it be okay if I postponed the root canal treatment, so that I can do it in India.(5) How much of an emergency is root canal treatment? Does it need immediate attention? After this course of medication that I have already been through, in case the pain does not occur again, then will it be okay if I saw a dentist in India and then take action as required - whether a root canal treatment or any other treatment?Look forward to your response. Many thanks.Regards,Arun Joshi","Doctor":"Hello, Requirement of root canal treatment can be decided only after examining your oral cavity. If the tooth is decayed and it has involved the pulp it should be root canal treated. Root canal treatment usually takes 3 sitting but now there is single sitting RCT which can be done if the tooth is not infected. Since the cost of RCT is higher in UAE you can get it done at a cheaper cost in India. You can use Colgate Prorelief tooth paste for sensitivity. It gives quick relief.

They aren't sore so they don't hurt me at all, but if I lick along the inner sides of my mouth I can feel them there - they feel kind of like scars but that's not what I think they are. If I stick my finger in and scratch/rub at them a little to see if they can come off a bit of white stuff comes off with them? They've been there for about a week now or at least that's as long as since I've noticed..Do you know what they are?","Doctor":"Hello, The problem you are having is due to chronic irritation of the cheeks by the occlusion of your teeth.

The X-ray showed the usual bone loss under each root of the molar.  The endodontist performed a root canal that day.

I was put in 4x 300mb Clindamycin and I am in day 6 of this.  In the past 3 nights, I have had full body night sweats on the 1st and 3rd nights.  The swelling is very reduced, but I have never had this type of night sweat before.

About a hour and a half after I started getting really bad hunger pains,  they fell intense, slight burning feeling,  and  I eat something it only just seems to calm it down but never goes away.

The tooth itself is hollow, it looks as if the hanging bit of gums came from inside the tooth. Will the hanging gums go away or is there a chance the roots of the tooth are still inside? Do I need to take her to the dentist?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for aksing the query, There is nothing serious about this, there is exfoliation of primary tooth and erruption of permanent tooth due to which there can be a piece of loose gum hanging. As the permanent tooth is not fully errupted, it will disappear when the tooth will fully errupt. The age of your child is six, so there you can see the errrupting permanent tooth from inside which is not the roots of primary tooth. The roots of primary tooth undergoes physiological resorption during its exfoliation. Do not worry, maintain a good oral hygiene. Hope this helps out. Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi. As of the last few weeks, I ve been having a problem with my teeth becoming very cold sensitive. This is becoming worse everyday. At first it was just the teeth. Now I have electrical sensations in my teeth and my gums - left and right, upper and lower. ALL my teeth are effected. I have not noticed any kind of changes with my teeth or my gums at all before or during this whole time frame. I can push on my teeth, push on my gums, or bite down hard - and no pain. So it does not appear to be a dental problem. It seems to me the nerves in my gums leading to my teeth have suddenly become over active. What could have caused this? By the way I am a 47-year-old white male.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to hcm, Sensitivity of teeth may be due to-Regressive changes like attrition,abrasion or erosion of teeth.

As a result I have resorted to taking senokot liquid 10mls every night but not sure if this is sustainable but the odour has gone.
