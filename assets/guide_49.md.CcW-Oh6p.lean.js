I am a female, 18, of a healthy weight as I am very sporty. I woke up at 3 this morning due to discomfort in my throat, yet no actual pain. I also had a headache. Upon waking up again for the second time, I realized that on the right-hand side of my throat, my gland was very swollen, yet still feel no pain. I am not aware that whether I have an infection with no cold and due to feeling no pain, no sore throat. My neck, however, is tender when touched or turning my head or facing upwards. My cheeks have been very red and I have had very short breath all day. The gland is noticeably bigger than the left, and when I look in my mouth it almost looks like there are two glands there, instead of one, on the right-hand side. The gland is noticeable and visible when just looking at my neck also, despite not being too skinny and having quite a chubby neck and face. There is only pain when touched, and only slight discomfort when swallowing food or water. My voice sounds a bit hoarse sometimes.","Doctor":"Hi. Lymph nodes (glands) are located in many areas all around the body, including numerous nodes in the neck and jaw area. Lymph nodes typically swell or enlarge when there is an infection close by to their drainage area as they form an important part of the bodies immune response by storing immune cells. Enlarged or painful nodes are thus often a sign that one has an infection in the area. From the symptoms, you describe some of the most likely possibilities are: 1. Tonsilitis (infection of the tonsillar glands at the back of the throat). Tonsillitis is quite common and often requires treatment with antibiotics so that the infection does not spread down the airway causing pneumonia. 2. Mumps (viral infection of the parotid gland). Mumps is most commonly caused by a virus and is treated symptomatically and monitored for complications. 3. Other bacterial or viral infection, most likely of your upper airway that might be spreading down your airway. I would strongly advise that you consult with a trusted physician so that he or she can examine you clinically and confirm or exclude any of the above and treat accordingly to prevent complications. Once treated, the glands typically return to normal within a few days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a best friend who suffers from anxiety and I saw her almost dying today because of a panic attack she had. All her life she thought she had a problem with her heart but she went to see a doctor and he said she is in perfect health. She starts shaking and cannot breathe and I am really scared and try to calm her down but she cannot breathe. She cannot stop shaking for at least half an hour. I do not know what to do and I hope you can tell me.","Doctor":"Hello. Panic attacks related to anxiety can be a scary experience. But remember it is not a life-threatening experience. You can encourage your friend to seek professional support to manage her panic attacks and anxiety. She will need a complete assessment following which talking therapy and medication can be prescribed. Meanwhile, she can try progressive muscle relaxation exercises and deep breathing techniques to help reduce her stress levels. You can contact us again if further advice is needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, At night time while sleeping, the nasal passage of mine gets blocked. This results in the stuffy nose in the morning once I get up in the morning and I had to continuously sneeze for a long time in the morning hours. Whenever I take Cetrizine, or Levocetirizine, or L-Montas tablets at night time I get relief from this problem. But consumption of this tablet makes me feel sleepy, and drowsy throughout the day time. Please help. I am currently on Glycomet-HS 1000 and Nexpro-40.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  As per your symptoms of nasal congestion and sneezing you are likely to be suffering from allergic rhinitis. One thing that is prime importance is avoidance of allergens. Then there is also the role of steroids. Since you are diabetic, systemic steroids are better avoided. However topical steroid sprays can be used safely. Are you using any steroid nasal sprays?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

From the last three years, I am facing an allergy in which I face difficulty in breathing, coughing, and sound produces while breathing. The problem increases at night and I wake up near 4 to 5 times during my sleep and sit for a while. This is my fourth year when I am again facing this problem. This problem arises usually in March and April and does not disturb in other months. When I faced this problem the first time, I consulted a physician who gave me five tablets of Asthalin (one for each day) and a cough syrup. It gave me relief. But last year, when I took the same Asthalin and cough syrup, it did not work. So my parents took me to another doctor in the city who gave me Leephylline 200 mg tablets for five days. He said that it is just an allergy which will go by itself after 18 years. He told me not to drink cold water, curd, rice, etc., when the season changes. This year I again faced the same problem but I did not drink cold water when the season changed this year. This year that doctor got transferred to another city. And when I went to buy Leephylline tablet, the chemist said that it is not coming. He gave me tablet Allegra M as its substituent. This tablet did not work. Then I went to consult a doctor who prescribed Cefixime dispersible 200 mg tablets. It also did not work. I want to ask that what is the reason behind my allergy? Why it occurs? Can you prescribe me a right tablet for my problem? Please give me advice what to do to get relief permanently from this problem.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be suffering from airway hyperreactivity disorder, the common colloquial term being an allergy. This occurs because your respiratory pathway is more sensitive to some day to day substances which others are able to tolerate without any problem. When such a situation occurs it can present with wheezing, breathing trouble, chest heaviness, sneezing, running nose, itching, sinus headache, disturbed sleep and day time sleepiness. One must be careful regarding seasons. If the allergy is occurring during some particular season then it must be due to some particular pollen. The substitute the pharmacist has given and the one the new doctor has given are all different. You need medicine to dilate your respiratory pathways. You need Asthalin inhaler of strength 100 mg and Seroflo inhaler of strength 250. For details regarding how to use these inhalers and how to avoid allergies in the future, you can revert back to me. But when you revert please give us details as to whether the breathlessness occurs throughout the day or only in the night, when it increases with physical exertion, whether it causes fever, headache, running nose, sneezing, etc. With the right advice, precautions, and allergy management protocol, you will be good soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 54 years old, female. I am having no fat loss at all. Even after excercise and proper diet plan. I am taking medication (inhaler) for asthma, nasal spray, and vaccines for allergy and Thyroxine for thyroid.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your query. Common medical conditions that can lead to weight gain in spite of proper diet and exercise are thyroid disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome and Cushing's syndrome and certain medicines. Since you are on Thyroxine and your thyroid is under control then thyroid is not causing weight gain. PCOS is not encountered at your age group generally. Cushing syndrome causes hormonal imbalance leading to weight gain and a few other symptoms. You can be investigated on the lines of Cushing syndrome which includes 24-hour urinary free cortisol test, midnight plasma cortisol, and late-night salivary cortisol measurements and low-dose Dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST). So, I would advise you to discuss with your treating doctor on these guidelines."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,","Doctor":"Hello. Do you have leakage when you feel to urinate?

It is about 3 cm in length and approximately 2 cm wide. It is very painful especially when walking.","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like you have a cyst. These cysts are nothing but swellings filled with fluid or some other materials usually secretion of glands. By looking at the history it looks like you have a Bartholin's cyst which usually occurs inside the vagina where Bartholin glands are present. Usually, they are small and painless. When they grow bigger, in your case, it causes pain and discomfort while walking or during sex. If it is very painful, probably cyst is infected with pus collected inside it. Do not be shy. Visit your gynecologist at the earliest before it gets worse. Your gynecologist will suggest you the best treatment possible by local examination. Cysts which are so big warrant surgical removal."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18 year old male. I am obese with weight more than 130 kg. I got plenty of tests done in a single year.

Now I am scared to go and meet a doctor. I am absolutely worried about getting cancer because I had received a very great amount of radiation with repeated scans and x-rays. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. X-ray and CT scan uses ionizing radiation. Though these are harmful rays, in diagnostic radiology it is generally safe for the patients. Though you have undergone many investigations it is well below the maximum allowable safe dose for the patient. Amount of radiation delivered to the patient varies with the organ for which imaging is done like an x-ray of L/S (lumbosacral) spine causes maximum radiation during an x-ray. It depends on the voltage and milliampere used during taking x-rays. Please do not worry about radiation hazard; the total added dose is far below the maximum allowable dose. There is almost no chance of cancer due to radiation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I started going to the gym a few days ago. Comparatively, I am taking good diet now. But, my belly fat is increasing.

Add in 100 gm salad and a small cup of two fruits like one citrus and the other fibrous.

But the good news to you is that the symptoms are resolving and getting better with medications. So, it is not proper cancer yet, just infection which is recovering. Now make a promise to yourself that you will not have gutkha, pan, chalia for your entire life and will not put yourself in trouble of cancer as it is horrible to deal with. This is the permanent solution to it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an allergic reaction to Doxycycline and broke out with hives and skin rashes. What can I do to clear it up?","Doctor":"Hi. The presented photograph is not hives (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is chronic dermatitis. It has nothing to do with Doxycycline. You need a medium potency Corticosteroid cream like Betamethasone valerate 1 % twice daily for two weeks with an anti-allergic tablet like Loratidine 10 mg once daily for 10 days. Hives are different. They appear reddish and appear and disappear. In that case, you need same anti-allergic tablet mentioned above plus Calamine lotion. If it is severe, you need to see a GP. It requires injectable medications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently started running (treadmill), but after a week or so, I found that my knees were really hurting. I continued thinking it was muscular, but it got to the point at which I was in a lot of pain. I stopped running and it has taken three weeks for my knees to feel almost normal. I had extreme pain behind the outside of my right knee, making it difficult to bend, and pain on the inside of both knees, which still feel bruised to touch, as well as at the top of both the calf. I have long legs and my feet lean inwards. Could this be what caused the problems? My concern is that if I start running again, the same thing will happen. I do not want to train for two weeks and then have to take three weeks off due to being almost unable to walk. I wondered if perhaps some people just really really should not run, and that there is alternative cardio I should do? Just as a note, I have been doing resistance training for a year and so I assumed that my leg muscles were quite strong.","Doctor":"Hello. The pain what you described could be due to an iliotibial band (ITB) friction caused due to tight gluteus muscles. Because of running, no proper warming up or fatigue. Please do not worry, it is a commonly encountered situation in runners and is completely solvable. I would recommend you to do icing frequently over the painful area. Stretch your gluteus, calf, and hamstrings. Roll an iced bottle over the outer side of your thigh and over the butt, the outer part of your hamstrings, and calf. Kindly revert back after two days to let me know the status of the pain. Do proper warming up before running. Good footwear will help to reduce such issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from premature ejaculation problem. It happens under 15 seconds.

With repeated practice of intercourse, it will be cured. If no improvement, then you can take help of psychiatrist or sexologist. Fluoxetine like drug can be prescribed in such case.

Behavioral counseling also can be done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had questions about birth control. If I take a contraceptive, will it be okay for me to have unprotected sex with my partner? And will it cause any complications in the future if we are ready to have a baby?","Doctor":"Hi. If you have been on contraceptives then your body would have got used to this. Most of the contraceptive methods are hormonal and all having short and long term side effects and differs in every Individual a bit. If contraceptives are taken regularly as per advised with proper timings and dosage without vomitings, then you will have protection as you required. Any contraceptives long term use can definitely give side effects like unscheduled bleeding, acne, migraine, breast and endometrial cancer, stroke, clot formation, etc. All side effects cannot occur in a single individual but that occur for which person hasa tendency and genetic history, etc. You can have sex along with proper contraceptives with or without condoms. But try to change contraceptives frequently or some time contraceptives free period to avoid side effects. Have regular contraceptives with condoms to have complete protection. Change contraceptives frequently to avoid side effects."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Till four days ago, I used to get beautiful skin whenever I applied random facewashes or moisturizer or any other nourishing cream on my face for a few days due to the placebo effect. After a few days, my skin used to become dull again. This effect on my face skin took years to develop. Now, four years back, I stopped applying anything on the face. So, the face skin stopped reacting to any cream from then. Now the skin is like when I feel attractive or I get compliments about my face, only then I get glowing skin for a few days, otherwise, it is dull.

Just based on your history, I can prescribe you the following remedies. 1.

I have been experiencing panics especially when I do not feel better like having acid reflux. Now the gastrointestinal issue becomes regular. The only means to stop it is by drinking alcohol during night time and I feel better and get a good sleep. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I suggest you to take once a day pill for controlling your acid reflux. Capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals. You can take it in the morning time before breakfast or before dinner if you have predominant night symptoms. This acid suppressant will control the symptoms of acid reflux and acidic related stomach pain. You can take it regularly for two weeks then take it intermittently whenever you need this. This medications does not have significant long terms adverse effects.  Well, I also want that you should know that, moderate alcohol intake is fine which means maximum of three drinks per day.

This ECG (electrocardiography) was taken a few months before that. I have had fatigue, hair loss, stomach cramps, and dizziness for a while. I have had some trouble with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. After being resuscitated my serum potassium was 2.7mmol/l. They tried to fix that by giving me potassium solutions. The solutions did not really work though because of low magnesium. I am currently on Bisoprolol accord 2.5 mg, Xarelto 20 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear about your health condition. This is extremely strange that at 25 years of age you suffered a cardiac arrest. Have you had problems with hypokalaemia before the attack? Where you on diuretics?

Or was it after the attack?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 19-year-old female. I had my wisdom teeth taken out about four days ago, and now the gum behind where the wisdom tooth used to be is very swollen and causing pain.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. Pain after the extraction is normal and that too for the wisdom tooth which often requires surgical intervention. However, if the pain is still present after four days (provided the extraction did not require any major surgery), it might be due to the infection of the extraction site which is often called as dry socket. Dry socket is associated with the severe pain in the extraction site and also a fetid odor of the mouth. It is also characterised by the inability to wide open the mouth properly. If you have these symptoms, then it is the case of dry socket. In that case, I would suggest you to have a visit to your dentist who extracted your wisdom tooth and get the wound cleaned up properly along with the medications. Meanwhile continue the post-extraction instructions that your dentist must have given to you like do not suck on the liquids or using a pipe to drink liquid or beverages, slight talking, etc. In case of the pain (if you have severe pain) I would advise you to disperse two tablets of Ketorol DT in the glass of water and then drink it (after visiting your drug history and only if you do not have any drug allergy). Just take Ketorol DT only once as they are very potent and repeated use of them might cause some side effects. However, if you have bearable pain and not the above symptoms then it is the case of regular post extraction pain and swelling. You continue the medication that your dentist has given to you for three more days. For swelling, you can use normal saline mouth rinses but rinse the mouth very gently as rigorous swish might dislocate the clot over the wound and may cause pain. Also, avoid touching the surface with your finger and tongue. Maintain good oral hygiene, brush twice daily and floss regularly with regular mouth rinses."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I got a red rash near the tip of the penis. The doctor told me to use Mupirocin T-bact, I started applying once a day and it has been 10 days. I want to know how much time it can take for a complete cure?","Doctor":"Hi. Mupirocin is a topical antibiotic. It has to be used twice a day for two weeks for infectious conditions like impetigo. Also, it depends on the extent of involvement and severity. Since I have not seen the rash, I cannot really tell you how much time it can take to heal the rash. Please attach your clinical picture so that I can see and make a diagnosis that helps me to comment further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The gums where my wisdom tooth is present is in pain.","Doctor":"Hi. What is your age? Wisdom tooth gets erupted in ages between 19 to 30. They put eruption pressure after every three weeks or so. If its position is not vertical or they are tilted or are impacted in bone, they start causing severe pain. For it the first line of treatment is taking medications. This will subside eruption pain. The second line of treatment is if it is not getting better with medicines you should get it extracted so that it may not bother surrounding tissues and tooth. Meanwhile, take tablet Brufen 400 mg eight hourly for three days. Give me followup after three days. If pain will persist, then you will be prescribed antibiotics. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband and I had intercourse on the 25th night and the tip of his penis started bleeding during this.

Is circumcision necessary now? Is there any ointment or cream to stop the bleeding if he inserts again? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. From what you say, it is likely that your husband is suffering from coitus related frenular tear. No ointment can cure or prevent recurrence of the same. A minor procedure like frenuloplasty is still associated with recurrence. Ideally, circumcision and 6 to 8 weeks abstinence are the best treatment options.

Glutathione is a natural product and for maximum efficacy, it is given intravenously. However, it is impractical to get intravenous every day hence oral Glutathione is given widely. Ideally, it is given 500 mg twice daily but 1000 mg per day can also be given along with Vitamin C. The side-effects are minimal when taken orally.

I read your query with due interest and understand your concerns. Low sex drive is a common symptom of a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders. Before I speculate anything about it I need you to answer a few questions in detail. Once you answer the above questions it will be helpful to suggest the appropriate measures."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a TB test done at 9:30 AM yesterday and it is now 7:30 PM. The area is itchy, swollen with a red ring around it. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi.  I believe that you have undertaken the Mantoux skin test. There is likely to be an initial inflammatory reaction to the tuberculous killed bacillus which can form the ring and itch slightly. You may apply an emollient over it. This test is to be studied after 48 hours for results where if the induration is more than 10 mm in diameter then the test is positive and the patient is said to be susceptible to tuberculosis. Then is followed by ADA (Adenosine deaminase) and/or MTB-PCR (Mycobacterium tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm the diagnosis further."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24 year old male. I am working as a software developer. Sometimes, I feel a sharp pain in my right lower part of the stomach. When I am trying to bend down, I am feeling some pain inside the pelvic bone. After eating meals and dinner, I am getting excess burping and feeling of bloating and tightness in the right lower abdomen. I am also having constipation problem for more than a year. I have consulted a gastroenterologist for physical evaluation. He diagnosed me and prescribed some medicines. After some time, I had an endoscopy and he found I have H.pylori infection. He prescribed medicine for the same. After a month, bloating and burping are less but the pain still persists. I have consulted one more gastroenterologist who evaluated me with some blood test and ultrasound of the whole abdomen and said nothing to worry as everything is normal in my report (including pancreas and kidney).  Now again from last three to four days, I feel my urine flow is slow and I have a burning sensation in the penis. I have excess burping, bloating, and pain in the right chest. As I have consulted many doctors and they reported as I have nothing, I am confused with my stomach pain now and much worried as what could be the factor behind the pain? What should I do now? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your history. As per your description, it seems to be a functional bowel disorder, it may be associated with what called as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Bowel illnesses are difficult to prove medically, and mostly they are a matter of exclusion. Infection like H.pylori may be the reason for your burping, but it would not be the cause for right lower abdominal pain. After reading all this do not worry that you have any major illness. I guess your appetite is normal and your weight too. Now I would suggest you do a few things."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have wisdom tooth. Is it necessary to remove it?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question and I can understand your concern. If it is giving you any sort of problem or giving you discomfort, you need to remove it immediately.

My wife is pregnant and started clinic today.","Doctor":"Hi. At first visit, the pregnant lady's blood group needs to be checked. There are many blood groups like A, B, O, AB and another thing which we need to know is rhesus positive or rhesus negative. So on the basis of rhesus, it is A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+, AB -. So, every blood group have rhesus classification like rhesus positive and rhesus negative. A positive and a negative.  Rhesus has to be known as there is one issue of rhesus incompatibility. If both mother and father of the child are rhesus positive or both rhesus negative, then no issue. But, if mother is rhesus negative and father is rhesus positive and developing baby is rhesus positive, then mother can develop antibodies against fetal blood that can cause lysis of blood cells most likely in next pregnancy which can lead to anemic baby. Rh negative mothers with Rh positive husbands need anti-D injections. They need to have twice at 28 and 32 weeks of gestation without any cause but in case of bleeding during pregnancy also need injection, after birth also. Check your blood group as well if wife is rhesus negative. She should have regular antenatal visits and in case of bleeding or pain report to gynecology emergency.  If wife is Rh negative, have blood grouping of husband. Regular antenatal check-ups in maternal medicine unit if Rh negative and some other complications are related to it. Anti-D injections at 28 and 32 weeks. Balanced diet, weight, and BMI, folic acid. Regular antenatal check-ups. Report in case of any bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering for the past two months supposedly some fungal infection on the wrist of my right hand. It is circular and expands in a ring red in color. I have been using Candid B cream but as it goes away it comes back again and increase in size. When it expands, white pus-like small things form and on applying the cream for 2 to 3 days goes away but again surrounding area gets these small pus-like things and so the ring expands. It has left a white patch in the center and red ring at sides. It burns in hot but feels good in cold air. Is there a medicine which I can take?","Doctor":"Hi. Your history is strongly in favor of tinea corporis. Tinea Corporis is a fungal infection, usually a consequence of excessive sweating, occlusion, and friction. If not treated correctly, it tends to keep recurring. Candid B is a combination of an antifungal with steroid and such combinations have recently been banned too. The steroid in the composition tends to only suppress but not cure the infection. In addition, it adds to the resistance, hence further delaying the response when treated correctly. Kindly upload appropriate images to confirm the diagnosis, stop Candid B immediately, let us know all the sites which are affected (groins, axilla, etc.) and mention if you are a diabetic. Tablet Levocet 5 mg once daily at nite for two weeks for itching. Stop Candid B."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 27 years old. I have to face problems of falling of sperm. Nightfall happens four times a week. Some time my penis feels burning. It hurts me. I met so many doctors for some days, I get relief, then again I test all sugar, thyroid, and so on. All are negative.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. You have the problem of nocturnal emissions four times a week and this is happening most probably due to the lack of sex or masturbation. Engaging in masturbation or sex would reduce the frequency and you will feel better. The burning in the penis is probably due to infection. This is happening most likely due to poor hygiene due to repetitive night falls. Clean your penis with neutral water and if needed take proper treatment. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My partner has very tight tendons on the sides of his penis that cause pain with erection.

During vigorous sexual activity sometimes there is a partial tear of the superficial layer of tunica of corpora cavernosa leading to such description.

If contact lens has been there for the last 10 years, then it would cause a lot of problems like redness, watering, itching, pain, blurring of vision. I do not think the contact lens is still there.

After X-ray, he said braces will be used by the jaws and will be visible after that up to 3 mm.","Doctor":"Hi. Your age is ideal for orthodontic treatment. If you will delay further then treatment will take more time for completion so it is better to start with it sooner.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I was seen by a nurse practitioner. My main complaint is leg swelling, joint pain, and stomach aches. She asked me to do a series of lab tests and to return a week and a half later. When I went back, she told me that everything came back negative. However, a trace of an old case of Lyme disease showed up but it was nothing to worry about. Then she carried on to give lecture on my weight, and that I need to lose weight. I do, but I am 5'7\\" and 215 lbs with three children. I have a long history of bipolar depression. Now I began to think that the joint pain and depression may have some correlation with this \\"old case\\" of untreated Lyme disease. I need some advice on this, please.","Doctor":"Hi. I assure you not to worry at all as things may get settled with proper care and follow-up. Yes, depression and the joint disease may definitely be associated with the untreated Lyme disease.  There are a lot of things that need to be cleared right away in history. I have written just for you to alleviate your concerns, once for all. Do answer where I ask a question, send back in follow up along with all the laboratory results you just went through.  There are three main stages of the Lyme disease.  Stage 1: This is 1-30 days after the tick bite. It comprises the vague febrile illness with a typical red rash named Erythema migrans (the rash that appears usually in unseen areas like axillae, groin and the back of the knee areas, almost after a week of the tick bite).  I wish to know, 1. Did you get this rash sometime? 2. If yes, can you please give me details as when? 3. Any eye redness, tearing, neck stiffness at that time with mild fever, etc?  Stage 2: Early disseminated disease which is 3-10 weeks after the tick bite. It includes fever and malaise, eye and vision problems, heart issues, joint pains mostly knees, ankles, wrist involvement.  There are also the neurological manifestations like meningitis, facial palsy, headache, neck pain or stiffness, photophobia. Also memory problems, mood changes, sleep and personality changes, depression etc., with some skin rash.  STAGE 3; Months to years after the initial infection which is latent or chronic Lyme disease, I have seen my patients get a latency period with no disease and again erupted with stage 3 after sometime.  Facial palsy and joint pains are very important and common manifestation of the late disease. Bladder dysfunction, hearing loss, cognitive impairment, other neurological manifestations including depression are common. Treatment plan can be decided on seeing the blood work in follow up along with the details in history."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 26 years old and now 36 weeks pregnant. I just noticed my stool appeared as a mixture of white and brown long particles. I never had white poop in such lengths. My scan reports were normal a month ago. Is there any problem to worry? Is there any threat to the baby? Should I visit the doctor urgently? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Passage of white or brown particles in stool does not harm baby and there is no need to be alarmed. You can visit a physician or gastroenterologist for a physical evaluation, to confirm the nature of the problem and take treatment if required. If there are no other stomach symptoms, that visit too is not an emergency. If you have white string in stools along with other symptoms like loose stools or vomiting and pain in abdomen/fever, you need to visit a doctor as early as possible."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 44 years old male. I have a good diet. I have been taking good care of my health for the past 20 years as my digestive tract is bad for many years. Can you review my medical records from July and compare it with my CT scan done yesterday? One thing which is confusing me is the prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic region. I could say neither stress alone is the cause for all my health problems, nor old age.","Doctor":"Hi. The paraaortic lymph nodes mentioned in the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is almost in normal limit. The enlargement will become significant only if you have pain in the abdomen or fever or weight loss. There could be many causes for bowel disturbance example: IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) or reflux of the gastric content that would also cause burning of the chest. In your case, it appears to be benign. We need more information about your bowel habits such as whether you have constipation or not. Stress is a very important cause of bowel disturbance, one should alleviate all kind of stress to get rid of these problems. Treatment plan as advised previously. Preventive measures as advised previously."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, One and a half year back, I was diagnosed with thyroid with the TSH value of around 7.24.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Is it because of that I have high bleeding or is it usual to have it while taking Krimson. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Krimson is an Estrogen-Progesterone medicine. It requires some time to balance your hormones. Relax, do not worry about the bleeding until it is heavy like changing pads often like two hours. Instead, clitoris stimulation may have caused some mild uterine contraction, amounting to squeeze out of some blood remnants inside the uterine cavity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About a month ago, right below the left shoulder blade started itching.

If I put pressure on that area it hurts more. I have tried over the counter pain killers and it does not seem to help. The pain comes and goes on its own. Not taking any medication.","Doctor":"Hi. With the description given, it looks more of a neurological problem rather than a skin problem. If there are no rashes and only tingling sensation and pain, etc., over skin of lower shoulder blade, then most likely you are having notalgia paraesthetica.

I have a healthy heart otherwise. 60 resting heart rate and 95/70 BP.","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your medical history and would like to explain that you are right when you worry about your current medications. Both Prozac and Flecainide increase QTc interval and may predispose for arrhythmia. I would recommend stop continuing their concomitant use. Probably it would be better to start withdrawing them both. But if it is not possible for the moment, you should discuss with your attending doctor to keep the most indispensable drug which in your case seems to be Prozac.  In addition, also Trazodone may potentiate the above pro-arrhythmic effect (increase QTc interval). Coming to this point, it would be wise to stop a keto diet for the moment, and also Flecainide. An adjustment of Prozac with Trazodone combination is recommended, for minimizing the potential adverse effects. You should check also thyroid hormone levels, just to be sure they do not influence the recent appearance of atrial fibrillation episodes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My doctor prescribed me ZOVIA 1/50E–28 for my birth control.

Please ensure you do not have high blood pressure, migraine, history of thrombosis, liver disease, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, etc., when using these. Painful periods have multiple reasons like endometriosis, distorted uterine anatomy, big clots passage due to heavy bleeding. Hips are no reason. A higher dose might increase the problems.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

First, there were not much but now they are spreading all over my arm slowly. It makes me uncomfortable in wearing short sleeve clothes. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. These are comedo or blackheads (attachment removed to protect patient identity), are small bumps that appear on your skin due to clogged hair follicles. These bumps are due to the production of too much body oil, the buildup of the acne bacteria, irritation of the hair follicles when dead skins cells do not shed on a regular basis, undergoing hormonal changes that cause an increase in oil production, taking certain drugs, such as Corticosteroids, Lithium, or Androgens.  Choose oil-free lotions, and sunscreens to avoid making your problem worse if you are using some. You should once visit the dermatologist for examination. These are treated with Benzoyl Peroxide lotion 2.5 % applied two times a day. You need a wash and keep your skin clean and oil free. Exfoliating scrubs dead skin cells and can help reduce blackheads."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had deep unprotected sex for three minutes with a broken condom with a sex worker who looks younger and healthy and aged between 18. It was my first intercourse with a sex worker and I am worrying about expose to HIV. I have started fearing from the minute where I had broken condom intercourse and she said to me that she does not have HIV and they never allow anyone to have sex without a condom because of fear of getting infected. So there is no need to worry but I cannot believe her and started studying about HIV and its symptoms and I have a feeling of infection because I got red dots in my finger pits and cold and throat infection. I want to know what are the red dots on my finger which I got? I got it tested many times in those three months and got a negative result. I am worrying abt six months test.","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, I want to tell you that the tests which are done these days are highly sensitive and specific and give accurate results. Congratulations on your three months HIV test, post-exposure being negative. Numerous studies have shown that 97 % of people will have enough antibodies to accurately test positive at three months. In some of the cases, it takes as long as six months to test positive, but this is rare. Since everyone's window period is different and as per the recommendations and I also suggest to get retested at six months. Red dots on finger pits, cold and throat infection can occur in various conditions not necessarily HIV. Relax. Move forward. Just go for a repeat HIV antibody test at six months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an episode of BPPV this morning. I had a couple earlier this year and I am confused as to which is the bad ear so I can do the proper procedure. It happens in this scenario: I lay on my left side and switch to my right. Vertigo starts up when I lay on my right side but only after I have been laying on my left. In fact, I could not get it to do it by turning my head and laying back on either side independently. By what I described, can you determine which is the bad ear? I did the Eppley starting on the left side but got nothing. When I shifted to the right it started for 20 seconds. I aborted not wanting to go the wrong direction.","Doctor":"Hi. With details of your history, it is difficult to say which side it is on but since with Epley, you get vertigo when you do on the right side, it seems to be more on the right side. It does not matter which ear it is in or if it is bilateral. The treatment is the same. The side matters if we try to cure by the maneuver. Are you taking any medicine for vertigo like Betahistine, etc? Precautions: You should restrict salt in the diet. Also, there is some balancing exercise which helps in the long term. The neck exercise should be avoided if you have a cervical problem. Also, let me know if you have other complaints like nausea and fullness in ears."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, When I am lying down my foot moves. What it means is like my whole foot will move up and down (if this makes sense) sometimes my hips too. I cannot remember when this started to happen but it only happens when I lie down.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be suffering from hyperkinetic movement disorders. Many people who suffer from mild or moderate PLMS (periodic limb movements during sleep) can successfully manage their condition without medication. People often report that relaxation exercises like yoga or meditation can help reduce their symptoms. Sometimes a hot bath or messaging one's legs before going to sleep will help with the movements as well. Try to have full body massage and if symptoms persist then visit any neurophysician. He will advise some tests and prescribe medications to you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 19-year-old girl, weight 38 kg, height 5 feet. So my problem is related to brain concentration. Earlier up to school, I had good concentrating power. After schooling, I started preparing for entrance exams and it has been two years preparing for the same but now I feel that I have trouble concentrating over questions, concepts during class or while doing self-study. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Lack of concentration can be due to several reasons, most common reasons are stress, lack of sleep, disinterests in the project and lack of motivation. Here are some tips and the principle by which they help you. Minimum seven hours sleep helps to reinforce the memory, and re-energize you for the next day. Regular routine, especially sleep timings, starting from your meal times, the time you visit the library, and workouts, keep it regular. Improves your time management, keeps you healthy and prevents loss of time due to sickness. Eat healthy. Eat what suits your taste and digestive capacity. Eat from only hygienic places. Again this helps prevent the unnecessary sick leaves. Non-study activities. It is a must, it gives a break to your mind which is already stressed by continuous and monotonous study hours. It could be anything starting from prayer, meditation, sports activity, work outs, morning or evening jogs. Have a healthy study group. Do not be selfish with your group, be contributory towards your group. It has multiple benefits, it acts like a mnemonic helping you remember facts in relation to place our person you discussed it with. It gives a sense of easiness to find many people are with you on the same boat. It acts as a strong motivation, if there is a healthy and friendly competition among the group members.  Stay away from distractions like the internet. Keep distance from people who speak negative most of the time. Try to be in company of people who are highly charged in energy. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a boy and my height is 5.1 feet, my father's height is 5.0 feet and mother's height is under 5 feet. So, can I grow 5.6 feet? Because my head is bigger than my body so I look awkward. Kindly help me, please.","Doctor":"Hello. Being a teenager, your body is actively growing in length and you will probably grow more until your bone's growth plates fuse. Taking both your mother's and father's height as 5 feet, the expected height is roughly 5'4'' with a little room for changes either way. Vitamin and Mineral supplements could supplement your growth and you may consider that."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 49 year old female, and I have a uterine fibroid. I have heavy bleeding from two or three months. What to do? What medicines can I take? Is it curable without surgery? Please advise. I am taking Kanchanar Guggulu from ten days.","Doctor":"Hi. The heavy bleeding may be due to the fibroid and menopausal symptoms. Hence, we need to treat fibroid and hormonal imbalance. For your condition, I suggest you try taking the following medicines. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. You need to continue these drugs for three months. Within one week, the bleeding will stop. Then gradually, the uterine fibroid will be reduced in size. After few more months, your uterus will become normal. If you can collect or buy the bark of jambul tree, crush 50 gm of the bark with 300 ml of water. Boil in mild flame, and reduce it to 50 ml. Then drink it. This should be consumed in the morning and evening on an empty stomach. This has the potential to stop the excess bleeding. Use banana flower in cooking. It is also good to control uterine bleeding. Another option is using hormones given by a gynecologist, but that should be your last option. This drug gives only symptomatic relief, it does not reduce the fibroid uterus size.

Generally, ginger is taken during pregnancy to relieve nausea and vomiting of pregnancy but care should be taken if the patient is on blood thinners, etc. Ginger root tea in a moderate amount not exceeding more than 4 gm is acceptable. I think you should not take too many juices as they themselves cause gastritis. Eat small frequent meals every two hours and have at least 8 to 9 serving of food every day. During the first three months, eat whatever you like but all-in moderate amount."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 36 years old individual. During intercourse, my penis gets eruction but I ejaculate in less than a minute. It is becoming difficult. Kindly help as I am losing confidence. My height is 5 feet 8 inches, weight 128 kg (severe obesity), waist-line 55 inches, penis size 5 inches, approximately when erected and girth is two inches and not so hard as it used to be. Glans penis (head) is completely covered by foreskin and cannot be seen and when tried to retract, it is painful and not possible to retract but when not erect, the foreskin can be retracted without pain and be cleaned. The main problem is premature ejaculation. Other systemic complications are diabetes and on Gemmer 1 mg once daily from the paat one year. No blood pressure or thyroid or anything else.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your problem. Premature ejaculation is very common and is usually not associated with any disease but may be due to anxiety. However, it is sometimes associated with infection of male accessory glands, which is treatable. You can learn to control PE by doing this exercise. Pull your muscles that you pull at the end of urination for a few seconds and then release. Repeat this several times daily. Another is the stop-start technique. When you feel that you are going to ejaculate stop the sexual stimulation and divert your mind, the penis will relax, after some time, start the stimulation again and repeat the procedure. Over a few months, you will gradually increase your ejaculation time. Also, there are medicines to control it but there is no permanent cure. In your case, you should strictly control diabetes and reduce weight by slow walking daily 15 minutes. Your foreskin may be tight due to some infection which is common in obese diabetics. If you get too much pain, then circumcision, which is a small operation can help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am not able to get an erection since yesterday, all of a sudden. Also for the past two days, I do not have sexual urges. I am 21, male. I had not faced erection problems before and till 3 to 4 days ago, I was able to masturbate with no problem.","Doctor":"Hi. Erection problem in young people is usually due to anxiety and stress. Masturbation and feeling guilty also cause this. Do you have diabetes mellitus, do you smoke, is there any history of trauma to the lower back, is there any pain in testes? If the answer to all is a no, then causes are anxiety, guilt, etc. Do you have morning erections? If yes, then you are all fine. Anxiety causes a release of stress hormones in the blood which may suddenly cause erectile dysfunction. Just refrain from masturbation, do not try to forcibly masturbate, remain calm, do not think about erection problem for seven days at least. Do not forcibly divert your mind to erotic thoughts. Meanwhile, do the following exercises: 1. Deep breathing: Sit on the floor in a calm room alone, close your eyes, slowly inspire through the nose in five seconds, hold breath for five seconds and then release air from the mouth in five seconds. Then hold breath for five seconds and again repeat this cycle for 15 cycles. Do this daily in morning and evening. 2. Kegel: Tighten your pelvic floor muscles like you do while you strongly hold your urine when you have a strong urge to pass urine. Tighten muscles for five seconds and release, again repeat the cycle. Repeat for 20 cycles in one session and do 4 to 5 cycles in 24 hours. You can do this anytime anywhere while standing in a bus, walking on a road, sitting on a chair, lying on the bed, etc. 3. Do jogging preferably in the early morning, for 30 minutes daily. Eat lots of dry fruits, drink plenty of water, reduce salt intake, avoid fatty meals. Follow-up after seven days with details about your condition, so that you can further be guided, if required. Anxiety, guilt, stress. Not at this time. As described above. Avoid smoking, alcohol, masturbation, erotic thoughts, and avoid concern about the erectile problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mom has an ear infection for more than one month now.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I have a lack of concentration, hard to work and changing tasks without completing it. I think some psychiatric help is must here. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. You report difficulties with attention, poor concentration overactivity, and impulsive behavior. These may be suggestive of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). ADHD may present since childhood but is more evident in the adolescent stage, as the academic demands get higher. You say you are in school. Even though you may be intelligent, if you have ADHD it may affect your educational attainment. No wonder it is causing frustration. ADHD is increasingly recognized in recent decades. It is not a behavioral problem, it is a neurodevelopmental condition which is treatable. ADHD can be managed by behavioral support, and if symptoms are significant, then medication (stimulants like Methylphenidate or non-stimulants like Atomoxetine) will be helpful.

I am also awaiting some fillings. I already have a temporary filling which as fallen out and the hole seems to be too big. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Use warm saline gargling daily at least 2 or 3 times, for two weeks. This will help in reducing the inflammation and help in preventing further recession of gum line. Also if you can get Betadine gargle for rinsing then it would be much better, this would be of great help in case of severe periodontitis (gum inflammation and receding gums). Use sensodyne toothbrush (as suggested by your treating dentist) which have very soft bristles in an upward and downward motion only. Do not scrub the toothbrush over gingiva (gums) as it may cause further recession of the gum line. If the recession is severe then it may require flap surgery, still, the receded gingiva can never be brought back but a further recession can be avoided. You need to get that filling done as early as possible or it may result in infection of the tooth root. The receding gums might be due to: 1. Faulty brushing habit. 2. Calculus deposition. 3. Poor oral hygiene. Intraoral x-ray of the affected area. Use of saline gargle, betadine gargle, flap surgery and antibiotics if required.

Male pattern hair loss (hormonal, androgenic).3. Dandruff. Other causes are mainly due to different systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, connective tissue disease, etc. With your history, I do not think you have systemic diseases. Please get the following investigations to rule out systemic disease. OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone test) and serum creatinine.

On the third week of my pregnancy, I took two pills of Misoprostol. Yesterday, I went to ultrasound and my doctor told my baby is very healthy. Is there a high risk for my baby to be born with moebius syndrome or other illnesses? Please inform me, should I end my pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. You already used Misoprostol which is hormonal pills used to induce abortion and acts locally but luckily, it did not work and you got a healthy alive, active baby inside uterus growing. Have strict monitoring and take care of any symptoms you have like pain, bleeding, etc. Your sugar levels, blood pressure, thyroid levels should be in normal range and if you have been treated for any health issue, that also need to be checked and regularly treated.  Have Folic acid 5 mg and Iron, Calcium with Vitamin D regularly. Have Micheal translucency scan at 13 weeks, detailed fetal anomaly scan at 20 weeks and scan for cardiac outflow tract at 22 weeks to check any abnormality in the child. I hope there will not be any abnormality if you do not have any family history of congenital anomalies. To be on safe side, you can take double marker tests, hormonal tests at 13 weeks and scan to exclude any congenital anomaly in the fetus. Have a regular antenatal checkup. I hope things would be better. Have the best care of baby and yourself. Misoprostol acts locally and prepares the female body to have a miscarriage. I hope it would not affect fetus with no detailed specific side effects as a congenital anomaly. Regular antenatal follow-ups along with a complete treatment of any health issue you have. Regular antenatal visit, double marker tests. scan at 13 weeks for nuchal translucency, at 20 weeks for detailed anomaly scan, at 22 weeks for cardiac outflow tract. Iron, Calcium with Vitamin D supplements, folic acid. Regular diet, weight, BMI, antenatal visits, multivitamins."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My heart has been checked, and I had a chest x-ray, CT of heart, aorta, abdomen, and pelvic floor and Doppler of my legs. All are clear. Blood work is normal apart from D-Dimer and c-reactive protein which is 12.6 mg/L. What can it be?","Doctor":"Hello. Following is my opinion about your asked question. D-dimer is usually elevated in some thrombotic events in the body like DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. But your CT chest and Doppler leg are normal as per history. So pulmonary embolism and DVT can be excluded. The other causes for elevated D-dimer can be liver disease, heart disease, inflammation, post-surgery, and pregnancy as well. Your heart is normal as per history, so heart disease can be excluded. You can rule out the liver disease by SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase), and serum protein estimation. If you have pregnancy or surgery history than it can be the cause. PT (prothrombin time), PTT (partial thromboplastin time) and coagulation profile can be planned by your doctor if D- dimer remains persistently high. Kindly attach your report to give further comments if possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had four miscarriages in a row. One had a subchronic hematoma. Is there a reason for this or a way to stop? I have given live births but now I cannot keep a child. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Recurrent miscarriages need to be investigated actually. You had live births but now had four consecutive miscarriages. It is better to have a thrombophilia screen and products of conception needed to be send out for histopathology to check any chromosomal, congenital, structural anomaly. If you have been treated for any health issues like diabetes, thyroid, or high blood pressure, better have a complete, revised and regular treatment. All levels of blood pressure, thyroid, sugar levels should be within normal range as high sugar levels, high blood pressure, abnormal thyroid function test can trigger miscarriage. Have Folic acid continuously 5 mg as the abnormal product of conception, with structural, congenital or chromosomal anomalies can be aborted easily by nature itself. A hormonal imbalance like polycystic ovaries need hormonal support like Duphaston and Metformin during pregnancy for maintenance. Have a healthy diet, less salt, sugar, oil, and spice. Try to have normal BMI and weight as both high and low BMI can affect conception. Husbands health issues also need to be sorted out. Have recreational activities and quit recreational drugs as a couple as these reduces fertility in both gender and can cause fetal anomalies. You need blood thinning medications as well as soon as fetal viability comes like Aspirin, Heparin, etc. It is better to have an early booking with maternal medicine and high risk pregnancy consultant obstetrician. Send me your recent blood reports, detailed medical, gynecological, obstetrics and drug history and have thrombophilia screen, rubella screen. So that you could be guided more nicely. Medical issues to be sorted out, if any. Thrombophilia screen, rubella screening. Recurrent miscarriages. Folic acid daily 5 mg, sex in the fertile period of the cycle, early booking with high risk and maternal medicine consultant obstetrician. Blood-thinning medications as soon as fetal viability confirms. Progesterone support as soon as pregnancy test comes positive or cycle miss.

Have black Sesame in whatever form you like (laddu or raw, etc.). Sesame is good as the hair tonic. You can also have Fenugreek seeds laddu. Fenugreek is also hair tonic. Have these medicines but I need a follow up with such details. Hair fall, smell from the head, itching of scalp, bleeding after itching of scalp, hairs stick together, any other complaints?

Let me explain you about beta thalassemia trait. It is good that you are aware of using online health portal. Beta thalassemia trait is the heterozygous condition and the patient can live a normal life. If nutrition is not maintained properly and if any unusual excess bleeding occurs because of some reason then sometimes Hb can be decreased and the patient feels weakness because of that. But as such thalassemia minor patient have no any problem which hampers usual lifestyle. You have to take precaution while doing marriage. Before marriage, your fiance thalassemia report should be done. If she is also having thalassemia minor then the chance of the baby having thalassemia major is 25 %.

I have started feeling symptoms and have a cold sore throat and rashes on my back. I had tested 22nd day and 95th day both are antibody test and got negative and my doctor asked me to retest after six months. I had read that 84 days are enough to show up in the test. What is the rare condition to get antibodies? Should I retest?","Doctor":"Hi. Regarding HIV infection, the window period (or period in which a person might test negative for the virus but actually be positive because of a delayed immune response) is typically between 21 and 60 days. There is however some evidence that it can be as long as 180 days (six months). When there is a history of a potential transmission risk event, like having unprotected sexual intercourse, we recommend a final repeat of the antibody and antigen combo test at six months. Even though your symptoms could be explained by other infections, I would still recommend that you repeat the combo test at six months for your own peace of mind. It is also very important that you test yourself for syphilis as your symptoms, especially your rash, suggests a need to just exclude that, as it is highly treatable if found. I would strongly suggest as well that you consult with a trusted physician so that he or she can examine you clinically and help to exclude other diagnoses like upper respiratory tract infection and treat accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am on the NuvaRing and this is the 7th day of it out because I was trying to have my period.

As the brain develops till the age of 18 years, stress can affect the development. Stress can, in general, affect the functioning of the body, hormonal balance, and immunity levels as well. If the stress persists beyond the child's tolerance, the effect can be long-lasting or permanent. However, if the child is relieved from stress, he can show a tremendous spurt in development.

I wonder can it have any relation with stopping of masturbation which I have done in about three weeks. Also, I had unprotected sex with someone 10 days ago and I am scared of HIV sign.","Doctor":"Hi. The erythematous papular eruptions which you have on your facial area seems to be acne or folliculitis (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is a superficial skin infection, commonly bacterial and is extremely common irrespective of HIV status. It has no association with starting or stopping masturbation. For your unprotected sexual exposure get your HIV rapid combo test, if negative you will require a repeat testing at three months and preferably at six months of exposure also. I also advise you having safe sex using consistently and correctively condoms in the future."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I recorded it yesterday throughout the beginning with 8 am and ending at 10:15 pm. The pulse was 58, 60, 80, 78, 69, and 54. The 80 was after hiking 2.5 miles. I am concerned about the low of 54. I am currently on Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide 325 mg/25 mg and Amiloride 5 mg, each one per day.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for reaching out to us. I understand your concern about your health. Please do not be worried as it is nothing. It is perfectly normal to have a slightly low pulse as you age. It is a physiological change that occurs with aging perhaps 54 beats per minute can not be said to be too low. A normal pulse is between 60 to 90 beats per minute. This range differs with people. Age, body size, and activity level are some of the reasons for the variation. I advise you to continue your normal daily routine without worry. You can become concerned if it becomes lower as much as 40 and you experience symptoms like shortness of breath or faintness. Remain healthy. Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from loose motion since today morning. Can you suggest a medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. Loose motion usually spontaneously subsides within a day or two. Usually people who travel more frequetly will get affected easily and hence it is adviced for them to take ORS with them. Let's have ORS (oral rehydration salt) solution, and take a few sips for every few minutes. And after loose motion, wait for a while and then have ORS to compensate for the water that is lost. Eat bland diet. Avoid milk, spicy and fatty food. Preferably eat bananas, rice and other light food. Loose motion should subside by this. However, if it is not controlled in a day or two, take tablet O2 (Ofloxacin and Ornidazole combination) twice a day for 5 days. This is an antibiotic which is useful in bacterial infections. If the infection is viral, antibiotics have no role. It needs to be just treated by ORS solution itself."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I commenced taking Femosten last month because I was not getting a period for the last six months. Prior to this, I got them intermittently for 12 to 18 months. For several months, I would just get my period for several consecutive months. My cycle has always been 28 days. My periods never differed, perhaps a little heavier than usual. I suffered constant hot flushing for six months. So the doctor prescribed Femoston which dealt with that issue. She did advise perhaps I would still have some bleeding. I have never had any breakthrough bleeding but last month I got a period, lasting for usual five days and yesterday, I have had another period. Just wondering about this. I am due to see my GP soon for a pap smear and review the Femosten. Should I make an earlier booking?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. What about hot flushes? Do you have them?

Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 61 year old man and in reasonably good health apart from being overweight and diagnosed diabetic 10 years ago. The following has started after I lost a lot of weight. For the last 9 months, I have had to sleep sitting up in a chair and leaning to my left side. If I lie down to sleep horizontally, or remain sitting up but tilting even slightly backward, or if I slip down on to my back on the chair while asleep, my heart begins to get faster and faster. I feel no pain and it does not wake me up. That is the problem, I sleep through it until I wake up with the need of going to the bathroom. I suspect these episodes last for hours with my heart going dangerously fast. These are not palpitations. When I wake up, my heart is often racing, and I have to take deep breaths for a couple of minutes to get enough oxygen inside me for the heart to return to its normal beat. It all started very suddenly, not progressive. For all these months I have been scared by the prospect of having to go to sleep and leave it as long as possible before trying, just praying that I can get through the night keeping myself upright and with a reasonably clear nose. If I can do that, I can usually make it through reasonably fine, but this is the exception rather than the rule. Body position seems to be one key factor, clear nose another, but the first always overrides the latter in importance. I recently had to make a 6 day 1500 mile dash drive and slept every night upright in the car seat right next to an open window. I had no problems at all during those 5 nights. A cardiologist has run tests and told me there is nothing abnormal with my heart’s muscle or function. I rented an automatic CPAP machine for 4 months, but have now returned it. It does not do much of help, but its data shows no continuous waking such as might happen with obstructive sleep apnea. It does, however, show that I go into periods of shallow breathing while asleep. The only other suggestion that I have had is that this might be some form of central sleep apnea and therefore perhaps more neurologically based. The company that rented me the CPAP machine say that a BIPAP machine might be better, as it will force me to breathe, but I would really like a more expert opinion before going down that extremely expensive road. Do you know any other people who have had similar symptoms and experiences, and if so, what was the cause and how was it treated? Current daily medications I take are 75 mg Aspirin for blood thinning, 1 x 15 mg Pioglitazone/ 850mg Metformin tablet for controlling diabetes, 5 mg Ramipril for blood pressure, and various vitamin and fish oil supplements.","Doctor":"Hi. My compliments for a detailed medical history of what you have been going through in the last nine months. I have gone through it and following are the points which are important to show the way to diagnosis: What are the problems you do not probably have: What you may have: My suggestions:"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Every time I exercise on the treadmill, my legs are blushing and itching. So, that is stopping me from exercising. What is wrong and what can I do to prevent this?","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and understand your genuine health concerns. This is a very common problem for a lot of treadmill users doing cardio exercises. The main issue is the sensitivity of the skin. It looks very simple but I found this fact after a research on 150 people of different ages and with different health status, but with the same issue of blushing and itching on the legs while using the treadmill.  Reasons: Dry skin in the legs. Wearing tight clothes/jeans or trousers while exercising on the treadmill. Wearing tight and above ankle socks. 1. Wear cotton-only trousers (100% cotton; not mixed with any synthetic fiber). 2. It is better to wear ankle socks compared to above ankle socks. 3. Wax properly and timely on the legs and apply Eucerin cream (extra dry treatment lotion) on the legs especially when doing the treadmill. 4. There must be a proper ventilation in the room where you do the treadmill. 5. Keep a judicious supply of water to avoid dehydration. 6. You need to keep a good and healthy diet full of vitamins, minerals and fluids (vegetables, salads, fruits, salmon fish, nuts, dry fruits). 7. Avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, beverages, energy drinks, etc. 8. It is possible that you may still feel itching and redness for the first couple of days, so it is better to take tablet Cetirizine 1 hour before workout. And apply Hydrocortisone cream if you feel that the redness is not going away on its own after an hour of completing workout .  In a few days you will not get the problem anymore."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How soon can I expect to start bleeding and is it normal to feel nauseous after taking that dosage? Until when is it legal to get an abortion for a woman without any complications or failed contraception?","Doctor":"Hello. As you asked, yes, it is common to have nausea after taking Regestrone pills, as it is a hormonal pill. Your periods will stop only after stopping the tablet and should be getting any time between 7-10 days after stopping it, as it varies from person to person. MTP (medical termination of pregnancy) can be offered till 24 weeks of gestation, if the pregnancy is assumed to be constituting grave injury to the physical or mental health of the woman. Although they have not clearly mentioned, as the scenario you mentioned, any unwanted pregnancy (arising due to rape or contraceptive failure) can be a grave mental injury to a woman. Also in your scenario, I would like to know, why would a woman consider a termination of pregnancy at an advanced gestational age, if neither there were any complications nor it happens due to contraception failure. But one needs to get it approved by two registered medical practitioners for going ahead with the termination of pregnancy.

Carcinoma of the breast three years back, followed by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. I am on Tamoxifen for past 3 years, and now I am taking Arimidex. I have been suffering from osteoporosis for over 7 years. Before six years, I had severe osteopenia with maximum bone loss of 21% on L3 and spine, ribs, trunk, and arms with more on the left side. I had undergone the following investigations. Before three years, I had FNAC which showed invasive ductal carcinoma, right breast ER+, PR+, Hercep score \\"0.\\" Last month, I had an x-ray and MRI, which showed focal altered marrow intensity lesions seen in B/L pelvic bone, sacrum, and left upper femoral shaft consistent with metastasis. I also had a PET scan which showed metabolically active ill-defined lytic destructive lesions in post cortex shaft of left femur, right inferior pubic ramus, B/L iliac bones, sacrum, D5, 7, 11 and L1, 4, sternum, right 3, 5, 7 post ribs with mid-right paravertebral soft tissue lesion at D7 level likely metastasis.","Doctor":"Hello. I do not have full information regarding the case from your query. The conclusion I can make from the information which you have given is that the patient has bone metastasis only. The treatment for such a case is a change in hormone therapy. Your medication has already been changed from Tamoxifen to Arimidex. I do not know since how many days or months you are taking Arimidex. Has it made any difference in intensity of your back pain? You also need to take Zoledronic Acid injection (Zometa). This also helps in bone metastasis. You also need adequate pain medications, maybe Morphine preparation to control your pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is a 68-year-old female, non-smoker. She had a severe cold and cough two months ago. After a course of Azithromycin, her symptoms improved except she just has a dry cough at night. Last week she had a cough with blood. I took her to urgent care, they prescribed antibiotics (Doxycycline) and cough syrup Promethazine. Also, they asked for a chest X-ray to rule out any other serious condition. The X-ray came back with a 2.3 cm lung nodule or scar tissue in left upper lung and recommended a follow-up X-ray after 3 to 4 months or a chest CT scan. CT scan came back with scar tissue in the upper left lung but has a 4 mm nodule in lower left lung. The nodule is visible clearly on the HRCT CT-scan slide (96-97-98) (1.25 mm lung). But slide 99-100 looks like hazy or patchy region posterior to the nodule (the report does not mention that but it is what I think I saw). Does this mean it is a ground glass opacity nodule or nodule is clear and this hazy region is some kind of infection? CT-scan does not mention ground glass opacity where I am worried about but it does mention patchy ground-glass opacity in lingula region and attribute it to infection or aspiration. Only aspiration I can think of is could be my mother lost two chewing tooth in the back and has trouble chewing food. She has been trying a partial denture but it is a task for her and I am not a doctor to make judgment. It has been stressful for me and everyone in my family. I would like some feedback on this. By the way, cough in blood reduced on the very second day and after the third day, there was no more blood in a cough. I want a radiologist to look at the report which mentions mild to moderate bronchiectasis and has Fitchner society guideline for nodule below 6 mm. More details about the presenting complaint: My mother had a severe chest or throat infection two months ago. A course of Azithromycin cleared most of the symptoms except a cough at night time. She had bloody cough (very dark red like cough with clots) that was on the 12th of this month. It subsided after the doctor prescribed Doxycycline. Besides, there is no weight loss. She was taking Repaglinide to control blood sugar. Otherwise, normally she is taking Metformin 250-500-500. Previous history of the same issue: None- my mother remembers a severe episode of a cough for a month around 40+ years. No history of tuberculosis. Current medications: Doxycycline 100 mg twice for 14 days. She has been taking since last week. Metformin 250-500-500 total 1250 in a day for blood sugar, Rosuvastatin 10/Clopidogrel 75, (TMT was done last month- No findings). Lab tests performed: Chest X-ray and CT scan.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through the 10 images uploaded, 8 CT images and two report images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are right about the haziness posterior to the nodule in images 97-99/ 241. So what we see is a nodule with hazy margins. Concerning this appearance, it can be reactive changes surrounding the nodule that is slowly healing (as you mentioned a course of Doxycycline is completed and she is feeling better) or it can still mean some residual active infection in the area. Therefore we need to address the issue from a more clinical perspective than an isolated nodule. Fleishner society recommendations are followed to know if a certain nodule is of potential neoplastic etiology. It is true that you are having a stressful situation at the moment but there is no obvious finding in the report that can cause any chronic blood in the cough. The ground glass opacities are a subjective finding and many radiologists mention it where the opacities are prominent. However, I have noted that she is on Clopidogrel 75 mg and if she had a violent cough before the bleeding then it might be possible that she had a small mucosal injury in the aerodigestive tract."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can tubes placed in ears cause pulsating tinnitus?

Both have an antiseptic effect on low-grade bacteria causing blepharitis along with add on effects (detergent and non-detergent) and hence improving hygiene. Hence, spacing them would be ideal. However, if you are a busy individual and fund carrying things around a bit difficult, keep at least 15 minutes gap for the action of one medication to set in.

Sildenafil is a rapid-acting drug and has a short duration of actions. Sometimes, due to hypotension caused by Sildenafil, individuals might develop symptoms like a headache. This could be the reason in your case too. One option to prevent this is to drink plenty of water before taking the tablet. This will prevent fall in BP.

Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Recently, she had undergone a third pick up cycle. Nine eggs were retrieved, out of which eight eggs were mature, five were fertilized and three embryos reach day 3 stage with two embryos grade A (eight cells) and one embryo grade B (six cells). I was disappointed to hear that only three embryos are developed because in her previous two pick-up cycles 10 embryos each were developed which were of either grade 1 or 2. However the worst part was our doctor told us that the egg quality was not good and there is very little chances of implantation with these embryos and asked us to go for donor egg. Doctor is planning to transfer our own embryos as well as donor egg embryos in single cycle to enhance success rate. I am surprised to hear this as I believed that grade A embryos have a very good chance of implantation. I would be grateful if you could answer my below queries: 1. Can poor egg quality produce grade A embryos? 2. If yes, does chances of these grade A embryos getting implanted are minimal? 3. What would be your recommendation in our case? Should we go for IVF with our own embryos or donor egg embryos?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing today? I would like to put forth a few facts of IVF or embryology. 1. Your wife is in the perfect age for pregnancy. 19 to 35 years is the best age. 2. Her body weight is normal, so a hormonal imbalance is ruled out. 3. She has given nine eggs, which is perfect. Of course, 15 or so would have been great. But 9 to 10 is excellent. Of these 8 are mature, so it means egg quality is good, otherwise, they would not have matured. 4. Out of 8 mature eggs, only 3 embryos formed, so I would be more concerned about the health of sperms. Some problem in sperm is not allowing good embryos to be formed. The egg has a lot of corrective capacity. Even if the sperm is damaged, it can correct it. Sperm movement and number may be normal, but if the morphology or health is not up to the mark then there is a lot of chances for the sperm factor to be evaluated and treated. Mixing of donor and self-embryos especially if self embryos are good grade is not a good idea. For your queries: 1. You are right. If eggs are not good, embryo quality will be bad, you cannot get grade A. 2. The grade is only to classify embryos. We get a healthy pregnancy from poor grade and no pregnancy from the best grade of embryos. It alone cannot be used to predict pregnancy chances. 3. I would suggest you have semen factor re-evaluated. You need examination, good antibiotic cover and hormonal priming of sperms, then if needed, go for IVF or if no other causes IUI or ovulation induction, try for few months, you never know, she may get pregnant with these simple, small but very effective methods. An indication of IVF also needs to be thought of."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have undiagnosed chest or back pain which over the last 4 to 5 months has been getting increasingly worse. Full spinal MRI performed, have not seen the report but was told by the doctor that there was nothing there that would account for the pain. I would really appreciate a fresh perspective. Pain (4 to 7/10) behind left breast and radiating around the side and underarm. Not affected by posture or activity but unable to breathe deeply. Episodes last from 90 seconds to 4 to 5 hours, some days it only happens 2 to 3 times, other up to 20 times. Sometimes, the pain will wake me at night. This pain is different from other episodes in that it is much sharper (10/10) and makes lying down impossible. Cardiac causes and blood clots have been eliminated. Nuclear bone scan showed a hot spot at L1, which prompted a lumbar CT. From that, I was told that I have severe arthritis in the lumbar with possible nerve impingement. Advice from spinal MRI was no nerve impingement. Previous history: Have confirmed the diagnosis of DISH in the neck (C3 to C7) and possible diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (being treated with Humira, which helps immensely). No problems with any other joints. Current medications: Mobic 15 mg once daily, Humira 40 mg fortnightly, Targin 40/20 mg twice daily, Endone 5 mg as required, Sevikar HCT 40/5/12.5 once daily, Thyroxine 200 mcg once daily, Oestradiol 2 mg once daily. Comments: Have lost 5 cm in height in the last 5 to 6 years. Probably not relevant to my thoracic pain, but when I go to the toilet, most times I have severe lower back pain for some time after, and occasionally pain down the back of both thighs.","Doctor":"Hi. Following is the reply after viewing your images (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Review of cervical spine MRI. In C2-C3 disc level, there is a mild left neural foraminal compromise. In C3-C4 and C4-C5 disc levels, there is minimal right and mild left neural foraminal compromise. In C5-C6 and C6-C7 disc levels, there is a minimal bilateral neural foraminal compromise (left greater than right). The features of DISH are persisting. Therefore, it is likely that the pains you are having on the left are due to mild neural foraminal compromise in the above cervical levels. There is mild fluid in C3-C4 and C4-C5 disc levels. There is no significant spinal canal stenosis. Review of thoracic spine MRI shows no significant disc bulge or neural foraminal compromise. Review of lumbar spine MRI and CT. There is no obvious disc bulge but the changes in the vertebrae and the intervertebral facet joints are moderate in nature. There is thickening of the flavum ligamentum in L1-L2, L2-L3 and L3-L4 disc levels causing thecal sac compression and impingement of nerves in the lumbar spinal canal. There is lumbar spinal canal stenosis in many disc levels and is prominent in L1-L2 disc level. There is a moderate bilateral neural foraminal compromise in L3-L4 and L4-L5 disc levels. The increase in pain during bowel movements is likely due to dynamic neural foraminal stenosis. The CT scan shows significant degenerative bone changes and facet joints are showing sclerotic changes in multiple levels."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My uncle went to the hospital with breathing trouble before five days and they said he has a heart problem and there is more block and want to do open heart surgery.

There are multiple blockages including a blockage in a left main coronary artery (LMCA), for which bypass is the best option. So, angioplasty is not possible and should undergo bypass.

Is my baby safe? I am taking iron, calcium, and zinc tablets for six months. Please tell me about the precautions and healthy tips.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, diabetes with pregnancy is a high risk pregnancy. The blood sugars should be checked before getting pregnant. In case a woman gets pregnant with high blood sugar levels, then there can be a risk of miscarriages, and certain congenital disabilities in the baby. Please check your blood glucose levels and HbA1c level to see for your glycemic control. Also, I am assuming you are taking folic acid supplements because that is a vitamin that helps prevent certain birth defects (neural tube defects - in other words brain and spine defects) in the baby. It would have been good if you had mentioned the medications that you been taking for your diabetes to check if you could continue them, also if any dose modifications are required. Because pregnancy-induced hormonal changes can disturb the glucose control as the pregnancy advances and it needs close monitoring.

I understand the stress you would have due to increased body weight and difficulty in losing it, after going through the attached details (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your BMI (Body Mass Index) is 48. BMI is nothing but a derived value from the weight and height of a person. For your height, your weight should be around 110 to 120 pounds. Normal BMI is around 25. If it is between 25-30, it is overweight. If between 30-35, we call it obesity. Up to 35 BMI, we can reduce weight by exercise, by reducing carbohydrates and by restricted fat diet, etc.  If BMI between 35-40, called severe obesity, some tablets like Leptos can be taken along with exercise and diet. But if BMI is more than 40, it is called morbid obesity which cannot be reduced by drugs or exercise and diet. Bariatric surgery should be done to reduce weight which will prevent you from getting diseases like hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, kidney problems, and osteoporosis.  Your BMI is 48, which cannot be reduced by drugs, exercise or diet. So, please start considering bariatric surgery as an option. I have seen people who shed almost 100 pounds effortlessly after surgery within 3 months. This surgery is completely safe and gives great results and prevents you from getting various diseases which I have mentioned earlier. Think about your heart. It is designed to work for a body which weighs 120 pounds. It is working double the time now, and its life will get reduced. So please consult a surgical gastroenterologist for clinical examination and surgery. All my wishes for your good health."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please help! I am so upset.

She got sick when we got home from emergency room too. Do we have to take her back to the neurologist? Does she have epilepsy?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your daughter's comprehensive medical history written by you. Tongue bite and urination indicate that these episodes are seizures. The probable diagnosis would be epilepsy.

I understood that you are having an off and on headache, likely a chronic headache. for the last 3 days, you are having a new-onset headache, which is triggered by cleaning your left ear, associated with scalp tenderness and pain behind ear. There are several possible causes of a headache behind the ear. One of the most common causes of such type of headache is occipital neuralgia. in this condition, occipital nerves are injured or inflamed The nature of pain is piercing and sometimes throbbing or similar to the feeling of an electric shock. for such pain, you need evaluation, maybe a scan, medications that decrease nerve pain such as carbamazepine, pregabalin, etc. Another common cause is Mastoiditis. It is an infection of the mastoid bone, which is the bone directly behind the ear. It can cause a headache behind the ear It is mostly associated with fever, discharge from the ear. In your case, it is likely possible as you have a history of ear trauma while cleaning your ear. Simply taking anti-inflammatory medication and antibiotics will help. Other cause includes temporomandibular joints (TMJ) inflammation. These joints can become inflamed and painful. there is sense jaw tightness and pain in addition to a headache behind the ear. Lastly, migraines can present in a various manner. As your having chronic headache it is also a possibility. It is important to find out the specific cause, so it can be treated appropriately. New-onset headache we like to search for red flag symptoms. This are Sudden onset of headache, the onset of headache after 50 years of age, increased frequency or severity of headache, new onset of headache with an underlying medical condition, headache with concomitant systemic illness such systemic illness (fever, stiff neck, rash)as fever, focal neurologic signs or symptoms. If these red flags are present, it needs urgent medical evaluation.

I am 41 and the dentist told me that I have bone resorption at the upper left maxillary region and I also have been recently diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Should I get the tooth extracted? Should I try again for a new third root canal? What about periodontitis which is at the beginning?","Doctor":"Hello. At first, I appreciate you because you have so much awareness of your oral health. The life span of normal root canal treated tooth is 5 to 6 years. If you have 15-year-old treated tooth, it means you are so health conscious and take care of your oral hygiene. My opinion is you should go for extraction along with cyst removal because third-time root canal of the same tooth is not a good idea. Periodontitis is nothing but an infection of gum tissue which is totally curable and depends upon your oral hygiene. Bone resorption is a kind of bone loss due to demineralization. There are many things which are responsible for that like age factor, some diseases, calcium level, gingivitis with periodontitis is also a cause of bone loss."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30 year old female. I am 8 weeks pregnant. I have been having epilepsy since 10 years. I had the last seizure a year ago. I am taking the following tablets: tablet Tegretol CR 200 (1-0-2), tablet Frisium 5 mg (0-0-2) and tablet Folic acid 5 mg (0-0-1). Can I take these tablets when I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello.  Tablet Tegretol should not be used in pregnancy. Only pregnancy-safe drugs should be taken during pregnancy. It is categorized as category D of FDA drugs in pregnancy. Category D means, there is enough evidence that it causes risk to the fetus. So, I would advise you to get back to your neurologist and discuss with him to shift you on safer anti-epileptics like Levetiracetam."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 19 year old male and I weigh 46 kg. Over the last seven months, I am suffering from fever along with chest and back pain. I also have body ache and little blocked nose but not runny nose. The mucus keeps coming out from my mouth. I have headache and I feel very tired. My stool is also not regular. It happens in every 3 days and I have no appetite. I visited a doctor, who examined me and suggested Levofloxacin and Azithromycin tablets for 5 days, Nam Cold for 10 days, pre and probiotic capsules for 10 days, Pantoprazole and Domperidone tablets for 2 months along with a cough syrup, if necessary. My question is this that I have searched about Levofloxacin and Azithromycin tablets online and found these tablets have very bad side effects. It is mentioned that it increases the risk of death and serious cardiovascular disease. So, I am very afraid to take these antibiotics. Will it increase the risk of death? I do not know what to do. Please tell me what I need to do. Is there any alternative medicine. And if I take this, will it affect my health badly? Is there any alternative home remedies or antibiotic medicines that prevents bacteria? I have not took any medicines yet. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. It is right that tablet Azithromycin might cause heart disorder like increased abnormal rhythm and this is seen usually in the elderly age group. At 19 years of age and if you have no known cardiac disease then you might take tablet Azithromycin. Tablet Levofloxacin is a safe antibiotic in adults. In your case the doctor has given a combination of tablet Levofloxacin and tablet Azithromycin. Since mucus is coming out of mouth, you probably have a bacterial infection in the throat. There are alternative antibiotics like tablet Augmentin (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate) or tablet Cefixime which have been used to treat upper respiratory infections. However, these medicines require prescriptions and to be taken in recommended dose. If you have started taking tablet Levofloxacin and tablet Azithromycin, then you can continue it for five days without any significant risk. If you have not started the medicine then you can talk to your doctor and ask him to give tablet Augmentin for five days. Tablet Nam Cold (Pseudoephedrine) is to reduce cold symptoms and some people might feel drowsy after taking this medicine. Therefore, please avoid driving after taking this. Pre and probiotic capsules will help in digestion. You do not have gastritis and vomiting therefore taking tablet Pantoprazole and tablet Domperidone combination for two months is not required. You can take this also for ten days and then stop. Please have your meal on time and include vegetables and fruits. Your diet must include 2200 kilocalories daily with vitamins and minerals. When you get up in the morning you might drink a glass of warm water and this will help in proper stool habit. Cough syrup is not required for you.

I first noticed just two months ago that my right tonsil looks like a kidney bean with a small hole on top while my left tonsil looks oval in shape with a much larger hole. My right tonsil looks like there is a lump of the bottom of it. I am 28 years old and I smoked for just under 10 years and I have not tested positive for HPV. I do not have any lumps that I can feel, have not lost any weight, do not feel regularly sick. I did have a sore throat a month ago and my left tonsil did feel infected. I did push quite a few tonsil stones from it. I am worried that the asymmetry of my tonsils may be an indicator of cancer.","Doctor":"Hi. Tonsils are our lymphoid organs which protect us from infections. The shape of tonsil can vary from person to person and asymmetrical shapes are not at all indicators for cancer. The holes you mentioned are called crypts which lodges food particles which can form stones. Hence, regular salt water gargling is advised. A sore throat you had was because of smoking which is a normal phenomenon of a tonsil infection. Hence you need not to worry thinking abnormal shapes of tonsil for cancer which is pretty much normal in all individual. Finally, regular gargling and antibiotic for a sore throat will relieve your problem. If at all tonsils are troubling you a lot, you can get them removed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am preparing for a competitive exam. For the last one year, I can hear my heartbeat (initially all the time) later mostly when I try to sleep. I have since started yoga, running, which helped me tremendously, but for a couple of months, I have not gotten back to running (with the exam approaching, in fact, I have one on day after tomorrow) and whenever I try to sleep, I cannot because I can hear my heartbeat. I am also worried about not getting enough sleep before the exam. Last year, the doctor prescribed an anti-anxiety tablet but I did not take, took up yoga, meditation instead. I have Melzap .25 (prescribed to my father by a doctor). I do not want to take it without the expert's advice.","Doctor":"Hello. You are possibly describing palpitation (when you are able to feel your heartbeat). It may be related to excessive anxiety. It is not uncommon for stress and anxiety to increase when you are preparing for a competitive exam. You are already following the right approach- yoga, running, regular exercise helps. You can also try a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. It may take 5 to 10 minutes. You can try it twice a day during the exam period. Avoid too much coffee, tea, and soft drinks. It can make your anxiety worse. Ensure you drink enough water, eat regularly and sleep enough. Melzap .25 (Clonazepam) can be used for a short term used to manage anxiety. It should not be taken for a longer period. It can make you feel drowsy sometimes. So do not take it for the first time just before exam day. Try it earlier and see whether it helps. Do not use Melzap regularly. Also, you mentioned marginally increased thyroid. Is T3, T4 increased or TSH increased? It is better to get it checked since hyperthyroidism itself can cause palpitations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. Two years back I grew some vision problem (myopia) because I think I used the phone a lot with full intensity at night. Till then my number has been increasing. Although now, I refrain from using gadgets at a high light intensity, till now I have visited the doctor about three times and every time, my number got increased. Right now my right eye's number is 2.00 and left eye's number is 1.75. I suffer from constant headache nad whether or not I wear glasses my eyes get stressed and then I grind my teeth. My questions are that with such decline in eyesight will I get blind? The last doctor I visit told me that at my age eyesight gets constant, so why mine is decreasing? What could be the cause of a headache around eyes? Why I have to apply stress to my eyes while reading or looking at far objects? Is there some exercise to cure myopia? How do you suggest LASIK treatment? Why people prefer lens rather than going for LASIK? Is LASIK harmful? What kind of food do I need to eat to cure myopia?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns and please be reassured there is nothing to worry about. This kind of myopia will not cause any blindness. Even though most people's power stabilizes by 20 to 25, few may have progression all the way to 30, it is not usual but is still normal. There are numerous causes that can lead to a headache, but the amount of myopia you have is very small to actually cause a headache. My advice is to meet with a neurologist to get things clarified. If the power of your eyes is correct, there is actually no need for you to stress while you are reading. This can, however, happen in case you have been wrongly given an increased power while you actually had no change. There are no exercises to cure myopia. Regarding LASIK, it is an older surgery, but it is quite safe. SMILE is the newer procedure. But for either of them, your power needs to be stable for at least six months. We prefer lasik to lenses because lenses if worn throughout the day, cause damage to your corneas, sometimes this damage can be permanent. Myopia is not dependent on the food you eat, but the amount of near work you do. So to lessen the progress, avoid using your mobile for a longer duration and keep them at least 30 cm away while you are looking at it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am six weeks pregnant. Before knowing that I was pregnant, I was treated for recurrent bacterial vaginosis with Metronidazole orally and Tergynan vaginally for a week approximately on weeks 4 to 5 of pregnancy. How it can harm my baby? Cause I heard that it is contraindicated in first trimester.","Doctor":"Hi. There are medications those can be advised in pregnancy as, during the antenatal period, many symptoms could occur that need to be treated. Metronidazole can be advised in pregnancy. So, do not worry and Tergynan is also antifungal antibiotic and it was advised locally, so acted locally. Actually, medications are better to avoid in the first trimester as basic organogenesis occurs. So now continue Folic acid 5 mg daily and do have scans at 13 weeks for nuchal translucency at 20 weeks for fetal detailed anomaly scan and at 22 weeks for cardiac outflow tract to be on safe side. Do not get stressed. Metronidazole is not contraindicated in pregnancy and Nystatin can be used locally."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My age is 26 and I have an issue with my blood pressure. It keeps on variating. Sometimes, it is high (150/90, 140/85, 130/90) and sometimes, normal (120/80, 110/60). I want to ask that do I have to consult a doctor and have some test? If yes, can you recommend those tests? Or do you think it is fine to have this much BP?","Doctor":"Hi. You need to test your blood pressure on a daily basis. The first thing in the morning and night time before you go to bed. You have to be resting for at least five minutes, and no food or drink for 30 minutes. Take the readings for one week. If it is, at the majority of times, above 140 then you need to consult a doctor. Otherwise, you need to have regular exercises, reduce salt, and caffeine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 33-year-old obese male. About 1 and a half years ago, I had a painful folliculitis, right below the left nipple which was cured after taking some antibiotics. It had caused a tiny bump below the left nipple, which when touched hurt. Anyways, after taking antibiotics it got healed. The place, however, continued to have a bump, but it was hollow to touch. You could press it down and when released, it would pop back up again. There was no pain. About three weeks ago, I felt pain in the exact same spot where I had folliculitis and sure enough, it was back. It was painful to touch exactly like when I first got that. So I took antibiotics and the folliculitis got cured again, in the sense that there is no longer any pain to touch it. However, the bump of the folliculitis still remains. It does not pain at all to touch no matter how hard you touch it, and the size of the bump has also lessened. However, that bump remains and feel hard underneath, though it does not hurt to touch. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. The description you have mentioned is quite classical for anetoderma. This condition arises whenever the skin's elastic and collagen fibers are damaged because of an infective or inflammatory condition. Due to the painful folliculitis, a few of these fibers in the affected area could have been damaged resulting in such condition. This can occur as a consequence of any skin disorder, it is totally benign, and if not causing any trouble best to leave it alone. However, in case you want to try something for it, you could use Tretinoin 0.025 % cream over the affected area for two hours daily."},{"Patient":"Health Query : I have thalassemia minor in the blood and I would like to know if there is a final treatment for it and if not, then what would you advise me to improve my health?

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

About three months ago it got infected. I went to my dentist, who cleaned out the infection and prescribed antibiotics. The infection did not go away, so I was prescribed antibiotics two more times. Once again, the infection is back. So over the past two months, I have gotten an infection four times and each time had been prescribed antibiotics, which seem to only temporarily fix the situation. I am at a bit of a loss for what to do because my dentist cannot seem to get rid of this infection.","Doctor":"Hi. That is hard that you got infected several times. If still infection persists, now your dentist must remove the implant and let the area heal. Maybe this foreign body is not accepted well by the immunity of your body so infection had occurred. Antibiotic coverage is enough once in a month, you are already given multiple times this means ultimately we have to remove the cause to get it right. Ask your dentist to do this removal work without much cost because five months is less period and comes under warranty period of time for an implant. Give me followup of your case in a week.

I went to my dermatologist and asked her to take a look. She was on the fence about it but decided to remove it given my history. I am blue-eyed, very fair, and my mother and maternal grandfather both had melanoma. She did a shave biopsy and the results came back as follows: junctional nevus with severe cytologic atypia and architectural disorder, inflamed pigmentary incontinence, a concerning melanocytic process with borderline qualities. It was recommended that the mole is excised with 5mm margins which I had done a few weeks later. I have two questions regarding this. First of all, my understanding is that melanoma can be tricky to diagnose in its earliest stages, so I am wondering if this could be melanoma. The word \\"borderline\\" in the path report has me the most concerned. My second question is whether or not I need anything else done regarding this mole. As I said, it was excised 5mm on all sides and the margins were clear. So, if it was an early melanoma, would there be any additional treatment?","Doctor":"Hi. I have evaluated your concerns and I think that you need to be applauded for your alertness. The steps that you have taken to manage the \\"funny\\" mole have been in the desired direction. You are right that moles can be tricky to diagnose in early stages. It so happens that they tend to be taken lightly and by the time, an individual seeks medical consultation, sometimes they have already invaded more areas. The term \\"borderline\\" in pathological reports indicate that: However, the mention of atypia and pigmentary incontinence leave little scope for doubt concerning diagnosis. In my practice, I have seen that pathologists tend to be conservative in their opinion. You took the best step to get the lesions removed. Now you only have to remain a careful observer watching for any unexpected growth, similar lesion elsewhere and follow up as advised by your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have this sudden sore at the tip of my lips.

I have gone through your complaint and have seen the attached photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are having herpes infection which is a viral infection. You should try taking a course of antiviral like tablet Acyclovir 400 mg thrice in a day for 5 days and apply a topical antibiotic like Mupirocin on the affected area twice daily. This will resolve the lesion within 4-5 days. This disease has a tendency to recur as the virus lives in the nerves of the host. Stress, ultraviolet radiation, surgery and infections can cause recurrence of the infection. This viral infection is caused by herpes virus.

My gum where my wisdom tooth used to be is swollen and feels like it is pulling away from my gums. What could be the cause and how can I make the swelling go down at home?","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question. I can understand your concern. As per your history, it looks you are having retromolar area infection. It can be because of the left root stem or cavity in adjacent tooth. To get proper advice and safe diagnosis, you need to upload pictures of the involved area. There are chances of traumatic ulcer too because sometimes the hard food in missing tooth area gets accumulated and becomes infected.

One doctor said we can pull down left upper canine using bracket and braces other said no because roots are not yet formed.","Doctor":"Hi. Regarding the impacted left upper canine, I have looked at your CBCT and OPG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). A vital piece of information. The age of the patient is not available. However, according to the present data, the upper left canine is not completely formed and also has a bend in the root. It is also placed at a much deeper and more difficult location. It can be brought down into the arch with surgical exposure and braces. However, there are certain risks with such teeth. Somtimes the tooth is joint with bone compounded by the bend in the bone and so does not respond to the pressure. In such a case, it will have to be extracted. This happens in extremely less number of cases. So it is a risk worth taking for the canine tooth since it is a very important tooth. Younger the patient, better chances."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 41, female, and sedentary. I am 100 lbs or more overweight 248 lbs at 5'4\\". I started the gym today and I walked slowly for 15 minutes. My heart rate stayed around 120 bpm. Then I stopped moving to see how fast my heart rate would go down. It went up 10 beats to 130. I checked again a minute later, it had started going down again. Why did it jump up 10 beats after I stopped moving? I have had a phisicap less than a year ago. I was told I had a good pulse, great blood pressure. I also have panic attacks so once I thought I was having a heart attack and went to the ER. They did that tripolin test two times, EKG or ECG. They took an X-ray too. I had not had a heart attack and they said my heart did not look enlarged and no signs of a blockage. So I am still paranoid though. I just have never noticed heart rate going up briskly after stopping the activity.","Doctor":"Hi. Heart rate rises because of the unconditioning due to long term sedentary lifestyle. Do regular exercise, heart rate will slowly come down. The more one is fit, more heart rate will come down immediately after stopping exercise. A decrease of 20 or more in the first minute is normal, less than 12 is abnormal due to less fit heart. You need to lose weight, eat healthily, avoid addiction to be fit. Other causes are anxiety and dehydration. Do regular exercise to be fit and to lower heart rate after exercise. If you need more information, or guidance regarding weight loss, exercise, healthy food, etc., you can always ask anytime."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old. I was wondering due to my shoulder being really bad and after doing surgery and still, even after that I am always dislocating it. I have been trying to tape it but I am not 100 % sure how to do that, so it will minimize the chances of it dislocating while snowboarding. I have been wondering whether the kino tape would be better or just a normal sports tape and if you could give me tips on how to tape my shoulder, it will be really helpful. I do exercises to try to stabilize shoulder but not with alot of progress.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your concern. In your case, taping can help you little in stabilizing the joint. However, Kinesio tape helps you to recruit or inhibit muscle and is of less help in providing stability to the joint. If you want to tape, then go for rigid tape. If you were my patient, I would honestly suggest you go to a good arthroscopic surgery and get your stabilization surgery properly and follow the proper rehabilitation protocol before attempting to start your sport. You have to first regain your stability range and strength before introducing to your sport again. If you are really keen only in taping, then tape your shoulder in that position which limits your sideways lifting and outward rotation of the shoulder which is actually a difficult position to limit. Stabilize your scapular muscles and can limit the scapular movement limiting the shoulder mobility. However, in a long run, this will not help you to make you independent.

Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Because of this, my total head feels like very tight and with this, I am not able to move my head down (but can move backward).

But still, I am facing neck, right shoulder (starting from neck till shoulder knee) stiffness.","Doctor":"Hi. Your X-ray looks fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So, nothing to worry. Yes, you can travel but if you have pain and stiffness, then you need to use a soft cervical collar-size depending on your neck length, or it can be adjustable. If you do a sitting job, then you should get up once every 15 to 20 minutes and take a small walk for two minutes everytime. For the lower back, you need to do McKenzie back extension exercises (cautiously under the guidance of a physiotherapist, as the neck should not get a lot of strain while exercising)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter is 15 months old, and it has been three weeks that she did not sleep at night. 1 to 2 hours at most and then she will cry waiting for me to bring her to the living room because she wants to play.

She will only stop crying once I brought her to the living room. I am working, so I sent her to a babysitter during the daytime. I thought she will sleep more during the daytime, but apparently, her sleep routine is just the same as before. Her babysitter said that she slept for 1 to 2 hours in the morning and the afternoon. She is healthy, so active, happy as usual and looks completely fine to me even though she does not sleep enough. Is this normal? Will this new habits affect my daughter's health or growth? What cause her sleep routine to suddenly change? (Previously she will sleep throughout the night, with 2 to 3 times milk feeding in between). What can I do to put her back to her previous sleeping habit? I really need advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Sleep habits of babies vary from one another. Your child is normal and there is no cause of concern. Most of the babies do this but become difficult to handle cause of working parents. She requires more patience. I really appreciate your concern. This will not affect her growth. Sleeping habits change because they become more active and locomotion takes priority over feeding. They like moving around. There is nothing anybody can do except handle with patience as you have been doing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a sore throat from last 15 days.

You may stop the Betadine gargle and start Benzydamine gargles diluted in water done twice daily after meals. Take a proton pump inhibitor which stops acid production twice daily before meals. Post meals, take an antacid syrup that neutralizes the acid produced. I would suggest you take an anti-inflammatory medicine to remove the congestion and edema inside the throat.

He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

The uterus measures 56x29x34 mm. The endometrial thickness measures 5 mm. Both the ovaries were well visualized and appeared bulky with multiple small follicles noted in parenchyma.

My menses date was on 26th of the same month, but I missed my menses. I had a pregnancy test after eight days and it was positive. I took the first set of abortion pills on the same day at 6:30 PM. At 10:30 PM, I started to have bleeding and the cramps and pain continued till morning 6 AM. It bled and five to six blood clots were there. I took my second set of pills at 10 AM. After that bleeding was very less, but the cramps were there. Till now I have some bleeding and small spots with an interval. Is everything working well? I want to assure that the abortion is complete. Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, you have not mentioned the name of the pills or the pack that you have taken for medical abortion. From the set of pills, I understand that you have taken two pills at 6.30 PM and then a second set of Misoprostol pills at 10 AM after 16 hours. This is a wrong protocol to use just Misoprostol pills alone and also at such a gap of 16 hours. The bleeding experienced may just be an endometrial shed and the gestational sac may not have been aborted out at all, because cytotrophoblastic invasion has not been stopped by the first pill called Mifepristone. As the bleeding has stopped it is suggested that you should get a transvaginal ultrasound done tomorrow or today to see if the sac has been aborted or not as you saw fewer blood clots and no tissue like glistening lump. I feel that you have not aborted yet as the pills have been wrongly consumed. I want you to mention the name of the pack that you have used or the name of the pills that you have consumed. There are multiple packs available and the only concern in such early pregnancy of less than seven weeks is that Mifepristone is required 36 hours prior to Misoprostol intake and then completion success rates are higher. Nevertheless, get a transvaginal ultrasound done to check for completion and review with the report."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old married woman. I have missed my period. When I tested using a Prega News kit, the result was positive. I do not like to have a baby now and I want to terminate my pregnancy with the help of MTP kit. Please advise me how and when to take medicine for termination. Do I need to take any other medicine with MTP? Please tell me in detail. I do not like to go hospital for this. Is it safe to get it done at home?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, your decision of not reporting to the doctor itself is very wrong and trying to abort at home is further wrong as MTP can lead to a lot of bleeding complications which you cannot manage at home after taking the medicine as a dosed protocol. The MTP kit (medical termination of pregnancy) is available in the market as unwanted, but the instruction to take the medication is not accurate for requirement of dose depends on the period of gestation first. Hence, it is necessary that you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy first whether it is intrauterine or ectopic. Once intrauterine confirmed, then the tablets can be taken in a scheduled manner under your local gynecologist supervision in a sequential manner with Mifepristone first and then Misoprostol. Sometimes, Misoprostol has to be continued till 2000 microgram maximum dosage in case of failed abortion with the initial dosage, which may lead to surgical abortion or D and C (dilatation and curettage). So, it is recommended that you should meet your gynecologist first and do not attempt any home abortion. It is not safe at all."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mom had headaches and backpain. So recently, my mom went for an ultrasound scan and was diagnosed with a bulky uterus. The size of her uterus is 83x41x61 mm, and they also found an intramural fibroid sized 57x33x38 mm. Could you please help me understand what exactly this means and is there any complication?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Let me start by saying that it is nothing to worry. Let me explain. Fibroids or myomas are benign or non-malignant masses arising from the muscles fibers of the uterus, usually in women with not many children (1 or 2). These masses are like stones and are hormone dependent. So, they grow till she has periods. Once periods stop, her hormone supply stops, and the fibroid starts shrinking. Intramural Fibroid never become malignant. If you randomly take scans of 100 ladies, 50 to 70% may have fibroids of different size. It is a dictum that, no asymptomatic fibroids need treatment. I would simulate it to, if you have a huge boil on the face, which does not interfere with food intake, just leave it alone. But even if you have a small boil on the inside of the mouth, it really hurts, then you may need treatment. Intramural Fibroids need treatment only if: If she has no symptoms, just leave it. It will shrink as her estrogen hormone is reduced. To further help in reducing the size and bleeding in periods, I suggest trying tablet Ormeloxifene (Sevista 60 mg or Novex DS), twice weekly. She can have it for a year or so and stop it after a scan. The fibroid would have shrunk. This medicine is cheap and has no side effects. If she is anxious or has any of the symptoms, then surgery and removal of the uterus with fibroids would be advised.

My case is about a girl who has schizophrenia and was diagnosed very early. She shows all the symptoms, like hallucinations, hearing voices, hurting other people and talking to people who are not there. My question are as follows. How can this person get counseled? Is CBT useful? If she does not seek help, what would happen to her? How can I help her if I was a counselor? What approaches can I use during our sessions and why? And lastly, what is the possible outcome?","Doctor":"Hi. CBT is usually not useful in schizophrenia when the patient is having fulminant and active symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions and hallucinations. The prerequisites for CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) are, 1. The patient should be motivated for therapy.2. The patient should understand the therapeutic alliance between therapist and himself.3. The patient should have good frustration tolerance.4. The patient must realize that the symptoms are because of his/her maladaptive thoughts, feelings and behavior. So in your case, the treatment of choice is drug therapy along with supportive treatment. As far as the prognosis is concerned, it depends upon the following: 1. The response to treatment.2. Good family support.3. The age of onset, a very early start is a bad prognostic factor.4. Treatment compliance.5. Employment status.6. The family history of mental illnesses.7. Type of schizophrenia."},{"Patient":"Hi, What should I do if I have taken seven 500 mg crocin tablets together?","Doctor":"Hi. If you indeed took 7 x 500mg crocin tablets which on the GSK website are paracetamol tablets, your total dose is 7X500mg = 3500mg of Paracetamol. The answer would depend on how heavy you are. Most of the time, the toxic dose is 200mg per kilogram. For example, if you are 70kg, the toxic dose or dangerous dose is 200X70=14000mg. So if you indeed only took 3500mg paracetamol and your calculated dose is less than the toxic dose, then it should not be a problem. However, if you have liver problems or have taken an overdose of paracetamol before, or you took paracetamol recently as well in other forms/shapes/sizes or you take other medications then this is not the case and answer. Also, if you developed pain on your stomach on the right, started vomiting, or feel unwell then you should see your doctor. If you are still worried, you should see your doctor or go to the emergency department with your tablets or tablet boxes so that the doctors know what you have been taking. Overdoses of Paracetamol are dangerous and can cause death if taken over the recommended doses.Ultimately, you should not take so much paracetamol so often and in large amounts. An adult can only take a maximum of 1g of paracetamol every 6 hours."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My periods started 14 days before and I had sex eight days back. Should I take pills after unsafe sex? If yes, what is the procedure to take I-pill?","Doctor":"Hi. According to your cycle, it is the seventh day of your menstrual cycle and considered to be safe. If you have a regular 28 day cycle, then ovulation is less likely on day seven. But, if your cycles are irregular then it is difficult to predict the exact day of ovulation as to when the chance of conception will be there. So, to be on safer side, you should take a pill today only. It is known as morning-after pill or pill 72 (Levonorgestrel 150 mcg) to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex only once. Yes, you can get a withdrawal bleeding after taking these pills before your next due date. In case 72 hours have crossed after sexual intercourse, then also you can prevent pregnancy in this cycle by getting a copper-T (intrauterine device) inserted and that too within five days of unprotected sex."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have schizoaffective disorder.

Did you develop these tremors only after starting medication or did you have some form of shaking even before medication? Both Abilify (Aripiprazole) and Cymbalta (Duloxetine) are known to be associated with tremors. Have you discussed these tremors with your treating doctor or psychiatrist? You need to be assessed for signs of extrapyramidal side effects. Abilify (Aripiprazole) is a proper medication for your condition. Any medication can come with side effects. So after assessment, your doctor can either optimize the dose of the medication or if appropriate consider a medication like Pacitane (Trihexyphenidyl) to control these symptoms.

But, it was lighter than the normal periods and it lasted for five days. Then for six days, I had lower abdominal pain, back pain, small acne, and headaches. I took a home pregnancy test after 22 days of the second intercourse and it came back negative. I was normal after that with no pain. There was only a small acne present. Now, it has been exactly a month for the incident to have taken place and I am feeling bloated. I have weight gain and my breasts are a little sensitive. Is this because of the change in hormones? Or are my periods going to come? Or am I pregnant? I am very tensed. A detailed answer would be highly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, let me tell you that there is no chance of pregnancy. Usually, ovulation occurs between the 12th to the 16th day of periods or better said as 14 days before the periods. Life of egg is 24 hours and that of sperm is 72 hours. So, there was no chance of egg and sperm meeting on the 24th day of the period as the egg would never have been alive for that long. So there was need of a pill at all in the first instance.  I-pill is a high dose of progesterone hormone. The same hormone which is produced in your body in the second half of the period after ovulation. This pill will suddenly increase the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus making it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy to implant. As it was a single dose, it had no strength to stand on, so it fell off and you got periods or bleeding from the increased thickness within seven to 10 days of taking the pill. This bleeding would have been thick, in fleshy pieces, dark red or brown, with slight lower abdominal pain until the bleeding is really reduced. So if you take one i-pill, it would make the endometrial lining unfavorable for an embryo to sit there, a second i-pill is never needed. Repeated use of i-pills in such short span will only disturb the hormonal balance and the subsequent periods. If at all the embryo had formed, which is not possible from the calculations you have given, then your urine would have been positive after 14 to 16 days of sex, which you said was negative. All the symptoms you have mentioned are due to the progesterone hormone. This is the i-pill and incidentally the same hormone that supports the pregnancy. So, just forget about it and relax. If you feel that the periods are getting irregular and different in amount then I suggest you just have any of the birth control pills like tablet Ovral-G (Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol) or Dear 21 (Ethinyl Estradiol and Levonorgestrel) or Novelon (Ethinyl Estradiol and Desogestrel) or Duoluton-L (Ethinyl Estradiol and Levonorgestrel) or Intimacy plus 0.03 (Ethinyl Estradiol and Desogestrel) one tab at night for 21 days. I am advising it not for the contraceptive benefit but for its hormonal level correction. You can have it for 21 days and stop and then the next periods will be within four to seven days. Further cycles too will be regular. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicines with their consent. I suggest you can have the same pills cyclically for further contraception. Hope I have clarified your query and do write back if you have any more queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having major pain in the back bottom right side of my mouth where my wisdom tooth is pushing in. I can see the wisdom tooth. What can I do for pain since the earliest my dentist can see me is in a week?","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question I can understand your concern. You need to use Hydrogen peroxidase 3% mouth wash. Make sure the concentration must not be more than that. You can also use antibiotics only after consulting your dentist. You can also provide further details of your medical history or any drug allergy, including the pictures of erupting tooth so that I can offer you a better opinion and treatment plan. Wisdom tooth eruption. IOPAR x-ray. Impaction. Pericoronitis. Mouth wash and antibiotics. Avoid sticky foods."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am facing problem of missing periods from last month. Pregnancy test is negative. I have also taken tablets of Meprate. My last period was 62 days back. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. Period normally starts within a week of finishing Meprate (Medroxyprogesterone) tablets. Rarely it can take 15 days for period to start. If it has been more than 15 days since last dose, you need to visit gynecologist to get one ultrasound done, as Meprate will be effective only if your endometrial thickness is good, ≥ 7mm. If it has been less than 15 days since last dose, you can wait. If there is strong suspicion of pregnancy no harm will be done by repeating pregnancy test. Meprate will not induce period if you are pregnant."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have queries regarding my mom's health. She is suffering from some abdominal issues. When she had a CT scan, they found an impression with the liver. I attached her report and please tell me if there is a serious issue. Yesterday she got admitted with intolerable abdominal pain. Her doctor asked us whether she had any injuries on that area. But she never had any injuries. They prescribed some medicine and asked her to take an injection for two days. She was discharged home in the evening and last night she got severe abdomen pain. She is worrying a lot and crying all the time. She is getting pain while she coughs. She is unable to sleep and has constipation. I totally rely on you to get suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi. According to the CT scan report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there are two problems. In the liver, there is hemangioma which is a benign tumor meaning it does not cause any harm. If it increases in size, then it is resected. The other problem is with the muscles of the abdominal wall in which a small amount of blood is accumulated which is causing pain. It can occur after some trauma or injury to the site. It will also resolve in a few days. So I think hopefully she will get fine in a few days. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing pain in my left wrist for a month now. I had x-rays and a CT scan showing normal, but the pain continues. A few years back, I had ulnar nerve relocation surgery from a fall on ice in the same arm. Could the nerve be the reason I am having this wrist issue?","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned pain in your wrist region for a month now. Also, you have mentioned previous ulnar nerve transposition surgery. Since your pain is localized to your wrist region, it seems unlikely that your ulnar nerve is involved because neuropathic pain is usually a radiating kind of pain in the distribution of the nerve. Also, there may be symptoms like numbness, paresthesias (abnormal electrical shock-like sensations) and weakness, which you have not mentioned. Also, no abnormalities in x-ray and CT scan means that the bones and joint alignment is all right and not a cause of pain. This also means that there is a soft tissue affection which is leading to your symptoms, so it could be due to ligaments around the wrist region, inflammation of tendons which we call as tendinitis, ganglion, etc., besides many others. Tendinitis or ligament sprain. MRI wrist (If no improvement in 3 weeks time or earlier if any worsening is present). 1) To wear a wrist brace for a period of 2-3 weeks. 2) Ice packs for local application. 3) Gentle anti-inflammatory medication like Ibuprofen or Paracetamol can be taken whichever suits your body. 4) Physical therapy We shall wait for 2-3 weeks to see the effect of this treatment protocol, also if you develop any swelling, or any other inflammation, kindly get back to an orthopedician and traumatologist online."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am experiencing tingling sensation of the scalp on left side of my head. The medications which I am taking are Zyprexa, Prozac Sonata, Neurontin, Tramadol and Metformin. Will any of these medications cause this tingling sensation?","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you that everything is going to be fine soon. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concerns. This is due to the side effect of medications you are on. It is relatively a minor side effect and is usually self limiting and not an issue of medical concerns.  Many of my patients come with tremors of the eye muscles or facial muscle tremors too along with the scalp muscle tingling. All your medications are fine and nothing has to be changed because, this is just a temporary adverse reaction to them and will go away on its own.  If I extrapolate my clinical expertise, I want to make sure you do not have the start of any neurological abnormality, as such kind of tremors may also be due to some associated neurologic disease. So, having said that, do you have some other neurological manifestations or any kind of disease symptoms other than this in any part of the body? Keep taking all the medicines. Your Metformin is least likely to cause such a side effect of muscle tingling. All others do have an impact of variable intensity. Avoid tea, coffee, diet or regular soda, energy drinks, alcohol, cigarette first hand and passive smoking, e-cigarette vaping, etc.  Take plenty of water and keep a proper physical activity. Cardio exercises are best for you. It will raise the blood flow to the scalp vessels and will keep the emissary veins of the scalp well flushed and will help relieve the symptoms.  Join any fitness club where sauna, swimming, steam bath, cardio exercises are available and follow the instructions of the instructor there. Your BMI (37.11) is high and it means you also have a higher fat content. And the drugs' fat distribution also contributes to side effects of drugs. Try to take your BMI down within the limit of 18-25.  Proper rest and meditation is best treatment for you right now. Also try recreational and meditational activities with your family."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

When I woke up this morning, I started feeling itches here and there in my body. I also got two blisters on the top of my toe where the bee had stung.","Doctor":"Hello. With the conversation we had, I understand that you were bitten by a bee yesterday (insect bite) on your toe and today you have blisters, itching, and swelling. Based on the information you gave, I have suggested some measures as well as some medications. Please wash the toe with lukewarm water and see carefully if any part of the sting (sharp organ of the bee) is left in the toe where it stung. If so you must contact your local doctor who can do the needful steps to remove the sting. If not, then apply some antibacterial cream (like Mupirocin ointment or Betadine ointment) over the blisters. Apply the cream twice daily and wash off with lukewarm water before the next application. Wear comfortable footwear that does not rub over the affected part. Next, to get relief from itching, take an antihistaminic tablet. Antihistaminics that you may take are Levocetirizine 5 mg once a day (if effects wean off, then take twice a day) or Cetirizine 10 mg once a day. If there is pain take a painkiller (Paracetamol 650 mg) if needed. If there is severe swelling and that is increasing with days you need to consult with your doctor to see if it has caused an infection. Increasing pain, pus from the blisters, change of color of surrounding normal skin, fever are some other symptoms showing worsening of the condition or infection. If you are a diabetic with poor sugar control, you run an increased risk of developing an infection. In such a case depending on the severity of infection, anti-bacterial agents have to be instituted. Take rest and do not move the affected toe a lot. Eat plenty of nutritious food and take 4 liters of water per day (this should be the case normally). Especially so now because when you take medicines, the body needs abundant water to take care of metabolism."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am suffering from jock itch for two months.

As bleeding is expected after taking two pills, how should I take the next two pills vaginally? Would it be less effective if I take the third dose orally and not vaginally?","Doctor":"Hi. Using oral medications after seven weeks of pregnancy may lead to heavy bleeding. Please ensure that you can attend a hospital with blood bank facility in your easy reach if any mishap of such kind happens. The Misoprostol tablets 200 mcg into four tablets should be inserted high inside the vagina after 48 hours of tablet Mifepristone intake. In case, you already start bleeding after Mifepristone (occurs in 30% of cases) ingestion, take two tablets on the third day morning (ie, around 36 hours) and two tablets in the evening.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I discontinued Risperidone two months ago. I have not had any psychotic symptoms. I believe my schizoaffective disorder is in remission. However, can Risperidone continue to have an effect two months after taking it? If so what is the maximum amount of time Risperidone continue to have an effect? I took it for four years and took 5 mg twice daily. I am a 44-year old male. I also take Buproprion 75 mg once daily.","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have taken Risperidone for four years, the brain circuits and its neurotransmitters had been under control. The medicine though it might have been washed out from your body, the effect of it remains for a few weeks to months and your brain circuits may start functioning abnormally after few months and once your symptoms come up again, the dose at which you were taking may not be sufficient to control the symptoms later. So, I advise you to immediately restart medications and do regular follow up with the doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is pregnant for about five weeks. So the doctor suggested Duphastone three times, JC Folate one time, Myocyst two times a day. My wife has got miscarriage two times before that and she was also treated for PCOD last one year. I am scared about Duphastone.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the case summary. As she has had PCOD, in such patient, there is a deficiency of pregnancy hormone Progesterone. So we have to give from outside to support pregnancies. There is a history of two miscarriages. Can you tell me where did they occur and at what time of gestation was the heartbeat present? When the ultrasound was done? I think we should start tablet Ecosprin 75 mg once a day if not yet started. There is no fear about Duphaston as it is safe during pregnancy. Many studies have been done to know about the safety of Duphaston. So you should not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a whitish lump at the back of my throat located on the posterior wall. I suffer badly from post nasal drip but not sure if this is related, doctors seem unsure and I am worried sick. Any input as to what this could be? Suffer from GERD, post nasal drip, have had blood at the back of throat over the area of concern previously (when the lump was not visible).","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern, it is most likely submucosal lymphadenitis of the posterior pharyngeal wall. This may develop secondary to chronic infection of the nose, paranasal sinuses, and throat. To confirm the diagnosis, you may go for MRI neck and FNAC from the lump. Most of the time it is reported as non-specific reactive hyperplasia which is not a problem and maybe leave as such but if anything special comes in FNAC then that may be plan for treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Today is CD6. Yesterday, I started taking Clomid for CD5 to 9. CD10 is scheduled for cervical polypectomy. The night before instructed to take Misoprostol. Can I try to conceive this month right after a cervical polyp removal? The polyp is very small in the cervix.","Doctor":"Hi. If a cervical polyp is removed anytime, there will be some fresh blood. So it is not advisable to have any medication for pregnancy, in the same cycle as the removal. As blood is not a good medium for sperms, sperm motility is reduced or stopped by blood components. You can try for pregnancy, but when there is blood with a raw area in the cervical canal, sperm health may be reduced. You can have sexual contact after bleeding stops, usually which stops within 2 to 3 days. Next periods your chances will be better. Better use Clomid from the next cycle."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had my periods on 2nd of this month that ended on 6th. After having the intercourse on 9th, I ate Option 72 on 10th at 8 AM. But now my periods came on 15th again. I had clot once and bleeding is also not very much. Am I pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have taken an emergency pill within 72 hours of intercourse, there is no chance of pregnancy. This could be because of hormonal changes due to the pill you have taken. So relax and do not worry. However, if you have a doubt, then get back to me. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi.. Doctor, I'm having a situation here..

But it has been maybe two weeks now and I still cannot lean on it or touch it in any way. If I do, pain shoots straight through my elbow and down my arm until I even feel a tingle in my fingers. It is not swollen, bruised or shows signs of injury in any way other than the pain. Do you think it is serious and should be checked out, or did I just hit it hard enough that even though there is no marking, it is just sore this long?","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear that an accidental hit to your elbow is troubling you a lot. By the looks of it (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you do not seem to have any bony injury, especially if you are able to move your elbow (flex and extend it) without pain. The only thing that I can think of is that you might have injured your ulnar nerve which is just behind the medial edge of the elbow. This would be more likely if the tingling sensation that you are getting is along the little and ring finger of your hand, which would be more if you tap just behind the medial aspect (inner aspect) of your elbow. If this is the case it should usually get better in 6 to 8 weeks. But if you feel that the symptoms are increasing or you are developing numbness or weakness in hand or wasting of muscles of hand (which is very rare), you would need to see a doctor. If you do not have the above signs then it might be just a soft tissue contusion which should get better in 3 to 4 weeks. If you are having pain on flexing and extending the elbow, you need to see a doctor and probably get an X-ray done."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am six weeks pregnant. I have struggled with GERD and esophagitis for years and my gastroenterologist put me on Nexium, which is the only thing that helps. I usually do a two-week treatment every year. My pregnancy is exacerbating the GERD. I just finished a two-week Nexium treatment and today my symptoms are worse than ever, and the acid is constantly in my throats and mouth. Is it safe to continue taking the Nexium beyond two weeks while pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, the symptoms can get exacerbated during pregnancy. Nexium is a relatively safe acid-suppressing drug in pregnancy. You can continue it when you have symptoms. The other alternative is tablet Ranitidine. You can add tablet Ondansetron 4 mg twice daily for a week 30 minutes before food. This also helps in reducing reflux. The other safe alternative is Doxylamine tablet. Avoid heavy meals, rather take short frequent feeds. Stay upright or move around for one hour after feeds. Do not lie immediately after food. Avoid reflux promoting foods like excess coffee."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am currently not taking any medication. I am 23 years old, 4'11\\", 115 pounds. There is burning, itching, and passed some discharge, milky like discharge on the inside of labia minora, just thin layers being wiped off, small like cuts or something are there along with redness, burns when I pee too. I was on Ciprofloxacin for UTI about two weeks ago and Fluconazole for yeast infection. I did not finish antibiotic, still have six pills left. I did not take and only took one yeast infection pill instead of two. I just took it again because I started having this problem again after my period ended. However, I have had a new sex partner within that time frame and do not know if I am fine. I bought one of those vaginal infection kits to test and the stick stayed yellow. It never changed blue or green which meant normal acidity. So, should I still worry about STD or does this sound like recurring yeast infection and UTI?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the case summary. I think your fungal infection of vagina and UTI are still not resolved as I can see you having so much of fungal infection (attachment removed to protect patient identity) plus you have not taken your antibiotics properly. So get urine routine examination and culture again and get blood sugar fasting also. We can also get a high vaginal swab for culture and sensitivity if the infection is not getting resolved. As you are having recurrent infection plus get your partner tested for semen culture and clinical exam to rule out STD as the male partner are usually carrier and do not exhibit symptoms in some infections. Candidal infection. Urine routine and culture, fasting blood sugar, get high vaginal swab culture. For the partner, urine routine culture, semen culture. UTI, vaginitis. Will start antibiotic after the culture report. For vaginal infection use Clotrimazole vaginal pessary daily for seven days. Apply antifungal with steroid combination cream locally to relieve itching and burning of private parts. Just clean your private parts with normal temperature water and do not let it remain wet."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25.

Will I be able to be normal in future like others from past 10 days? I am getting pain near knee cap region. Even after three months post operatively.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. In my opinion, it will take another 6 to 8 weeks for you to start running. I hope you got your movement range completely in your joint. Now, do your rehabilitation and weight training properly as advised. You can start walking normally. The pain what you are referring could be due to muscle stiffness or soreness. Get a gentle massage done for your thigh and leg muscles. Do not strain your joint. This should help you to get rid of the pain and the discomfort."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Five days ago (for the first time in my life) I went to the emergency room of the local hospital. I had awakened at 3 AM with severe dizziness and nausea. We determined that it was probably caused from an accidental overdose of Tamsulosin. I have gradually improved but to only about 80 % of my previous stability. I am still a bit wobbly, especially when I am tired at the end of the day. This morning my hearing seems affected. It is kind of like they feel when full of water, the sounds seem slightly muted except for sharp sounds which are almost painful.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. You need to perform tympanometry and pure tone audiometry to assess the condition of your middle ears, inner ears, and cochlear nerves. The attack which you have experienced can be an acute vestibular attack but the accurate diagnosis needs initially the previous audiological investigations plus videonystagmography (VNG). Before audiological tests, you have to stop any medications for dizziness for three days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Based on descriptive history, I come to the conclusion that it started off as a viral infection (a sore throat) and has progressed to a secondary bacterial infection which has manifested as a cough with phlegm and due to phlegm accumulation in your sinuses, you are experiencing strange sensations in your head. I would advise you to go for saline gargles (lukewarm water with a pinch of salt added) and Betadine sore throat gargles alternatively till you get your throat clear. Try swallowing a tablespoon of honey twice a day to soothen your throat. Start a course of Azithromycin antibiotic as it is the best suited for such respiratory infection and you will only have to take three tablets in a total of 500 mg once a day for three days. And start an expectorant cough syrup which has Guaphenisin in the contents, take 10 ml each thrice a day, it will relieve you of the phlegm.

Medicines: 100 units of slow Insulin, Valsartan 320 mg, Amlodipine 10 mg, Escitalopram 10 mg, Xiidra eye drops. After years of high HbA1c of around 10.5 last year has averaged around 6.5. HBP runs around 150/105. I have managed to radically improve glucose control over the last year but my blood pressure has remained the same. I have some retinopathy issues and my ophthalmologist and optometrist want my glucose to stay at or below 6.5 and my BP to be 120/70. I have tried a variety of diuretics like HCTZ, Spironolactone, and Chlorthalidone, each for about 3 to 4 months but I suffer from severe dehydration whenever I take a diuretic. My eye doctors also tell me that diuretics can worsen the inflammation associated with both my dry eye and retinopathy.

I have already had a period for a year and a half?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your concern very carefully. You are worried about your height. It is an important issue of everyone’s life. Usually, growth occurs up to 18 years. After that growth ceases. Growth depends on various factors like familial, nutritional, pathological. The highest rate of growth occurs between 9 years to 14 years of age when puberty occurs. Because in this time, gonadal hormone starts to release. According to international recognized institute CDC, normal height of girl at the end of 18 years is 60 to 68 inches. Your height is 60 inches. So you are in normal height and your age is in growing years. There are still chances of growing in height further up to 18 years. So, you should not be worried. But if still, you are worried, you should do some test to check whether the normal level is normal and not. Estrogen, LH, and FSH, testosterone, growth hormone. You can also contact with an endocrinologist to take a decision about growth hormone therapy. I hope the above information will help you a lot."},{"Patient":"Results from an HSG procedure showed that I have a bicornuate uterus or a thick septum. Both Fallopian tubes are patent. But there is an abnormal position of the uterine body, possibly due to a cystic nodularity in the right adnexa, displacing the entire uterine body toward the left side of the pelvic cavity.  Currently trying to conceive and I'm pretty concerned about the complications with both fertility and pregnancy due to the potential above diagnosis.  Further clinical evaluation is recommended. What can be done to fix this and/or make the changes for a healthy full-term pregnancy?  Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query woman may never need treatment for a bicornuate uterus. If it is required, the surgery is known as a Strassman metroplasty. This surgery may be recommended if a woman has repeated miscarriages and bicornuate uterus is thought to be the cause. Performing this procedure, as a solution to infertility, is controversial, as the majority of research carried out suggests that having a bicornuate uterus will not affect a woman’s chances of falling pregnant. Some evidence suggests that problems, such as miscarriage and early birth, are more likely in women with the condition, though it does not rule out a successful pregnancy and natural delivery. Women with a bicornuate uterus who do become pregnant should have additional monitoring and checkups throughout their pregnancy, to minimize risk and identify any problems early on. It’s not necessary that all those with this condition will get problems with fertility or pregnancy but the chances are more especially if it’s septate uterus where there’s full septum diving uterus into two. Sometimes it can’t be established on imaging and laparoscopic view may be necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

She is facing real difficulty in doing household work. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello Sir. Asthma has many triggers. They are cold weather, dust, mist, rain and as you said, pollution is also a cause. Since her symptoms do not come down with Deriphyllin, I am suggesting the following. She needs one antibiotic to completely remove the pathogen. Also some medications to reduce cold and wheezing. Once her symptoms are reduced, we can start single-drug therapy for a month to prevent wheezing coming back again. All the above medications have to be taken twice a day. She will get some sleep due to these medications. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. How to use the inhaler?

Recently I noticed that my left eye is red without pain or irritation, but red as the color of the pink eye. I do not know if it is the contact lenses which is causing the redness. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. It can be an infection, but one thing you must remember is contact lenses should ideally be used 8 to 10 hours a day. If you wear during sleep and for more than 10 hours a day, there is a possibility of the eyes developing infection and transparency of cornea getting decreased over a long time.  You must stop wearing contact lenses till your eyes are clear. Start wearing spectacles. Contact lenses related bacterial conjunctivitis or corneal hypoxia. Detailed slit lamp examination. Start using antibiotic eye drops and artificial tears eye drops."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 29 year old woman with a history of recurrent miscarriages (3 losses, all in 5-6 weeks). I was recently diagnosed with Grave's disease (I had overt hyperthyroidism with my last miscarriage). Now my levels are in check. I had APS, ANA and thrombophilia panels, all perfect except for heterozygous MTHFR A1298C. I have added more folate to my diet (2mg instead of 0.4mg). I am now 4 weeks and 1 day with my 4th pregnancy. I am taking PTU 75mg, Progesterone 400mg (300 orally, 100 vaginally), Prednisone 10mg and Folate 2mg. Yesterday at 4 weeks (2 weeks since conception) I measured my estradiol since I had never measured it with my other pregnancies. It came out at 186 pg/ml. Is my estradiol good enough? I have read studies that say estradiol levels are prognostic for a viable pregnancy but did not specify the numbers. With my last pregnancies, I lost them by bleeding and I have read that estradiol prevents that. Should I supplement with 1-2mg/day? Is there anything else I should be doing?","Doctor":"Hi. Your estradiol level appears to be fine if pregnancy happened naturally (that is not through treatment like ovarian stimulation). Though studies associate low estradiol levels with viability, the association is indirect (indirectly indicating defective egg formation/folliculogenesis, with resultant defective corpus luteum). Estrogen supplementation to improve viability in natural pregnancy is not studied well. In fact, it is only the health of embryo, which determines viability (and it cannot be altered through medicines), second hypothesized intervention being progesterone support (which you are already taking). As other causes like APA, thrombophilia is already ruled out, you do not need medicines for that. Regarding MTHFR mutation, if your homocysteine levels were high, it is better to take Vitamin B6 and B12 supplements along with Folate. If levels were normal, those supplements are not normally needed. If levels were not checked, you can get it checked or start supplements, as there is no harm in taking water-soluble vitamins. So, in summary, estrogen supplementation is not known to improve viability/prolong pregnancy, and is not needed. Vitamin B6 and B12 supplementation may be helpful if you had elevated homocysteine levels. Wish you good luck."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have allergies to dust and temperature changes. I get headaches frequently around my eyes. I breathe through the mouth during the night and sometimes in the day. My nose is almost always blocked. I also have huge under eye bags, a protruding brow bone, and a bigger lower lip because of mouth breathing. My tongue is usually white with foul breath and my ears have a little more than normal wax. I had adenoids as a kid and my parents left it untreated. Some doctors say I might have sinusitis while some say it is just an allergy. I had an NCCT PNS and it showed inverted 'S' shaped mildly deviated septum. Doctors suggest septoplasty, but I am skeptical about it as I do not think it will cure my problem. I think my cure lies somewhere else but I am not able to find it. Your help would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. Let us discuss your problems one by one. Before you undergo any surgery for this issue(s), you must know for sure if you have an allergy. Allergy is a form of hypersensitivity by your body to substances which do not elicit such a response from other individuals. Also, there is no known cure for allergy. We can, however, keep it under wraps using our medications. Hence, for someone who has allergy, we only give a guarded prognosis for surgeries, which means the success of surgery performed on such a person will be less because he has an allergy. Going back to your problem, only such a deviated septum that causes nose block almost always without any respite with nose drops and steam, do we advise septoplasty. A gross deviated septum increases your chances of contracting rhinitis (infections of nose) due to increased air currents and alterations in normal clearance mechanisms of the mucosa. This can aggravate your mouth breathing and headaches. Headaches around the eyes, like how you have described, could be due to sinusitis. Sinuses are air-filled cavities in your skull and facial bones which open into the nose through a small hole called ostium. The ostia of sinuses could get blocked due to mucosal edema which could be due to infections or non-infectious swellings. Blocking of the ostia result in poor ventilation of sinuses and hence sinus ache. Nose drops when applied in apt positions will gain access to the ostia and reduce the edema around it, increasing its diameter, to allow for better ventilation of sinuses. To confirm whether you have an allergy, you may undergo a few blood investigations like serum IgE (immunoglobulin E which is increased in blood in those with allergy) and AEC (Absolute Eosinophil Count). If the counts are higher, then we may institute you on nasal steroid sprays which have to be taken for a month or two or longer. These sprays control allergic responses very well in most individuals. If after the spray, your symptoms are getting better, you may forget the surgery. This advice is based on what information you have provided. I am giving you some general measures which you may practice: Hope you get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Last February, I have had an ear infection from cleaning my left ear too often with a q tip. I went to the hospital and was prescribed Aplosyn otic drops, Celebrex, and an antibiotic which starts with a letter L (I forgot it as I lost the prescription. I am sorry). I took it for a week and went back to the doctor to have me flushed. He told me my eardrum was not perforated. All went well until two nights ago. I gently cleaned my left ear with a q tip after shower before going to sleep. I woke up the following morning with mild pain in my ear (maybe because I was sided left all throughout my sleep and have put so much pressure on it). Today I used a mirror to have a look at it. It looks like it has pus again and the moderate pain now is up to my left neck. What should I do? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I know how frustrating this problem can get. You can follow the advice mentioned below. 1. Please stop using earbuds q-tips as they introduce infections into a sensitive region such as the ear. 2. If there is pus coming out of your ear, there is a possibility of you developing an ear infection that may or may not involve the eardrum. 3. Take tablet Amoxicillin 500 mg with Potassium Clavulanate 125 mg combination one tablet thrice times a day after food for one week. Along with this, you can also take a combination of Paracetamol, Phenylephrine, and Levocetirizine one tablet twice daily for one week. 4. Keep your ears closed with sterile cotton and change it every six hours. 5. Do not allow any water or air to enter into your ear as it can keep getting infected and pus or ear discharge will start once again. 6. In a case where if by chance there is perforation of the eardrum, it will close on its own once the discharge subsides. Do not worry about it, you will be completely fine in a week's time.

I am using to treat a back/chest problem I had two years back which the doctor prescribed Inozith-250 for me. I used the same drug when I had a similar problem and I am well.","Doctor":"Hello. No, Azithromycin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanate potassium work via different mechanisms. Azithromycin is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. Azithromycin is a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thus stopping bacterial growth. That is, it is bacteriostatic. Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death thus it is a bactericidal compound while Clavulanic acid is a β-lactam drug that functions as a mechanism-based β-Lactamase inhibitor (an enzyme secreted by many bacteria for their defense against Amoxicillin). While not effective by itself as an antibiotic, when combined with penicillin-group antibiotics, it can overcome antibiotic resistance in bacteria that secrete β-lactamase, which otherwise inactivates most Penicillins. The doctor may have prescribed Azithromycin 250 mg twice a day earlier to you for maybe congestion or cold or some other problem but I would advise you to visit a physician in person and then take the medication. Then it would be of much benefit to you. For more information consult a pharmacologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 28 year old male and a regular smoker.

But now, for almost 3 years I am stuck with regular gold flake.Now, I am desperate about quitting smoking. I tried not to smoke for a day. But the next day, I would return back to the same. Recently, I came to know about a chewing gum called nicotex. It comes in 2 mg and 4 mg form. But I am not sure about this product. So my question is, does cipla nicotex chewing gum help in quitting smoking? Also to buy this chewing gum, do I need a doctor's prescription?","Doctor":"Hello. As you have been a chronic smoker since last 10 years smoking 10-15 cigarettes per day, the body is presently addicted to nicotine and hence if you intend to leave it for a day, the nicotine withdrawal sets in. This may include: These Nicotex chewing gums have nicotine in them in varying concentrations which allow a sustained but minimal release of nicotine while chewing. This nicotine is absorbed through buccal mucosa thus not allowing the withdrawal symptoms to become evident, but the benefit is that you are free from most of the side effects of smoking per se, especially the smoke entering into lungs which may lead to lung diseases in future. This is a substitute to nicotine supplementation and is being prescribed for chronic smokers who wish to discontinue it slowly by following the principle of slow desensitization. These are available off the counter and no prescription is required for the same. You may try it and try to reduce your smoking urges. In the end, Nicotex can just help you in a way but you need to develop a will to quit smoking and that is very important. You may try and see how you respond to it as every person responds differently to its use. It has been seen to give successful outcomes, but again will power is still the most important thing behind quitting smoking."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 21 years old. I am addicted to masturbation. Now suddenly, I got muscle spasm and body pain. Can masturbation cause nervous system diseases?","Doctor":"Hello. Masturbation is a universal habit. It is present in most human beings. It helps to maintain sexual hormone levels, acts as a stress buster, and in males it protects against prostate problems and cancer. Also, the old sperms are pushed out of the body, to make way for new sperms. Old sperms need to be removed. This happens through sex usually. If sex is not happening, then through masturbation. If both are not happening, then via nightfall. A person can masturbate safely depending on his health status.

I have tried lots of medicines but there is no improvement. Because of the current scenario of COVID-19, I cannot visit any ENT specialist. Please help me and prescribe some medicines.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, I understand how frustrating your problem can be. Sinusitis is usually secondary to a certain problem such as allergy (which is the most common cause, once other rare causes are ruled out). So considering the treatment of this particular issue, we need to always treat the primary from its root source so that the effect remains for a longer time with the least amount of medications. What can be done? If you are having underlying allergic issues such as sneezing, watery nasal discharge, ear fullness, heaviness in the head, and facial regions, we need to treat the allergy first. You need to wear an n95 mask (and nothing else other than that) to prevent any irritative substance such as dust, fumes from entering your nose, and initiating the allergic cascade mechanism leading to its symptoms. Wearing a mask even at home, avoiding exposure to dust and other substances which instigate sneezing according to me is the single most important factor which you have to take care of as other things mentioned below are all for symptomatic relief and we are not treating the allergy as such, precisely speaking. Take tablet Sinarest (Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and Pseudoephedrine) one tablet two times a day after food for 10 days, Allegra-M (Fexofenadine and Montelukast) one tablet two twice for 10 days, Duonase nasal spray two puffs in both nostrils twice daily for three continuous months (do not inhale while applying the spray), tablet Mucomix 600 mg one tablet twice daily for 10 days. Do steam inhalation two or three times a day for supportive relief. Take Wysolone 10 mg once a day after breakfast for 10 days, tablet Pan D (Pantoprazole) one tablet before breakfast for 10days, Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for one month. Saltwater gargles 8 to 10 times a day will keep irritative substances away from the throat. All these medications will be useful only if you strictly follow the precautionary measures. The requirement of medications will automatically reduce once your symptoms come down with a decreased allergic load. Please do get a noncontrast CT (computed tomography) of the nose and paranasal sinuses and show it to me once you get it done in the subsequent follow-ups. I advise you for a follow up after two weeks of treatment, so I can evaluate and let you know about the further requirement of medications. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Painful and hard lump, growing larger day by day on labia minora. Trouble walking and sitting due to discomfort. Red and hot to the touch. Due to friction when walking, it started seeping pus with a little blood. Drained a lot and lump became smaller and slightly less painful, but the lump is still there and still hard to touch.","Doctor":"Hello. This is left sided labial abscess. Get incision and drainage along with that, the pus should be sent for culture and sensitivity. In the meantime broad spectrum antibiotic like Ampicillin with Clavulanic acid 625 mg three times a day for seven days along with anti-inflammatory medicine. Mostly infected. Pus for culture and sensitivity, VDRL, HIV. Labial abscess.

There is no way I will be relaxed. Is there any option they would do for me to be more comfortable?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, this is the only way to get local anesthesia. You can also go for general anesthesia but it will be too costly and needs hospitalization. It is a simple procedure, and you will only feel a prick like an insect bite. Do not worry, it is simple and there will be no pain during the procedure. If you are too apprehensive tell your doctor that apply some local anesthesia at the site of the prick, you will then even not feel the prick too."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 20 years old and my problem is that I have a tight opening of the penis. This is very painful when I jerk it off.","Doctor":"Hi. It is called as phimosis. Try to use steroid cream for 10 days and massage the skin. Try to retract the skin and clean the secretion beneath the prepuce. Keep the area clean because steroid cream may lead to infection if not taken care appropriately. Betamethasone ointment twice a day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got hit on the left side on cervical region almost two years from now. MRI does not show any injury or significant stenosis but the electromyography shows left moderate radiculopathy C5-C8 and recent results showed deterioration. Symptoms also still exist on left arm and trapezius but recently for the first time, I started feeling some irritations in the left leg too. My questions are the following: How this will progress you think? MRI shows nothing significant anatomically but radiculopathy deteriorates and emg results. Is this possible you think to start having the same problems in the leg too? This will constitute kind of myelopathy. Is it?","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that as there are no signs of myelopathy or spinal canal compression on MRI, there is no reason to panic about myelopathy. The pain in this region is related to the nerve damage. Physiotherapy can help improve your situation. I would also recommend trying a cervical collar during pain exacerbation. I do not think that it will progress. It is also important avoiding heavy weight lifting and use an orthopedic pillow. Regarding the irritation on the leg, I would recommend performing a lumbar spine X-ray study in order to investigate for possible chronic degeneration or the lumbar vertebral column, which may mimic this clinical situation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is suffering from a kind of skin infection. This infection occured across his fingers and leg. I am attaching photographs for the same.","Doctor":"Hello. I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

Psoriasis usually presents as dry, red, well defined, scaly patches on extensors like the elbow, knee, scalp, knuckles, etc. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 17 years old. She has cold allergies and at the time of cold, she gets a fever and she gets weak and after taking some of the medicine, her fingers start to vibrate. So what kind of medicine should I give?","Doctor":"Hello. Colds and fever is a viral illness that follows seasonal change usually. For fever Paracetamol 1000 mg thrice a day should be given after food only if there is fever and for colds, she can take Chlorpheniramine maleate or Dcold. Take care that Dcold has Paracetamol and hence if she is taking Dcold tablet, then she needs to adjust the dose of Paracetamol to 500 mg thrice a day only because Dcold has 500 mg Paracetamol already. Also, give her steam inhalation preferably with sterile water. And to avoid such prolonged illness, Vitamin C must be consumed, either in fruits like oranges, or fresh lemon drinks or tomatoes or she needs to take Vitamin C tablets daily to boost immunity and fight infection naturally. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 30 years old and according to LMP, I am 9 weeks and 6 days pregnant now. I had three previous miscarriages (two chemical pregnancies and one at 5-6 weeks). This pregnancy has been really well until a few days ago. Last week I had an ultrasound and the heart rate was 173. That night, I started getting cramp pain. I had mild cramps but noticeable. Cramp intensity was around 3-4/10 at the most. I cramped every day since then and yesterday I started bleeding. At first just brown blood then increasingly heavier. I went to the doctor as soon as I started bleeding (before the clots and red blood) and the baby was fine on the ultrasound, measuring 24-25 mm (so growing) and heart rate was 179. The doctor told me that there is no problem with the placenta which had no bleeding or tears and so this is not a threatened miscarriage. There was some free blood in the uterus which he said may be from further implantation of the placenta. However, I started gushing red blood with clots after an hour with 2-3 bouts of heavy bleeding through the night. This morning it seems to be much lighter but still bleeding. I still have mild cramps, some back aches and lower abdomen side aches. Overall, I feel like I have my period, I have a sensation of inflammation in the uterus, but without the typical period cramping. All through the pregnancy I have taken the following medicine, Prenatal vitamin once a day, Baby Aspirin 75 mg once a day, PTU 50 mg, 400 mg Progesterone vaginally, 3 mg Folic Acid, 2.5-5 mg Prednisone and HCG IM injections every 4 days (5000 IU). I have few questions that my doctor did not answer me. Can this bleeding be caused by implantation? Can takeover of progesterone production by placenta cause bleeding? When does the placenta actually takeover hormone production? Do I still have a chance of keeping this pregnancy? Do the mild cramps and backaches indicate impending miscarriage or are they somewhat normal with the bleeding? If they are normal, should I take Acetaminophen for them? Should I continue to take the Aspirin given that I am bleeding? I have had the APS and thrombophilia panel tests and all are clear. Should I take the Progesterone orally now, while I am bleeding? Is it as effective? And finally, is there any possible explanation for this type of bleeding with a healthy baby with heart beat? If it was immunological (for example NK cells) would that kill the embryo instead or just start a bleeding like this? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms you are experiencing come under category of threatened abortion. The clinical diagnosis of threatened abortion is presumed when a bloody vaginal discharge or bleeding appears through a closed cervical os during the first half of pregnancy. Risk of threatened abortion progressing to abortion is substantially reduced when fetal cardiac activity is seen on ultrasound; which is true in your case and is a reassuring fact. This bleeding is not an implantation bleeding. The implantation bleeding happens between 7-10 days after ovulation when baby is burrowing in endometrium which is actually before diagnosis of pregnancy or before a woman misses her period. Placenta takes over progesterone production between 7-11 weeks. But it is just a shift in hormone production and not associated with bleeding. As described above, you have a fair chance of continuing pregnancy (if not already lost), because of heart activity seen on ultrasound. Cramps during pregnancy (unless due to bowel/bladder disturbances) are not normal and indicate threat to pregnancy. Cramps do not always indicate impending miscarriage. Acetaminophen can be taken for relief of cramps; better medicine is injection of Progesterone along with antispasmodics. Aspirin rarely aggravates bleeding and can be continued despite bleeding in most cases. Progesterone when taken orally is less effective than vaginal progesterone, only exception being Hydrogesterone which is effective orally. Normally in such cases we start injection Progesterone 100 mg intramuscularly on alternate days, but there is insufficient evidence to support and refute its effectiveness. In most cases, such bleeding happens due to chorioamniotic separation or subchorionic bleeding that is bleeding between baby and uterine wall. If cause is immunological, abortion may happen with intrauterine demise of baby or it may start with bleeding; both are possible. So, summarizing facts in your case,"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My grandmother is 98 years old. Of late, she is complaining of head reeling often. She does not have high blood pressure or diabetes and her haemoglobin is normal. She has roti in the morning, rice and dal for lunch and roti for dinner. Her bowel movements are normal. What may be the possible reason and line of treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to see your concern about your grandmother. But one thing you have to keep in mind always is that she belongs to a very fragile age group. Just like the young ones, old people also need special care. A most common condition in this age group is malnutrition, which occurs due to poor diet. This adds to every other risk factor which can develop in this age group. As per the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there are no abnormalities yet, which is good. However, there can always be some underlying protein deficiency in this age group. Also, I would suggest you get her serum electrolytes, liver function profile, ECG and cardiac profile done. Increase the protein content in the diet, you can give egg white as well. Try to divide meals into 5 parts rather than the usual 3 meals a day. For her headache, I would say, in this age, there could be many reasons for headache such as reduced vision, refractory errors, glaucoma, anemia, respiratory conditions, etc. Hence you have to get a detailed assessment done to rule out every cause. For symptomatic improvement, you can give her NSAIDS such as Naproxen, Paracetamol when needed, but avoid repeated usage. Maintain her hydration, nutrition with high protein content. Once the assessment has been done, it is better to start with some medications, as in this age one should always be cautious."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My current weight is 92 kg, and my height is 5 feet 8 inches. I have a regular weight gain problem. In the past, I have got done tests like thyroid, testosterone, and cortisol. Please advise if any other test can be done to diagnose a problem. I have a very strict diet and exercise. I do not have cold drinks and fried food. But still, I am gaining weight. Also is the testosterone in the attached report less enough to cause any weight gain issues?","Doctor":"Hi.I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. If obesity runs in your family, then that might have influenced your weight gain. Such weight gain is genetic and therefore if your parents and relatives have a tendency of obesity then it is genetic and no other test is required. In males, stress-related anxiety plays an important role in weight gain. Many men gain weight due to increased mental stress. If you have any such stressful factors causing your weight gain, then please do mind relaxation exercises and being happy and cheerful will help in weight management. Eating also influences weight gain. Even if you are strict with the food you eat, please eat multiple small meals instead of a few large meals. This will distribute the calories evenly and you will not over eat. You might have daily 2200 kcal diet with small meals every 3 - 4 hours. As per your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), your testosterone level is near the lower limit and this is also related to obesity. It should be at mid-level. If you balance your stress levels and have a good healthy diet then your testosterone might get back to the mid-range. However, please avoid taking testosterone supplement because it can be harmful and have long term side effects like hair loss. Please do exercises for 30 minutes everyday and yoga for 30 minutes. Please get detailed evaluation done for diabetes. This should include fasting blood glucose, post prandial blood glucose and HbA1c blood test. Genetic, stress, over eating or diabetes related weight gain. Life style changes, confirmation of any medical condition like diabetes and intake of low fat diet."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My child had an outbreak of chickenpox one week ago. I would like to visit her and would like to know. Can I still get infected? If yes, would a vaccine help 2 days before meeting her? I have attached my height, weight and BMI details.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I want to tell you that based on the weight for your age and height, you are very severely underweight and the ideal weight you should have in my view is 68 kg to keep a good balance in life and keep your immunity up. With this BMI of 10.20, you are very susceptible to any kind of infection that normal BMI persons of your age are naturally immune to. So, have a good balanced healthy diet and keep your BMI in normal limits. If you will need any kind of help in this regard, feel free to contact me anytime. Let me explain you a little about chickenpox viral disease: Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It can spread easily. You can get it from your infected child who sneezes, coughs or shares food or drinks with you. You can also get it if you touch the fluid from a chickenpox blister on the body of your child. Actually, a person who has chickenpox can spread the virus even before he or she has any symptoms. Chickenpox is most easily spread from 2 to 3 days before the rash appears until all the blisters have crusted over. So, if you have to touch the child, do it with gloves on. This is needed until all the blisters are crusted over. You are at the risk for chickenpox if you have never had the illness and if you have not had the chickenpox vaccine. Now I want to add some knowledge about the disease course and how will it progress in your child's case: Get vaccinated for chickenpox if you had not had this vaccine when you were a child or if you had not got the disease when you were a child. I usually recommend to get a chickenpox vaccination, for a healthy person who is not sure if he has had the vaccine or chickenpox at childhood. Get your child properly treated as chickenpox may lead to severe complications like pneumonia and encephalitis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father has acute heart failure and extensive MI since two months ago. Also, he got a pleural effusion and leg edema. He is in bed symptomatic depending on oxygen device most of the time. His EF is 21. The ECG shows possible left atrial enlargement, nonspecific intraventricular block, right ventricular hypertrophy, inferior infarct, and anterolateral infarct. QRS = 138 with right bundle branch block. He sleeps in a 30-45 degree. We did not do PCI until now. I would like to know will CRTD be good for him?","Doctor":"Hi. As he had a heart attack, first priority is revascularization of angioplasty or bypass surgery. If this is done and heart function improves, then it will be good. In right bundle branch block, there is very little benefit of CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy). If revascularization is not possible, then maximum medical therapy is best. Yes, ICD (implantable cadioverter defibrillator) is indicated. It should be considered once the patient is out of the acute episode and is stabilized. If the patient needs recurrent hospitalization for heart failure or recurrent BP drops that need medicines to raise it, then the option is left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH) or heart transplantation (subject to availability of facilities). First thing is to assess for revascularization if there is viable heart muscle. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Yesterday, I began to develop swelling of the gums near the bottom right incision. Today it has grown up into a bubble covering the top of my back molar. One quarter of the molar is covered by the swollen gum. It is bubble shaped and deep red or white. Most of my pain has subsided but this localized area hurts severely and has gotten progressively worse. I have continued with salt water rinses and the medicated rinse the dentist gave me. All of the other sites seem to be healing just fine. Should I be concerned about infection? It feels like my molar is cutting into this piece of gum and it is a sharp burning pain that is radiating. No fever, is helped by pain medication but pain resumes immediately when the medication wears off.","Doctor":"Hi. I checked your attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity), clinically it is a sign of mild gum infection. Now you can do the following steps to overcome this problem: 1. Take Metronidazole 400 mg twice a day for three days, Augmentin 625 mg twice a day for three days and keep taking Ibuprofen 600 mg twice a day to arrest infection. 2. Keep doing saline water mouthrinses at least 6 to 8 times a day. Take a sterile syringe pinch that bubble a bit, let it bleed fresh. (If possible do it by yourself till three days once in a day, if not possible, go to the dentist, he will do it for you) and then wash it with saline water. You can wash this area with pressure with a syringe. Take saline in a syringe and wash this area with full pressure several times, food may be stuck at the back that may cause this infection, syringe pressure may wash it through. Hopefully, this will get better after doing these steps in a week. Keep doing rinses 5 to 7 times a day till next two weeks. Do give me follow up after three days. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32 year old male having a normal health condition. My height is 5 feet 6 inches, and weight is 58 Kg.

Please get a review with pictures for better evaluation and the best possible treatment for your concerns."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How much does lack of exercise during growing years stunt growth? How many inches does it usually subtract from your adult height?","Doctor":"Hello. As of right now, there are no studies to calculate inches lost by physical exercise. However, height is a function of genetics and your parental and ancestral genes play a major role in your physical appearance, but a small amount of environmental change does affect physical growth, and no exercise can stunt your height significantly but not measurably. Since is are no fixed number, different people have different height ranges. Some are born in tall families and some in short, hence a number for stunted height cannot be calculated based on exercise alone. Nonetheless, physical exercise plays an extremely important role to increase at least two inches of physical height on average."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had this swollen lymph node behind my ear for about three months now. What could the reason be? There is no pain. I am able to move it. I am not having any other symptoms such as fever, weight loss or fatigue. I have been coughing up mucus for a few years now. Could this be the reason and is there any infection suspected? About two weeks ago, I noticed a smaller lymph node appear right under my ear lobe (the top of my neck) what could be the reason for this? I also realized the skin where my lymph node is red and warm. Is it cancer? Please help. I have pictures attached with the lymph node behind my ear.","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like you have a small benign lymph node. Lymph nodes do no harm and everyone has lots of them in their bodies. These flare up only when there is a little infection to fight in your surroundings. So there is not much to worry about, especially it is not cancer. Based on the photos and information you provided (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it may also be a benign lipoma which is a lump of fat slightly thicker and does not need anything to be done. Just leave it in place and it will go away on its own. Do not massage it. See a doctor if you experience pain or if it increases in size significantly. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For a few days, I have had a bad toothache. I noticed swelling and begun taking antibiotics. I woke up today and the pain is gone but it is even more swollen. I have been using cold and heat compresses, as well as salt water rinse. I am worried I may have developed an abscess but I do not have the money to seek out a dentist.","Doctor":"Hi. Understanding your situation, I am prescribing you a proper antibiotic regime that will help in diminishing abscess and infection. Take Augmentin 625 mg twice a day, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg twice a day, tablet Brufen 400 mg twice a day. Take all these medicines for three days. It will work hopefully and will dry up the infection, but again you know it is a temporary solution. The permanent solution is the extraction of the culprit tooth. You may look for low-cost dental visits and ask in your locality when will it happen. Keep doing saline water mouthrinses at least 3 to 5 times a day. Give me follow up after three days. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 10-week old projectile spits up after every nursing session. He is scheduled to have an ultrasound of upper GI one week from now to see if he has pyloric stenosis. Last night he was up until 7 AM screaming in pain. He is hungry all the time and I feel like I am doing more harm than good by feeding him all the time. At his two months check-up, he had gained weight, he was 11 lb 7 oz. He has very good urine output and I do not think he is dehydrated. He only has 1 or 2 bowel movements a week. Every day he seems worse even with Zantac three times a day. I do not know what to do for him while we have to wait a whole week to have his tests done. Is there any way I can help him? Should I take him to the emergency room?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your misery. However, I feel the line of management chosen is appropriate. If you could arrange for getting a USG abdomen done earlier it would be good. An X-ray of the erect abdomen can also be done to get an approximate judgment about the same. Another study that may need to be done would be a reflux study (since you have mentioned Zantac is no good). Signs you need to take him to the emergency room include lethargy, abdominal distension, not passing stools for three days or more with recurrent episodes of vomiting. Beyond this, I do not think there is anything that can be done given the current scenario."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Measures to control BP (blood pressure): 1. Avoid smoking and other addictions. 2. Reduce salt intake in diet. 3. Reduce fatty foods, junk foods, and saturated fats. 4. Avoid stress and anxiety. 5. Do regular moderate intensity exercise such as brisk walk for 30 minutes. 6. Have proper night sleep, at least eight hours a day including at least six hours in the night (uninterrupted sleep). 7. Reduce weight even if weight is within the normal range. 8. Drink plenty of water. 9. Do deep breathing exercises and meditation.

Just had quad bypass surgery. Too clogged for a stent. Not overweight (ever). Smoked 2 or 3 cheap cigars a day for 15 to 20 years. No regular exercise, but stayed busy in the yard, walked the dogs, etc. Generally ate what he wanted, including both a lot of good foods. But he certainly did not avoid red meat, bacon, etc. I am 50, male. I have never smoked. I am 6 feet, 185 lb. I am a teacher, so I am up and about all day. I do not regularly exercise, but I stay busy. My latest lipid is HDL 48, triglycerides 81, LDL 158. I eat pretty healthy, but probably more red meat than I should. My questions are as follows. 1. If my dad had been on a statin all those years, would he still likely be in the hospital recovering from this surgery? And I say likely, as I know you cannot guarantee that answer. 2. If you were forced to advise me at 50, given that I would remain at my current weight (and not start smoking at any point) would you tell me to eat an extremely healthy diet like fish, nuts, fruits, veggies, little or no bad fat, red meat, etc., or would you advise me to start playing tennis four days a week (or substitute any exercise similar to that like cycling, rowing, running, etc.). You have to advise me to do any of the above, not both, please.","Doctor":"Hi. There are three things you are asking, statin, diet, exercise, right? 1. Statin: Scientific evidence shows elevated lipid especially LDL is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke. And guidelines tell us that everyone aged 40 or above, in familial cases even before 40, a lipid profile should be done. If LDL is above a certain threshold (different threshold in presence and absence of risk factors and family history), the statin should be started to prevent coronary events. If your father had started statins early, chances for the current condition was less likely. 2. Diet: Healthy diet is something like a prerequisite for preventing heart diseases, and it is must at all ages. 3. Exercise: Regular aerobic exercise of at least moderate intensity is must for all ages to prevent heart attack and stroke, etc. Two and three, both are must simultaneously, and both must be advised, if not enforced. If I have to advise only one, I would advise exercise. If still any concern, I will be happy to clarify."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got a Pap done last week and I got the results back today.

Firstly, whenever a sample is observed under the microscope, the pathologist has to comment on the adequacy of the sample. Your cervix has ectocervix (containing squamous, flat cells), and an endocervix (containing endocervical- columnar cells) (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so if the smear is collected properly, it should contain both type of cells for assessing any kind of abnormality to detect signs of malignancy.

Ejaculation of sperm with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and or before person wishes, it is called premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation is a common complaint. It is only rarely caused by a physical problem. PM early in a relationship is most often caused by stress or anxiety and too much stimulation. Guilt and other psychological factors may also be involved. The condition usually improves without treatment. Amount and consistency of ejaculates depend on the semen.

I am sure that is not period. Is it a sign of bowel cancer?","Doctor":"Hello. I assure you not to worry a lot as things can be settled with proper care and follow up. There are some reasons for fresh blood in stools, with stools, before or after stools other than menstrual blood.First of all, it may be hemorrhoids. You may have felt some dilated small lesions on the anal opening before or after passing stools ( if this was bleeding hemorrhoid). It is due to a disease named portal hypertension and you need to follow it up and it will settle down with treatment. Your general surgeon is the person to decide the stage of hemorrhoids and treatment goes accordingly. He may do proctoscopy, colonoscopy or digital rectal examination. The other cause is anal fissure bleed. When stools get hard due to constipation and when patient forcibly defecates, it causes a breach in the mucosal lining of the rectum and anus and it bleeds in the form of fresh blood. Lactulose syrup, whole grain foods, dietary fiber supplements, plenty of fluids and a good physical activity will help improve this condition. But it may also need treatment with antibiotics to avoid severe infection. General surgeon consultation for a physical examination is my suggestion. Last but not least is the cancerous growth. It is serious but less likely in your case. But if you have a family history of colon cancer, have a change in bowel habits, lost weight, loss in appetite, constipation or diarrhea, You may be having cancer. A general surgeon will diagnose with colonoscopy and barium tests through radiologic studies. Final suggestion - avoid constipation, keep a good physical activity, avoid fast foods, processed meats, low fiber diet, and soft drinks. Go to a general surgeon in person for proper evaluation and treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How to increase sperm count? I had a sperm examination test.

But I am worried he is not supposed to eat some kind of fruits. Please advise regarding what kind of fruits he can have and those which he should not have.","Doctor":"Hi. Fiber-rich foods are generally safe for diabetics to eat because they tend to have a lower glycemic index and therefore do not spike blood sugar levels to the same extent as high glycemic index foods. Fruits with high fiber content include passion fruit, orange, raspberries, apples, pears, apricots, blueberries, kiwifruit, strawberries, avocados, and raw papaya. Quantity to be consumed: A person who is diabetic should make frequent changes in his menu, meaning your father should take a small quantity of these fruits in a day asevery 10 g equals to 40 calories. So, he should not take any fruit in too much quantity, because all fruits have sugar in them. But the ones which I have mentioned above have low sugar and high fiber. For example, if he takes 1 medium orange a day, he can replace it with a pear the next day. So that each day he can have a different fruit."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 48 years old.

I have suffered bouts of depression for the past few years along with anxiety and OCD. I am on Zoloft every day and am doing well for the most part. I am staying active and keeping busy. The reason why I ask this is, that on my mother's side there are two stories of people with suspected schizophrenia. My maternal grandmother's mother was said to have been institutionalized for her life because of it, and my maternal aunt (mom's sister) is a paranoid schizophrenic, according to my grandma. Does this skip generations? Neither of my parents or siblings has this condition. What are the chances of becoming a schizophrenic? Do I have anything to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello. Based on the history provided, I see that you do not have any first degree relatives with schizophrenia. So the risk is not high. This condition can run in families, but the risk is more when you have first degree relatives with schizophrenia (like parents, siblings). Schizophrenia is relatively rare affecting about 1% of the general population. So anyone in the world has a 1 in 100 chance of developing schizophrenia. Your risk will be the same as the general population ( ~1%), possibly marginally higher due to extended family history. You need not worry unnecessarily as the risk is not substantially higher than anybody else in the world. To give you an idea about the genetic risk of schizophrenia, look at these figures. If there is a first degree relative with schizophrenia, the risk increases to 10 %. If both parents have schizophrenia, the risk increases to 50 %. If there is identical twin, the risk can increase to about 50 to 65%. You do not fall into these categories. You may be aware that genes play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia but they alone are not responsible. Schizophrenia is caused by a complex interaction between genes, environment, and psychological factors. Environmental factors like illicit drug use and high stress levels play a huge role. Since there is a possible history of schizophrenia in the extended family, it makes sense to avoid any risk factors like illicit drugs use (weed, cocaine, etc). Continue an active and healthy lifestyle. Continue appropriate treatment for depression, anxiety, and OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder). If you have any other concerns, you can contact your psychiatrist for a review. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What could be causing this? I am really not able to tell if there is a color change.","Doctor":"Hi. Intense itching as you describe mostly indicates a fungal infection. It is possible that you might be working in a hot environment or maybe sweating too much there along with wearing tight clothes. That prevents aeration of the area and promotes fungal growth. Try using antifungal or Cotrimoxazole ointments on the area to get relief. Hope you get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30 year old male. My height is 155 cm and I weigh 63 kg. I am facing hair fall for one year. Now it is even more severe. Till last year, I was having dandruff problem also, but after mundan (hair tonsuring), there is not much dandruff but hair fall has not stopped. Below are the symptoms. I used to wash my hair once in 3 days earlier. But within 2 days, my hair becomes wet even without applying oil. Because of that reason, nowadays, I wash my hair once in 2 days. Because of any reason, if I do not have a hair wash for 3 to 4 days, my head smells very bad and becomes wet. I do not know about my hair type, so I used to change my hair shampoo frequently between anti-dandruff and anti-hair fall. I got married four years back. Till that time, there was no hair loss and I had not observed any baldness. My father has baldness but, he got it at 40 years of age. But now, it looks like I am in the final stage of becoming bald. I have attached pictures of the same. I travel to South Korea very frequently for a minimum of 3 months a year. This weekend, I am traveling to a foreign country, so I need to buy any medication for hair fall (if needed) before going. I want to know my hair type and remedies for hair fall.","Doctor":"Hi.I have worked through your query and have understood your health issues. I have gone through the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I assure you not to worry. This is the most common disease of men at this age. It is actually the male pattern baldness and you are lucky that you had noticed at such an early stage. It is stage 2 baldness and has just started."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have severe anxiety and struggling majorly with nausea, having multiple panic attacks a day and now stuck for leaving home. 10 years ago they tried Zoloft which worsened symptoms. Then went to Mirtazapine 45 mg and that helped for quite many years. Unfortunately, the last 12 months it has gone back to a severe level. This week a GP doctor has changed me to Valdoxan which I am swapping to this week. I have been told to cut Avanza for two days entirely and start 25 mg Valdoxan which I have but having severe panic attacks and nausea. Wondering if there are better options or what to do. I am at a wits' end with nausea.","Doctor":"Hi. Although Agomelatine (Valdoxan) is a good medication for treatment of anxiety and panic disorders, it is not the best option. Agomelatine is considered a weak agent and possibility of helping in severe anxiety and panic attacks are less when compare to traditional medications such as SSRI and SNRI. Since one of the SSRI was already tried a few years back with negative results (Zoloft), I feel the SNRI should be considered as the next option. Although four medications are available in this category, I feel Desvenlafaxine (Prestiq) should make a better choice. This is one of the potent anti-anxiety medications and the possibility of a positive response is comparatively better when compared to other similar medications. It is true that it may cause nausea for some days (often less than one week) but this is self-limiting and disappears on its own in a few days and rarely lasts for a week. The next option is to try another SSRI which comes with trade name Paxil. It is again one of the preferred medication in severe anxiety and yields earlier results. It is true that every medication have their own side effects and we need to give a deeper thought before starting any medication."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had this patch of skin above my top lip for the past couple of weeks.

Do you have any allergies?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I had a miscarriage two weeks ago (three months pregnancy) and I went to the hospital. The doctor told me I have to flush everything out, which I did. But since then I have been having light bleeding with pain until last week. I had a heavy one with a thick clot and something else I cannot really describe. I immediately passed that out, the pain stopped and it was like something left me. But I am still having light bleeding. So I went back to the doctor to explain and he prescribed another drug to me, one will make me bleed and the other will stop the bleeding but I am scared. I do not know what to do again. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You had a miscarriage and it was managed medically. Post medical induction, you can have bleeding gradually but it can be in episodes and can be extended up to 2 to 3 weeks in form of mild spotting. Stopping of bleeding is not the solution actually. Have one transvaginal scan to check if any retained products are there still inside the uterus or not. If products of conception are still inside, this bleeding is in favor of you. As naturally, the body is responding and emitting out conception products. In the case of retained products inside the vagina, you might need evacuation if you observe heavy bleeding or pain or both. Have a complete check if any health issue you have and try to have regular complete treatment. If the uterus is clean with no products of conception inside, have a complete blood count, thyroid function tests and tablet Postan 500 mg and tablet Tranexamic acid 500 mg 8 hourly for 2 to 5 days as per need to stop bleeding. Have laboratory tests as per given scenario and discuss. In case of heavy bleeding and pain, report to gynecology emergency. As a casual protocol of induced miscarriage. Transvaginal scan immediately. Retained products. If retained products are there on the scan, you may need evacuation. So scan has to be discussed with the specialist to decide. If no products of conception, clear the uterus, then have medications as I advised above. Check on any other health issue and try to have treatment for that as well."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I have this pea-sized bubble like thing which bleeds on the side of my toenail. I have attached a picture of my toenail. It is a swelling, and I wonder what can I do to take it away, other than surgery?","Doctor":"Hello.I have seen your clinical picture and gone through your query (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would strongly advise you to undergo a partial nail excision, debridement and daily dressing of the wound until it shows healthy granulation tissue. It is because unless you remove the offending portion of the nail, the wound will not settle down. I would rather call it a procedure rather than a surgery, which can be done with local anesthesia (ring block) and in OPD procedure room. Other than surgery, just the debridement and daily dressings can be tried, but once again I would like to tell you that unless the portion of the nail which is curved inside and impinging the skin is excised, this wound may not settle down. Also, a broad spectrum antibiotic will be required until the wound heals satisfactorily."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have shortness of breath sometimes, burning sensation in the chest after having a meal. Consult with the doctor and get prescribed Omez DSR in the morning. Also, do some medical test including ECG, so the report is herewith attached. Please confirm the test analysis. The patient is having a brain tumor (astrocytoma, grade 2) and surgery was done a year back.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The only significant finding is of deranged cholesterol levels. Your LDL cholesterol is mildly elevated, so you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily food and daily exercises like walking, etc. No need to take any medicines for it at present. You should repeat lipid profile after three months of lifestyle modifications.  ECG is having minor changes only and no major and significant abnormalities are there, so nothing to worry about it. The symptoms are likely due to gastritis and reflux disease. So you have Omez DSR before breakfast for a week period and then whenever needed. Also, avoid spicy food, heavy meals and have some walk after meals for sometimes rather than resting immediately after food. However, if received any chemotherapy during treatment then should have one echo to rule out the possibility of heart damage due to chemotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an abortion a few months back but retained the gestational sac. After 39 days, I had my periods. Again I conceived three months back and had a miscarriage 5 weeks later. I am still bleeding and it is heavy bleeding with lots of blood. The blood is bright red in color. Along with the blood, there are large clots and tissues along with it. I do not feel any pain except when there is heavy bleeding I feel pain in my vagina. Is it a symptom of cancer?","Doctor":"Hello. The fact that your bleeding has not stopped even after a month of miscarriage, indicates that there is all likelihood that you may have retained products of conception. It is mandatory to get a transvaginal ultrasound pelvis to check for endometrial thickness and for possible retained products. If the products are not seen and the endometrium is thickened, then you should opt for dilatation and curettage (D and C) for controlling bleeding. I also assure you that this is not endometrial cancer, as it is uncommon at your age and you have an inciting cause (miscarriage) which initiated the heavy bleed. So, USG is a must."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Under normal circumstances are there any common viruses or bacteria (harmful microorganisms in general) that would be viable after three years?","Doctor":"Hi. It would have been better if your query had been clear about whether you meant the normal circumstances inside the human body or in the environmental condition. Inside the human body, bacteria and viruses can survive for many years without causing any clinical disease in the host and such type of hosts are called as carriers. When favorable conditions develop, these microorganisms leads to development of clinical diseases. Second about environmental condition, viruses multiply only inside living host and they cannot survive outside their host for such a long period of 3 years. The duration for inactivation of viruses in the environment is different for different viruses. About bacteria, many bacterial species can survive in the environment for a long period if they have favourable environment. It includes many non-pathogenic and some pathogenic bacteria and also some opportunistic bacteria."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 65 years old. He has bipolar disorder for 40 years. He also has diabetes. He is taking medicine for high blood pressure. For a very long time, he took lithium 1000 mg and oxcarbazepine 900 mg. 2-3 episodes used to happen, normally of long manic spell followed by gloomy/not so active spell. He stopped lithium due to toxicity, as even low dose was toxic. He started 200 mg quetiapine at night. In manic spell, he used to take up to 30 mg aripiprazole for 2-3 months. Considering his age and other medical conditions, what should be the right combination of medicine? Is aripiprazole safe? (it is very effective in mania for him) Now he has stopped aripiprazole, and he is fine. But he is complaining of restlessness sometimes. He feels like not wanting to sit in a place. What should be given to him in this post mania phase? Please ask for any more details if you require.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. Medicines for mental health conditions should be taken under the strict supervision of the psychiatrist. As mentioned above, lithium toxicity is a serious concern and it is good that you have stopped lithium due to toxicity. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication and studies have shown that it is a safe and effective medication for the elderly. The side effects are less when the patient takes Quetiapine. Transient hypotension, dizziness, and somnolence are the only side effects in patients and is seen rarely. Long term use of Quetiapine has shown no serious side effects in the elderly. Aripiprazole is good medicine but might cause agitation and activation in about 8 percent of elderly people who take it. Studies show that in most patients Aripiprazole can be continued at a dose of 10 to 15 mg/day. Aripiprazole has less metabolic side effects than other medicines. Side effects of Aripiprazole include dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, tiredness, excess saliva or drooling, choking or trouble in swallowing, blurred vision, headache, anxiety, weight gain, drowsiness, sleep problems (insomnia) and constipation. There is a little increase in the risk of stroke in the elderly due to the intake of antipsychotic medicines, though this is very less. It is very important to go into details of patient problems when prescribing and changing doses of medicines. I hope your father is managing well with his diabetes and blood pressure. Considering the above, it is best to prescribe medicines based on benefit and risk. Some patients might do well without medicine without much bipolar symptoms and in the absence of frequent attacks, however many require medicines like your father. There is no fixed regimen over one medicine being better than the rest but medicine like Aripiprazole has fewer side effects. Can you please let us know the treatment he has undertaken in the last 2 years, including medicine name and duration for which it was taken, dose, symptoms, and improvements."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concerns. No, cardiac ablation will not cause any derangements in your progressing disease of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). It will rather help improve the symptoms of the disease and will lower the racing heart (tachycardia) feelings. I advise you to do aerobic exercise on a regular basis so that venous return from the lower extremities can be increased. If you experience feelings of dizziness to the extent of syncope (fainting), I advise you to wear graded compression hosiery extending up to the waist, thus helping to increase static pressure in the legs and decrease venous pooling in the lower extremities.

My query is that I walk regularly brisk and my pulse goes up to 145 and 150 without any breathlessness and recovery is also good as it drops around 25 points within one minute. Does this mean my heart does not have plaque and I am safe? After 150 pulse, slight discomfort or maybe anxiety but no breathlessness.

Yes, if your heart rate is going above 150 without any chest pain or heaviness then the probability of significant blockages (more than 60 to 70 percent) is very low. However, this or even TMT will not help to rule out plaquing. TMT does not help in the diagnosis or ruling out plaquing as blood supply to the heart is not decreased even at very high heart rate. For plaques, CT coronary angiography is a good investigation. Although not absolutely necessary in you, you may undergo screening CT angiography or TMT in a few years just be on safer side considering the risk factors.

Follicle cysts subside in three months after the oral pills use. You can start the pills from the first day of periods itself, and continue the packs back to back, no gaps.

If you could take an overall look and see if there is anything unusual. More specifically, measurement of the sinuses of Valsalva. The most pressing thing is that I saw what I think is a false lumen, but I am no radiologist and might very well be very wrong, but I would like this to be checked.

The aortic origin, arch, and descending thoracic aorta show normal caliber lumen (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Abdominal aorta and its branches appear normal. No significant intimal thickening or plaque disease is seen. No intra-luminal filling defects seen. No sub-intimal collection or double lumen (to suggest aortic dissection) seen in the present scan. Flow and pulsation movement-related artifacts seen within the lumen are unavoidable in dynamic MRI scans (as seen in the reference images attachments sent by you). The measurements of the aorta at sino-tubular junction and sinus are within normal limits. Impression: Essentially normal aortic study. Regarding your pulse, I would request you for an ECG as ectopic beats and low volume pulses can be missed in manual or machine count but are well appreciated on ECG could indicate underlying arrhythmia."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I frequently get palpitations, usually a few times a day.

I can usually stop the run by coughing hard. Is this anything to worry about? My main concern is that I might pass out or that I might develop a fatal arrhythmia.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, I would say palpitations with light-headedness likely indicates some serious kind of arrhythmia. You are lucky that in 30 years, you did not pass out but there is a risk that this kind of arrhythmia can be fatal. I would suggest visiting cardiologist. Repeat EKG and echocardiogram, you might need a Holter monitoring for 24 hours and ultimately might need medication or pacemaker depending on severity and type of arrhythmias. I am suspecting it to be SVT or VT runs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My period came on the first of last month. 22 days later, my breasts were hurting. I was cramping but there was no period. Five days later, I went to the restroom and I wiped and there was light pink blood. The next day still no period or spotting. Two days later, I woke up and blood was everywhere but I did not bleed. Next day, there was nothing. Then, I used the restroom and a big blood clot came out of me and I have been bleeding all night. What could it be? My pregnancy test came back negative.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your concern. It is good you have already ruled out pregnancy because, in any type of abnormal bleeding among reproductive age, pregnancy is one of the first condition that should be ruled out. The second most common cause of these types of bleeding is a hormonal imbalance. Theoretically, your progesterone hormone should be elevated on the second half of your cycle and decreases when you are nearing the start of your period. So the amount of this hormone is critical in making you bleed. If there is too slow of a decrease or too abrupt or most the time insufficient amount, then it will affect the timing of the bleeding and will cause heavy bleeding. The treatment for this is oral Progesterone or in the form of birth control pills. The third common cause would be a structural problem, the presence of a polyp, myoma or endometrial lining problem, infection, etc. These situations will need ultrasound and evaluation by an ob-gyn. For your case, I suggest you take first Ibuprofen thrice a day for the first 3 to 4 days of your period. This would help in decreasing the bleeding and at the same time avoid pain. You may opt to observe this cycle of bleeding for another month or it would be more helpful to have a scheduled appointment with your ob-gyn for the next month."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My query is related to the necessity of rabies vaccine for me.

People caressing those dogs is a very common scene here. One week ago, while I was walking, a dog ran in front of me. That time, its back leg touched my feet. I inspected that part well, but no visible break in the skin was observed. Should I approach a doctor for any treatment? As the disease is quite frightening, I request you to consider the minute risk too.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your apprehension. As it is already one week since you had the dog touch your feet and there was no bleed or break of skin as such. No vaccination is required now. You should have thoroughly cleaned the region immediately after the dog had touched your leg.  I would like to know if you have any idea about the present status of the dog? As a watch of the dog for 10 days post-bite would be ideal. Also, precautionary vaccination is not usually advised. Only, a post-exposure vaccine is advised in rabies. If anyone has a bite or break of the skin or if there is lick by a dog on a broken/cut skin or if there is any bleed from the site of bite then vaccine is recommended. For a lick or fondling on an intact skin, only cleaning and washing the wound in running tap water is sufficient."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The chest x-ray is essentially normal except for slightly prominent lung markings bilaterally and especially in right lower zone. However, there is no area of patchy opacity or scarring. Prominent lung markings might be associated with a mild cough or a hyperactive airway. It is also important to keep in mind that occasionally the lung markings might also appear prominently in a normal person when seeing a digital chest x-ray like the one sent by you. There is no fluid collection. The heart is normal in size. The bones are normal. The diaphragms are normal. I would like to know the reason for which the chest x-ray was taken, for more detailed discussion because symptoms of the patient are important while discussing a chest X-ray.

Percocet is a tablet with a combination of two medications namely Acetaminophen and Oxycodone. This drug is commonly prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe pain. It is advisable to use this medication only in the prescribed dosage and for the prescribed time. The most common side effects of Percocet are:  However, there are a few other rare side effects like (in such cases, it is advisable to visit the doctor immediately) A typical seizure would be something like this: A period of unconsciousness with uncontrolled contraction and relaxation of your muscles (often all of them) along with involuntary or unconscious passage of urine and stools and may also be associated with vomiting and often associated with tongue biting. One who has suffered the episode will usually have no recollection of the event. Once the person gains consciousness, he/she feels exhausted and only a witness could provide the observation of the symptoms. There may also be injuries over the body.If a seizure occurs during sleep, then it could be life threatening as the vomitus may be aspirated into the air passage (trachea and lungs) and may cause difficulty in breathing. However, if you have observed any such symptoms, it is advisable to visit your treating doctor and get your medication reviewed.If you are sure that it is a seizure that you had, then it would be a good idea to stop the medication right away and also get a complete evaluation by your doctor to identify the cause of the seizure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 35 year old woman. My perineal area burns if my urine touches this area while I urinate. Having sex is also very painful. Should I be concerned and what can I do to ease this?","Doctor":"Hello. Your complaints are burning sensation around perineum whenever urine touches it, painful sexual intercourse and raw areas. It looks like that you might have a genital infection. To be more specific, if you have reddish colored lesions, erosions/vesicles over genitals, painful to touch, mucoid discharge along with above-mentioned complaints, then most likely you have contracted genital herpes. Genital herpes is caused by a virus named herpes simplex, contacted by having an unprotected vaginal/ anal/ oral sex. Usually, the first infection is severe as compared to recurrent infection. The frequency of recurrent infection is high. Diagnosis can be confirmed by ELISA detecting viral antigens.  Treatment involves the following: I would suggest you consult a venereologist in person, before starting this treatment, to get a screening done for other sexually transmitted diseases as well."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 38 years old and I am 67 kg and 169 cm. I am half black with kind of light skin. Although I have my fiancee, I masturbate a lot before and sometimes I damage my skin under the gland. I can mention maybe since a year or so. I always associate because, in the new place where I live, the climate is far drier than in my home country. Since one month ago, my fiancee started taking estrogen due to fertility treatment and she got candidiasis and was treated but she was not told that I also should take the treatment. I have since some time an almost unnoticeable small red bump with kind of dried and bright appearance in the gland (in what I call the down part of my gland which is where the gland connects with the part of the skin that I do not see when I pee).  At that time I did not have time for going to doctor and I did not know about icliniq. She advised me to use coconut cream and I used it and the swelling disappeared. However, I have it again in the same location. She recently received again the estrogen treatment. Like three weeks ago, when I had the first bump, once I had sex with my girlfriend and it was a little bit painful. In general, I do not know if it is because of my uneasiness, but I feel certain discomfort in the top of my gland but very little. These are all the symptoms I think.","Doctor":"Hi. It can be candidiasis or some allergic reaction. You can apply Miconazole cream locally twice daily for about 10 days and see. If it increases or recurs, see a doctor. Please use a condom until both of you are adequately treated, to prevent cross infection. The pain during sex could be due to stretching of the frenulum, the fold at 6 o'clock below glans. If it tears repeatedly, a minor corrective surgery helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have Crohn's disease and am pregnant. The first day of my last period was before 40 days and I have been taking multivitamins which includes 400 micrograms of Folic acid for the past four months. I am now pregnant. The doctor said that I need 5 mg of Folic acid due to the Crohns which I have started from today. No one told me I need more Folic acid than average woman until today and I am now sick with worry. If I had been taking an insufficient amount of Folic acid and caused harm to the baby, then how or when will I know?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your concern. You need not worry or be anxious about it. Although absorption of Folate may be disturbed because of your Crohns, taking 400 mcg for four months will be good enough. Meaning, you are not deficient from it from the very start but since you are now pregnant, additional Folic acid is needed to be used by the baby. I suggest you have your serum Folic acid test done so as to make sure that everything is not below normal. Because Chrons as you already may know effects the absorption of folic acid."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, If I lie on my back for more than two minutes, I have quite severe lumbar pain when I try to get out of bed, mainly when I try to straighten up.

I do not know what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your difficult position due to stress in the family. Remember it is not your fault and it is common for young people to feel stressed and low in the mood when facing problems at home or outside. First, try to discuss your problems with either of your parents when they are in a calmer mood. You can also discuss with a trusted uncle, aunt or grandparent. Do not suffer alone at such a young age. When you are experiencing negative and suicidal thoughts, do not be alone. Discuss with a trusted member of the family who can understand and support you. Try to change things under your control and do not worry too much which you cannot control. Try to relax. You can try progressive muscle relaxation exercises, deep breathing exercises. Eat and sleep regularly. Do regular physical activities like walking, watch TV, listen to songs at least for 20 to 30 minutes daily. Do not get bogged down by studies alone. If your mood does not improve in 1 to 2 weeks, it will benefit to see your family doctor to rule out clinical depression. If depressed, you will need talking therapy or counseling, sometimes antidepressant medication will also be prescribed to make you feel better. Remember these difficulties are temporary.

I bought it from a medical. They asked her to take it before one hour of intercourse. She had a regular period. Her last period was on 7th of last month but it is 11th of next month now and till now she did not get her periods. She does not want to get pregnant now as she has her exams in a few months. She is doing heavy exercise like cycling, spot jogging, sit ups. And also she has taken two raw papayas, four pineapples and three times ginger syrup. I am sure that condom did not get broken. My doubts are will she get pregnant? Is there really a pill available to be taken before intercourse. Is that pill true? What she can do further to get her periods? Can she take Probers tablet for getting it?","Doctor":"Hi. Stress plays important role in periods. She might be freaking out with the fear of getting pregnant, with exams on the head causing a delay in her periods. Please consider doing a pregnancy test, most likely, it will be negative, and that will help her relax. Periods will gradually occur. No need to worry. Yes, there are medicines for getting periods, but they might worsen her condition by causing mood swings, as she already has taken an emergency contraceptive. Secondly, emergency contraceptives should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, the earlier, the better effect. She has taken it quite early even before intercourse, so chances of pregnancy are nil."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old, and I have experienced forgetfulness ever since I was in elementary. I usually ace my tests because I have a very short term memory, so cramming often makes do. But, I often tend to forget things when my body takes the so-called auto-pilot mode. During these times, I tend to do things with me, not really focusing on doing it because I was thinking of something else. I cannot really recall what exactly happened in a day when nothing special has occurred. I often forget where I put things, even when they are already in front of me, or in my hand. I seem to misplace habitually and it has pertrubed my parents. Now I am wandering if these are early symptoms of Alzheimer's. Please reply, and if you want to ask questions about me,feel free.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms are not related to dementia or Alzheimer. At your age, considering the description of your complaints, I would think about a concentration disorder (attention disorder). This could be related to ADHD or anxiety. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist or psychologist to help determine the right cause. It is also important checking complete blood count for anemia and thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Today, I had an appointment with a doctor. It looks like I have a small cyst in my ovary. The doctor said, nothing is special but somehow told me to get Duphaston 10 mg for 10 days. Can it cause weight gain? What can be side effects? And if I do not get it and the cyst is not dangerous, can it affect my fertility?","Doctor":"Hi. It would be better if you could send me your detailed gynecology, obstetrics, medical, surgical, and drug history. The cyst is a developing large size follicle. If it is less then 4 to 5 mm then it should resolve by itself in the next few months gradually. If you do not have multiple cysts, then you can avoid medication. Duphaston is Progesterone and its side-effect is weight gain if taken for a long time. If you are observing weight gain, abnormal weight gain along with irregular or scanty periods, then you need only blood tests. So observe for these as well. In the case of multiple ovarian cysts with or without the above symptoms also, you need to have a blood test. Have a balanced diet, weight, and BMI to avoid polycystic ovary. Ovarian cyst. Have exercise, yoga, and swimming or exercise to have balanced weight and BMI.

The allopathy medicine suggested for this is Tadalafil 5 mg every day (vasodilator). Is it manageable through Siddha medicines? I am 33 years old. My height is 176 cm, and I weigh 76 kg. I have borderline high cholesterol, and I do not have high blood pressure or diabetes. I do not have the habit of smoking or drinking. Please go through my blood reports.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As per your blood report, your cholesterol profile is above the upper limit. This might be the cause for the penile artery blockage (atherosclerosis plaque). But, I think the other possible reasons for erectile dysfunction may be: For cholesterol, you consult a general physician and they would prescribe Simvastatin. This will reduce your cholesterol and reduce the plaque. If you wish to have sexual intercourse, on that day, take one tablet of Tadalafil before sexual activity. Otherwise, do not consume it regularly. It has many side effects. In Siddha, cholesterol, trauma or unknown cause induced erectile dysfunction can be treated using the following drugs: Last two drugs can improve the vascularity to the penis and reduce further worsening of atherosclerosis complications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am facing a problem with delusion. It is like an attack and I start thinking that my family members or my friends want to do something wrong with me and I suddenly get very angry and start shouting. The base of this problem is around 12 years ago when I spoke wrong about a female member of my family to a friend of mine. So, whenever I get an attack, I think that my friend had told everything to my family. I faced this problem for the first time around 6 years ago. Currently, I am taking Soltus 50 mg daily which was 100 mg earlier. So, I want to know what problem is this and do I have to take this tablet for a lifetime or is there any other solution for it?","Doctor":"Hi. Delusion is a false belief, which is very firm and unshakeable. It is a symptom of psychosis, which is found in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, mania, etc. It is due to increased dopamine chemical in the brain. Other causes are genetic, sociocultural and psychological. If you had shown a complete response on Soltus 100 mg in the past, then you can again start Soltus 100 mg now. Soltus (Amisulpride) is a antipsychotic medication, whose dose can be increased up to 400 mg. If you have continuous illness for the last 12 years, then you have to take medicine for a lifetime because chances of recurrence of these illnesses are very high.

You have not mentioned the specific site where you get the pain. Is it in and around the nipple or is it deep inside? If the pain is in and around the nipple, then it is most likely due to faulty technique while feeding.

My hand and leg palms feel like burning and become very hot, and I have the same feeling in my vagina too. I also get an occasional sharp pain in my lower abdomen for a few seconds.

I have attached my reports and I am currently taking Fol 123, Duvadilan, Duphaston 10 mg, Udiliv 300 mg, Pan-D, Thyroxine 12.5, and Eltroxin 75.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your examination. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). They are all normal. The symptoms that you prescribe above are common during pregnancy. Burning sensation in palms and hand is called Carpal Syndrome, it happens in pregnancy due to swelling of tissues. The burning sensation in the vagina is because your sexual organs are more vasculated (more blood comes to them) during pregnancy. To exclude vaginal infection you can perform a vaginal swab and urinary analysis. Your cervical length is 31 mm, so you do not have to worry about abdominal pain, that does not seem to be a uterine contraction. Countinue your medication and especially you have to consult with an endocrinologist to secure that the thyroid hormone levels are normal."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Using this for such a long time and at a young age can produce pronounced side effects like erectile dysfunction at a later stage, and low BP problems. I would advise to avoid the drug and try a more natural way of life. Use a barrier contraceptive that enhances the duration of sex and you can successfully wean off the drug. You can take it occasionally but it will be at your own risk. Besides, it produces short-term side effects also like dryness of respiratory tract and retention of alcohol.

Will this continue to bother me when I am practicing or playing? Any tips?","Doctor":"Hi. It is very common for everyone to get these kinds of experience when they change glasses even with the same power glasses. This is because our eyes get adjusted to the glasses, even minor changes like the shape of the glasses, frames, interpupillary distance, a gap between glasses and eyes.

If you are certain that there are two passages in the vagina, it could just be a minor vaginal septum, which is common and can be removed surgically. There are no complications. Or in some rare cases, your wife may be having two sets of a uterovaginal canal, also known as uterine didelphis.

It has the following features: Ovarian follicles are not fully functional and they do not produce the adequate hormone. This disease also has insulin resistance (a hormone which decreases glucose by increasing its breakdown) which leads to an increase in weight of the patient. Your doctor might be giving you a course of oral contraceptive pills for irregular menses. You should focus on weight loss by a healthy diet and exercise. Your weight loss will increase insulin sensitivity in your body. Please think about marriage and pregnancy before 30 years because PCOD is commonly associated with infertility.

I always fake things about myself, tell untrue stories. When I remember people, like my ex-boyfriend, I imagine a conversation between me and him that had never happened and I feel happy. I keep imagining all that I wanted to do but have never done. I talk to people in my mind. I meet them, I see them, I laugh and cry in my mind. I am tired of imagining and failing in everything in real life. I even sometimes imagine the conversations with dead people.","Doctor":"Hi. People use imagination as a defense or escape from reality. Some degree of imagination is alright because it makes us imagine a goal, feeling of happiness, if achieved, hence motivate a person for a target or goal but the use of excessive imagination can lead to wastage of time and serve as a distraction from your real life goals. You can reduce this by giving some aversive stimulation to yourself like a tyre rubber band in the hand bullet as much as possible so that you feel pain when you will stop doing this. Set a goal in real life and be passionate about it. Try to achieve it at any cost. If you still find it hard to overcome, then I would advise you to consult a local psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old.

So, please give me any suitable advice which can help my penis to get large and satisfy me and my partner.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your problems carefully. Your complaints are of small penis and less pleasure in sex. At first, you have to know details about sex and female orgasm. Normal sexual time is 2 to 5 minutes. Sometimes, it may be more or less. And sexual pleasure not depends on time and size of the penis. It is a myth that a large penis is good. But it is not true. A large penis may be troublesome for your partner. Now coming to the solution. 1. Small penis: there is some exercise which may help. But do not expect more. Do not use the device. It may harm. 2. Sexual pleasure: sexual pleasure mainly depends on foreplay rather than sex. More foreplay gives your partner more pleasure. Even only with foreplay, fingering and oral sex can make your partner pleased. So concentrate on those. 3. Less time: time may be low or high. You should mind it that, anxiety make your sexual time low and less pleasurable. So do not be anxious. There is some way to make your sex lengthy. Such as coitus interrupts. When you think cum is coming, just withdraw, take some pause and start again. Make more foreplay in coitus. Doing sex slowly. Do not be in a hurry. You can try Duloxetine 20 to 30 mg, 30 minutes before bedtime. It may help. But you should keep in mind that, there is some side effect of Duloxetine such as nausea, dizziness. Do not worry about that."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

Regarding what is diabetes and details about it, it is very difficult to explain here. However, some points are being given: 1. Diabetes is a hormone (insulin) deficiency disease, plus there may be resistance to its action, mainly in fat or overweight person. In some persons both these situations are responsible. Excess weight and physical inactivity are major culprits. 2. Once diabetes develops, there is a derangement of metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. But the major visible problem is high glucose levels and HbA1c. 3. This leads to an effect on microvasculature (small blood vessels) supplying retina, kidney, and nerves. Secondly, damage to macrovasculature (large vessels) like coronary arteries supplying the heart and large vessels supplying lower limbs. These actions lead to retinal damage (retinopathy, kidney damage and neuropathy and sexual problems in male). Large vessel damage causes heart-related issues, damage to the blood supply to lower limbs and ulceration at times leading to loss of limbs. Type 2 diabetes was earlier seen in persons above 40 years. However, nowadays it is seen more often in much younger age group, even in teen age. Strict blood glucose control with fasting less than 100 mg, PP (postprandial) 150 to 160 mg and HbA1c less than 6.8 should be maintained. Apart from taking specific medications, it is essential to take properly planned restricted diet, no sweets, no deep fried foods, no bakery items, no foods made of maida and avoid colas. Increase the intake of green leafy vegetables and salads. Plus regular exercise of over one hour and maintaining a near normal weight are important aspects of the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex with my office colleague 15 days back and he looks healthy and happy, but within two weeks of that incident, I got cold, fever 99.8 Farenhite, sore throat, toothache, and severe cough like never before. I am very scared. I got my period four days after sex. I am worried about HIV. I asked him if the condom was intact and not broken he said it was all intact, and I should not be worrying about HIV.

Hence, I would prescribe drugs like beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists and also Amiodarone if the atrial fibrillation is running at a fast rate. I would also like to rule out any reversible cause of the poorly functioning heart like blocks in the blood vessels supplying the heart, alcohol abuse, and rectify that, if possible. Beyond medication, there are devices like cardiac resynchronization therapy, but only a few patients are suitable for that, and finally heart transplantation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having irregular periods.

For your issue, take turmeric tablets two in the morning and two at night or turmeric powder (2 gm) morning and 2 gm evening after food. Take long pepper powder 1 gm. Mix this with cow milk and boil, then drink it. Daily two times this has to be done or one gram of long pepper powder can be mixed with honey and be consumed. Twice daily. Anu thailam is the ayurvedic nasal drop for this issue. If you could get it, apply two drops in each nostril, morning, evening and night before going to bed. This will solve your issues. Eucalyptus oil few drops (or the capsule) can be added in boiling water, and the steam should be inhaled (exposed on your face). This also relieves nasal congestion. Regular pranayama (naadi suddhi pranayama) will be helpful for you. Simply antibiotics alone cannot work here.

Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and SLE are two different forms of autoimmune inflammatory disorders which affect the joints, skin, glandular tissue. There are certain similarities between the two but generally, Sjogren's is characterized by decreased secretions from the lacrimal gland (tear producing) and salivary glands. Because of these, the patient has a gritty feeling in the eyes most of the day and difficulty in chewing and deglutition of food. Other than glands, there is some extraglandular manifestation of SS which are similar to SLE in many forms. Sjogren's when present alone is called primary Sjogren's. There is a term used for Sjogren's occurring along with either rheumatoid arthritis or SLE, which is known as secondary Sjogren's. Coming on to SLE, which is systemic lupus erythematosus. Going by the name it can involve any organ system in the body. Unlike SS, which majorly involves glands, SLE is potentially more dangerous than SS due to renal, hematological and CNS involvement. The renal, CNS and other systems are less frequently involved in SS. Both SLE and SS are a type to autoimmune inflammatory diseases in which anti-nuclear antibodies are formed in the body, the antibodies for SS and SLE. SS has anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, while the SLE has a long list of antibodies like anti-dsDNA, anti-smith, antiphospholipid antibodies, etc., are present. One thing to note here is anti-Ro and anti-La are specific to SS but can also be seen in SLE."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,When my son was about three weeks old, I woke up to see that his swaddle had come undone and was resting over his face. When I picked him up he was beat red in the face and sleeping. It took him a little to wake up but was fine when he did. I did not check for breathing at that exact moment because I was so anxious to wake him. I am very worried I may have caused him brain damage. Can a baby get brain damage from this kind of incident? I feel misinformed and uneducated on this topic. Like how it occurs and when it occurs. Also, how do you know if it had occurred? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. If the child has reduced oxygen supply due to such an incident, it may lead to brain damage which will be manifested in a day or two post this incident as a convulsion. That is how you will come to know that this kind of event has taken place. When a baby rests over his face, the nose and mouth may become blocked which will lead to air hunger which causes hypoxia which may cause damage to the brain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother has the following complaints.

Following are the consequences that I am facing through in my daily life: I am not at all confident to talk with new persons, especially in group meetings. My heartbeat used to raise and I will forget things to be discussed. I cannot remember and pronounce properly even with the people whom I meet daily. I do not know how to react when they wish me or when they talk to me. I am trying my level best to get rid of this anxiety by facing it but once in a while, only I could handle these situations up to my expectations. Also, I have intrusive thoughts especially when I go to the temple or when I see the photographs of god, I will feel like something bad would happen to me. If I read a book and implement that in a big project also, I could not remember even the titles. Somewhere I have read, social anxiety can cause memory loss. Recently I forgot my card pin number which I used 2 months back. My concentration power is very poor too. The other problem that I am coming through is uncontrollable daydreaming, even though if I try to keep my mind busy I will get into it unknowingly. I could not do anything to improve my career because of these problems. I am not sure whether it is any disorder or normal behavior of people. Please suggest me if I require any treatment to get rid of these problems.","Doctor":"Hello. You have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and social phobia. I can understand your concern. I have read through your history and from that, it is clearly evident that you have anxiety spectrum disorder. The symptoms like difficulty in talking with persons, increase in heart rate, forgetting things easily, inability to pronounce things properly, difficulty in reacting to others, difficulty to talk in arguments, etc., are due to social anxiety. The symptoms like daydreaming, poor concentration, inability to divert thoughts, etc., are due to anxiety only. The intrusive thoughts, repugnant thoughts like bad thoughts when you go to the temple, etc., are related to obsessive thoughts, and this needs proper evaluation. Social anxiety does not cause memory loss but due to persisting distraction and lack of concentration individuals find it difficult to focus and concentrate. This will cause feelings like loss of memory. Considering your history, I would suggest you visit a psychiatrist for evaluation. Medicines like SSRIs such as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, etc., can help to reduce these symptoms and you will feel better. These medicines are free of serious side effects and are better tolerated. Apart from medicines, relaxation exercises like yoga, progressive muscle relaxation exercises are also equally helpful in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have severe pain in the neck and shoulders often accompanied by numbness and tingling.

It would have been better if you had included the MRI and X-ray films or at least the report as I believe it is your cervical spondylosis that may be the cause of your current symptoms. I will recommend you to do neck strengthening exercises, shoulder elevation exercise, and take Pregabalin tablets for nerve pain along with Duloxetine and take antiinflammatory tablets for a couple of weeks to see the response.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

In such a scenario, it is better to give measles vaccine one month after full recovery from chickenpox. It is not a problem to give measles vaccine after a month.

Actually, my problem is I do not get wet, and I do not experience any sexual feeling whatever I watch or whatever I do (I mean sexual act or masturbation). Why is it so?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand what you are going through at present. Sexuality is such a topic that most of the people especially females do not discuss. Due to the stigma attached, they do not even come out with their sexual problems. So, I would like to appreciate your initiative to come up with your problem. As you told that you have difficulty in getting wet or stimulated after watching any intimate stimuli and also have difficulty in having sexual activities as you do not get pleasure from them. What you are suffering from is called \\"female sexual interest/arousal disorder\\" (FSIAD).FSIAD is characterized by: It can be caused by endocrine dysfunction, metabolic disturbances, cardiovascular disorders, CNS pathologies, spinal cord injuries, urogenital pathologies, medications, hormonal disturbances, relational issues, emotional disturbances, physical/sexual abuse, and violence.It needs a detailed evaluation to rule out the above-mentioned causes, to plan management for the same.

So, used Monistat injectable and cream. Itching and discharge have gone but I just noticed raised bumps near vagina opening. I am terrified.","Doctor":"Hi. The lesions appear to be genital herpes. But, do not worry, they are not here to stay. These bumps will gradually fade away within a week. If you are in pain, sit in a saltwater bath, apply ice packs, take Paracetamol. Most of the time, it can be confirmed with a swab test.  How old are the bumps? You may take the following medicine. If less than 72 hours, they will prevent the spread. If more than that, do not worry, your body will make antibodies itself and heal you. Since it is a sexually transmitted disease, my suggestion is to avoid any kind of sexual activity while the lesions are active. Swab test from lesions for HSV 1 and 2. Genital herpes. Tablet Acyclovir 200 mg five times a day for five days. Regular use of condom, avoid multiple sexual partners. If recurrent lesions occur, other STDs may be needed to be ruled out."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is suffering from Aspergillus otomycosis. She has had tympanoplasty surgery.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

There is possibility that your large bowel is functioning slow, or it may be a problem with the ejection of stools and not necessarily slow bowel.

My idea was to wait until my placebo week which starts on a weekday and then to take the placebos only up until weekend and start a new pack then. Would this work without changing the effectiveness of my pill?","Doctor":"Hi. You can stop the active pill on Wednesday instead. Take placebo pill on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and start a new pack from Sunday. The plan of preponding periods is bewildering to the body.

Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I would like to know is there fever or any other complaints?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a male, 23 years old, weight is 65 kg, height is 5'9\\". My penis is not getting hard for sex. The penis is getting erect but not getting hard enough. Due to this, I am not able to put my penis inside the vagina. Also, I ejaculate within 10 to 15 seconds (3 to 4 stock). And now I am avoiding sex because of this problem and getting less interest day by day. I do smoke regularly and drink occasionally also. I used to watch porn in excess and masturbate regularly. Please help me out. I am very much tensed about my future sex life. Please consult me what to do I want to get rid of this major issue. I cannot tell this issue to my family or friends also. I do not have enough money to consult a doctor privately. Please look into the matter.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your problems carefully. After getting above mentioned history, my assumption is that your problem is psychological rather than organic. But I need some information and investigation reports to confirm it further. If you want to visit any physician, I advise to consult with endocrinologist first and after excluding organic disease, you need a psychiatrist. Masturbation and doing sex are different issues. In the case of masturbation, we try to ejaculate as soon as possible. But in case of doing sex, we try to do sex as long as possible. So there is a psychological issue. Besides this, anxiety also can precipitate this problem. So after doing some investigation and excluding organic cause, I think you need some psychological counseling."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My teeth are all over the place and I have wanted a brace for years but the dentists keep telling me I need to wait till my teeth fall out as they will not put me to sleep to take them all out but they have not even noticed that I have a tooth which grows out of the gum to separate ways and it causes me a lot of pain. Currently, I am taking Quetiapine, Fluoxetine.","Doctor":"Hi. Usually, by 13 years of age, all milk teeth should have fallen out. If not, then you can ask them to be removed. Also, as the permanent canines are growing out from sideways you can ask your dentist to remove the milk tooth directly below it as soon as possible to allow it space to grow. If your dentist is not doing it, then go find another one. Braces can be put after all milk teeth are removed."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I took the Ellaone emergency contraceptive pill two days ago and have started my period today. So I would like to start taking the combined contractive pill Microgynon 30 today. Will that be fine? And will it be effective straight away?","Doctor":"Hi. Ellaone (Ulipristal) stays in the body for around 36 to 72 hours after ingestion. So hormonal oral contraceptives should be started only after five days, to be assured that there is no reduced effect of combined oral contraceptives due to Ulipristal, which is a selective progesterone receptor modulator. Combined OCPs (oral contraceptive pills) are fully effective after seven days of continuous hormone usage, so you need to take an additional method of contraception like condoms for these days. Please revert back if you have any liver impairment, gall bladder disease, migraine, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, breast condition."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 29-year-old male. Recently, I got married and tried having sex with my wife two days ago. It was my first time and I got discharged during foreplay only and could not achieve erection throughout that night. Even when I got an erection, I tried penetration but just lost erection during penetration. I did not feel aroused and the same symptoms are continuing for the last three days. Either I am unable to penetrate due to weak erections or get discharged within seconds. But, before the marriage, I used to masturbate once or twice a week and always got a very hard erection. I was feeling fatigue and weakness in the body for the last one week and even done bp, blood and urine test and all reports came normal apart from a minor infection which could be due to kidney stone as I have one. So, I request you to suggest me on this matter.","Doctor":"Hi. For providing you the proper treatment I need to know the answers of following questions. What is your age? How long you had been in a physical relationship? Any sexual encounter with a commercial sex-worker? Any history of diabetes and hypertension? Is the condition persistent or deteriorating with time? Does the condition remain constant with other sexual partners, if any? Smoking or alcoholic? Hyperlipidemia? On any medications or hormonal therapy? Any marked curvature in the penis? Any history of trauma, surgery or neurological disorder? Do you have any of these features: Persistent low mood, loss of interest in work, low energy, lack of concentration, disturbed sleep, ideas of hopelessness, helpless, guilt or suicide, change in the appetite, headache, forgetfulness, excessive sweating, the shakiness of hands?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 29 years old, male, suffering from blood bleeding from the back while passing stools in regular intervals. Initially, it bled in two months interval, and now it is one month. How serious is it?","Doctor":"Hello. Blood in stools can be from the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) or from the lower gastrointestinal tract (LGI). The dark altered blood is from upper GI bleed and fresh blood is mostly from the lower GI tract. We need to evaluate various possibilities that can cause such bleeding most commonly being hemorrhoids or piles, inflammatory bowel disease, acute dysentery.  In such a scenario, I would advise you to see your doctor, who will perform a proctoscopy in his office. If any evidence of piles is found, you would be treated accordingly. If he feels suspicious for inflammatory bowel disease, he will post you for colonoscopy. Also, important here is that if you are having cramps, this might be some infection or dysentery. It is not necessary that it will always be associated with loose stools. In such a scenario, you would require antibiotics like Norfloxacin and Tinidazole. In case you are suffering from chronic constipation, you would require to use laxatives to prevent piles. See your doctor and share my opinion with him or her. I hope it helps. Stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having the problem of sperm leakage from my vagina immediately after sex for some time now. It comes out in loads which were not like that in years back just before I had a D and C three years back. I have been trying to get pregnant but to no avail and I suspect this could be due to the D and C and the sperm leakage because the leakage is not normal. Though I had complications after the D and C, some fetal remnants which caused severe pain, came out on its own the next day but still bled for 10 days with the pain minimal. Please, do you have an idea about how this could be causing infertility problems.","Doctor":"Hi. Fertilisation of ova requires a single sperm, and a normal male ejaculate contains millions of them. So sperm leakage should not be the only concern causing your subfertility. You need to go through some tests for you and your partner to rule out other causes as well. D and C (dilatation and curettage) sometimes cause intrauterine adhesions or tubal block, which may be a cause in some cases of infertility. Husband's recent semen analysis, transvaginal scan to rule out PCOS, intrauterine pathology, fibroids, blood parameters: LH, FSH, TSH, prolactin on the third day of periods."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I need help. Two weeks ago, I was at a friend's gathering or party. And we filled a barrel with glass bottle drinks and a lot of ice and a lot of water. Everyone picked up their drinks from the barrel. I had a cut on my finger and constantly dipped my hand in the barrel for a drink. I later got to know some colleagues at the party are HIV positive. But I did not see the water in the barrel bloody or anything of that sort. And I cannot tell if someone had cuts on their hands as well. A week after the incident, I got this mild cold. And I am worried. Please, is it possible for HIV to have survived in the water? Should it be the case that anyone had a cut on his or her hand? Is it possible to have gotten infected just like that? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query carefully. You are tensed about your exposure to HIV. Now I am explaining you everything. HIV infection is usually acquired through sexual intercourse, exposure to infected blood, or perinatal transmission. In your case, you are exposed to HIV by blood mixing fluid to drink. You have to keep in mind that the HIV virus does not survive for a long time outside the body. You also keep in mind that exposure through oral route is extremely rare. So there is very very little chance to be infected by this mean. But if you are worried after that explanation, you can go for a test named ELISA for HIV. But it needs minimum 2 to 3 weeks to be positive in the fourth generation test. And 7 to 8 weeks in the first generation ELISA todetect the virus after exposure. So you should wait."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can delirium be caused by fasting and lack of sleep? My 25-year-old daughter is delirious.

I thought it has to be something physical because it came on so quick, but nothing was found. How do we help her return to herself? Hospital advised Benedryl to help sleep and to encourage food and drink.","Doctor":"Hi. The answer to your query is yes. Prolonged fasting and no sleep can cause mental and physical symptoms similar to mania or delirium or coma. It would have been helpful if serum electrolytes, catecholamine levels, and urea levels were recorded or mentioned because BP is on higher side. The advice for adequate rest and a proper diet is also correct. It may be beneficial to visit a counselor to prevent such episodes in the future."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 28 years old.

Please be advised that a normal ECG while you do not have the palpitation feeling, is not diagnostic of the palpitation. You need to have a cardiac monitor. If the palpitation happens every day, then a 24 hours cardiac monitor should pick them up.

The one on her leg is much larger and seems to spread a little over the course of a few days. The one on the arm is small. She is taking calcium and vitamin D for her osteoporosis and I have given her some vitamin K2 and D3 drops as well from time to time. She is 85 years old.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I can understand your concern. According to your statement your grandmother have been suffering from purple spots on leg and arm with osteoporosis. When small blood vessels are ruptured causing blood to pool under the skin and can create purple spots on the skin are known as purpura. Purpura may be resulted from illnesses such as bleeding disorder, recent history of blood transfusion, cancer, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), infections like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C, CMV (cytomegalovirus), EBV (Epstein Barr virus), etc. It may also occur due to inflammation of blood vessels, blood stream infection, vitamin C deficiencies, medications like Heparin, Aspirin, Sulphonamide, steroid, chemotherapy, Digoxin, Hormone replacement therapy, etc. Purpura are usually benign and may resulted from above mentioned causes and it sizes can vary from small dots to large patches. Senile purpura is benign which affects older people as their skin and underlying blood vessels become more fragile with aging and may bleed from minor trauma. The treatment depends on causes and most of the purpura does not need any treatment and dissolved over time. It may take 4 to 6 weeks to heal. The treatment are only needed for those which are not disappeared over time. You can use topical retinoids along with her current medications. I want to add that according to the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) that are shown here, your grandmother have been suffering from age-related senile purpura. Give her vitamin C and citrus foods like orange, lemon, etc., with application of sunscreen and sun-protective clothing along with previously mentioned medications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Past sexual history and erection of penis in the early morning when you awake from sleep. Though I have some query, I am giving you explanation. Masturbation and real sex are totally opposite things and the maximum portion is psychological rather than physical. In case of masturbation, we do hurry to ejaculate. But during intercourse, we try to make it late as much as possible. So psychology is totally different. During masturbation, you give your total concentration in doing that.

I just want to be clear that no birth control pill or any family planning method that can give 100 % assurance that you will not get pregnant. It only decreases a significant percentage of the chances. So yes, she can be pregnant but if she took an emergency pill then it gives her only 75 % chance of getting pregnant. The spotting after ECP (emergency contraceptive pills), usually 5 to 10 days after is what we call withdrawal bleeding. This is expected since the hormone Progesterone in the emergency pill is so high, it can cause spotting or bleeding after.

It looks like a pimple (or actually two tiny one's side by side) with some reddish outline. It is not painful at all. She does not know about her family history and considers herself medium in terms of skin shade. We are concerned because we read somewhere that the lower leg is the most common spot for a woman to develop a melanoma. We would like to have an opinion on this to know if we should have it checked. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is mostly a wart. Melanoma is generally black in color and is very rarely seen in young age. This lesion of hers has mostly no feature of melanoma. Wart occurs due to one of these reasons say pricking, thorn or from other people if the virus gets into your skin. The virus stays there and slowly grows. Also, a wart is infectious, i.e., after touching a wart if you touch anywhere else, you can get a wart there too. So the most important advice is \\"do not touch at all.\\" Wart has to be removed as early as possible before it spreads much. It can be removed by radio frequency cautery which burns the wart and is removed. Many creams and acids are also there to use, but I consider cautery as the first line of treatment, as chances of recurrence are less with it and the wart is removed in one sitting. I advise her to get it removed by cautery as early as possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have urinary external sphincter void dysfunctioning. The doctor had suggested Botox injection 200.

Good supportive treatment comprising hot water gargles, plenty of warm water to drink, avoidance of smoke, dust and cold foods, avoidance of oily-spicy foods during the course of treatment and a healthy nutritious diet will help remove the infection faster. The white or yellow spots on the tonsil are due to obstruction of small crypts due to the infection. It is a common finding in follicular variety of tonsillitis. You may also gargle the throat with dilute Chlorhexidine mouthwash if there is any bad smell emanating from the mouth. Do revert back to me for any further query or clarification. I will be happy to help you. Hope to find you in good health soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am thalassemia major with factor XIII decficiency, HCV+. I transfuse platelet or FFp daily and RCC weekly. All these things are reacting in my body. My ferritin level is 15000 after chelation therapy. This also reacts badly every time. I am 28 years old. How much time do I have to live more?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows:  The serum ferritin level of 15000 is definitely too high. Along with HCV, the prognosis is somewhat poor. However, without knowing the amount of iron deposition in tissues like the liver, heart, etc, and also the amount of damage to liver secondary to HCV infection, it is difficult to say anything. If all are functioning well, then 5 to 10 years should be easily managed well with therapy. Need to reduce ferritin levels, improve nutrition with protein rich diet and need to have a positive outlook. Liver biopsy for serum iron and amount of damage based on liver function tests and histopathology examination could be helpful in further management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I had been for his appointment where he had an x-ray and found that the bone has not knitted together. He smokes approximately 10 cigarettes per day. I have found through online research, that smoking hinders bone healing and have advised him to stop, even if short term to assist with the healing of the broken bone. He had cast for three weeks and then was transferred to a walking boot with vague instructions on how to deal with it. He is being told that he should be walking more on the ankle which is broken. But, he is worried as he will cause more damage as it is not yet aligned. Also, should he be wearing his walking boot at all times? He wears while sleeping and he removes it while bathing daily.

Also, I have a migraine.","Doctor":"Hi. From the information you have given, your vision prescription is -4. You have not specified whether it is a spherical, cylindrical, or a compound power. You are also using a Toric contact lens, for the first time. The reason for seeing light spreading can be due to a faulty fitting contact lens, because, the Toric lens has to be perfectly fitting, since they carry an axis power. The other reason could due to corneal edema, again due to a faulty fitting contact lens. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old and my hands are very dry and rough. There are very deep noticeable cracks in palms and the webbed skin between the thumb and the index finger is very dry and rough. No lotions help. It is a big self-conscious thing. It has been this way since I can remember. Any help would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. I am glad you asked this. In my professional opinion, this could either be a worse case of dry hands (xerosis) or a localized form of palmar keratoderma, a close-up examination with regards to surface elasticity and color would be elemental in determining the diagnosis. The treatment for palmar keratoderma is different as many medications like retinoids and other medicines are not available over the counter. You will have to see your dermatologist to institute the treatment for the same. In either case, avoid excessive washing with soap. Avoid handling harsh chemicals like washing soda, detergents, bleach, car cleaners, etc., with bare hands. Use hand lotion regularly to keep the skin soft. Take omega 3 supplements to regulate the cholesterol environment in the skin."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My age is 28 and actually, I am suffering from hypothyroidism and my latest TSH is 11.

Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for posting your query. Diet for hypothyroidism is to avoid cabbage, cauliflower, and spinach. Otherwise nothing extra diet is needed. Complications do not happen at any particular level. It happens if the TSH is high for years. Complications are heart problems, slowness in action, high cholesterol and in severe cases coma. I recommend you to increase the dose to 150 mcg and repeat TSH after two months."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Two years ago, I went to a dermatologist to remove a lesion on my scalp. She told me it was a mole and it will regrow again. They checked it and it was not cancerous. So yes, it will regrow again and I am worried because of the aspect. I want to be sure it is a mole, not a wart because it looks to be having papillary tissue. HPV+ aggressive type (condyloma in the genital area) eight years back. No more episodes of HPV. HIV negative and no other diseases.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for posting your question on icliniq. As per the photograph you have sent me (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it does look like a wart, I will make the following points, to support my observation. As you have said, they checked it and it was not cancerous. Was this told you by performing a skin biopsy or just orally? To come to a definite diagnosis of a wart skin biopsy is a must. Warts are known to occur even after removal. Warts spread to other areas of the body as well as you have given a history of condyloma in the genital area. Was a viral typing done for the genital lesion eight years back? 1. HPV in care of wart. 2. Congenital in case of nevus. Skin biopsy. Verruca vulgaris, sebaceous nevus. Verruca vulgaris. Removal of the lesion surgically, or by using radiofrequency or Co2 laser. Try not to remove it with your fingernails, if it is a wart, it will spread to other areas."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,When I was in high school, I had horrible periods. Very heavy bleeding, big clots and they would last longer than a week sometimes. I never told anyone because I was embarrassed and eventually, it calmed down and they were more normal. I still had awful, awful cramps every month though until about two years ago when I went on birth control. Since then they have been super easy, light, only lasting a few days with manageable cramps. But slowly every month my cramps are getting worse and worse again. Any idea, why?","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms can have two causes, one is low pain threshold (pain sensitivity varies among individuals) or endometriosis. Endometriosis is less likely in your case as oral contraceptives are known to suppress it. If you are taking low dose oral contraceptive (Estrogen 20/30 mcg), you can take a high dose (Estrogen 35/50 mcg) for two to three months (if your doctor permits or if you have no risk factor for high dose pill. You can see package insert for risk factors) and see if pain reduces or disappears. Other option would be to take same birth control pills continuously without a break for menses (it can be safely taken continuously for nine months) if it is acceptable to you. Normally, such pain of dysmenorrhoea reduces or disappears after childbirth. So you may have to bear some pain till then."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My first molar is paining. I am applying clove oil and had Aspirin. What is the treatment?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the case and it seems you have an inflammation of the pulp tissue inside the tooth (the sensory area inside the molar). This condition is usually known as caries tooth, bacterial infection has broken the hard tissue of the outer layer of the molar and entered the middle area called dentin. It is the sensitivity area and so there is a constant pain. I suggest you to visit a dentist near to your place in order to clean your tooth from that bacterial infection and to seal it by permanent filling."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, About three months ago, I was diagnosed with periodontitis. I am facing swelling of gums, gum bleeding and pus from gums. I would like to know available treatment options and can it be treated without any surgery. I am 26 years old. I am taking Vitamin C tablets.","Doctor":"Hi. There are two treatment options for periodontitis. First includes deep scaling and medications. Periodically scaling will be done of each quadrant of the jaw in two weeks and meanwhile, you should take following medications, capsule Doxycycline 100 mg one time a day for seven days (take two capsules together at first day then take one capsule from the second day). Tablet Metronidazole 400 mg, twice a day for five days, tablet Flurbiprofen 100 mg twice a day for three days. Meanwhile, keep doing saline water mouth rinses. Take a cup of water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it and do its rinses five times a day at least. For one week, it is the best therapy for healing of gums. The second treatment option is for severe cases in which gum grafting surgery is done. If the first line of treatment does not affect you then go for the second option. Please provide your clinical pictures of teeth so I may suggest what should you opt for. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About 18 months ago, my stomach distended, and my stool turned from brown to light brown and eventually yellow. After that, I started to lose weight at a rapid rate, 40 lbs in 15 months. I was given multiple blood tests, an upper endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasounds. The only thing of significance was minor gastritis and some gallbladder sludge, nothing else. I have no hepatitis or autoimmune issues. I do not have Wilson's disease. 11 months ago, I had a blood test showing elevated ALT liver enzymes and slight liver enlargement. Total bilirubin was elevated as well. I had more ultrasounds, a liver biopsy, a colonoscopy, abdominal CT scan and MRI. Nothing was out of the ordinary with the imaging, except more sludge and possibly small stones. The biopsy showed 'minimal portal and lobular inflammation' with an indication of a resolving process. My liver enzymes continue to be elevated, my stool is constantly yellow and now for the last six months, it floats. At this point, the doctors continue to investigate, but cannot figure out what is happening. I do not drink, use drugs or anything of the sort. I am seeking advice as to what the doctors might not be seeing. I do not seem to have any type of GI or surrounding structure cancers. What else could cause ALT liver enzymes to elevate? Lastly, what would cause a sudden change in stool color and eventually floating? Is there any connection with the liver or vice versa? Could that help explain the weight loss? I cannot gain the weight back no matter what I do. I have stabilized at 196 lbs and I am 6 feet. Any help you can give would be much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. The cause of your weight loss could be maldigestion, malabsorption or systemic illness. Floating stools point toward fat malabsorption syndrome in your case. High liver enzymes can be due to fatty liver or infection of the liver. We need reports to differentiate between these disorders. Investigations to be done: I think you have already done the investigations. Kindly provide the details and reports.

So please tell me a solution to get fairer complexion.","Doctor":"Hi. You can do the following for tanning. Use a very good sunscreen. The proper method of using sunscreen is to use a sun protection cream. Sunscreen or sunblock with SPF of at least 30+ daily. If you are going to be outdoors for a long time you can use SPF of 50+. The sunscreen has to be applied every 3 to 4 hours, as the protection only lasts for 3 to 4 hours.  The sunscreen has to be applied liberally onto areas of exposure from face, ears, and neck to arms and feet. Apply the sun protection at least 20 minutes before stepping out. Time is required for the absorption of the sun protection cream or lotion. The sun protection cream is the last layer to be applied. All other creams or lotions should be applied beneath this. You can apply a talcum powder over it if it appears too oily. There are many options available. Creams, lotions, gels. If you have oily skin, use a lighter formulation like lotion or gel, for normal to dry skin use a cream. You can also use an anti-tanning cream like BAN-A-TAN all over the face at night."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,After taking Unwanted 72, my wife got down within five days.

These medicines have a severe side effect of heavy or irregular bleeding. Your wife had the same side effect. Please check her hemoglobin levels; she might turn anemic if she bleeds much. Continue taking iron pills. It might take one or two cycles to get her periods to get regular again.

Secondly, I would advise you to leave the situation or place which makes you angry. Thirdly splash your face with cold water or take a bath and drink a glass of water. Then you can close your eyes and take deep slow breaths through your nose. While doing so kindly focus on your body muscles individually in a series like the first face then neck then trunk and so on. And also while taking deep breaths, you can count from 1 to 100.

Your panic attack is based on an underlying anxiety disorder. You need to know what is your anxiety disorder. If you provide more details, I will be able to diagnose your proper basic underlying anxiety. You are worried about the panic attack symptoms. You are worried whether the same symptoms will come again. This also is natural. Every one will do so. But, there is nothing to worry. The repeated thinking here actually is expecting the panic attack and that is called obsession. Obsession brings anxiety and apprehension.You need to read a lot of articles about anxiety and panic attacks. Understanding them will ease your doubts.

First is the Raynaud's phenomenon, this is not crucial as I do not experience this as much anymore, making sure my hands are always kept warm. But, if you have any other suggestions I would like to hear them. The one symptom that I am most concerned with is the generalized edema. It has started about 4 years ago and has gotten severely worse. Since then, I have been prescribed diuretics from my doctor. But, whenever I take them I will go through a process of losing about 10-15 lbs in water weight, then after a week of no drug or diet change, I used to go back to the same state as I was before taking the diuretics and sometimes much worse. My doctors and I think that this may be due to my capillaries being \\"leaky\\" and this leaking protein might surround the body tissue area. When I take the diuretics, my body flushes out the water, but at the same time the protein in the area senses a loss of water and sucks in more from my bloodstream by replacing the water I had just lost. However, my doctors are not quite entirely sure that, if this is, in fact, the root problem with water retention. I have kept a very strict diet when it comes to sodium and other things of that nature. Anything of a personal nature that comes to solving this problem that I have tried, have had no successful outcomes. I wanted to know if this is a case you have seen in many other patients with an autoimmune disease, especially the patients with systemic sclerosis. If it is so, is there any effective treatments for the water retention other than diuretics? Is there anything that I can recommend my doctor that will aid me in dropping this water weight and keeping it off?","Doctor":"Hi. According to my opinion, Raynaud's phenomenon is a part of CREST syndrome of systemic sclerosis. In case that is troubling you, the best treatment that I have found very successful is the use of crushed Sorbitrate tablets in coconut oil and apply them to massage over the extremities. This is a very economic and effective treatment. Now, as far as water retention is considered, this can occur in two cases: So, I would recommend you to get the following tests done: I hope, these investigations will be of great help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain. What treatment is required for annular bulging and tear?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help you. For further information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have little bumps on my genital area that could be genital warts. How do I know for sure, and what do I do to remove them and prevent infection?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query. I have seen the attached photograph also (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As per details, these are the following possibilities for your symptoms: The confirmation of diagnosis is done by clinical examination and if needed, a skin biopsy is done. Treatment depends on the diagnosis. Broadly, Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) works in all the above-mentioned conditions. You should visit your doctor for clinical examination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About forty days back, all of a sudden vision of left eye got blocked. After examining, the doctor told VH in my left eye and gave injection Lucentis. What is VH? After 30 days he again examined and told that blood in left eye has totally cleared. He also said that retina has to be arranged properly and for that surgery is required. Central vision is not clear, please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. VH is Vitreous Hemorrhage. Vitreous hemorrhage is common only in long-standing diabetes, which leads to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.If this happens, intravitreous Lucentis (Ranibizumab) is advisable. Another one is intravitreous Avastin (Bevacizumab), this costs almost one fourth of injection Lucentis, please ask your doctor for this. Remember that both these help only in preventing complications. They will not clear the blood. Blood clearance occurs over a period of months. But even after clearing, it may cause traction of the retina (not in all cases) and hence has to be operated and cleared and silicone oil has to be implanted in the eye. These are high risk surgeries and vision after surgery is guarded.  Important part is to always keep diabetes and hypertension under control."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a severely anemic patient. I have been on iron and B12 shots for three decades, but still, there is no improvement. I have got enlarged spleen, IBS, and also no absorption from the gut. I had undergone so many tests but nobody seems to have answers. I stay exhausted, dizzy and pale. Can anything help my severe anemia?","Doctor":"Hi. As you are on iron and vitamin B12 shots, I would assume that it could be nutritional. It is obvious that no absorption from the gut and also IBS will complicate it. Enlarged spleen could be due to increased destruction in spleen or production of cells in the spleen to improve anemia (extramedullary hematopoiesis).  I would like to know the following details:"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,When should I expect ovulation to occur if my cycles are different each month? It has been ranging from 31-35 days. We are trying to conceive, and I take prenatal vitamins every day. We use Pre-seed lubricant and have been trying for eight months now with no luck. Can I have some advice on how to get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. Generally, the rule of thumb is that ovulation takes 14 days before the next periods. In your case, you can take an average of your last three cycles and check with ovulation kit available in the market, starting from two days before two days after the extrapolated date. For example, if your average comes to be 33 days, just minus 14 days on the calendar. So, it is the 19th day from your last period. Now start checking with ovulation kit from 17th day to 21st day. But, pregnancy is not just timed intercourse. For a successful pregnancy, both the partners need to be in their peak of fertility. Please mention your height, weight, previous significant history of medicines, surgery, hospitalization, any sudden weight gain, facial hair growth, husband's semen analysis, any hormonal test, and radiological tests, if done. After these answers, I will be in a better position to guide you. Please feel free to contact."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 22 years old. My height is 147 cm, and weight is 45 kg. I have pcod problem, but no thyroid. Now I missed my periods for three months. So, I am using kalarchikai with pepper everyday morning. I have been eating this for about 25 days now. How long should I take this for getting my period and make it regular?","Doctor":"Hi. I would like to help. Kalarchikai choornam is a well-known medicine to manage PCOD. Its dose and duration depend on the condition. You should take this choornam 3 g twice a day with warm water after meals for 90 days regularly. USG abdomen. PCOD. Kalarchikai choornam 3 g twice a day with warm water after meals. 1. Avoid spicy and fried junk foods. 2. Drink plenty of lukewarm water. 3. Do regular kapalbhati Mandukasana and Ardha Matsyendrasana as well as pranayama like anuloma viloma nadi shodhan and bhramari."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I believe it is an adult tooth. How would a tooth be hollow?","Doctor":"Hi. If it is the second last tooth of the last side, then it is the last milk tooth that got broken, as it falls off in between age 9 to 11 years. If it is the last tooth of arch that got broken it is the permanent molar tooth. It is the only permanent molar in arch till 12 years of age. If it is molar, it is some serious issue. Get root canal treatment or filling done because this is the primary molar that will aid in chewing for your daughter's entire life. If it is deciduous or milk tooth then you need not to worry. A permanent tooth from beneath might have given pressure for the eruption, and so milk tooth will be wearing off after becoming hollow. A hollow tooth is caused by cavities or a broken part of tooth. I can tell you a better exact diagnosis if you can provide me with clinical picture of your daughter's teeth. If it is painful right now, you can give simple Brufen syrup (Ibuprofen) 8 hourly for three days. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have noticed that I have an extremely irritated vagina with chunky discharge that looks yellowish green. I am negative for trichomoniasis and waiting for gonorrhea and chlamydia results.","Doctor":"Hi. An irritated vagina with chunky discharge is a definite sign of vaginal infection.  Most of the time, character, color and odor of discharge helps in identifying the type of infection. Since your discharge is yellowish green, have to keep in mind sexually transmitted diseases. Please wait for the further reports. All the vaginal infections can be treated well with antibiotics. So do not worry. If it is recurrent, please rule out diabetes. Please use condoms, and avoid multiple sexual partners. These two steps can help get rid of STDs forever."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a bad episode of SVT. It was the first major episode. The heart rate was above 200 bpm. I rushed to emergency, today is the fifth day, and still, I have tightness in the chest, shortness of breath and pain in the chest that come and go. Is this normal? I am a 30-year-old female. My weight is 70 kg and height is 165 cm. I am not on any medication yet. I have a history of high anxiety. I had a sudden onset of fast heart rate around once or twice a few years before. I have white coat hypertension. Blood tests taken in the Emergency Unit came back normal.","Doctor":"Hi. The definitive treatment is ablation of the pathway in the heart. An electrophysiology study is done to locate pathway, and radio frequency or cryoablation is done to cure SVT (supraventricular tachycardia). The symptomatic treatment before ablation is tablet Verapamil 480 mg per day. Some degree of fatigue is common after SVT which may last one to two days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a complex case, as stated by my dentist. I had braces five years ago, but my teeth went back to their previous state, overlapped, like they were tightly fit into a small place, apparently because of the shape of my mouth. Also, I have fear from getting braces the second time, that it could cause harm to my teeth and still they would stay the same. Is there another solution? I am 18 years old now.","Doctor":"Hi. I can exactly tell you about your case on seeing radiographs and clinical pictures of teeth if you can provide. While, your query is telling me you had a relapse of orthodontic treatment. Now you have two options. 1. Go for invisible tray ortho treatment (in which invisible trays are given instead of metal brackets). This is an expensive one and treatment time is prolonged. Your teeth will not weaken in it as bracketing will not be done. 2. Go for conventional metal bracketing ortho treatment. Get it done and do get fixed retainers at the end of treatment, that is, the invisible wire at back side of teeth that prevents teeth to come back at their previous positions for your entire life. This is not expensive, a bit economical and treatment result is fast. If your teeth get weaken at end of treatment, get them veneeres or get filling of composites done on them. All will be fine then."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had an abortion four months back. My period returned seven weeks later and ever since then I have been spotting randomly every few days. I was 13 weeks pregnant at the time of the procedure. Is this normal? If not, what could it be? There are no other symptoms aside from very very light cramping. Previous history of the same issue: I did have the Nuvaring before I got pregnant and was taken off of it due to an estrogen-induced stroke. I then tried the mini pill. Current medications: Sertraline.","Doctor":"Hi. Please ensure if you had a complete abortion or there are still bits of retained products of conception in your uterus by doing a transvaginal scan. Since it was a second-trimester pregnancy, there may be chances of RPOC, which can lead to irregular spotting or bleeding. In such case, you may need a D and C (dilatation and curettage) to get rid of RPOC. Secondly, Sertraline reduced the efficacy of birth control pills, and hence failure rate increases. So ensure to take additional precaution using condoms, if possible."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 25-year-old female. I found a quarter-sized hard nonmobile lump under my nipple a day ago. Is that an usual spot to get breast cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. It is usually uncommon to have breast cancer in this age group. It looks most likely a benign breast lesion or a localized infection. You have not given many details about this lump such as skin or nipple color change, any nipple discharge, whether you are married/unmarried or breastfeeding mother, any family history of breast or ovarian cancer which may be helpful in identifying high-risk breast lumps. Nothing to worry about, but it is recommended to visit a mammalogist or a General surgeon and let them examine this breast lesion. If needed they will put you on close follow up or investigate further with ultrasound breast or MRI breast. The significant risk factors for developing breast cancer are. 1. A family history of breast cancer.2. Obesity.3. Certain genetic syndromes.4. Any previous breast lump.5. Hormone replacement therapy, history of estrogen intake.6. Early menarche or late menopause. In case you have any family history of breast or ovarian cancer then you must go for genetic counseling also."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have too much pain in teeth and also getting tiny small type holes in teeth. I am a male, 18 years old.","Doctor":"Hi. Holes in teeth indicate cavities. If you are having severe pain in teeth this may indicate you are suffering from pulpitis and you need root canal treatment from your dentist. Meanwhile, start with the following medicines. Take Augmentin 625 mg two times a day, Gramex 400 mg (Metronidazole) two times a day, Ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day at every eight hours for three days. Take all these medicines for five days.

You are well informed. Adolescence does cause anovulation, that is, you are not ovulating every month. Hence, not getting regular periods. This is often due to an ever-changing hormonal axis in a girl's body. Give it some time to come into its own flow. You in the meanwhile have not got periods for the last 10 months, but need to get at least four periods in a year to prevent the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Your BMI is on a lower range, so increase your protein intake to gain around 3 to 4 kg. Do you do very heavy exercise or have tubular vision or smell problems? That may add up to the issue.

Combination gel of Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide gel on the pimples in a very small amount. 2. If dryness occurs, use a good moisturizer. 3.

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 23-week pregnant with DCDA twin. My CL at week 19 was 28 mm and I was asked to take bed rest. Can I do any exercise because I prefer natural delivery? Currently, I am taking Progesterone tablets vaginally and also weekly Progesterone injection.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. Cervical length needs to be checked again at 24 weeks for further advice. In general, twin pregnancy has a tendency for preterm labor. Your focus right now should be on preventing preterm labor rather than normal delivery. For normal delivery to happen, you do not need to do special exercises (though pelvic floor exercise is supposed to increase the chance of normal delivery). You can start exercises after 32 to 34 weeks when babies will be safe in the outside world. Till then, it is better to avoid strenuous exercise. You can continue routine household work (or maybe morning or evening walk after consulting your doctor)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have smoked excessively (a pack a day) for six years now. I feel the need to quit now but nothing will give me the same feeling and hit that a cigarette gives me. So I have decided to gradually reduce the habit. I have bought a pack of Nicotex and instead of quitting cold turkey, I plan to have one smoke a day and have the recommended 9 to 10 Nicotex gums a day. I want to know if it is safe and hoping it will not cause Nicotine overdose. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. My recommendations would be not to take Nicotine on regular basis. Instead of that, take it whenever you have craving for it. You may take up to 8 to 10 tablets initially, but you have to reduce that also, as few people get addicted to that also. I would recommend you to discuss with your doctor to put you on a medicine known as Bupropion for short duration as it reduces the cravings of cigarettes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 76-year-old woman, weigh 121 lbs, BMI 20. The exam results from annual wellness check-up are as follows: Coronary calcium scan: LMA 0, LAD 185, LCX 1, RCA 90, Total: 276. Routine wellness EKG summary: aortic valve thickened and calcified. Normal mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation. Mild cuspid regurgitation. Mildly increased PASP. Physiologic pulmonic regurgitation. Arterial doppler of legs: Normal flow and pulse. Medication: Only Irbesartan 150 mg. Without medicines, BP varies between 120/70 to 155/80, is labile, so I take Irbesartan to stabilize it. With Irbesartan, it is nearly always 120/80. Additional data: Former smoker for 19 years, quit before 24 years. Genetic data analysis suggests a high risk for CHD. Exercise: I began exercising 2 to 3 times weekly about six months ago. 60 to 100 minutes aerobic, weight training. On a treadmill, I try to keep my pulse to 90 % of maximum (target 130) but it reaches that in six minutes walking at 3.73 mph and it often goes to 135 at which point I slow the walking speed to bring it back down. Recovery time to drop 12 BPM is 75 seconds. Question: Am I taking a risk of stroke by pushing myself beyond 130 bpm (90 %) even if only for a short time? Should I regularly see a cardiologist?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, answering your queries, you should visit a cardiologist regularly and avoid strenuous activities in order to reduce the risk of acute coronary syndrome. Your echo has some abnormalities which are age-related and there is no evidence of CAD. However, calcium score is elevated which implies there is a significant risk of coronary artery disease, which is probably in earlier stages as you do not get any symptoms on the treadmill. However, such minor plaques may rupture and give rise to ACS. So, you should avoid strenuous activity and should be on both antiplatelet like Aspirin and statins. Also, you should undergo a stress test like either stress thallium or stress echo or treadmill test."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A 45-day-old street puppy's teeth touched my finger yesterday but there was no bleeding. Puppy is also fine. What should I do? Please advise me.","Doctor":"Hi. Just tell me whether the puppy's teeth just touched your finger or you got wound also? In case, you just got a touch, then nothing to do but in case, you got a wound then keep the wound clean. Keep a check on the dog also. Meet nearby doctor in case you have a wound. A person who is exposed and has never been vaccinated against rabies should get four doses of rabies vaccine: one dose right away, and additional doses on the third, seventh, and 14th days.

She got a hole in teeth and she is complaining of a toothache for three days and from yesterday, she developed swelling on the right half of the face. Is this any sort of emergency?","Doctor":"Hello. After going through your query and image sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity), this seems to be a case of severe infection inside the right tooth. Tooth decay has resulted in infection in the innermost part of the tooth called pulp that contains nerves and blood vessels. Deep dental caries. Intraoral periapical radiograph (X- ray). Acute periapical abscess or buccal space infection. Acute exacerbation of chronic periapical abscess. 1. Treatment can be planned after analyzing the X-ray. 2. To reduce pain and swelling, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs can be given for 3 to 5 days. 3. If infection beneath the root is not in excess, then root canal treatment can be done. 4. In case of excessive pus and infection, pus drainage followed by extraction should be done. 5. Immediate extraction is not advisable. 1. No hot fomentation should be done. 2. The face should not be covered. 3. No massage should be done. 4. Biting from the affected side should be avoided."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am using Betnelan tablet and Mosegor syrup to stay healthy. Is it advisable to take it? I am using it for the past one year. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. I would not suggest you use them. These tablets and syrup are not going to help you to gain weight or muscle building. Betnelan is steroids and it will cause harm to your body in the long run. Steroid work by replacing the testosterone hormone that would normally be produced by the body. Suppression of natural hormones made in the body is the most common side effect of steroid use. Eventually, the body can no longer produce the necessary amounts of testosterone, leaving the body out of its equilibrium state. Long term use of steroid lower body's immunity and lead to infection and other diseases in your body. In order to build muscle and body there is no better way than joining a gym and supplementing it with a diet rich in proteins. Choose high calorific foods like milkshakes, fruits like banana, pineapple, chiku, pear, and dry fruits. Add more protein like peanut, soyabean, pulses, and meat in your diet. Egg and milk are wholesome food. Take them daily. Warm milk before going to bed brings in a healthy and considerable weight gain. Start with smaller proportions initially and gradually increase the intake. It is important to have a balance between exercise and diet for a healthy weight gain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had two children with cesarian delivery at two years difference. In both cases, l had not got my earlier physique and stomach, as well as the navel, is in its previous place. So please help me in getting my physical touch as soon as possible. Is there any problem?","Doctor":"Hi. Pregnancy causes havoc changes in a woman's body due to loads of hormones flowing in the blood for long nine months. With an increasing girth of your bump, your abdominal skin and underlying muscles too get stretched and weakened, often leading to diastasis recti, which is not observed at first. Now once the pregnancy is over, those weakened and overstretched muscles are noticed as a lax abdomen and saggy belly. During pregnancy itself, we need to do work on our posture alignment, and some regular exercises (walking, swimming, yoga, belly breathing, squatting, abdominal bracing) to keep the core muscles strengthened. Physiotherapists can give the best idea. The same exercises need to be continued, immediately after delivery too to help regain the abdominal muscle tone. In your case, though it is not late, you can meet an experienced trainer, who can guide you to regain your inner core strength and tone. Otherwise, abdominoplasty or tummy tuck is a surgical method to get the things right."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My younger brother aged 18 years, is having teeth bleeding from a month. So I suggested him to consult a dentist and he went for it. As no one was there to guide him about what to do, he got into a trap by some brokers and they took him to their doctor. The doctor said it is pyorrhea and he started clearing it and did not even speak a single word about money. While cleaning his gum, my brother was having a lot of pain in his gums and his gums were receded. Although the doctor just cleaned his tooth and gums became too thin and he does not want to go there. Could you suggest some medicine which could relief his gum pain and make his gum strong like before?","Doctor":"Hi. The best therapy for healing of gums after scaling is as follows: 1. Saline water mouth rinses. Take a cup of lukewarm water, put 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it and do its rinses twice a day, mandatory for two weeks. New and healthy gums grow every 14 days so they will become better in two weeks hopefully. 2. Do Chlorhexidine or antibacterial mouthwash twice a day for two weeks. 3. Take tablet Froben 100 mg (Flurbiprofen) twice a day for three days. That will heal minor inflammation of gums. Kindly give me followup after a week. Avoid going to brokers because a proper doctor and sterilized instruments are very necessary for good oral hygiene. Take care. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother got pain in the right hand, severe pain starting from shoulder backside to elbow for the past 4 to 5 months. She could not lift her hand, drag the things with her hand.","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concern. Pain and limited range of movement of the shoulder joint can be due to various reasons like fracture of the bones forming the joint, injury to the joint capsule, injury to ligaments of the joint or any muscular injury or spasm or injury to any nerve supplying the joint. The other causes are frozen shoulder, less frequent use of the joint due to pain or injury or some chronic disease. Your mother's symptoms appear to be like frozen shoulder where joint becomes stiff, painful and there is a limitation of the movements of the joint. Frozen shoulder can develop by less use of the joint because of pain, injury, after surgery, chronic diseases such as diabetes or stroke. Frozen shoulder is a self-limiting condition, it nearly always gets better with time. It is diagnosed by physical examination. X-ray can help to see whether symptoms are from other conditions like fracture or arthritis. I suggest you consult an orthopedician. You can follow the mentioned instructions. Apply hot water bag over the joint for 15 to 20 minutes 3 to 4 times a day. You can give her some analgesic, anti-inflammatory medicine like any of the NSAID. Physiotherapy will definitely help. Gentle stretching. It can be prevented by gentle stretching of the joint and using joint more often. Check her random blood sugar. Some severe cases may require surgery also, so I suggest you take orthopedic opinion also. Frozen shoulder or fracture of the humerus. X-ray right shoulder- AP and lateral."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 25 years old with the polycystic left ovary. I have been taking Diane pills (Cyproterone Acetate or EthinylEstradiol) for about three years now. I would like to ask if it is okay for long term use? I mean does it have any severe complications of side effect on prolonged use? And I took the pill primarily to correct my hormonal imbalance and to correct my menstruation. But does this pill really have a contraceptive effect?","Doctor":"Hi. Diane pill is a fourth generation OCP (oral contraceptive pill), that is, an advanced generation pill. Apart from its contraceptive use, it is more often used for its wonderful non contraceptive use. As it is an OCP, it will definitely prevent pregnancy. For a young girl of your age (taken into consideration, that you are healthy in all aspects), it should not pose any problem. For ladies more than 35 years, smokers, ladies with a migraine, liver derangement, jaundice in last six months, gall bladder stones, hyperlipidemia, diabetics, hypertensives, any breast malignancy, history of stroke, etc., it can cause some serious issues like thrombosis, blood clots, deranged blood parameters."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Acetaminophen is safe compared to Percoset. Single use of Percoset never causes permanent side effects. The side effect caused by a single dose (such as loss of appetite and difficulty in emptying bladder) will be for one day only. Once the amount of drug gets excreted from the body (now drug within the body becomes less gradually), automatically the effect or side effect (mentioned above) must disappear. Only for the usage more than 3 to 5 days, may lead to more side effects. If used for more than 10 days, the permanent side effects may come. Nothing to worry about vocal card swelling.

If it is more then 10 miu/ml, then more likely to be pregnant but if beta hCG shows increase in 48 hours around 66 %, then it is gradually progressive pregnancy and if it is increasing but less than 60 %, then it could be ectopic pregnancy and if it shows a reduction in 48 hours, then it is miscarriage. If you have already got bleeding after hCG report, then it is better to have a repeat beta hCG and transvaginal scan to exclude any need of evacuation.

What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. A heartbreak or a fall out of a relationship is a saddening experience. There is a feeling of loss coupled with damage to self-esteem. But lots of people experience it at least once in life. Here are a few tips to cope with it. Sitting or lying down all day at home will not help and in fact, worsen depression. It is time to interact with friends as much as possible. Treat yourself to a movie with friends, a dinner, a visit to nearby holiday spot. If these sound difficult, at least interact on phone. Indulge in your hobby which you enjoy. Share your thoughts with a close family member or friend. Get active physically. Join a gym, start cycling, or maybe dancing if you like. Realize that it is better that it happened now rather than farther late in the relationship when you would have been more emotionally invested. It has been a while that you are used to being in a relationship. Do not be scared of being single for some time. It is worth enjoying too. Do not rush into your next relationship right away. Remember that time heals all heart trauma in a way that you emerge stronger and emotionally healthier out of it. If you feel that it is difficult to begin these activities, see a psychologist or psychiatrist. Sometimes an initial help is needed to get out of this cycle.

See gaining weight depends on metabolism, genes, and activity, etc. Metabolism of every person varies depending on thyroid gland functioning. Genes mean that if your parents are skinny then there are chances that you will be lean. Physical activity also determines weight gain. Without any indication, protein powder intake is not good. It may lead to health issues. Bodybuilders take it but they take it under the supervision and it is required in them.

Have proper dressing, recreational activities, nice perfume, beautiful environment, light music to have a nice mood and proper orgasm before sex. You can use lubricant as well if unable to get secretions. Have complete check and treatment of any health issue you have. Have a better physical and mental health. I hope things would be better.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am applying a petroleum jelly daily but after that, my face looks dull. No glow on face after washing with face wash. It glows but not after applying vaseline petrolium jelly.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understood your concern. You have a combination skin which is a little difficult to take care of. In the morning, wash your face with Cutishine facewash and follow up with a good sunscreen like Suncros or Sunban ultra XL gel. Reapply sunscreen once more in the afternoon. In evening wash your face with Cutishine again and apply a moisturizer like Venusia Max while your skin is still damp. Just before sleeping wash moisturizer off with normal water and apply GlyAHA Koj cream all over your face. This should solve a lot of issues for you. Follow up with us after one month."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 51 years old with normal weight (fit), yet he has diabetes and now a heart problem. Just got an angina attack. Doctors say bypass or angioplasty are the options since three of his heart valves are 70 to 80 % blocked. He is on a strict diet with no oil at all and only salad. We have recently heard that there is an option EECP, so we were thinking to jump in that instead of the surgery. Since we are scared and not ready for that mindset yet. My question is that is EECP a good option? My father is feeling alright since 3 to 4 days?","Doctor":"Hi. Science is based on evidence and experiment. As for as three-vessel disease and diabetes mellitus, the evidence favors CABG (bypass) if there are suitable targets (which means vessels can be attached as a bypass). There are many trials which support this decision. Another option is PCI (means angioplasty). So if talking about the treatment of choice in your case, it is CABG. If it is not possible or feasible or desired, then the next option is always PCI. Regarding EECP, it is usually reserved for those patients who are neither candidates for CABG nor for PCI, who are on maximum medical treatment and still have chest pain. In such patients, EECP can be an option. EECP is never the first option in those patients in which CABG or PC is possible. Yet medical ethics says always respect patients choice. If the patient does not want to undergo an invasive procedure, then non-invasive procedures such as EECP and medical management can be kept on top. No doubt, EECP is also effective in treating anginal pain. EECP, in fact, causes turbulence in blood in coronary vessels and speeds up the generation of new blood vessels in the heart, but does not open already blocked vessels. In my opinion, I will put CABG on top, PC on the second and EECP on third. But if the patient and his family want EECP, then I will respect their wish."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 4.5 years old son has taken 25 to 30 digestive Anardana tablets without our knowledge. From then, he complains about severe stomach pain after 1 to 2 hours. We have consulted the doctor and he gave an antibiotic course of four days which was completed. Problem is still there. We have done ultrasound, blood tests, urine test. All are fine except 1 to 2 pus cells in the urine. Then, we consulted alternative medicine doctor, he says that stop all medicines and only give a small quantity of milk mixed with water to him. Kindly suggest what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child but do not worry. Since, it has been four days when your child has eaten Anardana tablets and the ultrasound and blood reports are normal, the child probably has developed acidity. Since you have already given antibiotics for four days, there is no point in continuing antibiotics. In my opinion, you should give Digene syrup 5 ml three times a day for seven days to child and syrup Cyclopam 5 ml for pain on SOS basis. 1 to 2 pus cells in urine is a normal finding and nothing needs to be done for it. A small amount of milk with water also helps in reducing acidity. In all, I think that you should not worry much as the ultrasound report is also normal. Review after two days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have recently noticed two very tiny pin sized skin color or pinkish dots on the tip of my penis. I am sexually active but have not been for about four months which was protected. These dots seem to have no feeling when I put my finger over it.

They have been there for about a month and a half now and have not gotten any solutions. I am a 20-year-old male.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query and went through the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), they look essentially harmless and if you do not have any itching and if it does not bother you much, you can let them be. They are either pearly penile papules or overgrowth of sweat glands (sebaceous hyperplasia) and they can be differentiated only on close viewing. That said, both are pretty harmless and are not STDs if that is what you are worried about, but if you do want to get them removed, you can consult your dermatologist and there are minor procedures like radiofrequency to get rid of them."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, When I squeeze my shoulder blades together, my spine always cracks or pops (like cracking your knuckles).

It has been an ongoing pain for three years and it is getting worse. It is very easy to pop and it is addicting.","Doctor":"Hello. The sounds coming from the spine is called as snapping of joints. A synovial joint is a joint where two bony surfaces are enclosed in a capsule with synovial fluid enclosed in it. It is like sound coming from two wet surfaces placed together and now separated. It is a normal physical property. You feel good or relaxed on repeatedly doing it because of your habit. You do not have any muscle weakness. You should avoid doing it repeatedly as repeated forces over a limited area of the spine will predispose it to degenerative changes over the long term.

Kindly suggest the remedy.","Doctor":"Hi. Possibly, you might be having some mild infection in the lung that is causing the congestion towards early morning. When patients come with these complaints, I evaluate them and see if they have any infection or allergy. Symptoms suggesting infection are a cough, thick mucus, chest pain, mucus production while coughing, fever, a headache.  Symptoms suggesting allergy or asthma are running nose, wheeze, a dry cough, sneezing. If you have any of the above kindly let me know details regarding each complaint. Like the time for which it is present, the aggravating or relieving factors. Also, general precautions that you can follow to relieve some of the issues are: 1. Steam inhalation with Carpol plus capsules put in the water, take steam through open mouth twice a day, once before sleep and then in the morning. 2. Avoidance of direct cold winds, AC blower, dust, smoke. 3. Avoidance of smoking and drinking. 4. Adequate nutritious food comprising all nutrients.

He has been prescribed Levolin, Budecort, Montair. Still, episodes continue. What should we do?","Doctor":"Hello. Your son seems to be suffering from asthma. It is a hypersensitive disorder where the airways are hyper-reactive. The lasting solution is avoidance of triggering factors. The hypersensitiveness cannot be cured by medicines but can be kept to a minimum using steroids and other medications. I suggest you take the medication as told by the doctor. Levolin inhaler is for acute episodes and Budecort is to be used for longer duration. Budecort contains steroid component which reduces airway inflammation, also it has to be tapered before stopping. Tapering means the reduction of dose gradually over days rather than an abrupt stoppage of medication. Montair contains Montelukast which is leukotriene inhibitor which reduces the concentration of pro-inflammatory substances. The drug is helpful during acute episodes. Try to avoid cold winds, dust, house dust, etc. After kid wakes up, remove the bed-spread and take it out of the house and vigorously shake it to remove all dead skin cells, dust, dirt, etc. Also during windy season construction material from construction sites may trigger asthma episodes. Pollen from the garden can also do the same. One must make a note of the triggering factors so that next time he can avoid those factors.  Adequate nutrition which stresses building the right immunity for your child is very important. Foods rich in green leafy vegetables, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, and all vitamin B complex and minerals are important to build immunity. Taking a portion of amla everyday can help your kid get adequate vitamin C. Provide him with Iron and Potassium rich meal. A strong immunity can help avoid small offending agents. However, the best method is to avoid triggering factors."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 9-month-old son is facing problems of the chest with a cough for the last four days. He coughs the whole day like he is going to vomit but nothing comes out. Please suggest the medicine to use so that his cough, sputum can come out.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child. It seems that your child probably has got a lower respiratory tract infection. Since you are already taking antibiotic Ofloxacin prescribed yesterday according to prescription attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems that your child is not responding to it and we have to change the antibiotic. According to the prescription attached, the weight of the child is 8.1 kg. In my opinion, you should take syrup Cefpodoxime (5 ml equals 50 mg) 2.5 ml three times a day for three days. Continue syrup Wikoryl 4 ml three times a day for three days. If wheezing episodes is present then give nebulization with Duolin on SOS basis. However, since this is a prescription medicine, I suggest you to meet the local doctor to confirm the diagnosis. Review back after two days.

Can I use Tugain Foam 10 % Minoxidil hair gain treatment as well as Morpheme Bhringraja (Eclipta Alba) for hair and skin care 500 mg extract 60 Veg capsules together for the better result?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your question but unable to understand what kind of alopecia are you having and how severe it is. If it is in the beginning stage, Minoxidil can reduce your hair fall. Use 5 % Minoxidil instead of 10, as 10 can be very irritating to the scalp. Eclipta alba has reported hair growth properties but research is more in favor of locally applied ether or ethanol-based extract rather than oral medication. But yes, there are reported benefits in grown factors seen with Eclipta alba, so you can continue taking that. Take supplements containing biotin like Follihair for augmenting the growth. If your hair growth is still not satisfactory, please discuss with your dermatologist about starting you on low dose Finasteride. (1 mg alternate days).

Anxiety occurs when our brain starts sensing danger without any external cause following which body and brain come to the activated level and physical and mental symptoms of anxiety occur. The things you need to know about anxiety and panic attacks are as follows: 1. Do not panic. It will increase the anxiety and panic of the person suffering from it. 2. Treatment is the mainstay, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. Ask your friend to get the regular follow up of his psychiatrist. 3. Whenever your friend suffers from the panic attacks, tell positive motivating things like, ask him to take a deep breath, relax, offer him a glass of water, tell him that this will go off and he needs to stay little calm and everything will be alright.

You are conscious about your health and that is commendable. Firstly, you need to rule out diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and C (HBsAg, anti-HCV), syphilis (VDRL), gonorrhea (smear test), chlamydia (smear test), herpes (IgM and IgG) which are commonly sexually transmitted via the respective blood tests. Cytology or pap smear is just screening for cervical cancer irrespective of HPV or any other sexually transmitted infection. You can check for HPV-DNA, chlamydia, gonorrhea test from the vaginal aspirate. as well as a throat swab. It is perfectly normal to have any kind of sexual relationship, keeping into account both partners are stable in their relationship and are tested for STD.

About a year ago during a stressful time, it got worse. It seemed I was nervous all the time, apprehensive, basically felt terrible. This only made anxiety worse, etc. I take a low dose of Klonopin and really do not like to take that. My doctor prescribed SSRI which seemed to make things worse. All the time affecting my functioning with my job and whole life. Recently, I was diagnosed with subclinical hyperthyroid. Scans and uptake all appear normal. She wants to put me on a low-dose of anti-thyroid medicine. I am so confused because I do not like taking medications but want to feel better. Will this help and can you ease my anxiety over taking the medicines?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query. Anxiety requires a two-way approach for its management- psychotherapy, and medication. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy: This involves talking about your anxiety to a therapist so that you do not keep your fears to yourself. Not just a therapist, I feel you should talk about it with anyone you are comfortable with. You can make some lifestyle modifications too to help you. Be physically active. Develop a routine so that you are physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities. Quit smoking, cut down alcohol and drinking coffee. Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety. Use relaxation techniques like meditations. Keep calm and breathe. Self-talk helps too. Make sleep a priority. Eight hours of sleep is considered adequate. Eat healthy.  Medications: This requires trial and error to choose a medicine that you can tolerate well. I feel SSRI's are a good choice. Please take the medicines for at least a month to see if you have adapted to it before switching to another one. And if you feel better with Klonopin, you can choose to take it. Subclinical hyperthyroid: It is caused when the thyroid startshyperfunctioning but it is not detected clinically. Symptoms include palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance, sweating, nervousness, anxiety, reduced feeling of well-being, fear, hostility, and inability to concentrate. I feel your symptoms of anxiety are aggravated because of subclinical hyperthyroidism. So I would advise you to start taking antithyroid medicines as they would control the level of thyroid in the body and hence help in reducing the symptom."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am preparing for MBBS for last three years but have not gotten selected till now. My friends got selected. So, I feel this is really harassing me. Because of this, I am very much depressed for the last year. My problem is not that I have not got selected in MBBS but my problem is that I am having headache for the past year. Sometimes it stays for four to five days. Before one year there was no problem when I travel in bus or four-wheeler but from last one year, I am having headache and vomiting feeling while traveling by four-wheeler or by bus. Because of this, I am getting more and more tension and depression. So, please suggest me if it is necessary to go to a neurologist.","Doctor":"Hi. You are having headache for the last one year, so definitely treatment is needed. There are two possibilities in this case. It may be a tension-type headache (as you are tensed due to preparation) or a migraine (of adolescent-onset). For making an exact diagnosis and prescribing treatment, I want to know about your headache in detail."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Today my mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer stage 4. She is having a fracture in the hip bone for two days and was admitted in hospital for that. Later, it was diagnosed as cancer. They are planning to do surgery for fracture and after that chemotherapy. Now she is unable to walk or sit. Is there any risk in doing surgery at this stage 4 of cancer? What are the treatment for this stage? What is the prognosis? Please give us a reply.","Doctor":"Hi. She needs PET-CT whole body scan to establish the sites of metastasis involved all over the body. Breast cancer only with bone metastasis has a good prognosis. She needs six cycles of chemotherapy first and then reassessment. Surgery is indicated for spine or bone for fixation of fracture and local radiotherapy. Surgery or radiation for breast is not warranted at present. If the spread involves liver, lung or brain other than bone, then prognosis will be bad."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is a patient of epilepsy for 22 years. Earlier she was diagnosed as GTCS (generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and CPS (complex partial seizures) and given Eptoin 100mg BD at first, then Zeptol CR 400mg BD with Cloba 10mg for fits, convulsions, and senselessness. But still, it was going on. Now, for the last two years, we consulted another doctor, who diagnosed that her treatment was not in the right way. He said that the seizure was idiopathic generalized epilepsy with absence seizures and she was given Encorate Chrono 500mg BD with Cloba 10mg. After this, she was good for two years. Then she again developed fits, senselessness, and convulsions this year. So, we went to the doctor and this time the diagnosis is combination of multiple seizures with psychogenic non-epileptic seizure and was given Encorate Chrono 500mg BD, Levipil 500mg BD, Cloba 10mg HS, Nexito 10mg HS. But still fits and convulsion is going on after coming back from the hospital. Please advise what has to be done. Is the treatment going in the right way? Is there any need for medicines such as Topiramate or Lacosamide or Tiagabine medicines?","Doctor":"Hello. Your mother's situation seems to be very complicated. I would like to explain that it is true that Carbamazepine (Zeptol) can have no good effect or even worsen idiopathic generalized seizures. The valproate plasma levels should also be performed, to know if she is being treated with the right doses of Encorate Chrono. I would recommend performing a brain MRI and a careful EEG to establish any possible cause of these seizures, which could be treated by a possible brain intervention. I would also reconsider the treatment with Escitalopram (Nexito), as it is an SSRI(Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) and in rare cases has been shown to aggravate the seizures. Hope it was helpful."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I found 8-10 red spots on my upper right thigh and a few weaker spots on the right and left leg. They are not itchy. I noticed them just this morning.The spots are red in color. Their size is about 1/16\\" to 1/8\\" diameter. I am taking Flonase since last week. Should I quit taking it? What could it be?","Doctor":"Hi. I have viewed the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) It is a case of papular urticaria, a type of insect hypersensitivity reaction with irritant dermatitis. It is a very common problem and harmless too. It has nothing to do with Flonase (Fluticasone propionate). So, if you are using it for any other indication you can safely go for it. Just apply Mupirocin ointment twice daily. The spots will completely subside in 1 week. Please let me know if any new lesions are continuously appearing, as in that case you may need oral medication."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mom recently died due to heart attack. She was an asthma patient and also had depression. She was having medicines for all these. One morning, I saw her biting her tongue and was unconscious. I rubbed her chest slowly that she breathed. When I stopped rubbing, she stopped breathing after some time. After sometime I again rubbed and she breathed and stopped breathing after I stopped rubbing. A doctor came home and confirmed her death and all that he asked was whether she had any heart disease. I guess it was a silent heart attack. Please let me know how could have I saved her life or the procedure of rubbing the chest was right or wrong? Also, if I had rubbed the chest continuously whether it could have helped? (or only CPR will help in this case). Just asking this question to help someone else in future.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I appreciate your interest to know the emergency life-saving procedure. Tongue bite usually occurs in seizures and not in heart attacks. There is a possibility of a seizure in her case. Many reasons can be there for such an incident. It can be due to fall in sugar levels, due to side effect of asthalin in medicines, due to missed drug, due to high potassium caused by respiratory drugs, due to high blood pressure causing brain stroke, etc. If there is a heart attack or cardiac arrest, then the best way is to give CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). Do not rub, but compress the chest with your hand and release as if you are manually pumping blood. Also, you should have given mouth to mouth respiration if you thought she is intermittently breathing. This way you are pushing air into lungs manually. The purpose of CPR is to allow lungs and heart keep working till we can get the patient onto a machine. Since the diagnosis here is not clear, we would suggest that what you did was in the right direction but you should have applied more pressure and done it aggressively. Please learn basic CPR from any institute or doctor so that next time you know how to save someone!!"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 39 year woman.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I want to know the risk factors and protective measures I can take if I choose to start a sexual relationship with him.","Doctor":"Hello. Type 1 herpes is a sexually transmitted virus. It spreads with contact with an infected person. It can lead to oro-genital infective lesions. To prevent it, avoid any kind of sexual contact with the infected person especially when the person is having active lesions. If you already had the contact, take precautionary prophylaxis of antiviral medications. Yes, you can have sexual contact with the person but there will be minimal chances of getting infected even if the partner is not running any active lesion. Condoms do not prevent the spread of infection in this case."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a premature ejaculation problem. I got married five months back. Initially two months back, I was able to do intercourse well but now before the start of the intercourse, I am getting the ejaculation. We are planning for a child now but I am much worried. My height is 187 cm and weight is 102 kg.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your situation. Premature ejaculation is not a disease of the body and it is seen in almost all men at some point. It occurs because of your tension and anxiety about performing sex or previous bad sexual experiences. Medicines can be taken initially to reduce your anxiety if you are married or having regular sex.  Practicing exercises to strengthen the muscles which help in ejaculation and retraining penis to ejaculate late would be a permanent solution rather than medicine. No permanent cure with allopathy, ayurveda or any system. It happens because of so many factors like as follows: 1. You have been training your penis to ejaculate early all these days. 2. You will be very anxious about losing the erection and will hurry up for intercourse. 3. Glans of the penis may be very sensitive. 4. The desire may be too much. You can try tablet Duralast 30 mg two hours before sex only till you get confidence."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, This afternoon I noticed some pretty severe gum recession on my left lower cuspid (approximately 5 mm). As far as I can tell, it is the only tooth with any signs of gum recession, and I think it might be due to crowding (my lateral incisor and first bicuspid are slightly behind and might well be pushing forward) because of that. Is this an urgent issue for a dentist or can it wait, and if so, is there anything I can do to help the issue?","Doctor":"Hi. It is okay. You do not need to rush to the dentist. The clinical scenario of teeth that you told indicates that most probably this gum recession is caused by yourself. You brush like giving a slight high power stroke on right and left bicuspids and then with normal force on rest of the teeth. Because of high-pressure stroke, gums in that particular area goes down, causing sensitivity of tooth. Another cause could be plaque or tartar around that particular tooth causing gums infection that results in receding gums. But still, I think it is your brushing technique that is the main cause of receding gum. Tell me about it. You just have to change your brushing technique, do not do harsh brushing in that area. Take a soft bristle tooth brush. Avoid severe hot or cold food stuff till you visit your dentist. Rest treatment will be done later by the dentist and that could be scaling or filling of abrasion. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I do not know what disease I am suffering from but it is killing me deep down. I do not want to get married, my parents are forcing me. Please help. It is going on from past 3 to 4 months. At times, I feel like going away from the house or to kill myself but then I see towards my family and the idea of dying gets ruled out. I was suffering from mild depression but my parents do not know about it.","Doctor":"Hello. Let us summarize your complaints, thoughts of running away from the current situation, occasional suicidal ideas, avoidance of marriage. Marriage is a cause of joy but it is a stress in itself. So, maybe you are trying to avoid further stress because you are overwhelmed with the stress of your current life. Besides, medical education is tremendously stressful and enough to cause depression in the vulnerable.  Besides, you give a history of mild depression in the past. If you are having suicidal thoughts, even occasionally, it is a marker of severe depression and needs treatment by a psychiatrist. Other symptoms of depression include sadness, loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities, change in sleep, appetite, weight. Anxiety, guilt feelings, pessimistic thoughts, if you feel that you also have these symptoms, then it is likely to be a major depressive disorder. It can be treated with antidepressant medicines like Escitalopram or with counseling, psychotherapy with a psychologist. If you do not have these symptoms, then we will have to search for other causes of your current complaints. Send follow up to this query if you have any other symptoms. Take care.

My hemoglobin is 10.5, RDW-CV is 18.3, MCHC 39.6, hematocrit is 26.5. Any issues, let me know and what you prefer for me? Please let me know.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. As per the values mentioned by you, the hemoglobin level is low which indicates anemia. RDW-CV is on the higher side (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Its normal value should be up to 15. A high RDW-CV favors iron deficiency anemia. But it can be seen in B12 and folate deficiency also. Hematocrit is low. The normal value should be between 37 to 48 % for women. All the three parameters are indicating towards iron deficiency anemia. Only MCHC is contradictory but in early stages, you can find normal or slightly high MCHC in iron deficiency anemia. To confirm it, I suggest you few blood tests like a peripheral smear, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin levels, serum B12, and folate. There are many causes of iron deficiency anemia like chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, menorrhagia, hookworm infestation, dietary deficiency, etc. In my opinion, you should consult a physician and get evaluated properly so that the cause of anemia could be found and proper treatment in the form of iron supplementation can be given.

No pediatrician nearby and we have to drive six hours to another town for the pediatrician. Please suggest me?","Doctor":"Hi. Crying while voiding urine and fever might be due to urinary tract infection (UTI). Urine routine and microscopy needs to be done for screening and if it suggests infection, then urine sample for culture and sensitivity needs to be given and oral antibiotics has to be started. The culture report, which takes two to three days will guide the further use of antibiotics, if any infection positive. Antibiotics should be started only after giving off a sample for culture and sensitivity, if UTI is suspected. Giving urine sample for testing after taking antibiotics might alter the test report and delay the infection.

I have read your query. Developmental stuttering is a common form of stuttering seen in children under 5 years. Stuttering occurs when a child is learning speech and language skills. It occurs because of the child's language and speech ability are unable to manage the child's verbal demands. They do not require any treatment as the stuttering stops as command over language and skills is obtained. A speech language pathologist can help diagnose stuttering. No invasive testing is necessary. Typically, you or your child can describe stuttering symptoms, and a speech language pathologist can evaluate the degree to which your child stutters. Not all children who stutter will require treatment because developmental stuttering usually resolves with time. Speech therapy is an option for some children. The best candidates for speech therapy include those who have stuttered for three to six months, have pronounced stuttering, struggle with stuttering or experience emotional difficulties because of stuttering, have a family history of stuttering."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father aged 83 years is physically healthy but he is hearing some of the old friends sound continuously which we cannot hear, for 10 days. So, kindly give us some advice as soon as possible.","Doctor":"Hello. This symptom of hearing things when there is no sound is known as an auditory hallucination. At his age, there could be a number of causes of the same as: 1. A stroke which has affected the blood supply of the part of the brain responsible for hearing. This is likely if he has untreated hypertension. 2. If there are other complaints like forgetfulness, not remembering names or recent events, or anger and sleep disturbances, along with this hallucination, then it could be dementia. 3. Old age psychosis or depression with psychotic features. This auditory hallucination is just a symptom caused by an underlying disorder. It is advisable that you see a neurologist who will be able to investigate and diagnose the underlying cause and treat accordingly. The treatment will differ depending upon the cause of this symptom. It is advisable that you take treatment from an experienced neurologist because, during this age, the patient is very sensitive to side-effects.

I run cold water on my hand doing dishes or washing my hands. Sometimes, it feels like it has a severe cold burning or numbness. But every time I am moving it, it still really hurts so much.","Doctor":"Hi. The cause of redness with or without numbness in your pinky finger could be from Raynaud's phenomenon, nerve disease, vasculitis or rheumatoid arthritis. Since you are complaining it to be related to cold exposures, it is more likely to be Raynaud's phenomenon. This process is due to cold injury to the blood vessels which are contracted because of the chilling effect of cold. This is also to conserve the heat inside leading to cyanotic spells in the peripheral vasculature. It is quite common in some persons after exposure to cold there is progressive redness and then bluish to purple discoloration of the skin accompanied with warmth and pins and needle sensation at the affected area. I advise you to protect yourself from cold. Use of vasodilator drugs is part of a conservative regime that is advised in mild cases after consultation with a doctor.

These tests are nowadays routinely done even in younger mothers. According to your blood tests and USG findings (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you are on lower risk, that is, 1 in 10000, while as per your age it is a bit high risk, which is why the test was offered. Preferably you can opt for second-trimester quadruple blood tests during 15 to 18 weeks as well to keep you relaxed and finally do an TIFFA scan at around 20 to 22 weeks.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It should be safe and be able to buy online, preferably FDA approved.","Doctor":"Hello. Snoring while sleeping is usually associated with sleep apnea syndrome. Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which pauses occur in breathing during sleep. Symptoms usually occur due to obstruction of the airway.For the treatment of snoring, we have to treat the sleep apnea first. Few such devices which I would suggest are: Before purchasing them, do consult a sleep medicine specialist in person for clinical examination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I take Quetiapine XR 400mg. How can I gradually withdraw?","Doctor":"Hello. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic, with a half-life of less than 24 hours. It has a benefit of not causing extrapyramidal side effects. However, it can cause sedation, postural hypotension, and urinary complaints. Although it does not cause any withdrawal symptoms, it is recommended to stop gradually by tapering over a period of time. As you are taking 400 mg XR formulation of Quetiapine, you can taper it by 100 mg every 2 days until you reach a dose of 100 mg, when you reach 50 mg, take 50mg for one more day and then stop. However, if you are taking Quetiapine for some psychotic conditions or acute mania/ BPAD (Bipolar Affective Disorder), I would suggest you to consult your treating psychiatrist before tapering your medications, as at times unsupervised tapering can lead to the reappearance of the symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My period was delayed. I had a pregnancy check which was positive. I consulted a gynecologist since I did not want a baby and hence decided to go for medical abortion (as my son is just 12 months). She prescribed me with medicine and after 48 hours she had asked me to place 4 medicines in my genitals before going to bed. My menstrual cycle started the very next morning and continued for 3 days. After 15 days, she had called me for an ultrasound to examine whether all was done perfectly. I had an ultrasound scan (reports attached). The doctor said that it has not come out completely and therefore prescribed medicine (prescription attached). She gave me two medicines to place in my genitals. Next morning, I had very less bleeding which gradually stopped at night. Doctor, I am very much confused as to what is happening. In no case, I want a medical abortion. Please suggest as to what should I do so that all gets fine.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concerns. I have gone through your history and ultrasound scan and it is showing that the abortion is incomplete and there are a retained products of conception in the uterine cavity. (attachment removed to protect patient identity) Your doctor had given Cytolog (Misoprostol) to clear that product. As you had only minimal bleeding, the chances of retained products are there, so you can repeat your ultrasound scan. If it is still present, then you should consult a gynecologist and get D&C (Dilatation and Curettage) done to clear the retained products of conception."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old female. About a week ago, I noticed an ingrown hair in my pubic area. I left it for a couple of days and then put a hot compression on the area, exfoliated, and tried to free the hair. I used a pin to pull the end out of the skin so I could tweeze the hair out, but I ended up popping the pump and pus just started oozing out. It was sore the next morning and I let it go until tonight, I tried to free the hair again and just ended up squeezing the lump, this time it was a bit larger, again blood and pus came out, but I pulled a hair out with the tweezers and I believe that it was the ingrown hair. I just noticed that my right lymph node in my neck and my groin area are swollen. I would rather not go to see my doctor. Any advice? And the tweezers and pin were both sterilized both times.","Doctor":"Hi. After going through your history, I suppose you are having folliculitis. The lesion is filled with pus, then the best way to get rid of it completely is to incise and drain the pus completely. After draining the pus, you may have to apply antibacterial ointments like Mupirocin. This will take not more than three days to completely cure the infection there. Since you have enlarged lymph nodes, you may have to take a course of antibiotics like Azithromycin, Clarithromycin or Zifi 200 minimum for a week after consultation with a physician."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 24 years old but my breast size is small. Could you please suggest any medicine to increase my breast size without side effects?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. Small breasts may be due to hormonal imbalance, genetics, poor nutrition, thyroid hormone problem. Take diet containing fats and soy products. Massage breast from below upwards and from side inwards using some coconut oil. Change your posture by standing straight and pushing your chest forward will make your breasts look bigger. Exercising the muscles beneath your breasts will make them appear more rounded, it can be done by push-ups done daily for few times increasing gradually. You can also check for PCOS by ultrasound of pelvis and also hormonal imbalance by doing serum (blood) estradiol and testosterone. If there is hormone imbalance then medicine will help you, sometimes oral contraceptive pills increase the size to some extent."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 5 years old daughter has a blood-shot eye and not sure if there is a lump in it. It is not sore. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. From the pictures you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can tell you that the most probable cause of this redness is a benign condition called nodular episcleritis. It is a form of allergic reaction of the body to certain substances and normally subsides over a few days to weeks. It is not contagious but does recur in a few patients. My advice to you is: 1. Do not rub or meddle with the eye, this only aggravates the condition. 2. Use over-the-counter lubricant eyedrops- Refresh tears 0.5 % four times a day until the redness goes away.  3. Avoid dusty, windy, sunny weather. You should see an ophthalmologist in case- 1. There is a sticky sensation in your eyelids which does not let you open them after sleep in the mornings. 2. There is a drop in the ability to see, this is best seen by closing one eye and trying to see with the other. 3. The redness increases or she starts developing new symptoms or the redness does not go away even after a week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have dull pain and pressure in my lower right abdomen for about six months which worsens while sitting. There is kidney pain while running.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. As you mentioned that you are having abdominal pain from a long time, I suggest you get evaluated properly. Chronic abdominal pain that too on right lower has many causes. It may be related to some disease of the gastrointestinal tract or urinary tract or some muscular problem. Disease of small intestine involving ileocaecal junction like ileitis, typhoid ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases, a disease of large intestine like colitis, IBD, a disease of the kidney and urinary tract like stones in the kidney, ureter, etc., can cause pain in the right lower abdomen. The pain related to the kidney is generally dull aching and present in the lumbar area and it can increase with activity. Sometimes, a muscle spasm can also cause severe pain which increases with activity. In my opinion, you need an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm the diagnosis. As your problem is a chronic one you need to consult a surgeon and get your ultrasound done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fiance is having blood in his stool. It is bright red also. He said it hurts while wiping a little. He has had it more than twice a month. His stool is solid and very dark brown. Also, said the blood in the toilet was very noticeable and that when he wiped the toilet paper looked like when you get a bloody nose. Has been having a few stomach aches also.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. Presence of blood in the stool and dark-colored stools indicate that some active bleeding is going on in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract. The blood gets digested in the intestine and comes out through the rectum in the form of dark colored stools. I suggest you consult a gastroenterologist as early as possible. He may need endoscopy and colonoscopy to find out the source of bleeding. If he is taking alcohol, tell him to stop it.  Bleeding in the upper G.I. bleed. Endoscopy and colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Yesterday, I had a colonoscopy and today I had a bowel movement that was bright green. Should I contact the doctor who performed the procedure or is this normal? I am a 32-year-old female.","Doctor":"Hi. Bright green color stool could be due to the presence of bile in stool. During a colonoscopy, you were given laxatives that might have disturbed your intestinal flora that is responsible for the yellowcolor of the stool. Also, stool must have passed rapidly through the gut. Other causes could be: 1. Fat rich diet will increase the release of bile pigments and if it moves rapidly, your stool will be green. It occurs during a period of stress or infections. 2. Rarely diet rich in green leafy vegetables can cause green color stools, if malabsorption ensues or due to not chewing properly. 3. If you have any other symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting or green stools, do not stop within the next 12 to 14 hours. Then I would suggest you consult your doctor. You can take probiotics to build up your intestinal flora."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am not getting full hardness. No morning erection. I got 70 to 80 % hard erection. This is happening for the past two years. Why is this happening and is there any serious problem in my penis? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. It can be due to stress or anxiety or due to a physical cause. For physical cause, you need to do some blood tests. Stop smoking if you smoke. Check BP. If you are taking any medicine or nutritional supplement on regular basis then it may be due to the side effect of that. So relax, do exercise, if no improvement then you will need blood tests.

I have had several brain MRIs over the past 2.5 years. All have noted cerebral microhemorrhages. These are unexplained. I understand that they have not changed in size or character over the years, but one or two more have appeared.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

In my opinion, you need surgical intervention in the form of incision and drainage of the wound.

There are 3 options of which first says \\"sys\\", the second one says \\"dia\\" and the third one \\"pulse'. Which option is for checking the blood pressure and how much should is normal?","Doctor":"Hi. The automatic blood pressure machine is a good investment, and it is good to have one at home even if you are not struggling with your blood pressure. The ideal position to take your blood pressure is with the machine located at the level of the heart. The best way to do this is in a lying position, and you should rest for 5 minutes before taking your pressure. Follow the instruction in the manual as for how to position the cuff around your upper arm or wrist depending on the machine you have. The first value you see \\"sys\\" shows your systolic pressure which is the pressure exerted by the left side of the heart (left ventricle). The second value \\"dia\\" is the diastolic pressure which is the pressure of blood entering the right side of the heart which then enters the lungs. Your blood pressure is then indicated by the systolic over the diastolic pressure. The unit used is mmHg (millimeters of Mercury). Ideal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, but a normal range can be between 115/75 to 130/85 mmHg. Any pressure over 140/90 which is persistent and produces symptoms of blurred vision, headaches, and facial flushing as well as a pressure below 90/60 causing symptoms of breathlessness, dizziness or confusion should be addressed by a health care professional. The third one \\"pulse\\" is pulse rate which is the rate at which your heart beats. A normal pulse for an adult is around 72 beats per minute. A rate of over 100 or below 60 which causes symptoms such as those mentioned above also need to be evaluated."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For the past six weeks, we have been noticing that my father's PP sugar levels after breakfast are in the range of 195 to 250 depending on what he eats.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: C-ANCA (Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) positivity indicates Wegener's Granulomatosis. In this condition, there is involvement of upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys. Most common diagnosis, while kidneys are effected, is Lupus. But I suppose your ANA and anti-Ds DNA are negative.  I would like to see all your reports, and I also recommend you to get an x-ray of paranasal sinuses to see for any polyps that are associated with Wegener's Granulomatosis. A chest x-ray may show a cavitary lesion. You need a kidney biopsy, first of all, followed by which you will be started on immunosuppressive therapy. Steroids and other immunosuppressive agents like Cyclophosphamide, Azathioprine are used. Prognosis and life expectancy can be commented after the report of kidney biopsy, as most of the times fatality occur due to renal failure.

I have had two brain MRI's that have been normal, except for an incidental finding of a pineal gland cyst. I continue to worry about inheriting multiple sclerosis. I am a medical coder. So, I spend a great deal of time in front of the computer. This affects my vision, and I experience back and thigh pain. I am hoping this is due to sitting down all day. I also have a slight hand tremor. However, I am a very anxious person, and I type fast all day long. I wonder if typing all day could cause a hand tremor? I am very active and energetic. I exercise 5 days a week for an hour doing treadmill and stair climbing. I spent a great deal of time this weekend hunched over painting. I am wondering if this is what is causing my current thigh and back pain? I am also due to start my periods anytime. I am still worrying about inheriting multiple sclerosis. What are your thoughts on the possibility of still having multiple sclerosis with two negative brain MRI's?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. It is clear that you are not having MS (Multiple sclerosis) as of date. None of your symptoms are typical of multiple sclerosis. Back and thigh pain is posture related and tremors are anxiety related. Repeated MRI's being normal further rules out this disease. Agreed that multiple sclerosis can be hereditary. If one of the parents is having multiple sclerosis, chances of the offspring having multiple sclerosis are 1 in 50. Since you are having no symptoms and your brain MRI is normal, you need not worry about it.

I got hit with great force by another cart which caused my inner thigh to hit a pole on the inside of the cart causing great pain. The pain is very sore and at first, I could barely walk. I can gently push the area and feel a lot of pain just above the knee.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for using this platform. It sounds like you had a pretty bad impact on your inner thigh. Luckily, it sounds like you were still able to walk in spite of the pain. This means that there is a very low likelihood that you may have a bony or joint injury. Nevertheless, a blunt impact can cause a bruise (contusion) which may be painful on pressure for quite a few days. You may also have some reddish-blue discoloration in that area. If within 24 to 48 hours, you may use ice to reduce the inflammation. After that, warm compresses (heat packs) may be more helpful in alleviating the pain. If you are not able to bend your knee without extreme pain, you may need to have an X-ray to rule out bony injury. The pain and swelling of a bruise should slowly reduce over the next few days. If the painful area swells and the pain worsens instead of getting better, and if you have a fever, then you should see a doctor immediately to rule out infection. Rarely, there may be a collection of blood inside your muscles, and this collection may get infected. Were you taken to the hospital after this injury? Have there been any X-rays taken since your injury? How many days old is this injury?

Also there is pain on resistance to movement.","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Knee joint consists of two bones that are femur and tibia. In between these bones, a few structures are present which provide stability to the joint and make the joint strong. These structures are ligaments which connects the two bones and meniscus which are the fibrocartilages present between the two bones. Injury to the meniscus is a common problem faced by football players and athletes. Probably you had a meniscal injury or tear as you are having pain while bending the knee and difficulty in opening it which is called locking and unlocking of the joint. Not all meniscal tears require surgery. I would suggest you get an X-ray done to make sure that there is no bone fracture. Limit activities of the knee joint. Stop playing football for a few days. Apply ice packs to the knee joint for 15 to 20 minutes 3 to 4 times a day. Apply crepe bandage to the knee. You can take an anti-inflammatory medicine like any NSAID twice daily for five days. Avoid running and jumping. I suggest you take orthopedic opinion also.  Injury to meniscus or ligament of the knee joint.

It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This lesion is asymmetric and presents irregular borders and irregular distribution of the pigmentation presents border irregularity, color variation, and a nodular component of diameter ≥6 mm. Before I make further diagnosis, I would like to know for the last few months is there any change in size and new lesion? Change in color? Change in shape? Is there inflammation?

Pelvic and lower back muscle weakness will give you symptoms of back pain and leg pain. You should do blood tests. Check for vitamin D and B12 levels. These blood tests are useful to check the vitamin levels in the blood which co-relates with muscle weakness of the body.

As you are having bleeding per rectum, you should get evaluated properly. Bleeding in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract can cause brown colored stools. There are many causes of rectal bleeding like piles, a fissure in the anus, bleeding in the intestine, rectal ulcer, rectal polyp, etc. I suggest you consult a surgeon. You need proper examination and colonscopy or simoidoscopy. You can follow the mentioned instructions. Drink plenty of water. Take a diet rich in fibers like vegetables, salads, etc. Avoid oily, fatty and spicy food. You may need a stool routine and occult blood examination. Hemorrhoids, rectal polyp or rectal ulcer."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been having chest pain like a sharp ripping, feeling dizzy, and went to the ER three weeks ago. He did not say anything about my EKG but I needed to see a cardiologist for my heart murmur, but I had to go to my doctor to get a referral. So I saw her, she heard my murmur and said it did not sound good. So, she sent me to the ER that morning. The EKG had huge mountains on it towards the bottom, but they said it was normal as well as the chest X-ray, CT scan but yet I am still having these sharp chest pain, dizziness, feeling short of breath that lasts for 20 minutes or longer, comes and goes especially during housework, and even laying down. I have been dealing with hypertension (high blood pressure for the past 17 years) and on three medicines one of which is a patch. I feel like they have given me the run around because I am a 37 years old female. Please help me. I feel like I will waste my time going back to the ER, and I have to get a referral from my doctor to see a cardiologist. What is wrong with me, Nexium does not help but baby Aspirin does.","Doctor":"Hello. We are here to help you. With chest pain and murmur and a history of hypertension, cardiac chest pain is the most probable diagnosis. However, acid reflux and muscular pain need to be kept in consideration. It is important to differentiate between all as the treatment course is entirely different. The muscular chest pain is dull and diffuse and any movement aggravates it. It is usually continuous and not intermittent like the cardiac chest pain. Cardiac chest pain is severe and crushing in nature. It increases on activity like walking, exercising. It often radiates to the left arm, shoulder and nape of the neck. Following ECG, for cardiac evaluation, you need echo and treadmill test (TMT). If any abnormality is found, then an angiography should be performed. Share my opinion with your doctor. Stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My penis size is 4 inches when erect but all my friends have a length of 5.5 to 6. I feel embarrassed in front of my fiancee. Can I increase it to 6 inches because I think that nothing is impossible? Is there any way? I also suffered erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. The sex time is only one minute.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. There is no medically proven treatment to increase the penis size. It cannot be increased, unless you have hormonal problems like if the serum (blood) testosterone and LH are low. Size of the penis varies from person to person, like other physical features like height, etc. On an average, it ranges from 3.5 inches to 5.5 inches on erection. If your penis is within this range on erection, then do not worry. If your penis is smaller, then you can do hormone tests. In pornographic films, they show big penis by injecting drugs, etc., which is harmful, so most people have wrong ideas about penis size."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My period started 12th of last month. I reviewed the Depo shot two days later. I had unprotected sex nine days later. He ejaculated in me several times. I thought I would be protected but I am also having symptoms of ovulation like high (hard) cervix with a sharp pain in my ovary, then I had spotting for three days (brown to red then to brown again). What are the odds that the Depo is not effective for me? Is it common to experience ovulation and period symptoms on Depo without actually releasing an egg?","Doctor":"Hello. Depot injection does not offer immediate protection and it is advised to maintain abstinence for at least three weeks post-injection before the hormonal balance is readjusted for the cycle. Also, intermenstrual bleeding in form of dark brown blood is a common side effect which is seen with Depot injection. Also, it would be difficult to comment on the ovulation bleed as this is possible in this cycle as this would be the first month of Depot injection and hence barrier contraceptive is advised for initial 2 to 3 weeks. As you have had unprotected intercourse on day 11 of the cycle, there may be a possibility that the bleed may have been ovulation and not due to Depot and you may get pregnant. Once the best way to rule that out would be to undertake a serum beta hCG test after seven days of last intercourse and if the hCG levels are higher than 5 ng/dl, then you are pregnant, else safe."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have TB disease, type1 respiratory failure. Oxygen was given, oxygenation improves but falls to LVL on presentation. What support should be given before the onset of hypercapnia? I have dry cough for two weeks, blood in sputum, fever, sweating and weight loss.","Doctor":"Hello. As you said, the patient has TB, hypoxia is more common which leads to type 1 respiratory failure. So only supplemental oxygen is not enough. We should start noninvasive ventilation as early as possible before hypercarbia sets in. So the possible options for NIV are CPAP or BIPAP depending on availability. The IPAP and EPAP pressures can be set up according to blood oxygen levels and oxygen saturation to be aimed to keep above 95 %. Minimal sedation will keep the patient calm and also help to reduce further hemoptysis.  Supportive measures like good nutrition and good nursing care should help to recover faster. Frequently keep a watch on blood gases. If NIV is not helping to keep oxygen above 95 % or hypercarbia sets in, mechanical ventilation may be needed. Ultimately we have to titrate depending on the blood oxygen levels. Antitubercular treatment must be continued simultaneously. Antibiotics according to infection markers.  TB. Arterial blood gas. Pneumonia. NIV and anti TB treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am facing certain problems which include balancing problems, blurred vision and sometimes, headaches, concentration issues. It has been 2 to 3 months that I am facing all these.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. The cause of your symptoms can be related to brain disorder or vitamin B12 deficiency or eye problem. In my opinion, you should consult a physician first because you need a thorough neurological examination. These symptoms can be related to cerebellar disease which is a part of the brain. Vitamin B12 can also cause balancing problems, headache, concentration issues, etc. Sometimes, a refractive error in the eyes can also cause balancing problems, blurred vision, headache. I suggest you consult an ophthalmologist also. Get your serum vitamin B12 done. If you have low levels then you may need B12 supplementation. Cerebellar disease or vitamin B12 deficiency, eye problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a headache all the time, like a spinning head. Whatever I eat, my headache does not go. I use simple Panadol, but no effects on my headache. It is from the last 10 months, after my pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hi. Your frequent headaches along with dizziness or spinning could be due to raised blood pressure or hypertension, migraine, tension or stress, hypoglycemia, etc. Hypertension, migraine, and stress are the most common causes for the headache. Without examination it is very difficult to tell the exact cause. I would suggest you measure your blood pressure, if found raised then you have to take antihypertensive medication after consultation with a doctor.  Migraine causes head pain. There are certain trigger factors for migraine like lack of sleep, starving, stress, certain food, and smell. The treatment for migraine headache comprises management of acute attack with painkillers like Naproxen, Aspirin, Paracetamol. Drugs like Propranolol, Topiramate, Flunarizine or Amitriptyline may be taken after prescription from a neurologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, From the 16th of this month, I started having sex with my fiance a lot. Five days later, I started having really bad stomach pain and the next day, I started bleeding. It was light. So I thought it could be implantation bleeding, and Iwent and got a test. I am not supposed to have my period again until the beginning of next month. The home pregnancy test I took came back negative but I am not sure if it is because I took it too early before my missed period, but my bleeding has gotten worse. It is really dark and heavy and has a lot of clots, and the stomach pain is still bad. I am worried it is a miscarriage chemical pregnancy. Is it too soon to take my second home pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hi. The pregnancy test will not show a real result if done before expected next date of menses. Chemical pregnancy bleed or abortion happens only after you miss your period, so do not worry about that. With the kind of bleeding you have (heavy and continuous), implantation bleeding is ruled out. The most probable thing can be an early occurrence of menses or bleeding from the cervical lesion. If it continues beyond a week, you can consult your doctor for examination. If it stops, you can do a home pregnancy test next month if period does not start on the scheduled date to decide further management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I seem to have something caught in my throat. When I try to swallow, my throat closes up and I vomit whatever I was trying to eat or drink. If I sit for a time, the excess saliva in my mouth will not even go down.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query. It looks like you either have a neuromuscular disorder of esophagus or esophageal motility disorder. There are several types of it. 1. Zenker's diverticulum. Do you vomit foul smelling, newly digested food? Zenker's is associated with intermittent difficulty in swallowing and regurgitation of old undigested food. There is excess salivation and also a nagging cough is present sometimes. 2. Diffuse esophageal spasm. It causes difficulty in swallowing and is associated with chest pain. There is drooling of saliva too. Do you have chest pain associated with esophagus? If yes, then DES is a possibility. 3. Achalasia cardia. The classical symptoms are difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation of food and weight loss. Have you noticed any weight loss in you? Difficulty in swallowing is initially for liquid food and then as the disease progresses it is also associated with solid foods. 4. Nutcracker esophagus. The complaints are similar to DES, like chest pain and difficulty in swallowing. 5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. There is regurgitation of newly digested food and also burning sensation in heart. 6. Tumor in esophagus. The difficulty in swallowing shows a progressive increase in symptom. And the difficulty is more for solid foods than liquid. I feel your symptoms are suggestive of Zenker's most likely. However, for a confirmatory diagnosis you will need further evaluation. Please get a barium swallow esophagography done. You will also need an upper GI endoscopy to evaluate further. In case of Nutcracker's, manometry test is diagnostic. Please visit your nearest hospital to get yourself evaluated further."},{"Patient":"Gender: Female Age: 19 Weight: 320 Problem: Gum/Mouth problems Symptoms: Numbness behind my two front teeth, aches, receding.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

I have consulted a doctor and he told I am suffering from allergy and it is incurable. I am worried. Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. A blocked nose can be from an infection of upper respiratory tract also. If you have a fever and throat pain along with the blocked nose, then it is due to some infection. Allergy also causes blocked nose, sneezing, running nose, dry cough, etc. And yes, allergy is incurable. There is no permanent treatment for allergy as such, but it can be controlled with drugs and other measures. To control allergy, you should avoid allergens like dust, pollen, specific allergy-causing food, and grasses. Avoid exposure to cold climate and cold beverages. For nasal blockage, you can use some antihistaminic decongestant nasal drops as Nasivion nasal drops. You can also take some oral antiallergic drug like tablet Montek-LC (Montelukast and Levocetirizine) twice daily for ten days if your doctor has not prescribed you an antiallergic medication."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 52 year old male.

Most of the hair dye products contain a chemical called PPD (para-phenylenediamine) which is responsible for allergic reactions. In such cases, I advise my patients to strictly avoid application of hair dye. You may use herbal henna for dyeing hair. I advise my patients to apply topical steroid like Hydrocortisone in the affected area. Antihistamines like Levocetirizine also help. You need clinical examination. So, you should visit your doctor so that he can examine you and give you prescription accordingly. You can share my opinion with him.

What will be the probable treatment for this?","Doctor":"Hello. It would have been better if you had mentioned your age. For an exact diagnosis and treatment plan, attach a more detailed history and an intraoral picture of your mouth. If you have 8mm of midline diastema (space between the teeth), you usually require orthodontic braces for correction of the spacing. Such treatment goes on for around 1 year or so. Sometimes we may also need to do a minor surgical procedure called frenectomy, if required, according to the structure of your gums. It would be better to comment if you could attach an intraoral picture. We can also do a fast procedure by placing a crown over the teeth or by doing a composite build up if your jaw and teeth size allow that. This also depends on your preferences. This will give results in two weeks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have pain in my left shin bone when I try to run. It is on the inside of my leg at the lowest point on the tibia, just above the ankle.

My child is only on breastfeeding. I want to know when can I start exercising, light as well as proper gym in order to get back to shape. I want to know till when do we need to be on sexual abstinence. Also, when can I plan my next child?","Doctor":"Hello. As it has been more than 9 weeks post delivery already, you can start your light abdominal toning exercises if your pain has completely subsided. Generally, we tell the mother to avoid exercising for 6 weeks till strength is achieved over the c-section scar. Do not lift weights for at least 6 months. As your menses have resumed, even though you have been breastfeeding, you may get pregnant as ovulation may start if sexual activity is resumed now. You can safely resume sexual activity now if there has been no pain over the scar. Next child should ideally be planned after an interval of 3 years. So it is suggested that you should be practicing contraception, be it barrier or hormonal to avoid unwanted conception hence. Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 20 years old. My weight is 53 kg and height is 167 cm. I look small for my age. There is no appropriate growth. Can you suggest any medication or supplement for this?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and I would like to suggest you some natural way to increase your body growth. There are many factors that affect the body height and weight such as gender, age, genetics, lifestyle, diet, etc. If there is no weight gain despite eating a calorie rich food, then you should be investigated for a malabsorption syndrome. It is a condition which will prevent absorption of nutrient from food into the body. Your weight is also determined by genetic factors. If you have very slim parents then you too will be slim. I am happy that you are very concerned about your health. It is known that 7,700 calories will put on as 1 kg in weight. You should increase the physical activity as well as your routine diet to increase weight. Dip handful of whole grains (black grams, peas, peanuts and pulses) in a cup of water overnight and eat. Take curd with fat twice a day. Increase the intake of carbohydrate like rice and bread in your food but do not have at late night. You can take cereals, milk and egg for breakfast. I suggest you to start exercise with adequate protein intake. This will help your muscles to build and gain weight. Start with a jog and then mild exercise like cardio, pushups, cycling and swimming. Try out moderate exercises and not the high intensity ones. Along with it have a protein-rich diet including milk, cottage cheese, banana, egg whites and lean meat.  Slowly increase your calorie intake by 500 calories every week up to 2000 calories. Have a good amount of water of around 2 liters per day. Do not consume fatty food. It will increase fat deposition in your body and will make you obese. Try this natural way instead of any medication for weight gain.

I did not have sex until the 33rd day (it was protected sex) of my cycle. Now, I have not yet had my periods. It is the 39th day and I took a pregnancy test on the 38th day and it came out to be negative. I do not know what to do. I did have my exams going on during the time of my expected menses. So, I am guessing it is stress. If the test came out to be negative, then is there still a chance? And, also I am having breast secretions for which my doctor has given me the B long F tablet. She said it is hormonal but she does not yet know that I had sex because she is my family doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. If you had sex on the 33rd day, then the test will not come positive so early even if you have conceived. It takes around two weeks to come positive.Although the chances are very less, you should rule out pregnancy. Do a test around 47th day.  Amenorrhea can be because of hyperprolactinemia as you are also having breast secretion. Get a serum prolactin and thyroid profile done. Stress is also one of the causes of delayed periods. Just relax and wait for your period. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I like to go running. I was a very successful marathon runner when younger. Now I still workout, but my goal, apart from general health is mostly emotional fitness for the job. I work on the phone with customers and I have to be in a strong positive mood to be successful. I am currently living in a country where the climate is very cold and dark. When I work out it is not about speed or distance for me it is about sweating. Because, when I breathe deeply and sweat very deeply, I have the feeling that is the point when my cardiovascular system gets activated the most. Now, I found some friends who are really in shape and who do really great workouts with me. The problem is that since I do not have a car, I always have to reach back home by foot. This weekend I am currently with cold and flu. I think that I got it because I went running, sweated, stopped and then walked slowly with wet clothes through the night for about 30 to 40 minutes. In the summer, I never had this problem. Since I train with the friends, I sweat even more and the winter has already started. What do you like to tell me about this? Should I manage to run home, even with wet clothes such that I would at least not get cold? Should I take a taxi to reach home in 15 minutes? Should I later take a warm bath?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is easy to catch cold, particularly if you are in a cold, wet and windy weather. Also, exposure to extremely cold temperature affects you in many ways and can cause frost nip (first stage of frostbite), trench foot (prolonged exposure of feet to cold) and frostbite (damage to skin due to cold), chilblains (itchy swelling in hands due to blood vessel inflammation) and last but not the least hypothermia (low body temperature). On the top of that, you being a marathon runner and a fit person will be having less amount of subcutaneous fat, which usually insulates you from cold temperatures like a quilt. Moreover, after a workout and sweating a lot, if you do not compensate by drinking water, you may get dehydrated and that further predisposes you to the ill effects of cold exposure. Well, I would advise you to take a cab to return home, particularly when the weather is so cold. Here are few don'ts you need to keep in mind. Also, I suggest few dos post workout. If you have any frost bite or any blisters, then immediately do not pour or immerse in hot water. Take a pair of extra clothes and never run in cold weather in wet clothes. Take a taxi particularly now as you have flu. You may take lukewarm showers. Warm shower definitely helps you to fight cold, but does not compensate for the cold injury. The length of exposure to cold temperatures depends on the variables such as the temperature, warm clothes you wear and your physical condition. Do take care of your health as the degree emotional health that is crucial for your living is directly proportional to your health.

The pain has not lessened, sometimes feels worse. It hurts when I breathe so I have to take shallow breaths. I know that X-rays will not do much and I realize that not much can really be done at all. So my question is what can I do to help the healing process or if there is anything I should not be doing. I have been going to work and avoiding heavy lifting. I cannot really afford to take more than a few days off. Would it slow the process of healing if I continue to go to work but avoid heavy lifting and any strenuous activity?","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. Severe pain on the ribs and breathing difficulty after a fall indicates some injury to the ribs. Even a minor fracture of the ribs can cause severe pain and breathing difficulty. Sometimes, severe muscular spasm following a fall can also cause such symptoms. So you need a proper physical examination. As you mentioned that you fell on the left side and having severe pain and breathing difficulty also, I suggest you get an X-ray done and consult an orthopedician. It is true that X-ray will not help much but you can get it done to make sure that there is no rib fracture. For minor rib fracture, only conservative management should be done. You need to take rest, avoid excessive spine movements, avoid sleeping on left side, avoid lifting heavy weights. In my opinion, you should take rest and avoid working for a few days. I would suggest you take some oral anti-inflammatory drug in combination with muscle relaxant drug twice daily for about five days. You can also apply some analgesic cream or ointment twice daily. Also, hot water bag over the painful area for 20 minutes thrice daily for pain relief. Rib fracture or muscular spasm. X-ray thoracic spine- AP and lateral."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

However, after my fourth ultrasound yesterday she said the sack stayed the same and was just black inside with no sigs of a fetal pole or anything else. She advised me to stop my medications and schedule a D and C. So, I stopped taking the medicines yesterday. All day yesterday and today I am having a constant spasm of my lower abdomen. I need advise on what could be going on? Currently, I am just taking Estrace and Progesterone oil shots.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems it was anembryonic pregnancy means the sac was formed but without a fetal pole. Sac is not growing inside to have a fetal pole and gradually towards further stages of pregnancy even after hormonal support. It is a bit depressing but if you want to wait for some time more to have nature to react rather then your own initiative then you can quit hormonal support and wait. Cramps indicate that natural miscarriage is soon to happen. Be positive. Things that meant to come to you will come to you. It is your decision that you want to wait or want evacuation now. In case of bleeding, severe abdominal pain or dizziness report to the hospital. After this pregnancy, start folic acid daily 5 mg if you want to try again for IVF (in-vitro fertilization). Have healthy nutritious diet with daily exercise and some relaxing recreational activities. Quit recreational drugs if you want to conceive again as these reduce fertility.

I also think that the combination of all my symptoms may mean something. I was tested once for thyroid problems and once for Lyme disease because I had a big, dangerous tick-bite rash. I am 19 years old and according to my growth curve (height of father and mother) my height should be 1.80 meters. I started puberty later than everyone else my age. I have always been too short, I am 1.68 meters now and I do not think that I will grow any longer. I am also feeling tired and sleepy all day long. I thought it was because of school and other stuffs and I just need some rest. But now during my holidays, though I have slept around 8-10 hours every day, I feel tired and sleepy. My black circles also did not disappear. My symptoms are as follows. I have signs of anemia, such as rapid heartbeat, headache, dizziness, pale skin through which veins can be seen and had little cracks at the corners of the mouth some years ago. I use to get sudden muscle spasms once per day or so. Since birth, I have been suffering from asthma and acid reflux. I have small individual red spots on torso, joint, bone and muscle pain for a few times a day and it does not hurt too badly. I have pop elbows for a year or so. I am getting pale sores in the mouth and bad teeth. I brush twice a day with an electric brush, but still many problems when I go to the dentist. I feel bloated and constipation. My stools are of bad smell and oily. I am also getting diarrhea a few times per week. I got hereditary hair loss and bald temples. I have a history of migraine including temporary blind spots in sight. Occasionally, I get strange things in eyesight, not only normal floaters, but sometimes also hundreds of very fast moving transparent balls. Sometimes, I suddenly see a very flashy thing in my eyesight for a few seconds. It takes long for me to fall in sleep after going to bed. I had intestinal problems all my life, but I just thought that they were normal. When I was very young, I did not really have so many issues like I have now. When I was around 14 years old, many of the problems started. I actually ended up in the hospital, because I had an unbearable pain under my ribs (right lower quadrant). They thought that I had a perforated cecum, but luckily that was not the case. They did not really know what it was, but I had high fever and I threw up 20 times or so. Around 17 years old, I started balding. Strangely the migraine has gone, but instead I have more signs of anemia. I eat a decent and good amount of vegetables and fruits. What do you guys think? Is it celiac disease or something else?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for sharing your detailed history with us.

Up to the two-weeks late period, all PT are negative. But I am still worried. I do not experience any signs of pregnancy except my breast is aching, abdominal pain, and missed period.

Such miscarriages can occur with little or no initial blood loss. These are termed chemical pregnancies, as they are lost before they attach to the womb and before they grow big enough to see on ultrasound. Only the pregnancy hormone is detected. The fact that you have still not had your menses needs to be investigated. Although it may be normal to have a delayed return of ovulation and menses after a miscarriage. The same pregnancy hormone detected in the urine pregnancy test can be done by a blood test for greater accuracy. An ultrasound may also be beneficial to identify any other cause for your missed period and your abdominal pain. Did you have a history of irregular periods before this episode?

It is better to do a root canal treatment in the teeth as soon as possible as the pain can become unbearable.

I would like to have something to read about it. I am currently taking Atorvastatin 80 mg, Metoprolol ER 25 mg, Lisinopril 10 mg, Clopidogrel 75 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concern. Heart attacks are caused by a blockage in the coronary arteries that is the arteries supplying blood to the heart. Multiple blocks in the coronary arteries at different places reduce the amount of blood supply to a particular part of the muscles of the heart (myocardium). As a result, the heart muscles become weak. Weakened heart muscles do not contract forcefully during cardiac contraction and hence are not able to pump enough amount of blood in the systemic circulation. This condition results in heart failure, as a result of which there will be less amount of blood in the systemic circulation and low blood pressure. Low blood pressure will cause impairment of blood supply to various organs like brain, kidney, liver, muscles, etc., which results in multiple organ failure and venous congestion in various organs. Also, the chances of repeated attacks increase following the first attack. I hope you understood the consequences of multiple heart attacks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got injured in a car crash.

In obstructive jaundice, there is an accumulation of conjugated bilirubin in the body due to obstruction at different levels in the hepatobiliary system which causes yellowish discoloration. ERCP helps in clearing the biliary system. Sometimes, only the biliary sludge will be found in ERCP. Bilirubin takes some time to get completely cleared from the body. Repeat your liver function test after a week. If it is still high, other causes should be ruled out. You can try ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) which comes with the name tablet Udiliv 300 mg once daily for two weeks as it helps in clearing bilirubin."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I have been experiencing a shooting sharp pain in and around the left side of my chest. It comes and goes and does not last more than a second or two. It does not happen often, just here and there, but my bicep is also sore. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query. If you experience pain, pressure or discomfort in the center of your chest or in your arms, back, jaw, neck or stomach, along with shortness of breath, a cold sweat, nausea, fatigue or lightheadedness, these symptoms may signal a heart attack or myocardial infarction. Please visit your nearest hospital in such a case immediately. But, when chest aches and pains are on and off or of a different kind, it is often something different. You have mentioned that repeated EKG have been done and it is normal. So it is unlikely that you have had a heart attack. You have also mentioned that it is associated with sore biceps. Do you have any history of injury to the chest? It is quite possible that your pain is due to a musculoskeletal injury to the chest. Please take tablet Ibuprofen 400 mg every six hours for five days. Your symptoms should subside. However, even after taking this medication, symptoms do not disappear, please visit your doctor who can evaluate you further.  Few other conditions which can give rise to chest pain include: 1. Fractured rib: History of trauma will be present with severe pain at a particular point in the chest when pressed. 2. Pain associated with breathing: It points towards lung cause like pleurisy. 3. Pain associated with discomfort in abdomen: It could be because of acid reflux from the stomach. If your symptoms point towards any of the above mentioned causes please visit your doctor who would do further examination. However, you have mentioned that you have done chest X-ray and it has come as normal. So it is unlikely that its any of the above. I would also advise you to sleep adequately, about eight hours daily. Keep yourself stress-free and do exercises to keep yourself fit."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

We are working together, and two weeks before only her visa got renewed. While the visa stamping time, they check all procedures and tests. About her, she is divorced and separated before one year back. Since one year she lived alone and no sexual relations with anybody. About her Ex-husband, his background was not good. He had a relationship with other girls I heard. But right now both of them are living in the healthy conditions. There is no significant medical problems. Past four months, we had a good relationship (sexual). My problem is this, recently I got a fever, and I took medicine. Then I was fine. But the cold is not getting cured. Frequently it is coming. Actually here the weather is a little cold now a days. But no weight loss or no other problems. Just cold and headache. Headace sometimes but cold regularly. Can you please advice, is it related to my sexual life? Should I go for any test? Can the HIV virus be hidden for a very long time? Could you please tell me once it is infected how many weeks will it take to identify? Actually, I am planning to marry her.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query. It is most likely that fever and cough are due to common cold. Please do warm saline gargles several times a day to reduce the throat inflammation. You can also take steam inhalations to get relief. If a cough is persisting you can take the antibiotic. Take tablet Azithromycin (500 mg) once a day for five days. If the symptoms persist, further tests may be needed. For the headache, you could get your eyes tested. Also, get your blood pressure checked.  You have asked for advice on HIV infection. HIV infection occurs in three stages. Stage 1: Occurs within 2 to 6 weeks of exposure. Symptoms include a headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, cough and cold. It lasts for a couple of weeks, then goes away. Stage 2: There are no symptoms during this stage. Stage 3: Full blown symtoms of HIV occur due to immunity being compromised. It is important to use a condom as it provides the best protection against sexually transmitted diseases. If you are suspecting HIV exposure, it is important to get one tested. ELISA test is the method used for screening. Rapid HIV tests are also available. These are only used for screening and should be follwed by western blot test which is confirmatorty. Sometimes, a false positive result occurs so it is important to get a repeat testing done. HIV virus takes 2 to 12 weeks to appear in blood so that it can be detected by the test. A person should get their partner tested too if the result comes as positive. Please consult a nearby doctor if symptoms persist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, If my dad and just recently my 20 years old brother both have low testosterone levels, what are the chances that I will too? I am 18 years old.","Doctor":"Hi. If low testosterones are due to secondary (acquired) causes then you are spared. The cause of low testosterone should be ascertained in your father which could be done only after detailed history and physical examination because there are number of causes for low testosterone levels. Congenital causes of low testoserone are Klinefelter syndrome, anorchia (bilateral), cryptorchidism, myotonic dystrophy, enzymatic defects in testosterone synthesis, Leydig cell aplasia, and Noonan syndrome. But these diseases are so severe that they interefere in normal reproduction process which is not the case here. So probably it is some acquired cause for which detailed history and examination is required. I would suggest you to consult your physician who can guide you better after thorough examination."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I just did a dual test. I am worried right now, please help.

I can understand your concern. According to your test results (attachment removed to protect patient identity), negative factors are: PAPP-A levels are elevated. Beta hCG levels are low. Positive factors are your age is below 30 years and nuchal translucency is normal. Now the possible steps can be followed are as a dual test can be performed till 14 weeks, better to repeat the test after 48 hours preferably in a standard laboratory. If the results fall in a normal range, repeat the ultrasound after one week. If everything is normal, you can continue the pregnancy. If on repetition also test gives screen positive, the possibility of the chromosomal disorder is more and you may need to terminate the pregnancy after confirming with your doctor. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 38 year old male. My height is 5'3\\", and I weigh 69 kg. Recently, I had a health checkup.

Please let me know what does this indicate.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query and attached reports, my opinion is as follows: (attachment removed to protect patient identity) Increased HbS with reduced HbA at this age suggests possible sickle cell trait disease. Most important evaluation is the possibility of the transfer of this to the next generation, to your kids. Hence, evaluation is necessary. As a complete workup has been done, no anomaly is detected and there is no organ damage at present. Nutritional anemia is additionally present. Iron supplements, vitamin B12, and folic acid supplements are necessary. Anemia correction is necessary. If there are any complications in future, hydroxyurea therapy may need to be started. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and hepatitis B is necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is it necessary to check oxygen saturation if the patient is on oxygen for shortness of breath?","Doctor":"Hello. As you said that patient needs oxygen for shortness of breath, it is absolutely not required to measure the oxygen saturation all the time. But, if dyspnea (shortness of breath) is due to COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) that is due to excessive smoking, then controlled oxygen should be delivered by monitoring oxygen saturation through pulse oximetry. The reason behind it is that carbon dioxide is the only source of stimulation for respiration. When a patient is on oxygen and if he gets ready made oxygen from outside the drive of respiration is depressed. Also, uncontrolled oxygen delivery has its own complications. To monitor response to oxygen given, the only method is to check saturation non-invasively. So, for this type of use, it is not advised to check saturation regularly. But if you require oxygen continuously, then it should be monitored through pulse oximetry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Whenever my fiance has been having sex recently (the past few days) it has been painful. I can feel a certain spot on the right inside of my vagina that when he hits it while going in feels like a knife stabbing me in that spot. After he is fully in and going, it does not hurt. It is just the initial insertion hitting that point. I can literally pinpoint that it is like two inches up inside on the right side. And after sex, when I go to the bathroom it is always tinted red. I thought this was because I had just gotten a new implant in my arm a few weeks ago and I was getting used to it but now I am thinking the blood is coming from a cut or something. I am just wondering what this spot could be or what it is at all?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. You seem to have Progesterone implant. There may be a slight change in the mucus quality due to these hormones, rendering it thicker, hence less lubricating. There may be a small crack or tear (due to sexual activity) due to inadequate lubrication. In my view, you should avoid sexual activity for a few days and allow it to heal. Vagina heals pretty fast, so if the problem does not subside in two weeks, it is better you allow a doctor to have a look to clinch the exact diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is a human brain transplant possible?","Doctor":"Hello. Human brain transplant or full body transplant is possible theoretically. Research is going on in this field where we have a case of head transplant from one dog to another where the dog died after a few days. There are a few reports of surgeons who believe it can be a reality in humans in 2 years. The most significant barrier in head transplant is the inability of the nerves to regenerate fully. A scarred nerve will not be able to transmit signals properly. Let us hope it would be possible someday and that would be a great achievement for humanity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with blepharitis. I also have seborrhoeic dermatitis (perhaps rosacea as well), and my condition has improved greatly. Recently, I got very bad allergy symptoms, my eyes and nose became extremely itchy, causing me to sneeze a lot. This morning when I woke up, I had trouble in opening one of my eyes due to a dark yellow eye discharge. Apart from being itchy, my eye was blood red and dry (only one eye). I have never had this much discharge before, especially after I started cleaning my eyelids for treating my blepharitis. It really terrified me. Could this be bacterial conjunctivitis due to the color of the discharge and the fact that only one eye was affected? What are other possible explanations?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, it is nothing but common bacterial conjunctivitis. Since you have blepharitis, you are more likely to get conjunctivitis. Also, blepharitis, in turn, is related to seborrhoeic dermatitis. What I can assure you is bacterial conjunctivitis is treated easily with antibiotic eye drops. Try using Gatifloxacin eye drops initially half-hourly on the first day and later you can taper to hourly dose next day and 2 hourly on the third day and so on. Just continue for 5 days, and you will be fine.  My only concern is that you have associated blepharitis. This can be treated well by cleaning the eyelids with baby shampoo daily, for a few months. Once blepharitis is controlled, your eye irritation, watering, and itching will come down."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 33 years old and I want to ask what and why we need to stop taking Ranitidine before endoscopy?

There may be various conditions ranging from just physiological vaginal cysts to some problems like herpes, warts that need medical treatment in cases of vaginal or vulval bumps. In order to get into the actual diagnosis, it is essential to have a look.

Development of ingrown hair after shaving Brazilian area is a common problem. Please note to use condoms during sexual activity, if you are unsure of the type until you seek medical advice. 1. Ingrown hair- bump containing a curled in hair. 2. Genital herpes- pimples in clusters, some ulcers may be present, may be itchy, tingling and recurrent. 3. Genital warts- tiny cauliflower-like growth, may be itchy. 1. Ingrown hair gets better with time, no medical treatment required generally. 2. Genital herpes- tablet Acyclovir 400 mg thrice a day after food for seven days. 3. Genital warts- get them removed by a dermatologist by laser therapy. Use condoms during sexual activity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals.

It is also important having some rest and avoid prolonged standing up or sitting position or weight lifting. A lumbar brace can help.

I can understand your concern. The possible causes of your partner's irregular spotting are as follows: 1. As her periods were delayed by last month itself means around one month ten days by the time you had sex. So, the possibility of pregnancy has to be ruled out. 2. Continuous usage of emergency contraceptive pill can lead to hormonal imbalance and menstrual irregularity. 3. Withdrawal effect due to the usage of the contraceptive pill.

To clear this severe cold I had to take Avamys. A couple of doctors I consulted said my nose and sinus seem to be inflammed, and there are some polyps in the nose. Now and then I seem to have the sense of smell. But almost always, it does not seem to exist. I am very worried about this. I was wondering if this kind of condition can be reversed, and if so what kind of procedure or medication usually is needed. I take asthma medication (Seretide 250/25) twice a day. I have no other medical problem. Blood tests are all fine. I seem to catch colds easily (or perhaps it is an allergy). Any guidance as to the type of tests I need to do redo and procedures that could be done.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems that you have allergic rhinitis with polyposis. The loss of smell sensation with you can be because of the polyps which prevent the air to reach the olfactory mucosa in the roof of your nose or because of a viral attack. I advise you to take antiviral medicine as Acyclovir tablets. Its dose is five tablets all over one day only. Continue your Avamyse spray till polyps disappear. If the Avamays spray does not end the polyposis you have to perform a surgery to remove polyps. When the smell nerves are injured, it cannot be healed completely again. We just save the remaining part of the sensation. In your case, I think it is smarter of time that you can smell again but not in a normal way as before. Just treat polyps first then we will see."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a hard white layer on head and glans of the penis. Please help.

Calculating from the first day of your last period date add 30/32 (menstrual cycle length) days and mark the date of expected next period (the first day). Generally, the rule of thumb says ovulation occurs 14 days or 2 weeks before the next expected first day of the period.

There are lots of differential diagnosis for the lump. Lipoma: It is an overgrowth of fat in an area. It is soft to touch. It is a benign condition. It is a slow-growingtumor and usually recurs if removed. No treatment is needed if small. Sebaceaous cyst: It is cystic swelling with a collection of sebum. It is a benign condition. It can be removed by excising the cyst. Malignant tumour: They are slow growing in the beginning but when it undergoes malignant change it grows rapidly. It is hard to touch. It needs to be biopsied to find the nature of a tumor. Abscess: They are an infection which is quite painful to touch. It needs to be treated with antibiotics and if it fails, the pus needs to be drained out. If the swelling is small, does not cause any discomfort, it can be left like that with regular follow up. If there is a sudden change in colour, consistency or size it needs to be looked upon by a doctor who can evaluate it further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What does hCG serum qual present mean?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query. There are two types of tests to check for pregnancy. Serum beta hCG qualitative test and beta hCG quantitative test. The qualitative test detects whether beta hCG is present or not. It can detect beta hCG more than 25mIU/ml. The quantitative test detects how much beta hCG is present. It can detect beta hCG as low as 1 mIU/ml. Result interpretation for qualitative beta hCG test is as follows. If the result comes as positive (present), it means you are pregnant. If the result comes as negative, it means there is no pregnancy. Beta hCG is also raised in certain other conditions like ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, molar pregnancy, and certain tumors. However, these are associated with other complaints also like a pain in the abdomen or irregular periods or bleeding, etc. Sometimes, false positive tests may occur when certain hormones are increased, such as after menopause or when taking hormone supplements. When the test is negative but pregnancy is still suspected, the test should be repeated in one week. When the test comes as positive, a person needs to go to an obstetrician and gynecologist who would evaluate the woman further. Ultrasound is also done to confirm the pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I missed my last month period. I have done all the tests, and I am not pregnant.

I have not had any trauma to my foot, knocked it or dropped anything on it. Is it something that will just disappear? I am a 31 year old female, currently on Amitriptyline 50 mg at night.","Doctor":"Hi. I have examined the submitted details and will do my best to help you overcome the problem. Close examination shows the dark band appearance that is often seen in individuals who get an infection due to a fungus. To most of my clinic patients, I suggest tablet Fluconazole 150 mg weekly and Miconazole or similar antifungal lotion twice a day. It takes some weeks before the results are apparent. If there is itching in adjacent areas, Zyrtec (Cetirizine) or another antiallergic can be a great help, taken once a day. With proper care, avoidance of moisture in the area, and well fitting footwear, the problem is manageable. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, A couple of days before I found out that I am pregnant. According to the first day of last menstrual period, I am about four and a half weeks pregnant. This is my fourth pregnancy. I had an ectopic pregnancy before four years. Then gave a birth after a year through emergency cesarean and delivered another baby through Cesarean after 15 months.  After my second baby, my doctor advised me not to get pregnant for a minimum of 18 months to 2 years. She said that my uterine wall was very thin. It has been almost 18 months since my last cesarean. I am in a confused state now whether to continue with the pregnancy or not. I spoke to my GP and she said it is all up to me, but there is a risk. What should I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. I think your GP has guided you correctly. Abortion can be associated with complications, some of which may be major. Your gynecologist informed you about your weak uterine scar. So, continuation of pregnancy can be risky as well. In my opinion you should consult your gynecologist who had done your cesarean section. Then, after understanding every advantage and disadvantage, you yourself take the decision. For further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, When I was 11 years old, I was knocked off my bike and cracked my front tooth in half horizontally, shortly after the dentist fixed it. Since then I have had no problems with it and had multiple x-rays to check on it. When it happened, the color of the tooth changed very slightly, to a very slightly more yellow shade than the rest of my teeth. I am curious to know what happened when the trauma occurred. Did my tooth die? What are they checking for when they x-ray the tooth?","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and can understand your concern. Any trauma to the tooth generally has long-term consequences like tooth discoloration, etc. As you said that your tooth was fractured, it might have led to a slight injury to the pulp or even if not so, the fracture line would have been close to the pulp. In both cases, the pulp over time starts to become non-vital sometimes due to injury and sometimes due to the restorative material lying in close proximity to the pulp. This over time results in the discoloration of the tooth. The characteristic feature of this discoloration will be that only the involved tooth will be discolored and other teeth will be normal or not discolored. If that is the case, it generally means that the tooth is in the process of becoming non-vital till the tooth becomes slight brownish black which means the tooth is entirely non-vital. It is generally not associated with any kind of pain as the process is chronic and takes time to set in. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist. He would prescribe a vitality test of the tooth and also would get an x-ray for the tooth. By that way, he would come to know if the tooth is dead or still vital and accordingly will propose treatment. If the tooth is vital, he will put some medication over the pulp to let it heal and then fill with the pulp friendly restoration. However, if the tooth is dead, I would suggest you to go for the root canal treatment (after evaluating the condition of the tooth and soft tissue). Meanwhile, keep your oral hygiene good, brush twice daily and floss regularly. Use mouth rinses to clean the mouth after meals."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a 35-year-old guy. I am married for six years. I am unable to get a proper erection for the last three months. Please prescribe some medication.","Doctor":"Hi. You have given very little information regarding your problem. There are lots of reasons for poor election after marriage and among them the most common is psychogenic. The erection depends on many thing beside medical causes. In medical causes usually, early morning erection is deficient. So if you have proper early morning erection, then it will be mainly psychogenic. Hence, if you found no early morning erection, then you should have penile venography and meet some urologist. If it is proper, then search for other causes. You can take tablet Tadalafil 10 mg once a week for the current problem if you do not have any medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, etc."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24 year old female with a Jones fracture. I broke it for the first time last year and again this year. At this stage, it is showing a nonunion, but I can easily bear weight and there is no pain or swelling. I have no plans to play sports or go running in the future. I was wondering if I can live without getting pinned. As of now, I cannot take leave from work. Also, what will happen if a nonunion is is left untreated?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your question, and it seems that your fracture is not healing well. There are a few points which I want you to know: The first and the fifth metatarsal are actually the weight-bearing bones in the foot. So, proper union of any fracture involving these two bones is important. Jones fracture involves the fifth metatarsal of the foot and that too in an area with a slightly peculiar blood supply. So, if not managed well, can lead to nonunion. You are very young, and at this stage, it is not advisable to leave any fracture unsupervised in terms of treatment. If your concerned orthopedic doctor is telling to get it pinned or open reduction and internal fixation with a screw, then it makes quite a lot of sense to actually undergo that treatment. I can actually advise you in a better manner if I can see your fresh x-ray and also your clinical picture showing the involved foot. Also, you have not mentioned the total duration since the second injury, and what form of management is being done right now. If it goes into permanent nonunion, you will keep on having foot problems from time to time in the form of pain, swelling, and difficulty in ambulation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having PCOD. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a very common condition nowadays. It is a treatable condition and will not affect your life much if the cysts are small in size. A lot depends on your lifestyle. Stress is a major factor. Eating healthy home cooked food and doing regular exercise will make a big positive difference to your condition. If you are overweight, reducing your excess weight will work wonders for you. So do not worry. As your question does not have details, I would like to ask you a few questions that would help me answer better: 1. How old are you? 2. Are you married? If yes, do you have kids? 3. Are your periods regular? 4. Is your weight in the normal range? 5. Do you have excess hair on your body or face? 6. Are you on any medication for PCOD or any other condition? 7. Can you explain your food habits? (veg/nonveg, what times of the day you eat, and in what quantity) 8. Do you indulge in any kind of physical exercise daily? 9. How is your sleep pattern? 10.

I feel very bad before others. This problem has been there since childhood. I have attached the pictures of my stained teeth. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a permanent discoloration which cannot be removed by normal means like dental scaling. It needs a treatment called lamineering of the front 4 or 6 teeth as required. In this procedure, the front side of teeth will be reduced and a ceramic laminate (covering) will be fixed permanently. The other option is that you can also place a full ceramic crown (cap) over the 4 or 6 teeth for better durability. These treatments are a little expensive, but will provide a natural look to your teeth. There is no other permanent solution to your problem."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is suffering from feet swelling for the past four years.

I feel scared and worried all the time. I have panic attacks and cannot leave my house. I know I need help but I do not know how serious it is.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I would like to inform you that from the described symptoms it seems that there is Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks. Both of these disorders fall under a broad category of anxiety disorders. The condition is so disabling that many patients with this disease get significant difficulty in doing day to day activities. As I can see your symptoms are quite distressing, it is clear that you need help to cope with these symptoms. Untreated anxiety disorder lowers the quality of life, and over time it becomes difficult to treat when compared to new onset disorder. Regarding treatment, it can be treated by either medications or psychotherapy. Among the medications, SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) are generally effective in this condition. Examples of SSRI include Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Paroxetine, and Sertraline. They show improvement after using these medications for at least 4-6 weeks. Among psychotherapy, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is most commonly used and it takes about 8-12 sessions of one session per week lasting for one hour. Although definite treatment is required from a psychiatrist, before you could make an appointment with a psychiatrist, I recommend the following things for better management of anxiety symptoms and stress arising from them. These are simple measures which will help you a long way when practiced regularly."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had Mirena removed before a month and had what I think was a period the next day that lasted for four days. It has been 37 days with no period and three negative home pregnancy tests. I have been nauseated with cramps that are dull while some hurt good enough to stop me from moving. What is going on?","Doctor":"Hi. Mirena is a progesterone-containing IUCD (intrauterine contraceptive device). Its sudden removal induced you periods last month. Your current delay in periods is also because of the same. It takes time for the body to restore the normal hormonal balance after removal of Mirena. Do not worry. Wait for another week or 10 days. You should get your periods. If not we can start you on medicines to induce the period. Hope you found this information useful. All the best,"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My sister is 14 years old. She cannot ultimately stand straight. Her spine bends forward a little near the upper back and shoulders. Could you please suggest me a remedy?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for using this platform. It sounds like your sister has a forward bend in her upper back when you look at her from her side. Is this correct? We give this forward bend a name called kyphosis. While kyphosis can have numerous causes, the most common in this age group is postural. Kids in their early teens develop the habit of stooping forward at their lower neck. This habit is often known to be secondary to sitting in front of computers, laptops, tablets, etc. Constant bending forward of the neck makes the upper back adopt this abnormal posture. Also, the habit of keeping shoulders protracted in a forward position is also common in this age, especially in girls. Very rarely, she may have a structural cause of kyphosis. A common condition in this age is Scheuermann's kyphosis which is due to the collapse of the discs between the thoracic vertebrae. It is, however, more common in the mid-back rather than upper back. Nevertheless, she should be evaluated by a spine surgeon with expertise in spinal deformities to rule this out. If it turns out to be postural, a course of physiotherapy focused on postural training can be helpful. I will be happy to go into details of the exercises and review any x-rays that may have been done already."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My acne is getting worse. The spots are on my face, back and chest.

It seems you are having pain in the coccyx region. The coccyx is a small bone present between the anus and lower end of the spine(sacrum). There are many causes of pain in this region like a pilonidal cyst, fractured bone, sciatica, infection and inflammation of the coccyx. Avoid sitting at one place for a long time and prefer to sit on cushion, pillows or padded seats. You can apply ice packs over the painful area and can take analgesic medicines for pain relief.

You have a history of knee injury two days back, but you have been able to ambulate after the injury, even though it is painful to you. Initial management is to give rest to the affected joint and try to limit pain and hemarthrosis.

Intensive ice packs for local application over the injured joint to keep pain and swelling to a bare minimum. 2. Knee Brace can be used to hold the knee in extension and restrict movements initially. 3. You can start with anti-inflammatory medication according to your body's suitability. 4. Local analgesic spray can also be used after ice therapy.

Does this sound like something I can take care of with an increased dose of ibuprofen or should I go to an urgent care facility? Is there a better OTC I can take or a combination that might be more effective? Are the above symptoms normal or typical following a cervical polypectomy for a 1 cm polyp or is the back injury separate? Can I expect these symptoms to subside over time?","Doctor":"Hello. It is normal to experience reddish brown discharge for 4-5 days post cervical polypectomy, but it should not cause any back pain per se unless there has been a secondary infection or vaginitis or bacterial vaginosis which is quite likely with vinegar smell. Flagyl (Metronidazole) as an antibiotic can often cause dizziness if adequate water intake is not practiced, and also as you are not in the habit of taking antibiotics, this can further aggravate as well. Please do not take plain Ibuprofen four times a day as this may cause acidity and increased gastritis without an antacid preparation and can add on to nausea. The back pain can be secondary to an accompanied fresh urinary tract infection which may have developed during these days due to decreased water intake possibly and also due to possible bacterial vaginosis or vaginitis. You need to be examined fresh for a review by your gynecologist again, and a high vaginal swab culture is recommended for a possible change in antibiotics and ruling out bacterial vaginosis. For the pain relief, you may switch to tablet Aceclofenac 100 mg twice a day, as it is more effective and free from side effects. However, a urine culture is also recommended. Please visit your gynecologist for review."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a female of 25 years old. Since last month, I am noticing slight hand tremors when I am inactive and when I am performing an important task like meeting an important person. Also, I am a smoker.","Doctor":"Hi. Heavy smoking can lead to tremors in hands and so can tea and coffee if consumed heaviely. Slight tremors, particularly in the hands and fingers, is a normal phenomenon called physiologic tremor. It can get aggravated by stress or anxiety. You should cut down on smoking. If tremors do not disappear after cessation of smoking consult a physician and undergo some laboratory tests like estimation of thyroid hormone levels and blood glucose levels that can also cause tremors if found deranged."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My mother has a tumor-like thing in her shoulder. It is like a soft pulpy thing. Right now it is small and not causing much pain. When she works too much, she feels a weight on her shoulder and a mild pain like she has lifted a weight. Is that something cancerous?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for using this platform. It sounds like your mother has a soft pulpy growth on her shoulder, which is painless at rest but causes heaviness on exertion. Although this information gives us some idea, it is challenging for me to guess what precisely this growth is. It will be nice if your mom could have it evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon. He or she will assess whether this growth is arising from the subcutaneous fat (example - lipoma), underlying muscle or bone or joint. If there is a suspicion of bony or joint involvement, an x-ray may need to be taken. There is a rare possibility that this swelling might not be a growth, but just a manifestation of trauma or infection. I will be happy to review any pictures, x-rays or other imaging that you may have already done. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 32 years old, got married seven months back. I had regular 28 days cycle. Two months back, I had amenorrhoea for 40 days followed by urine pregnancy test positive but followed by bleeding and USG pelvis shows clear uterus, after seven days. Following this, I got some brownish discharge like sometimes, increased whitish discharge irrespective of the menstrual cycle. What can I do for this?","Doctor":"Hi. If the urine pregnancy test was positive then you got bleeding and then, bleeding and uterus empty, then maybe it was a complete miscarriage. Post bleeding, vaginal brown discharge might be infection or remains of miscarriage. To be on safe side have beta hCG and high vaginal swab to exclude infection and pregnancy. Follow with the reports. In case you have pain, immediately report to an emergency gynecologist.  Post-miscarriage or infection.

Please suggest some medicine. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi. It is essential that you drink 4 liters of water as constipation can cause pimples. Once a regular bowel moment is established, you could apply Oxidoben cream (combination of Adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide) at night over the pimples. It will dry them up and shed them away. Continue it for three weeks. Avoid unnecessary use of facewash as dry skin can also cause pimples. Wash face with plenty of water during the day. Also, I suggest capsule Azithromycin 500 mg once every day on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday for two weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My period has been off for the past six months, meaning my cycle will go from 31 days which is normal, up to 51 days.

Irregular periods can occur due to many causes like anemia, hormonal imbalance like PCOD, thyroid disorders, etc. As you are having irregular periods for the past 6 to 7 months, better to consult your gynecologist once and get examined and go for investigations like hemoglobin levels, thyroid profile, ultrasound, etc. If she advises, you may need to undergo FSH and LH levels also. With this full workup, the possible cause of your problem can be identified and treatment can be taken accordingly. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 28 year old male. Approximately, six to seven years back, I had urinary infection when I was sexually active with my girlfriend. I was advised to take an antibiotic course, which I did not complete at that time and the infection was not fully cured. After that incident, I used to get urinary infection once in a few months. During urination, I sometimes used to have one or two drops of blood only during the time of urinary infection. In addition to the above mentioned problems, I have some other issues related to sexual health. Such as premature ejaculation, extremely bad timing, sensitivity of the penis skin, lower back pain, lack of confidence, etc. Very often on my way to the toilet some urine drops are leaked. During night time, I have to stand up several times to urinate. Sometimes, approximately once a week after urinating suddenly sperm drops are released, but I have not discussed this part with my urologist in person. I am not a stressful person, so the reason behind this has to be something else than stress. I have now recently been to a urologist and I was told that the infection became chronic. The doctor recommended antibiotics again and I have now completed the course. The urinary infection should be cured by now. All the new tests were negative. The urologist told me that my prostate size is bigger than people in my age. Please suggest me some good solution for the above mentioned problems. I want to get married soon and live a healthy life. The ultrasound has been made. The urologist here told me that, my prostate size is bigger than normal people in my age. This is not suppose to happen until a person gets older. That is the main reason of feeling weak and not being able to control urine, etc. I hope you understood all my problems. Please suggest me some medication for all the above mentioned problems. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I assume that your reports have all been normal. If not, then please forward it to me.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Spironolactone increase your potassium levels. Avoid eating food items that are rich in potassium while taking the medication to prevent a sudden increase in potassium levels which can be fatal.

Throat is highly sensitive and anything causing irritation can be annoying. Foreign body sensations in throat may be subjective or there can be some pathology causing it. Inflammation of structures in throat like uvula, tonsils or posterior pharyngeal wall can cause foreign body sensation.

At times forceful deglutition or swallowing can lead to foreign sensation. Gastric reflux can cause foreign body sensation.

There are some medicines also which enhance immunity but you should take the whole treatment at least for 2 to 3 months. If interested, then, can ask in next follow up. Have a citrus Vitamin C rich fruit daily. As much as you eat fruits and veggies, your immunity will be improved and reduce allergic condition.

Please suggest some medicines without side effects.","Doctor":"Hello. You should answer a few questions so that I can help you better. Circumcision of the penis is a good thing, as you do not get diseases like phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin fully over the glans penis) and penis cancer."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am seven weeks pregnant and I want to do abortion but I had a baby boy with a C-section six years ago. So I just wanted to know if I can abort.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. If you have decided for abortion, you can undergo but under strict supervision. You have to consult your gynecologist, confirm the gestational age. Up to eight weeks, medical termination is possible. But better to be under admission to prevent untoward effects like excessive bleeding, severe pain, very rarely scar dehiscence.

The problem I have is that my facial muscles seem to always change shape when I am under stress. I remember someone once telling me he knew what was wrong with me. He said my face needs to breathe. Also when I shave and my face gets air my facial skin gets smoother in texture and fuller. I had not eaten in a while so I was starving and I went out to eat. I ordered a hot dog and by the time I finished eating I felt a surge of energy like my blood began to rush I think and my face popped and was a lot fuller. I think after that any time I would go to the toilet my stool would come out very dark and hard and messy. I do not know what could be the cause. So please could you help?","Doctor":"Hello. It is very strange if your facial muscles tend to change shape on daily basis. I know of a few conditions in which facial flushing (redness) can occur due to increased blood flow, but the change in facial musculature with food intake or under stress is not a common thing. The facial flushing can occur with eating of certain foods which are rich in amines. Can also occur with hyperthyroidism and diseases like VIPoma or some other carcinoid syndrome. But the above things also have certain other presenting features."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mom has a severe abnormality in the lower abdominal part. On doctor's consultation, we have done USG. In the report, the impression shows that mild hepatomegaly with grade II fatty changes, right-sided mild hydronephrosis, bulky heterogeneous uterus with multiple SOLs. What does it mean? Is there anything serious? Which type of specialist we should consult in this case?","Doctor":"Hi. There is nothing to worry about. For hepatomegaly, you will have to lose weight and avoid oily foods. Mild hydronephrosis could be because of some infection in the kidneys which may require antibiotics. There is mild SOL (space occupying lesion) in the uterus which could be because of hormonal changes. Please get yourself checked by a gynecologist with the reports. However, if you have a doubt then get back to me. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have something on my penis. It started a couple days ago after I had unprotected sex. I am uncircumcised. It is not the first time I have noticed something like this happen and I always get concerned. It feels very itchy, and also hurts. It does not feel painful when I urinate. There is also a foul smell. It started as feeling sore and irritation, and then little bumps came out, and after that, it seems like the bumps look like sores. I have gotten tested for STD but HSV 1 and 2 were not in that panel. I have also been looked at and the doctor said balanitis. But there are two different examples of when it happens and the one I am concerned with today does not appear to look like the balanitis.","Doctor":"Hi. Presently the clinical photographs are not suggestive of herpes genitalis. Looks more like balanitis. In herpes genitalis there will be clean looks ulcers without slough, also there will be a pain. Herpes genitalis should subside with 5 to 7 days. Consider application of Mupirocin 2 % cream twice daily with Clotrimazole 1 % cream twice daily. Also, an oral antihistamine can be taken to relieve itching. I would advise you to visit dermatologist personally and if this is a recurrent problem, clinical examination is important. Protected sexual intercourse is advisable."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have got a TT injection in deltoid of left arm today from a local hospital. After loading injection in casualty the nurse called to injection room, I sat there, nurse cleaned my arm with spirit. After cleaning, I noticed that the preloaded syringe with the needle was kept on the bed with needle touching bedsheet by the time I was about to ask, injection was administered. After this, I also enquired about this to the nurse then she said cap was slipped off and did not notice. I also enquired to RMO he also said no need to bother. I am having doubt that injection needle if touched the bedsheet, will there be contamination. Now I am anxious about this. Will there by any possibility of diseases due to this unsterile injection? Please give your opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. Good to know that you are careful with healthcare. Firstly I would like to know what was the reason to take a TT injection? On a general note, the injection needle scenario you described is completely safe from most serious viral infections, but only a few bacteria may persist. You see, any organism that develops disease inside a human body grows in a warm medium such as blood and requires a liquid temperature controlled viable environment. But in this case, the bedsheet is a nonviable environment for any infective organism or germ. Hence the chances of you falling sick from that needle are as low as finding a shooting star in the sky. Although I do not say it was completely sterile, it may cause at most a slight immune response that may look and behave like a mosquito bite. Keep me updated with any suspicious symptoms you notice and do not worry, we are here for you. The nurse was not wrong either. Take care. Using a rubbing alcohol dipped in cotton over your skin prior to the injection makes your skin sterile and also the needle as it goes in. Follow up as necessary."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 37 years old male and for the last few months my sex drive is getting lower and currently, it is at its lowest.

Otherwise, it is a very safe medication."},{"Patient":"I had a sinus infection and was prescribed two weeks Clavulin for a total dose of 1500 mg per day . At the end of two weeks I was symptom-free - but the day after I finished the meds I got my symptoms back and developed frontal sinus infection. I went on Clavulin for three weeks at the highest dose and had frontal sinus symptoms the whole time while I was on the antibiotics. I finish these antibiotics two weeks ago. Every day for the last two weeks I have a lot of pressure/tension on the top of my head that is pressing down on the top of my head and is very bothersome and also sometimes across the top of my forehead with occasional aches in my eyes . It is very hard to focus on anything else because the pressure is so bothersome. It has not gotten worse but remains the same every day . Can you tell me what is going on ?","Doctor":"Hi! Apologies for the late reply! As you have rightly put it, the most probable problem out there is a severe allergic problem with an associated sinusitis (frontal sinusitis to be precise). I have tried to explain things in a very simple yet precise manner below. The cascade of events is explained in a very simple manner below eventhough its not as simple as it looks!  Exposure to dust (or any irritative substance that your body is hyper sensitive to) will initially initiate reflexes such as sneezing to remove the offending agent out but if this fails, mucosal cells in you nose start to hyperfunction producing loads of mucus to trap dust(owing to its sticky nature), this mucus has no where to go other than either being blown out of due to mucociliary activity gets pushed into the throat, thereby entering into a new zone, the throat initially reacts by activating cough impulses to push out the mucus, but if that fails, a local inflammation around the throat starts which often leads to symptoms such as feeling of a lump in the throat and repeated feeling to clear the throat.  Now this is general cascade that usually occurs in most people, but need not be specific to you.  Sinusitis is always secondary to something, allergy being the most common out of them. There could be other reasons as well for sinusitis to occur such as a hypoplastic frontal sinus, narrow frontal outflow tract/ frontal recess/ sinonasal polyposis etc.  Another important fact About sinusitis is about its recurrence. Plain use of antibiotics doesn't solve the issue, but just keeps it off for a while. We need to dig down and see what has caused the sinusitis in the first place for appropriate treatment rather than superficially treating it with plain antibiotics.  Precautionary measures is one such thing which if followed ( such as in a case or allergy) will definetly go a very long way in keeping the problem at bay. The requirement of medications also will be less and on the whole you will have immense benefit.  You can consider the following advice All precautionary measures have to be followed strictly for maximum relief, other wise medications won't be useful on long term. If things don't seem OK even after following the treatment schedule mentioned above, a non contrast CT is mandatory to find out what exactly could be going on in the sinonasal region. Anatomical variations, extent of inflammatory load are few things we look into while reading a ct scan. Surgery can be considered (if above medications and precautionary measures don't give any relief), but there is a catch to it. The symptoms might come back sometimes even on a higher scale after a brief relief following surgery if the precautionary measures post surgery are not followed. Ideally speaking in a nut shell, I again emphasis on preventing any irritative substance from entering the nose and throat, thereby triggering an allergic cascade of events and reproducing the symptoms you have mentioned above. I hope I have answered to your query in detail. Sorry again for the late reply. Get well soon! Warm regards"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

His actual age is 7.5 months and corrected age is 4.5 months. Birth weight was 960 gm and his current weight is 5.60 kg, drinking man-pro around 100 ml, 5 to 6 times a day. Since last 10 days, he has also been started on semisolid food. He had breathing difficulty because of a cough. We had got him early morning in the emergency for complaints of a heavy cough. He was nebulized but there was a wheezing sound due to which they said he would need PICU for monitoring. Currently, he is admitted in PICU. His saturation levels were fine but the doctor started him on oxygen with mask support. He was drinking milk well but they stopped his feeds as well and started IV liquid which does not suffice his hunger. They did all reports- blood and chest X-ray and everything was normal. His heart rate was on the higher rate of 150 to 180. The first thing they did was that they stopped the feed, he cried and cried for more than half a day wanting food in which he lost a big amount of energy. Until the morning, I got him to PICU. He was playful but second half of the PICU admission day he was looking very tired. The wheezing had increased. At night they took a call to put him on HFNC due to increased wheezing. He was restless the whole night and till early morning his heart rate was 185 to 201. Now, it has come down to 150 to 165 but he is still on HFNC and feeds have not started yet. My concerns are as follows. He was given oxygen support at the initial stage as required when he was able to breathe and maintain the saturation levels without it. Was it necessary to stop his feeds as that has taken away all his energy and he is distressed with hunger?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Your concern is whether oxygen was necessary. Whenever the baby is having wheezing and respiratory distress, giving Oxygen is necessary to avoid impending ventilation-perfusion mismatch. It is considered as supportive therapy even though the monitor might be showing 100 % saturation.  Was it necessary to stop the feed? Only treating doctor can decide. Whenever there is respiratory distress, children have a high risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia which is bad. But, whenever the baby is vitally stable, the baby can be started on the feed througha tube (RT feed). Treating doctor is best to decide about it. Still, if you have concerns. You are free to ask treating doctor. It is your right."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is 25 years old and she has PCOD. We are trying to conceive for 2 years. We had done an IUI which failed. We did IVF, but it ended with a chemical pregnancy. Last month, our doctor did Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET). He transferred 2 embryos on that day. We got a positive result through urine test. We did serum beta hCG test. The report shows hCG level of 1,50,000 mIU/ml. The value looks like very high. Does this value signify a healthy pregnancy? Does it mean a twin pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello. The normal hCG levels in a singleton pregnancy as follows: In a twin pregnancy, the levels are 30% higher than the singleton hCG levels. Generally, during the Frozen Embryo Transfer, 3 to 4 embryos are being transferred, and hence the levels can be as high as this 1,50000 IU. But, as you are sure that there were only two transfers, then according to that the value is still higher for a twin pregnancy. Considering the present scenario, this may indicate a molar pregnancy. It would be important to get an ultrasound pelvis done to identify multiple gestational sacs, and if molar pregnancy is suspected, then an MRI would be warranted. You can follow up with the USG report, and I would be able to guide you better after seeing the reports."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from SPA rheumatism and the doctor has prescribed Salazopyrin, Sulfasalazine for more than 10 years.

For the past two months, I have been getting blood spots after the 10th day of my periods along with discharge. Is there any problem? I can also feel some body pain. Is it because of the low Hb count? My height is 5'9\\" and I weigh 76kg.","Doctor":"Hi. Hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.8 g/dL can be considered as not too low. Just occasional spotting after periods should not reduce your Hb (if it was higher than 12 g/dL previously). Regarding your symptoms of body pain, it depends on what was your Hb level previously. If it has reduced by 1.5 to 2 g/dL compared to past reports, then there is a possibility that your symptoms are due to reduced Hb. In any case, you can either take iron supplements (with tablets containing elemental iron of >50mg, preferably 100mg) or increase dietary iron intake in the form of green leafy vegetables, dates etc., to improve Hb. This should also treat symptoms of body pain if it is due to low Hb. Regarding intermenstrual spotting/bleeding, if it persists beyond 3 menstrual cycles, it needs evaluation by a gynecologist and needs local examination and probably one ultrasound. Kindly get it done if bleeding/spotting persists beyond three cycles. The doctor can also evaluate Hb and other tests."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My weight is keep on increasing in spite of diet and regular exercise.

I also have multiple heart problems which are right bundle branch block, bicuspid aortic valve, high blood pressure, and patent foramen ovale. I also have Barrett's esophagus and this week, I am going in for an endoscopy at a local hospital. I have had endoscopies before but, I recently saw in the news that someone passed away from a recent endoscopy. I am scared because the varicose veins are from my upper leg to my foot and are pretty gross looking. My vascular doctors' group have made me wear a compressed stocking, but I notice some new veins bulging or surfacing. I do not know if I should or should not wear the compressed stocking when I go for the endoscopy. I am concerned because even though these are superficial veins, they help pump the blood back to the heart, and I do not know what will happen when the sedative is injected intravenously. I guess I am just nervous because there is a new symptom to me. I have attached a photo of the side of my left leg where the vein is bulging in the front of my leg in front of my shin and across my ankle. It is very painful at times, however when I lay down the veins disappear. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. I can see that your leg has developed varicose veins (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This happens due to back flow of blood into the superficial venous system of the legs. Wearing a compression stocking will maintain the forward flow, but this is not a permanent solution. In patients with varicose veins, a venous doppler study of the affected lower limb is recommended, and this will tell the competency of the saphenofemoral junction (at the groin) and the saphenopopliteal junction (at the knee) which are the main valves that regulate the blood flow from the superficial to the deep venous system. Any collateral veins with incompetent perforators will also be known. Latest techniques involve laser ablation of the veins involved, and this prevents any complications of varicose veins. I guess your vascular doctor might have told you about varicose veins in detail. The endoscopy procedure can be done without any increased risk due to varicose veins. The sedative injection will not cause any problems due to varicose veins. So, you need not worry about that. Please be assured that the person who passed away during endoscopy might have had a different reason or underlying illness due to which the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure. Please stay calm and go for the procedure without hesitation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, It was five years back when I encountered sleep problem for the first time, and at that point, I was doing a night shift.

After more than a year, I got to know from a medical personnel that, Clonazepam is a sleeping pill, and I immediately stopped taking it. From then onwards, my sleeping problem increased. I was feeling agitated, mentally hyperactive, and sometimes suicidal thoughts came in mind. Sometimes I had difficulty breathing.

He underwent surgery which was a success. He is taking chemotherapy right now, which is supposed to eliminate the malignant lymph nodes, which have spread to other parts of his body. He has his fourth dose of chemotherapy planned for next week. However, one of the lymph nodes located on the left side right under his neck is constantly growing, so doctors are planning to change the type of chemo after the next PET scan. I have a few questions regarding the condition of my father. The first one is does lymph node growth indicate that the chemo is not working, and the nodes are actually getting bigger? Or it may be something else (like the creation of cysts or capsules around the node)? I know we cannot be sure what is happening until the PET scan, but we would like to know this information so we know what to expect. The second question is when chemotherapy is not working, is it standard to actually try more types before finding one that starts working? I know these are not easy questions to answer, but my father is very anxious and knowing as much as possible would help him immensely with his physical condition.","Doctor":"Hello. So, I have gone through your queries. I would like to know a few details which will help me in answering your questions. So before surgery what was his stage? What did baseline CT or PET (whichever was done) showed? Did he receive any chemotherapy prior to surgery? Or was the decision taken to go ahead with surgery? What chemotherapy is he receiving? What surgery did he have and what was post-surgery histopathology report? His age, general fitness, and any other illness? Now coming to your questions. LN (lymph node) growing during chemotherapy means usually disease is not responding in 95 % cases. Rarely there are nonmalignant causes (usually infective) which can also cause LN enlargement. So depending on the clinical picture, risk, and possibility of other etiology and imaging, the decision is taken to change treatment. Your physician sometimes may want to be sure that the LN is due to disease only then he can sometimes suggest FNAC or biopsy of LN. When one chemotherapy is not working, we go to the second line. Usually, idea is to start chemotherapy which is standard and which patient can tolerate. So it is not like we try different choices before finding the right one. We start with a standard one and if the patient is not responding we go to the second line. If first-line treatment is not working the chances of next line working also goes down. Also, second line options may have more side effects. This decision is taken usually with patient and physician preference."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After two units of blood transfusion, it came up to 6.8 and gone back to 6.3 after 10 days, then another unit was transfused. Endoscopy, colonoscopy, CT-scan have been done but no concrete reason was found. Then serum iron and ferritin test showed ferrozine, cobas / 6000 at 396 micro-gm/dl and ELFA, mini vidas 10.6 ng/ml. She is currently taking Astier XT one tablet per day.","Doctor":"Hello. Her RBC count is very low with low serum ferritin and high serum iron (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Also, her anemia is normocytic normochromic which is generally seen in bleeding due to chronic blood loss or in chronic disease. Other causes can be chronic kidney disease or liver disease, both of which are unlike since the renal and liver function tests are normal. Since occult blood is present in stool, a gastrointestinal bleed is the most likely cause. But that has been ruled out by endoscopic tests. However, occult blood in the stool may be falsely positive in the following instances if it is a chemical occult blood test, like Iron medication (which is the most likely cause in your mother's), certain fruits and vegetables, Vitamin C, meat. It is better to get the stool tested for occult blood by the immunologic test as it is not affected by these things. A bone marrow biopsy can be done to rule out aplastic anemia. Other causes of anemia of chronic disease should be ruled out like an autoimmune disease. Blood transfusions will not cure the anemia unless the underlying cause is treated."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 20 years old, female. Ever since I have been 14 years old, I have IBS, bad stomach pains and constipation, almost two years ago I stopped taking my BC pills (I was on birth control since I have been 16) and my period did not come forever after and my skin was at its best ever. Three months later my periods became heavy and about six months later I started having bad painful cystic acne all over my face and body, heavy periods and cramping (lots of blood clotting), bad IBS, alternating between D and C, bad bloating like I was pregnant and gas. On top of that since last six months, I have had a leaking bladder, unsure if that is from straining or food related. I tried BC again in the last three months but my skin looked worse again. I am on a paleo diet and noticed my skin is a bit better but I do believe my hormones are a big role in this and would truly appreciate an opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. You can try these simple home remedies as these are helpful for your problems. Chew half teaspoon of fennel seeds after every meal. It will help in better digestion of food and also useful in bloating. Take aloe vera juice 15 ml with an equal amount of water two times a day after food for ten days. If you notice an increase in stool frequency then you can reduce juice amount to 10 ml. It will help in normalizing your periods. Apply aloe vera gel two times a day over the face. It will help in reducing the acne problem. In case of excessive bloating, you can take half teaspoon of ginger juice with a pinch of rock salt. It will also help in decreasing the problem.Try all these things regularly and you can consult me after ten days or you can consult a nearby Ayurveda physician regarding improvement and for further management. I hope you understand my point."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have not had periods in three months due to PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Recently, I had a burning sensation while I urinate. I had couple of pictures taken and I realized I bruised myself while showering because my nails are long. Yesterday, I had some cramps like period cramps, checked for a period, there was none. I used my finger to check and saw blood, so wore a safety napkin throughout the last night while asleep and woke up with nothing on it. Inserted my finger again this morning and I still see little blood. What is the issue?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your concern. I presume you already know that PCOS causes your irregular menstrual cycle. And it can also present like very scanty bleeding or just spotting today then nothing at all the following day, it is called oligomenorrhea and it is part of the PCOS. However, with the history you have told, you have long fingernails. It is also possible that you have caused a little scratch to the vaginal mucosa that would have caused the mild bleeding. I suggest you set an appointment with obstetrician and gynecologist to prescribe you with pills to regulate your menstruation. In the meantime, if the bleeding is just mild, you need not worry about it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been feeling unwell for a long time. These are my recent blood results. My doctor says that my hematocrit, RBC count, hemoglobin and mean cell volume have been out of the normal range for at least 10 years as that is how far back he can see. I think it should be investigated. What do you think? Haemoglobin concentration 161 g/L [120.0 to 150.0], total white blood count 9.6 10*9/L [4.0 to 10.0], platelet count - observation 327 10*9/L [150.0 to 450.0], hematocrit 0.491 l/l [0.36 to 0.46], mean cell volume 83.8 fL [83.0 to 101.0], mean cell haemoglobin level 27.5 pg [27.0 to 32.0], mean cell haemoglobin concentration 328 g/L [315.0 to 345.0], red blood cell distribution width 12.5 % [11.6 to 14.0], red blood cell count 5.86 10*12/L [3.8 to 4.8], neutrophil count 6.3 10*9/L [2.0 to 7.0], lymphocyte count 2.6 10*9/L [1.1 to 3.5], monocyte count - observation 0.5 10*9/L [0.2 to 1.0], eosinophil count - observation 0.2 10*9/L [0.0 to 0.5], basophil count 0.1 10*9/L [0.0 to 0.1], percentage neutrophil count 66 %, percentage lymphocyte count 27 %, percentage monocyte count 5 %, percentage eosinophil count 2 %, percentage basophil count 1 %.","Doctor":"Hello. Your hemoglobin and hematocrit values are slightly high. Your RBC count is only marginally elevated since the upper limit of normal is 5.5 million/cu.mm. With these values, there is a suspicion of you having hemochromatosis or an early stage of polycythemia vera. In hemochromatosis, there is iron overload and the two main tests required are serum ferritin and serum transferrin saturation. Genetic testing is confirmatory. For polycythemia vera, the red cell mass needs to be determined and preferably a bone marrow biopsy. Testing for the JAK 2 gene is confirmatory. It is better to get these conditions ruled out since they require treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 54 years male, having erectile dysfunction and diabetic for the last three years with HbA1c value 8. Can you please prescribe the dose of Sildenafil?","Doctor":"Hi. Erectile dysfunction can be due to many conditions including psychological and underlying like diabetes, hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, atherosclerotic disease and some medicine such as antipsychotic, some antihypertensives. So you need to be evaluated to find the cause of erectile dysfunction. Drug therapy includes Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Vardenafil, and injection Alprostadil can be used. These are prescription only drugs, so you need a prescription for the same. Sildenafil and related drug are contraindicated in a person taking nitrates. The starting dose of Sildenafil is 50 mg in most cases and depending upon the response the doses can be decreased or increased. It comes in 25, 50 and 100 mg dose. I would like to inform you that diabetes is one of the leading cause of erectile dysfunction and taking Sildenafil alone will offer temporary relief so you need to have good control of your diabetes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I keep having strong cramp like feelings. I am 37 weeks pregnant. I do not know if it is an upset stomach or actual contractions. What is the best thing to do or how can I tell?","Doctor":"Hi. Monitor this cramping by holding or placing your hand on top of your abdomen. Differentiate the feeling and softness of the abdomen when you feel the cramping versus when you do not have the cramps. The actual labor cramps would feel like a menstrual pain accompanied by the perception of hardening on top of your abdomen. It usually lasts for 20 to 30 seconds and the interval may be irregular at first. Usually, you also feel this hardening everytime your baby kicks or moves. If these labor cramps persist for 4 to 5 hours, you might also have brown to bloody vaginal mucoid discharge that is usually scanty. On the other hand, stomach cramp is not associated with abdominal hardening. Best of luck."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have low back pain since 5 years. The pain comes once in every 3 to 4 months. The pain is more in the morning and less in the evening. Why does this pattern occur? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned persistent low back pain for 5 years as your main problem. It is a known scientific fact that when you go to bed, the muscles in the body relax subconsciously, due to which any inflammatory pain is felt more. When you start with some activity, then that protective muscle spasm comes again and prevents the pain perception. Also after overnight inactivity, the disc pressures have been found to be very high in the mornings. So there are very high chances of prolapse early in the morning. Hence, I always advise my patients not to bend acutely forwards, or lift something very heavy, especially in the early morning time. Your pain could be due to multiple reasons - muscular, mechanical, discal in origin, etc. If you have a localized backache, with no associated neurological symptoms like radiation of pain to legs, numbness, paresthesias, electric shock-like sensations in legs and there are no systemic symptoms like swelling, fever, loss of appetite or weight, etc., my advice to you for the initial 2 to 3 weeks will be: If your condition does not improve after 2 to 3 weeks of this conservative management, then you need to undergo some investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I smoke, and I usually avoid smoking around other people. However, I work at a hospital, and I went outside the hospital, and I lit up a cigarette. I did not notice that there was a woman with a baby, and I stood near them smoking for quite a few seconds. Now I am worried that the baby might die of SIDS, and it will be my fault. Is this possible?","Doctor":"Hi. Please find my observations below. Second-hand smoke or passive smoking can cause SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) only in infants who are exposed to such smoke regularly and in a closed environment like their house. Your cigarette smoking was an isolated event and unlikely to influence the health of the baby in any significant manner. Cigarette smoking in the open dilutes the harmful gases in the atmosphere and if you smoked only for a few seconds then the baby's health will not be compromised even if the baby has inhaled a small amount of the smoke. Please be assured that your action will not harm the baby in any way. In conclusion, you can forget the incident as a small error and stop feeling guilty about the entire episode. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a lower GI and pelvic CT scan with contrast done at the age of 36 years. I fly a lot. I want kids. Did this scan harm my eggs or increase my chances of developing cancer? Nothing was found in the scan, and the MSV was 8.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The contrast CT scan pelvis has exposed you to radiation of 8 mSv as recorded on the machine. For a 36 year old female patient, this means you are exposed to an additional cancer risk of 0.09 percent. In other words, there is a 99.91 percent chance of having no effects due to the CT scan pelvis. Flying exposes a pilot to radiation of approximately 2.2 mSv/year. Natural radiation we are exposed to is approximately 3.1 mSv/year. In conclusion, the 8 mSv radiation exposure has not caused any significant adverse effects and will not affect your plans to have kids. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My HSG test report is as follows. Impression: Contrast spill into the peritoneal cavity was not visualized on the left side, however faintly probably seen on the right side. Clinical correlation is suggested for further management.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity) However, I would like you to answer a few questions so that I can help you better. Did you get a pelvic ultrasound scan done? Your HSG report says tubes visualized and no dilatation seen, this is good. But the second part mentions contrast spill into the peritoneal cavity was not visualized on the left side, however faintly probably seen on the right side, this may indicate a block in the tubes at their outer end. If there is block of the tubes at their outer end, then hydrotubation (tubal flushing) can open it. Alternatively, a laparoscopy and fimbriolysis may open it. Blocked tubes are usually caused by Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) due to infection with chlamydia, tuberculosis, and other microbes and also by endometriosis, a condition where there is a collection of menstrual type blood around the uterus, ovaries, and tubes.  If you can send me the image, I can comment better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

Breathing treatments like nebulizers will not hide any suspected lung cancer when given before taking a chest x-ray. Chest x-ray is a basic investigation used to screen the lungs field and heart and usually done as a routine investigation. A routine chest x-ray usually picks up any nodules or mass in the lung fields that might represent lung cancer and is not affected by the patient taking nebulization therapy. If there are strong reasons to suspect a lung cancer, then a CT scan chest is the best investigation and gives a complete detailed overview of the lungs. In conclusion, breathing treatment will not hide lung cancer when given before taking a chest x-ray."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am eight weeks and three days pregnant.

The problem is that bleeding is very very little by little, I mean just a few drops without any pain or any blood clots. I am not sure it is my period or vaginal bleeding. As I am sexually active, I just had sex once, a month ago. I do not know what it is. Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. I am pretty sure this will be the beginning of periods. These little bit variations in days and amount of bleeding are common. Ultimately, in a day or two, you will have your normal bleeding periods. Another possibility is lost pregnancy. Sometimes, conception occurs and just get lost before even next menstural day, and misunderstood as normal periods. So just watch for abnormally prolonged bleeding like for more than seven days. But I believe that it would be normal periods."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I had three stitches after the procedure. I have swelling and pain when I open my mouth. The pain is reducing every day. Today I noticed pus formation and with slight pressure, it came out. It was orangish-yellowish color. Once this came out I felt better. My doctor has recommended only Ibuprofen 340 mg, Paracetamol, and Lysozyme HCl 30 mg. He also prescribed Clindamycin 300 mg but said not to eat it after my followup visit on the next day after tooth removal. Can you please suggest if I need to take any other medicine? I have started taking Clindamycin three times a day from today morning. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, this condition is known as dry socket. All you need to do is visit any nearby dentist if possible and get this cleaned or washed properly. Maybe after extraction, you spit something forcefully in 24 hours. This condition is normal. Drink a good amount of water, rinse mouth with salt water properly. Visit the dentist for further cleaning of that pus. Take medicines on time if you are still following any.

I get a little bit of relaxation by medicine but not completely and again next year I feel the same problem. I have gone for X-ray, etc., and everything was fine.","Doctor":"Hi. Your cough seems related to the weather which gets worse during the winter season. Which city do you live in since some dry arid or polluted cities have high levels of toxins? And what is your BMI (body mass index) or weight and height? That may also cause gastric irritation if weight is above normal. This seems to be a kind of allergic bronchitis that is healed by increasing immunity. Lemon and ginger are the best natural ways to improve immunity or take a Vitamin C supplement. The cough will go with regular care and warm water treatment. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Are we allowed to drink water after a cesarean section? If not, what happens to the body if you drink water?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your concern. Water is not prohibited after C-section. However, drinking water or any fluids is delayed right after CS because you are expected to lie down flat on the bed at least eight hours after the operation to avoid post anesthesia side effect of a spinal headache. With this, since you are in supine and you just got an operation, your bowels are not yet fully functioning. If you drink water lying down, you might aspirate it towards your lungs and you will have a difficulty of breathing. If you take it within eight hours and you raise your head to drink it, you may experience a spinal headache plus you will experience vomiting and possibly abdominal pain because your intestines are not yet ready to take it in. You may try to sip out water with wet cotton just so to wet your lips and quench a little desire to drink."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Due to weather change, I caught a cold and dry cough is there since last four days. Please suggest some medicine to expel a cough from the body.","Doctor":"Hello. A dry cough is very common with a change of weather and is often prolonged. It often causes a lot of discomforts especially in the throat. It can also be associated with seasonal allergies. You will be needing an expectorant along with a drug from the bronchodilator group for dilation of the bronchioles and easy expectoration of mucus. I suggest syrup Mexair which contains Terbutaline (bronchodilator) and Guaifenesin (expectorant). Other than that I would suggest you do steam inhalation twice day. Syrup Mexair twice a day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The query is about sanded grout exposure. I am quite concerned about my girlfriend’s exposure to silica dust. We were doing a home renovation. I left for about 1.5 hours while she was removing tile in a kitchen. When I had come back I saw she was removing grout with a grinder and no dust mask. The room was filled with dust in the air. The room is about 10x9 with 12” tiles. This makes for a total cut distance of 1100” with the grinder. Assuming a 1/8” cut with a depth of 3/8” and this works out to 51.56 cubic inches of dust released into the air. Assuming an average of 25 % silica content in the grout and weight of 38 g per cu inch for the dust, that is about 490 grams of silica dust releases into the air. The room was open to adjacent rooms so I estimated about 90 cubic meter space, wich would work out to 5.4 g/m^3. She was doing this for about an hour and a half so I estimate about 1 m^3 was inhaled. From what I have read this is really high-level exposure. Is my math wrong? Did I miss something? I am making her go to the doctor and we will monitor her health closely. I am really concerned this could lead to serious problems in the near future.","Doctor":"Hi. Looking at the history, it is quite a high-level exposure and it can cause some kind of pneumonitis feature called hypersensitivity pneumonitis or toxic dust syndrome. If she develops symptoms of a cough, breathlessness, better to get a CT thorax to see her lungs and if possible lung function tests also. Kindly get back if you need more information."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Again, the second one was done six months later which was also a failure. My husband was diagnosed with fair to poor sperm DNA integrity and he is getting treated for the same.

As there is a blockage in the fallopian tube, IVF (invitro fertilization - a manual process of fertilization of the egg and the sperm in a laboratory) is the only option. Ideally, the ovum should be healthy in such cases, unless there is an association of PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or other cofactors. Ovacare Forte and Folic acid are micronutrient supplements and may not alter your cycles.

After the filling, an abscess reoccurred twice which was treated with antibiotics. It seemed to settle for a while and then I could feel a pain and pressure inside the tooth. Now a small pimple like spot has developed on the inner side of my gum at the top of the tooth and it drains pus. Is this another abscess?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. As per your history, it seems to me that you are having recurrent apical periodontitis. If the filling is still there, it needs to be removed. The recurrent apical abscess is because of this infectious tooth. Either it needs root canal treatment or extraction. Root canal treatment is the treatment of choice according to my opinion. If you have any X-ray or you can upload a picture too to get a proper treatment plan from my side. If you have this pimple like abscess you may need an antibiotic course too."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My problem started three years back for the first time when I started taking dumbbells for exercise. As I did not know from how much weight should I start, I took 20 kg (10 kg in each hands). Within a week of exercise I felt shortness of breath and so I stopped doing it and visited a doctor. He told me to take ECG and it came out normal, but I had higher pulse rate. When he checked my BP it was also high like 140/90 mmHg. So, he prescribed Nebicard 2.5 one tablet per day in the morning and it brought down my heart rate and BP. Since then I am not able to work hard and when I do something then excessive sweating and higher pulse happens. So, I visited a cardiologist and he asked an echo test. It was taken lying down and he told there is no problem, but I have a bicuspid aortic valve. He told to continue with Nebicard and take echo for every year. But, even today I have symptoms like higher pulse and I can feel the heart beating hard when I touch the chest wall. Also, when I stand up suddenly my heart rate first increases and then decrease low after some seconds and I have sweating. This is accompanied with breathing difficulty. This stops to normal in some one or two minutes and heart rate becomes normal. This is happening to me since three years and still going on. What is wrong with me? Is BAV causing this? What test should I take now? I have done all blood tests, thyroid tests and kidney Doppler, everything were normal too. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for consulting me at this platform. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I think you need to carry out taking the same medication as this is a mandatory medication. Exercise induced asthma may also cause shortness of breath. Excess sweating is natural and this is also a side effect of almost every medication used for lowering heart rate. It is called postural hypotension, in which you feel sleepy and sometimes weak when standing up from sitting position.

I am worried it might be something serious. This year I have also experienced a lot of left side facial pain and numbness, as well as left eye blurriness. So I am not sure if the pain on the left side of my scalp could be related.","Doctor":"Hi. The ABCD criteria for moles you should be aware to see for malignant changes. One should always look for the change in color, size, margin, the surface of the mole, also if it is associated with itching and bloody discharge. I have reviewed clinical photograph attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are no changes of erythema around mole or discharge. In photographs, there are two moles only. If there is an increase in the number of moles or increase in size, the best would be skin biopsy for histopathology to see for malignant changes. Presently, there is no inflammation also in these two photographs which you have attached to comment on itching sensation which you are experiencing. You should consider an ophthalmologist opinion for the blurring of vision. I do not think personally from these clinical photographs that mole and other symptoms are associated. Physicians opinion should be considered for numbness over one side. If you have any fluid-filled lesions on one side then keep watch for that too. Skin biopsy for histopathology should be done if specifically mole is associated with itching."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from heart palpitations (especially when I lie down or do some physical activity), shortness of breath, tachycardia for the past three months. I am taking Propranolol (20 mg per day) for this. Propranolol is controlling trachycardia a bit. In stress my condition worsens. I think (my own opinion) that I might have mitral valvular stenosis. What do you say regarding my condition?","Doctor":"Hi. It seems to be due to anxiety. To exclude any valvular disorder, the cardiologist will auscultate your heart carefully, if he listens any abnormal sound he may advise echo, otherwise no need. Regarding palpitations, better have an ECG done at the time of symptoms or alternatively 24 hours ECG may be done. Avoid stress, anxiety, do regular exercise or brisk walk, reduce weight if you are overweight. Avoid any such thing people usually are addicted to. Reduce tea, coffee. Deep breathing is a good exercise to reduce anxiety, get up early in the morning and do this before or after fair prayer."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been under a considerable amount of stress.

The surgery was on the lower right side as my wisdom tooth was impacted and was inside the bone. Hence, I had to remove it as there was some TMJ discomfort. My recovery is going fine there is no numbness and I just want to take your suggestion on one thing. I still have a swelling type thing on my right side jaw where surgery happened, though my right cheek is fine. I just want to know, in how many weeks my jaw will be fine as there is something that I can feel like swelling or a hard lump near to my surgery area. When I do open my mouth there is pressure on my right side jaw. Since there is no pain, I just want to know that when can I expect my jaw swelling or hard lump in the surgery area to be fine?","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. Post-extraction swelling is normal as the tissues require a conducive environment for healing. Normally, an extraction site shows almost complete healing after 21 days provided you do not have any negative habits like smoking and have followed the instructions perfectly. In your case, it seems there was surgical removal of the tooth which requires an incision, bone cutting and sutures. If that was the case, it would take roughly around 4 or 5 weeks for the wound to heal completely. The swelling will also subside with the coming days. I would suggest you to wait and follow the instructions of your dentist. However, if the swelling continues to remain there for even longer time, and if you feel discomfort then I would suggest you to go to your dentist at that time. I would also suggest you doing normal saline oral rinses with warm water but very gently (in order to not destabilize the clot of the wound). Maintain good oral hygiene.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am currently bleeding through my nostrils, having underskin blood spots and pain in my ankle. These symptoms are new to me. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 4 year old son has a broken ulna and radius. They are broken in the middle of his arm. The x-ray shows that the broken bones are displaced. The doctor did not perform a reduction and ordered a full arm cast. He stated that the bones will set themselves as my son grows. Is this true? It does not make sense that reductions are performed on some children being that \\"the bones will set themselves as a child grows\\". I would like to know if my son has received proper treatment.","Doctor":"Hello.I have seen the x-rays of your child (attachment removed to protect patient identity).To be very honest, I am not happy if this is the position which has been accepted after the cast has been put. It is true that fractures remodel in children very well and that they also unite very fast. But in your child's case, I am unhappy because : It is also known that serial x-rays have to be done because the position in a cast can change and lead to unacceptable malalignment. In any case, I will advise you not to panic. It would be better to go for closed reduction and above elbow cast under sedation. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32 year old male. I started masturbating ten years back. CurrentlyI masturbate daily morning and night. Sometimes, I achieve erection very quick, and sometimes it takes time. I masturbate seeing porn videos. The problem is, when I entered marriage life, I could not get a proper erection to penetrate my partner. I could get partial erection, but that goes down soon. I also get less excitation when I actually touch or feel the body than seeing porn. Due to this, my marriage life was affected leading to divorce. I do not get erection problem during masturbation, but why during actual sex? How to cure this? I would be married again soon in a month. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. It is your thought, which is creating the problem. For a man of 32 years with regular masturbation for the last 9 years, it is easy to understand that there is no problem with erection. It is the guilty feeling associated with masturbation that is creating the problem. In other words, it can be said that the problem is a psychological one. This is common in men who think masturbation is wrong. At this stage, I would like to advise you a few things:"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently had a car accident. I was passenger. How can my arm feel very still and tender? The doctor at the urgent care gave me Naproxen but my muscle is still tender and I have not been able to sleep at all. The doctor gave me Hydroxyzine which did not work.","Doctor":"Hi. If it is just a bruise, then you just need to give it time and pain control with some NSAID like Naproxen, and need no intervention but only if your swelling start getting worse. But in any accident we should consider ruling out underlying bone fracture as bone fractures need to be fixed surgically. I am not sure how bad your accident was, and how your bruises look like but if it is bad enough then might need X-rays to rule out underlying fracture. I believe that urgent care doctor have ruled out or did not think of fracture after examination. So just keep taking Naproxen, cold compresses with ice (wrapped in plastic bag or cloth) might help. Contact doctor if swelling or tenderness do not start getting better in 2 to 3 days or start getting worse."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to know what can be done to get my teeth in proper alignment as there is a gap between two teeth.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. If you have a gap between the front teeth only, then the condition is called as midline diastema. It can be treated orthodontically as well as with conservative management (operative dentistry).  In operative dentistry, the gap will be filled with the tooth-colored material (composite filling) and it will be as if there were no gap in between. However, a slight elongation of the crown does occur but you have a small gap so it will not be that evident. For you, I would recommend you to go for the operative procedure (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a non-invasive procedure and results are instant and is also globally approved procedure. Follow up after the procedure is done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 49-year-old male, 6'4\\" and 300 lbs. I take very low doses testosterone, an estrogen blocker, and HGH. All very low dosages.

I tried to have blood drawn today but the facility cancelled the appointment. Will aspirin help reduce the risks of stroke?","Doctor":"Hi. I agree with you. There is a risk of leg vein thrombosis in deep veins of legs due to prolong sitting. Aspirin do help according to some studies, might be not as beneficial as full anticoagulants like Heparin, etc., but take Aspirin 325 mg (not 75 or 81 mg) one hour before flight with meal.

Your friend's mother is showing an aggressive and abusive behavior which indicates serious mental illness.

Would you do the thyroid hormone test with every patient admitted to the ward? Would it be a standard psychiatric procedure? What neurological and physical examinations would you conduct to rule out any other medical or neurological disorders? Schizophrenia is a dysfunction of brain’s physiology; the functioning through neurotransmitters and through hormones but actually genetic problem is always there; means there is a dysfunction at cellular level.

Is it only a matter of time before it gets infected or not? If I have no pain, it is dead right?","Doctor":"Hi. According to your history, the pulp is exposed and decayed by now. It means sensations are lost and that is why you are not feeling pain in it. But it does not mean your tooth cannot get an infection now. It can get infected because of the food stuck in it can cause infection in gums around broken tooth and root. That may be very painful. Therefore, I will advise you to visit your dentist and get it extracted or treated according to your clinical condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am diagnosed with the degenerative changes in the cervical and many more things.

I have read your concern and seen the MRI report. It seems that the spine shows degeneration in the bones and disk but does not show any impingement of the spinal cord and the nerves. However, the cervical vertebrae are abnormally straightened as opposed to normal curve (this signifies muscle strain). The pain you are experiencing can be discoligamentous in nature, meaning this is coming from the disc and bones and joint attachments. It is a good thing that you do not have any motor weakness (signifies intact nerves). This usually resolves in pain medications and rehabilitative medicine in six weeks. This should help you. Age-related changes. Repeat MRI after rehabilitation in six weeks, serum, calcium, sodium. Cervical arthropathy due to RA or TB. Degenerative cervical spine disease.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

The medicines you are taking are also good. But instead of taking hormones daily I recommend that you put in a hormone-releasing intrauterine device called Mirena. That remains in your uterus without problem. Delivers the hormones where they are actually needed, cutting down the side effects of excessive hormone intake plus you get rid of the daily responsibility of taking your pills. However, as per the ultrasound finding of a bulky uterus, you may have adenomyosis which is causing this abnormal uterine bleeding. Adenomyosis is a condition that affects the wall of your uterus. Unfortunately, it does not respond well to hormonal treatment. Please get an MRI of the pelvis done. If that shows adenomyosis you may still try Mirena but if that is ineffective, you may even need surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have extreme anxiety when I see an attractive girl.

However, when I masturbate with hand or use fleshlight masturbator, my penis is really stiff and everything goes fine. I am a bit embarrassed too. What could be the reason? How can I overcome it?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand. You are not yet married and therefore you should not worry much about your erection. A hard and stiff erection happens only one or two times before or during intercourse. If you have five minutes sex, the really hard erection will happen only for less than one minute. Otherwise, your penis will be a little bit sluggish. Secondly, hardness does not count in sex or ejaculation or childbirth. Having the ability to penetrate and ejaculate counts.

By your history and description, the possibility of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is more likely. A cough with greenish expectoration is commonly seen with pseudomonas infection.

I always tell my patients that diabetes is not a disease as long as it is under control. When it is not under control, it leads to disease (complications) in the long run. It is extremely important to keep your sugar level under control at all times. How you choose to do it is entirely up to you. Nothing is impossible. Dietary changes are not very difficult if you make up your mind and take control of your life. Regular physical exercise also helps to a great extent. However, if you think you cannot make any changes to diet and lifestyle, the only way to get your sugar level under control would be to increase the dosage of your medication. Gluconorm-VG2 is prescribed for diabetes, but Telesta 40 is for high blood pressure.

As per your clinical history is concerned, please follow like this. Discuss with your doctor about the prescription medications like Nitrofurantoin to clear the infection and Paracetamol for pain and fever. Do follow lifestyle modifications like this.  Drink plenty of liquids, especially water. Drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that you will urinate more frequently allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin. Wipe from front to back. Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. Empty your bladder soon after intercourse. Also, drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria. Avoid potentially irritating feminine products.

Your urinalysis and vaginal swab tests were normal or not? You have received medications for bacterial infection but it keeps coming back. One thing that I want to tell you is that in normal females few have high vaginal secretions. It is sometimes by genetics or otherwise at ovulation or excitement, at fertilization or in stress or anxiety or overexertion during pregnancy or in a few diabetic patients. All can be due to over-production of normal vaginal flora as well but other infections could be there. You could have one of the above-mentioned causes.  Do not over-treat vaginal secretions unless it is diagnosed infection, smelly, irritating and not normal as it can cause damage to your normal vaginal flora that is lactobacillus. As a result, you can have vaginal dryness, over-secretion from the vagina. Maintain strict hygiene. Soft comfortable undergarments. Have a healthy nutritious diet and try to have full monitoring and treatment, if you have any health problem. Have twice on two alternate days Clotrimazole pessary per vaginal and have one course of tablet Doxycycline 100 mg BID for seven days. If you feel irritating, you can sit in warm water twice daily for a few minutes.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am on alpha and beta blockers. Is it possible to take Actifed and Otrivine nasal drops together?","Doctor":"Hi. I would suggest it is better to space these out at least two hours apart. Give a gap of two hours before taking other after taking one. Pseudoephedrine and Oxymetazoline have common alpha agonist activity, can increase, give a surge in BP, especially if your BP already remains at the borderline. Another thing that I am concerned is, if you have underlying subclinical BPH, taking these two together can precipitate urinary retention and you will not be able to empty bladder."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a plica removal surgery six days ago. How do I ensure a good recovery, without scarring inside the knee? How much can I and how much should I exercise in this knee, and how?","Doctor":"Hello. Plica is a tissue that remains behind when the knee joint is formed (from multiple small pockets). In some, it may be a very tough structure and cause rubbing when the knee bends. Once excised it will not grow back and movements will not make this worse. You are allowed to do everything as soon as the pain and swelling subside."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, We just had sex about seven hours ago, and we did it without any protection. So my penis was inside her vagina and we did a handful of up and down movement (she was on top of me, basically sitting on me- cowgirl position), and we decided to stop because of the consequences unsafe sex may lead up to. My concern is that although we stopped way before I could have reached orgasm, precum could have secreted out of me. I am considering buying her Trust pills as it is said to work as an ECP would. In my country, Plan B is not available.","Doctor":"Hi. The Levonorgestrel content from trust pills is too low. You will need five pills taken at the same time, then another five pills after 12 hours. However, your partner may feel nauseous and uneasy because this pill also contains Estrogen and a high dose of it also have side effects of nausea and vomiting.

First of all, you should be confirmed that it is hemorrhoids. If it is external or internal hemorrhoids, external cause pain and internal cause bleeding. Also, let me know if you have constipation. If yes, use capsule Colace 100 mg BID and avoid constipation, take a sitz bath twice daily. Sitz bath is simple.

Immuno outcomes: CD3, CD5, CD43 many positive T-cells. CD20, CD79A many positive B cells. CD23, Bcl-2 some positive. Cyclin D1: rare positive only CD10 negative. Diagnosis: negative for malignancy. Question: I have a history of sibling lymphoma and I have the epstein barr virus. Should they consider mantle cell lymphoma? Needle core biopsy through endoscope may not be definitive. Excisional would have been better. Lymphoma symptoms are present. Primary biliary cholangitis was also diagnosed before five years. Lymphocytic colitis and erosions in the stomach are also found. Should I ask for more testing for lymphoma?","Doctor":"Hello. Hereby, I am giving my opinion for your case. You are having ebstein bar virus infection. This virus can lead to hepatitis development and enlarged lymph nodes. You are right on your suspicion that multiple enlarged lymph nodes raised suspicion towards malignancy especially lymphoma. But the main thing is biopsy is considered conclusive and your flow cytometry report is clearly suggestive of non-malignant lesion that is polyclonal cells are present. So these reports are not suggestive of any lymphoma. You have mentioned diagnosis as primary biliary cholangitis, so in this autoimmune disease, liver enzymes can be elevated. In this disease, over the time cirrhosis also can be developed. No need of repeat biopsy just now as per the mentioned report. Consult a gastroenterologist for primary biliary hepatitis.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The RCT was short because I experienced acute pain beyond that point. RCT is about 1.8 mm short. He then suggested getting apicoectomy because RCT was incomplete. From a second opinion, the other doctor recommended a re-RCT. What should I do? Do I need to get the surgical procedure done? I have no symptoms of pain in the tooth. My teeth are generally weak and hence a little pressure is felt. The tooth area is mildly sensitive, but I suspect it to be from other nearby infected tooth.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query, and I can understand your concern. Endodontic treatment for any tooth when it is not completely done like in your case it is short. It might be that you cannot feel pain or have any other discomfort. But it is highly susceptible to the secondary infection in the root. I would highly recommend going for the re-RCT treatment as it will not require any major surgical procedure and the tooth will be saved as a whole (in retreatment only minimal tooth material is lost). However, sometimes if space is some mm short, then if the root canal is properly sealed, it might not lead to further secondary infection. But that is just one such case. So if you wanna wait for the symptoms, you can but I would suggest you go for re-RCT.  Apicoectomy is more invasive and will remove a small unfilled lower portion of the tooth and then accordingly seal the apex of the root. This also is a way to seal off the apex for underfilled root canals in RCT. But re-RCT is more desirable for me if you would have been my patient. Also, maintain good oral hygiene and brush your teeth twice daily and floss regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fiancee took four Yasmin pills as emergency contraception.

That was taken within less than 30 hours after we had sexual intercourse. Looking for your kind advice. She is feeling better now but I am afraid to continue with another four pills. Also, I have read that Yasmin can increase blood clot which can be deadly. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. Using Yasmin pills for emergency contraception follows the Yuzpe regimen where oral contraceptive pills are used as ECP within 72 hours of last intercourse. As the first four pills have been taken by her after 30 hours of intercourse as per the regimen, so the next should be taken after 12 hours and should not be missed. The side effects can vary from mild nausea to vomiting, headache, bloating, belching, breast tenderness or even spotting. These effects are secondary to Progesterone and Estrogen in the pills. These can be countered by taking an anti-emetic pill like Metoclopramide10 mg, an hour before starting the regimen and also before the second dose after 12 hours. This shall prevent nausea and Progesterone side effects can be countered by increasing the water intake which can neutralize the Progesterone side effects. To help prevent you from feeling nauseous, one should take pills with food. It also helps if she would timer second dose such that she takes it just before bed. That way, she will sleep through nausea. The clotting is a known rare side effect of OC pills if OC pills are being used for years together for contraception, then predisposition for clotting increases. But the regimen needs to be completed as per protocol to achieve the desired result. After taking the second dose, withdrawal bleeding should be expected in next 3 to 5 days and once bleeding is appreciated, it would indicate that there is endometrial shed and chances of pregnancy are minimal and she is likely to be pregnancy safe. The best would have been emergency contraceptive pills like an Ipill or Plan-B, but if it is banned in your country, Regimen is still a reliable means for emergency contraception with OC pills.

In a recent medical check-up, there was a note related to heart rate (bradycardia), the result was 49 bpm. I also have checked manually and also using pulse meter, the result around 51 to 55 bpm. In the last eight months, I do morning run three times a week (30 minutes). Actually previously instead of running, I also have done sports exercise (static bike) with the same intensity. One thing that differs with the previous conditon is I lost 8 kilos (in 7 to 8 months time). There is no symptom related to my health, instead, I feel comfortable and fit. I have consulted with the cardiologist and he said it was okay as long as I do not feel any symptom (faint, dizzy, etc). But the doctor quite worried regarding the heart rate at night since based on ECG result (using Holter monitor for a full day), it showed the heart rate plunged to 35 bpm at night (sleeping). The doctor gave me Terbutaline sulfate, with a low dosage (two times a day at 2.5 mg). My question is whether bradycardia is related to my sports activity? Does it relate to my weight loss? Is there any reference related to normal heart rate for atheletes (with sports heart) when sleeping at night?","Doctor":"Hi. It is quite common and normal for regular athletes to have sinus bradycardia, I saw some with heart rate down to 40 to 45 bpm daytime. At night usually, the HR is slower and it can get down to 35 bpm. As long as you remain asymptomatic that is no lightheadedness and no fainting or collapses, then no further action is required. It is not related to weight loss which could be secondary to increased physical activity and exercises. If weight loss is not deliberate, then this needs to be investigated. Weight loss and bradycardia could be seen in malnutrition patients and people with severe depression sometimes. I do not think it is the case here as you do regular exercise which is a good sign. Please be assured."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old girl now and am having hair fall. What should I do now? And my skin is dry skin. Which is the best cream for my face and which body lotion is best for me?","Doctor":"Hi. For hair fall, apply Bringharaja thailam or Neeli bringharaja thailam. Use fingers to do the scalp massage with this oil. After one hour of oil-finger massage, the bath should be taken in warm water. This has to be continued weekly twice (minimum) to daily. For the hair, iron, zinc, copper elements are important. So take foods that contain more iron, zinc, and copper. More stress and less sleep are also the reason for the hair fall. So, correct it. For dry skin, use Aloe vera based gel (buy from cosmetic or medical shops) and apply. Body lotions usually dry the skin. So, you may not apply body lotion or you see the lotion that contains olive oil and badam. If you consume food prepared using coconut oil and apply above mentioned herbal oil on the head (hair), the skin gets oil from them. Skin will glow. The dryness is more during winter. So, drink more water and consume oily foods."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a metal crown, and the metal has become pointy and cuts my tongue. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello.  I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. The metallic restoration or crown when placed needs to be in harmony with the occlusion or the bite of the mouth. However, sometimes with due course of time what happens is that the crown gets disharmonious due to the continued masticatory forces of teeth and jaw. Sometimes, even the fractured part of the metal crown makes it sharp. This might lead to discomfort or even sometimes impinging to the soft tissues. You do not need to worry as it can be treated by trimming the sharply pointed surface. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist and get the occlusion checked. He would either go for trimming of sharp point in order to relieve you or if there might be any other problem underlying the cause, he would rectify that so it might not happen in the near future again. I would also advise you to have good oral hygiene and brush your teeth twice daily and floss regularly. Also, make a routine dental check-up six months in order to maintain your good condition of teeth and be evaluated of any problem in the earliest."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having stomach pain recently, low appetite, and sometimes it hurts when I eat meals.

By your history and description, the possibility of GERD is more likely. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain, indigestion, burning epigastric pain, burping, belching, etc. So take Pantoprazole and Levosulpiride combination on empty stomach twice daily.

So should I give her Unwanted 72 or is there any chance of getting pregnant and can you tell me the side effects which she will face after taking Unwanted 72?","Doctor":"Hi. It is better if you send me her detailed gynecological, obstetric, medical, surgical, drugs history. If she has short irregular cycles of 28 days or less, then it is better to have Ipill as in regular cycles of 28 days there is a fertile period from day 8 to day 13. So, better to have I-pill within 48 to 72 hours post-sex without vomitings. She can have withdrawal bleed within 1 to 2 weeks post-pill and then next cycle could be irregular or unpredictable but as soon as the body gets rid of hormonal effects of externally induced contraceptive, cycles could come back to the previous pace. I hope you get my point. For regular contraception, you can have combined oral contraceptive pills for three months or implant or injectable or Mirena intrauterine device, etc. But, mind it that all contraceptives are mostly hormonal and their long-term use can give short and long-term side effects that could differ a bit from person to person according to the body response of the individual.

Then, I had a CBC test done and the result showed that the RDW was high 16.3, low HCT 34.0, low hemoglobin 10.8, low MCH 23.9 and low MPV 7.9. The rest of the results were normal. The doctor told me to use an inhaler, but it is not helping. I would like to know what exactly is wrong with me. Previously, I was using Ventolin inhaler. Currently, I am using Ventolin inhaler and Montiget.","Doctor":"Hi. The hemoglobin levels and other abnormalities do not explain the severity of the symptoms that you are experiencing. Iron, Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements along with dietary improvement to improve hemoglobin to 12 to 13 g% is necessary. However, after improvement, if the symptoms improve, then it could be a possibility. Hope your thyroid tests are normal and these are not anxiety or panic attacks. Try some breathing exercises like pranayama and meditation for relaxation. Inhaler maybe useful if there is an allergic reaction or bronchospasm. In case of serious shortness of breath and even if it mildly helpful, better to use during the episodes.

He used to meet me for some time and tell all the information what he had done. Before four years, when he was 2 years old, he said that, my husband banged my son's head five to six times on the wall and made his nose bleeding. Now, we got to know that my son has ADHD. Now, what should I do to know whether my son is fine or not?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, let me tell you that you are doing a great job managing a kid with ADHD along with some family issues what you had mentioned. For further information consult a child health specialist online -->  Clinical examination by a pediatrician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Is this a tooth abscess or root canal may be?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I have seen the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and based on that, I would say that your wisdom tooth has caries (cavity) that seems to be deep. Secondly, it has not erupted (come out) completely into the oral cavity and the gums or flap covering it is inflamed and enlarged. A few questions, do you have pain, especially while chewing or sleeping? Is there any painful swelling, especially below the angle of the lower jaw (lymphadenopathy)? The permanent solution for this is tooth removal (extraction or surgical removal, which can be confirmed after seeing X-ray: OPG or IOPA). Again, an X-ray only can confirm whether any abscess is there or not. If you do not have pain, then you can delay the removal a bit. But, get it removed as soon as possible. Yes, a tooth with such a cavity can receive a root canal treatment if the cavity reaches pulp (blood supply) of the tooth. But, this wisdom tooth is advisable for removal only. I will explain why. This tooth is not completely erupted into the oral cavity and does not have space too. Secondly, maintaining oral hygiene in this area is difficult and access to the dentist for the treatment is difficult too. Even after root canal, placement of crown (cap) in this area is difficult and a total waste. So, why to waste your money and the dentist's efforts. Thirdly, this tooth, by evolution, has become non-functional, so its removal is not going to affect you much with mastication. So, keeping all this in mind, removal is the only best option for this tooth. You can attach the X-ray and answer regarding the pain (if you have) so that I can help you further. Take care.

Revert back with the photos to a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just went to my general practitioner due to recently having some issues with shortness of breath and an odd sensation in my heart area. I suspected it was nothing but went in anyways just to be sure. The sensation in my heart area is not at all painful, but just a sensation of \\"fullness\\" or \\"tightness\\". I got an EKG done, and the results said I have a \\"minor interior repolarization disturbance, consider ischemia, LV overload or aspecific change. flat or low negative T in AVF with negative T in III\\" I am a 29 year old male in generally good shape. I smoked for about 10 years but quit two years ago. I still smoke marijuana daily. Also, about eight years ago, I had a root canal done, and it has now re-infected twice. I am scheduled for an apicoectomy next month to deal with the asymptomatic infection. I only mention this as I am worried that maybe the untreated infection could have spread from the root of the tooth to my heart? Also, I live at 7,000 feet elevation which I am sure does not help the shortness of breath, but have lived here about six years. I am currently very nervous thinking I have a serious issue. Can anyone tell me what these results mean? My general practitioner referred me to a cardiologist but I do not want to be a nervous wreck until I hear from them.","Doctor":"Hello. I have carefully reviewed your detailed query. You definitely need an in-person cardiologist consultation for appropriate evaluation of the issues. Only EKG is not conclusive in such a case. We need to listen to the heart and then go for thorough physical exam. Tests may include but not limited to exercise stress test, echocardiography, thallium scan, chest X-ray, CT scan, angiography and others if needed. Once ruled out we can say with confidence if there is any issue that needs proper management. Yes, an infection can spread from the teeth and throat infection to heart and can be diagnosed. Blood work also helps in this regards to find out infectious agents in blood and due to infection, any changes in the blood. If there is blockage to any of the blood vessels supplying the heart, there are chances of shortness of breath and patient can be short of breath even talking for some time, little physical activity or climbing the stairs. Do not panic and just follow as directed by your primary care and go for cardiologist evaluation. Meanwhile, go for apicoectomy and keep in touch with your dentist. Hope it helps.

Get a thyroid profile done and other blood tests like a complete blood count and sugar levels. You should eat only what you feel like and what you can sustain like fruits, a dry toast with butter or jam bread. You can have cornflakes with cold milk as the hyperacidity reduces with that. You can have a semolina porridge or a sandwich. It is alright. Everyone goes through it. Some have bad phases but eventually, it will be over or at least decreased considerably by 12 to 13 weeks.

Got IVF cycle agonist technique done but could not retrieve any eggs. IVF cycle got canceled due to empty egg syndrome. Now, what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Your AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) levels are very low indicating poor ovarian reserve and a TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) of 7 at 25 mcg Thyroxine is still high. It should be less than 4 ideally to support folliculogenesis and ovulation. As IVF (in-vitro fertilization) could not yield any eggs with agonist cycle, it is suggested that you can be placed on DHEAS (Dehydroepiandrosterone) 75 mg tablet daily for 48 days along with low dose oral contraceptive pill for two cycles and then should repeat your AMH to see if it improves and ovarian reserve is improved and then you can opt for another IVF cycle post that.

When I touch a specific point on my spine the pain is severe. It hurts when I bend or sit it feels very sore. I visited a GP and she said that she thinks it is a muscle insertion that causes the pain but she is not sure. She did a neurological examination and all was normal. I wanted your opinion as my ankles and shin bone now started being painful too. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia four months ago and wanted to know if it is this that causes bone pain. My posture is quite bad too so I am not sure what it could be. I am very worried in case it is something very serious. What I should do now?","Doctor":"Hello. From your history and being unable to examine you I can only speculate on the cause. Yes, fibromyalgia can lead to trigger spots like tender areas which can be over the muscle belly or their attachment on the bone. The good thing was that the neurological exam was normal. Now coming to your concern that the shin and ankles had become painful. I will recommend that you get your ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), complete blood count (CBC), urine routine, Vitamin D levels, and blood sugar tested. This will generally show indication about any inflammatory process and bars on that you can be started on antiinflammatory medication including steroids and possibly vitamin D too. Please let me know your investigation results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 16 months old was on a 10 day antibiotic for a bad throat infection. It looks like one of her teeth has gone a bit yellow after it. Is that normal to happen with an antibiotic?","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. You do not need to panic. Generally, the discoloration of the teeth is a reversible process and when the medication is stopped, the discoloration also gets corrected. The tooth discoloration has many reasons and yes one of them is medicine. There are several medications that may cause discoloration of the teeth like Tetracycline antibiotics cause blackish to brownish discoloration. However, sometimes it is not the medication as such that causes the discoloration. The medicines of babies usually contain some sweetening agent in order to make the drug sweet to taste. On regular consumption of the drug, the teeth might show decay or yellow discoloration. I would suggest you visit the same doctor who prescribed the medication for your baby and ask him if the medicine might have any side effects of causing discoloration. You can also send me the name of the antibiotics that the baby is on, so I can see if those drugs could cause any kind of discoloration. Meanwhile, maintain good oral health of your baby. Rinse his or her mouth with water after taking medication and foods (breastfed milk included). Clean his teeth with cotton ball gently and massage his gums gently. This will ensure safety from further damage to the teeth. I would suggest you to keep on continuing these cleaning tips till the baby is 2 years old. After 2 years, the toothbrush can be used to clean the teeth. If you are able to maintain the oral hygiene of your baby till 3 years, the overall oral health of the baby for the coming future will be good and there will be a decrease in the incidence of the dental related problems."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Do people who have spina bifida and have urinary and bowel incontinence also have fertility issues?","Doctor":"Hi.

The nerve damage in spina bifida that affects urinary and bowel functions may also affect sexual functioning. It has been found that most males and females with spina bifida are fertile. Many of the issues surrounding reduced fertility in spina bifida are due to mechanical and anatomical reasons. 75% of men with spina bifida achieve erections, but maintaining erections is a problem, and some may be merely reflexive in nature. Most of these men show marked improvement with Sildenafil though ejaculation may not occur in all men.

But in the majority of the cases, weaning off or rather the whole process of treatment should be augmented with psychotherapies associated with the diagnosed condition. In your case, CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) should be augmented with the medicine.

I do have a white lump on my upper gum but I have had it for a while. Sometimes, it goes away and then comes back. My tooth pain almost feels like a cavity but I am not sure.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems your tooth is having a chronic abscess due to infection reaching the pulp and beyond the roots of the tooth and the white swelling is an abscess. I suggest you consult your dentist who will take an X-ray of the tooth and will confirm the diagnosis and explain the treatment and prescribe the medication. Mostly, if the case is of abscess and if there is enough tooth structure, you will have to go for a root canal treatment followed by a crown. So, do not worry. Another possibility can be a gingival abscess, but in this, pain on chewing is rare.

So, it is essential to substitute it by other vitamin supplements."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hypertension. 138 mmHg systolic, 80 mmHg diastolic, 82 heart rate. Spasmodic foods (like yogurt) make higher hypertension. Antispasmodic foods (alkali, basic foods) do not cause higher hypertension. Which drug can I take? 57 years old, 72-kilogram weight.","Doctor":"Hi. BP of 138/80 is considered as high normal BP. You did not mention any other cardiovascular risk factors which put you in the low-risk category. In the first instance, I recommend lifestyle changes with regular exercise such as 40 minutes brisk walk on daily basis, reduce salt and caffeine, and smoking cessation (if you smoke). If after three months of lifestyle changes your BP remains above 130/85 then we can consider adding tablets at this stage, you do not need any tablets."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 55 years old. For the past 20 years, I have been paralyzed in the right extremities. Initially, I took allopathy treatment but it was not helping. So, took Ayurveda and really it helped a lot. My voice came back but with stuttering. When I talk about something I forget some words. My right leg is at the moment fine on the whole but we can make out that when I walk, there is a slight deviation. Now, my right hand has not been in use ever since the stroke. I am now on Ayurvedic medicines Mahayogaraja guggulu 1 - 1, Rasnadhi guggulu 1 - 1, Gandharvahastadi kashayam 15 ml with 30 ml warm water 1 - 1, Triphala churnam 10 gm, for massage Ksheerabala tailum and Valiya sahacharadhi tailum. The results are very slow. I want to ask you to help to vanish my stroke. I am a BP patient also.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query. You have weakness of the right half of body which is more in right arm than in right leg for the last twenty years. There is a history of hypertension. You had a stroke involving left cerebral cortex leading to weakness in the right half of body. I cannot be sure without neuroimaging like CT scan brain or MRI brain whether it was an ischemic stroke (cessation of blood flow to the brain) or hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding into brain substance).  Stroke causes damage to the brain due to underlying cardiovascular disease with time damage is permanent. There is currently no treatment for complete recovery after such a long time since the occurrence of stroke. New treatments focus on early thrombolysis when the patient reaches at stroke center within three to four and a half hours of the start of the stroke to receive thrombolysis if it is an ischaemic stroke. The best management plan for you is control of blood pressure and rehabilitation and prevention of further stroke."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Of late I am feeling like an orphan. My mother is always concerned about my sister who got married last year and has an infant. I feel my sister has no time for me and my mother has forgotten me. I give a lot in a relationship but I do not get even a quarter of it in return.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand you are going through a tough time emotionally. You are very close to your mother and sister emotionally and feel let down by them. You have mentioned that your sister has an infant and your mother is spending more time with her. Probably your mother feels at this point of time your sister needs her more as this being her first child. She may need all the physical and emotional support possible. A baby does take up a lot of effort. So probably your mother and sister do not realize that they are ignoring you and your needs even if they are doing so unintentionally. I would advise you to talk to them openly about it. You can begin by how happy your are about the new addition to the family and how you would love to be involved by the family in the process. Gradually tell them how you have been feeling ignored. You never realize how open communications can really help improve relationships. Every relationship has ups and downs. I am sure you will be able to resolve issues with your mother and sister."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I currently have aligners on and since I started the treatment I noticed a little white contour around my gums lower teeth, they lift a little bit. Is it something to be alarmed about?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. No, your gums are absolutely fine and nothing to be alarmed for. They are minor issues due to the realignment of the contour of your gums. Do continue to use aligner. When you remove your aligner please apply Rexidine M forte gel (if you feel any discomfort). It is just contouring your gums to the same level. If you carefully look to the image you uploaded you will notice those white lines only on the tooth that placed below. Realignment of the gingiva (contouring it on the same level). Continue using aligners. I do not think there might be any sharp edge, do mention to your dentist if present. Follow up after seven days. Apply the gel when not using your aligner. Use a simple mouthwash like Colgate plux after brushing your teeth to keep your gums healthy. Warm saline gargle occasionally."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is the pregnancy products coming out. Heavy bleeding is expected after medical termination of pregnancy. Sometimes, however, if the medical abortion is not complete and some products remain stuck in the uterus, the bleeding may continue or even be excessive to a level where you need to visit an emergency.

Before four years, I had a baby girl but she never did breastfeeding on my left breast. Now before one month, I have noticed I have breast lump which is never painful for me. I had reduced my weight to 8 to 10 kg from last 10 months. That is the only symptom that matches here. The doctor suggested mammogram followed by biopsy but the result was active chronic mastitis with giant cell reaction. So, the doctor prescribed antibiotics but after 20 days lump is of the same size. The next visit she suggested was an excisional biopsy of the lump. So, finally, I did an excisional biopsy or removed lump with surgery and then now biopsy report says mammary duct ectasia with chronic granulomatous mastitis. There is no evidence of malignancy in the examined material. Now my doctor is confused about what kind of treatment has to be started here as disease says for chances of repeated again but what kind of treatment will be effective here. Can you please advice here, if possible?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, you can relax well as there is nothing to worry with this report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The breast lump excision biopsy (the removed lump) has no evidence of cancerous tissue. It has evidence of inflammation and infection. Now few changes are noted in the biopsy are also seen in tuberculosis. But there is no strong evidence to suggest tuberculosis. This might have made your treating doctor confused. My suggestions would be you can get the slides reviewed by another pathologist, just for a second opinion. If it is non-specific, you can be just on follow up."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Since yesterday I am getting tooth pain in my upper left canine.

Almost dental caries can cause pain whether it is constant pain or intermittent. According to your condition, it is almost caries bacteria cavitated inside the tooth and pain results from the infected bacteria reaching the pulp chamber (the sensory area inside the tooth). So, actually, you will feel pain and discomfort frequently. I suggest you reach a dentist as soon as possible but you can take analgesics to subside the pain temporarily. You can take Acetominaphen tablet 200 mg one tablet twice a day for five days. Also, if you could place small cotton with a little clove oil, it will be very helpful. You can apply the piece of cotton with clove oil inside the cavity of the canine 3 to 4 times frequently or you can use this technique at the time you feel pain.  Bacterial infection. Acute pulpitis.

Now she is 10 months old.","Doctor":"Hi. This condition is more of pediatric cardiology rather than adult cardiology. However, I think that if the stenosis is minimal then it should only be observed at this stage with regular yearly echos. If the stenosis progresses and become of severe degree, then this can be managed with means of balloon dilatation in the first instance in young age group and only if this fails, then she can have surgery.

However, it is important to control the sizes of your food portions. I recommend that you use a measuring cup of whatever size you want. Use this same cup to measure your food at every meal. Start your meal by eating one full cucumber. Then you can eat your meal which should have one cup of rice or grain and three cups of vegetables (all measured in the same cup). Finish your meal with 250 ml of thin buttermilk. You should make sure that you eat all this in one meal. If you think it is too much to eat, reduce the size of the cup.

Treatment of it is mostly according to the cause. Another treatment is symptomatic. Loratadine is antihistaminic and antiallergic medicine. In your case of itching with hives, you can take Desloratadine with Montelukast (Dazit M) or Fexofenadine with Montelukast (Allegra M). But to search for the cause of itching with hives will be more beneficial."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The last year my skin complexion changed on my hand and then it spread up to my elbow.

My worry here is that you may have a Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) and you need an urgent orthopedic opinion to help rule this out. The reason I say so is that the pain and limp from the hip in an adolescent has only a few causes one of which is SCFE. The other cause is an infection and it is equally important. I hope you ask your parents to arrange a visit to an orthopaedician for physical examination at the earliest. This will certainly help, as a full examination of the hip and x-rays and blood reports will help clear any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a burning sensation on top of my head.

The second important thing is that whenever you feel your mother is disturbing, you need to take a break for 15 minutes, go out to an open place and take deep breaths for 5-7 minutes and avoid thinking about your mother and continue study at that time. This will help you to vent your feelings out.

I was 13 years old when I got my braces. My orthodontist made it in such a way that the lower set of teeth were slanting inwards so that my upper row could be in front. I do not have trouble chewing. I want a jaw setback surgery as I find my face structure very unappealing. I do experience stiffness when I open my jaw, even while yawning. I wanted to ask what the surgery actually does, take out bone segments or just push the whole lower jaw back? And what is the risk involved? I have heard that it can damage nerves and cause permanent loss of sensation. Also, is it possible to do nose plastic surgery along with the jaw surgery? I want both the surgeries in one go. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, you can undergo surgery to reduce the lower jaw, i.e., mandible by around 5 mm or so if needed. It is only a slight difference. The advantage is a slight increase in aesthetics later on probably. Some disadvantage is always present like you said, i.e., nerve damage like permanent anesthesia of partial parts of cheek, teeth, and lips or sometimes disfigurement. But the surgery can be done without much external scarring. The surgical procedure includes removing around 2 to 3 mm of bone from mandible on both left and right sides and push the mandible slightly back. It is done by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon involving plastic surgeons too. You can do rhinoplasty or nasal bone correction to straighten the surface and give a sharper look. This procedure is done by plastic surgeons mostly. The main thing is to decide whether correcting the aesthetics would provide you with the perfect look which you desire. Ask your doctor to show a photo of yours with the modified look, so that you can decide on your own whether it is worth to undergo surgery. After seeing the attached photos of your facial profile, according to my personal opinion, I would say that your profile is acceptable as it is. (attachment removed to protect patient identity) Also get an opinion from a plastic surgeon whether the surgery would be fruitful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need you to please analyze my lipid profile and liver test where I can see that a few numbers are at a very high end.

Rosuvastatin may cause the liver function to derange. Since how long are you taking Rosuvastatin or any other lipid-lowering medicine? If the liver function was normal before starting Rosuvastatin and deranged after taking it, I will advise you to continue taking it and re-monitor LFTs (liver function test) after two months.

Your ECG is showing changes (attachment removed to protect patient identity) which indicate some kind of heart damage either ischemia, hypertension induced or other. You mentioned here about angiography and it is showing only 30 percent blockages. So have you undergone echocardiography to rule out other causes? If not, you should undergo. Next thing, you mentioned about shortness of breath, which can occur due to heart dysfunction which can be seen on echo or may be due to low hemoglobin. Were you smoked in your life? It can cause lung damage and shortness of breath. Also, regarding shoulder and body pain, this commonly occurs due to low vitamin D and cervical spine problem. Do you also have neck pain, tingling, numbness in arms, which may be due to cervical spine problem? You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high-calorie diet.

Enamel was removed to make room for the composite resin and the enamel is now too thin and feels sharp to the tongue's touch because of this. Shape and feel is not consistent with the natural front right tooth. Is there any way to fix this? Want to be as conservative as possible to avoid further damage.","Doctor":"Hi. According to your query, I believe it will be easy to solve that problem you have, just a little bit of enamel sharpness or roughness can usually come from a previous bonded composite filling done especially at anterior teeth. So at that time, you should go to a cosmetic dentist or expert. He will do for you abrasive smoothness by composite finishing burs to get the same consistency and then you will feel comfortable or he will go for changing the old filling to get a new one. Do not be afraid about further damage of your teeth. A doctor can do what is must to do for you to restore the aesthetics and function of your tooth. It would be good if you could attach an image of your tooth here to get further details of your question."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an epileptic patient and currently on Lamictal 200 mg twice a day. I am planning for pregnancy. I would like to know the dosage of Folic acid I should start.","Doctor":"Hi. I suggest you tablet Folvite 5 mg of Folic acid one tablet per day. The recommended dose of folic acid is a controversial topic. Various doctors favor 1 mg to 5 mg per day. The best part is that the Folic acid has no side effects. It is a water-soluble vitamin and an excess of it gets excreted in urine. So, we recommend 5 mg per day to all our patients. When sufficient dose is harmless, there is no need to take a chance by giving low doses. One more concern of mine is that you have to check with your neurologist if it is safe to go ahead with pregnancy while on Lamictal (Lamotrigine). The safety of Lamictal is not established by studies. But, if your physician has good experience with personal case series, then I think you can continue.

My doctor checked my HbA1c a year back and found it 4.2. Recently, I was facing little dryness in my mouth and that is why drinking more water too. Also facing some little burn in my feet. Other things are fine till now. Is there any probability that I got diabetes by this time? Should I go for another test?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Your HbA1c report is in the normal range, you do not have diabetes. If your test was done in a reliable laboratory, there is absolutely no need to repeat this. The dryness of mouth can occur due to dehydration. So I recommend that you drink at least 2 to 3 liters of water daily. Burning sensation in the feet can be due to vitamin B12 deficiency. You can get your vitamin B12 level checked by a blood test done early in the morning after 12-hour fasting. That means, if you are going for your test at 8 AM, you should have finished your last meal at 8 PM the previous night."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am concerned about sores in the mouth with a tooth pain.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. The multiple sores you referred to surrounding your back tooth are the sinuses from the periapical infection (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This occurs when there is infected pulp tissue (inner part of the tooth) and there occurs pus formation at the bottom of the root of the tooth. Now when this pus gets more and more formed, it tries to push the surrounding tissue to come out of the tissue. This leads to the formation of the sinus. It is characterized by sore mouth taste frequently and also if the infection is acute, there may be a pain in the tooth. Here the filling you have in the tooth might be the cause of the infection as sometimes the fillings when old and not routinely checked to develop cracks (especially amalgam or silver metal fillings) which lead to the entry of microorganisms into the inner tissue of tooth leading to pus formation. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist and get an X-ray for the tooth. The tooth may require a root canal treatment (confirmed on the X-ray). Meanwhile, you may take an analgesic for the pain and an antibiotic for the infection for three days. If you were not allergic to these medicines, I would suggest you take Aceclofenac 100 mg when there is a pain in the tooth, and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanate 625 mg two times daily for three days and then visit a dentist. Also, maintain the good oral hygiene by brushing, flossing and using oral rinses regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from total depression and anxiety.

As far as your relationship is concerned, you both need marital counseling to resolve conflicts advising at one side would not be beneficial, and most importantly, start admiring him for everything, for his dressing, his smile and, whatever he is doing for you, and appreciate him for being husband and reduce your expectation at this point of time and it may work in a way that he may be there for you, which you are expecting."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My dad is having a persistent BP of 150/95 even after taking Telma 40 in the morning and Cilacar 20 in the evening.

There could be conservative, medical and surgical management. In conservative, you can wait for nature to take a step for miscarriage and can have a natural process of miscarriage but might need medical or surgical management. Medical management needs to treat with medicine that stimulates cleaning of the uterus but might need surgery. In surgical management, evacuation is done actually but might need medical treatment for that. In case of severe bleeding or pain, you need to report to the tertiary care center.

Well, most of your symptoms do look like related to the nerves only as the feeling of tingling and numbness can be related to that. I have gone through your older reports as well (attachment removed to protect patient identity), where there is a mild spasm of the spine. But since it is affecting your hands, and face it probably looks like coming from the neck region this time. You can get an x-ray done as and when you get time but will guide you with the following lifestyle changes as well. You can continue Pregabalin for 15 days to 30 days at least. If you feel the relief is not adequate, you can increase the dose to twice daily for seven days. Include vitamin D along with Pregabalin as well to strengthen your bones. As for the postures: 1. Make sure you are not sitting in front of the laptop for too long with head bent forward. It should be at a good height so it does not strain your neck too much. 2.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I had an anal fissure a few months back due to constipation and it got healed with medication. For a week, I have constipation due to the change in my diet and lack of water intake. Whenever I had a bowel movement, I would get some prickly sensation in the anal area and itching. Two days back, I saw some blood and very tiny blood clots in stool. I took the same medicine, which was prescribed for anal fissure. My doctor told me to take the same whenever I had a fissure again. I have been taking that medicine for the past days and I did not see any blood or blood clot in the stool. The stool appears normal in texture and color. But still, when I pass motion, I feel a little swelling, slight pricking and itching in the anal area. Today, I read something called colorectal cancer or tumor. It has confused me. Many links say that the blood in the stool is the first symptom, there is a lot of bleeding and sometime bleeding cannot even be seen with the naked eye. Which is the truth? If the bleeding cannot be seen does it mean I still have a tumor or cancer in the rectal area? They also added up a lot of other symptoms like weakness, etc. I do not feel any of that. Apart from this, I am extremely healthy. I do not smoke or drink. My exercise includes yoga and dance. There is no history of cancer in my family as well. I am scared after reading that. I think even my normal appearing stool could have blood in it and there could be a tumor. I feel there is a little swelling or obstruction in the rectal area. I would like to go for colonoscopy. Will they do a colonoscopy to the patient of my age? I want to know whether my doubts are correct. Do my symptoms mean cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms of constipation associated with pricking pain and itching in the anal area as well as blood in stools lead to a unified diagnosis of anal fissure. An anal fissure is a small tear or crack in the lining of the anus. It may occur when passing large or hard stools or experiencing bouts of diarrhea. It can cause sharp pain and bleeding during and after bowel movements. It may also cause itching and burning in the anal area. It is usually a minor condition that goes away within six weeks. Its symptoms include a visible tear in the skin around the anus, a skin tag or a small lump of skin next to the tear, pain in the anal area during bowel movements, streaks of blood on stools or after wiping and burning or itching in the anal area. Please do not panic and get anxious. Colorectal carcinomas occur in later ages. Do you have any family history of the same or any polyps or any gastrointestinal complaints? In malignancy the symptoms are continuous and not episodic as in your case. Also, it will not subside by their own or respond to the treatment prescribed to you. In carcinomas, it is usually associated with iron deficiency anemia, weight loss, maroon colored and narrow stools. Still, if you have any iota of doubt, then go to your treating doctor and get your anal fissure re-examined. As per my view, you do not need any colonoscopy unless you have any positive family history or the above mentioned symptoms.

Now I have some kind of fears, I am afraid when my heartbreaking arises, I am afraid of eating different foods (fear of intoxication), I am afraid of staying alone, etc. Too many fears in my life.

It is good that you have improved only on psychological therapy but then whatever has been taught in psychological therapy, you need to continuously practice it at home. Please look up Jacobson's progressive muscular relaxation and practice it 3 to 4 times a day. This exercise will significantly help you gain some control over the somatic symptoms of your anxiety. As far as medicines are concerned, Valium is a medicine which will relieve anxiety to some extent but will make you feel sleepy. If you have been experiencing anxiety episodes every single day or at least 3 to 4 times a week, I would advise you to take Paxil 12.5 mg in the morning and gradually consult a psychiatrist to alter the dosages. But if you have been experiencing anxiety only in specific social situations and require medication only to suppress the anxiety for the time being without feeling sleepy, I would advise you to take tablet Etizola SOS."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Do you mean to say that you had secretions from the vagina before attempting intercourse in the past but, you are not having that in recent time? If yes, it indicates that you are not devoting sufficient time for foreplay (activities before intercourse like kissing, fondling, caressing). Foreplay is essential to get aroused and have secretions. Proper secretion does not occur many times when one or both of you are not interested in sex but, to please the other partner you carry out sexual activity. In conclusion, having proper intimacy and time devoted to sexual activity is important to get secretions from the vagina. Once you lose that intimacy, getting aroused becomes difficult and extra effort is needed from both partners. In my opinion, this is not a health issue but a relationship issue. Your feeling that the vagina is very tight again points out that there is a lack of proper lubrication. I would like to inform you that despite being small, a vagina can accommodate any size of a male penis. It is because of the fact that vagina is surrounded by soft tissue which has great stretchability. I hope you are taking treatment for PCOD although, there is nothing to do with sexual pleasure and PCOD."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have had an ovarian cyst in the past but this does not feel the same.","Doctor":"Hi. This is called primary dysmenorrhea. It can start anytime within five years of the beginning of periods in girls. Do not worry. It is a benign condition but definitely painful. I would advice start taking tablet Naproxen 250 mg twice daily with meal two days before your expected periods and take 500 mg twice daily on the day of the start of the cycle. You can continue for 2 to 3 days even after starting cycles if needed. This will help in preventing pain.

Today and yesterday my anxiety has begun to surface more. The first two and a half weeks I was great. I do not know if I should switch medication. Keep going with it or what? Is it possible for my anxiety to get worse around week three?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety in the past two days in spite of being on medications. Has some stressful event taken place at your workplace or at home in these past two to three days? Generally, anxiety gets better with time with medications. If Paxil has helped you, it would not make any sense to switch the medicines abruptly. Instead, you can consider augmenting it. Along with Paxil, you can take tablet Etizolam 0.5 mg SOS as and when you feel very anxious. So Paxil can take care of the long-term anxiety and Etizola will help you in the short term. Along with medications, also look up Jacobson's progressive muscular relaxation exercises. It takes 20 to 30 seconds to do this exercise. If you do these exercises 3 to 4 times a day, it will help you gain significant control over your anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have issues with my breath even after washing my teeth.","Doctor":"Hello.

Make sure to reach the gum line as well as tooth surfaces, floss at least once a day, rinse with mouthwash twice a day. Take care of your digestion.

Your SGOT is slightly elevated. Your lipid profile is also showing elevated total triglycerides and cholesterol levels. All these are suggestive of obesity and treatment is weight reduction and lipid-lowering drug (Rosuvastatin 10 mg once a day at night before going to sleep) for two months.

There is a high HbA1c level which is 11.8 and shows poor control of blood sugar level. BMI is 26.8 which shows that there is a trend towards obesity. Although she is overweight at present as per BMI. There is high blood cholesterol, total cholesterol as well as LDL cholesterol. These are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. There is a good thing that other laboratory tests are normal. There is no microalbuminuria. GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is normal. Full blood count and renal function tests are normal. Management of the patient includes diet and lifestyle modification. Regular brisk walk at least 30 minutes a day. She should be on Insulin at least twice a day (mixed NPH and regular like premixed NPH/regular 70%/30%).

Can this also be done under local or epidural instead, as I am having anxiety about the general method? Am I overreacting, maybe to a common method? Currently, I am taking Flomax once a day.","Doctor":"Hi. Regarding the type of anesthesia for circumcision and cystoscopy, it can be done under local anesthesia or spinal or epidural anesthesia or general anesthesia. Local has the following benefits of no risk related to anesthesia. The drawback is some discomfort but usually tolerable in a cooperative patient.  Spinal or epidural has the benefit of good analgesia, post-operative pain control for a few hours, reasonable safety. The drawback is may need to stay in the hospital longer to avoid a post-spinal headache. For cardiac patients not so safe. General anesthesia, the benefit is it can be tailored to a short procedure. Relatively safe in cardiac patients. The drawback is higher cost, inherent risk for short neck or asthmatic patients. So anesthesia has to be tailored or individualized after discussion with your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, What are the ramifications if you lose 20 pounds with new dental implants? I have lost seven pounds since this month. Also, having immediate dentures over implants, my dentist gave me a water pik and said it is fine to leave the immediate dentures in for a month while my extraction area is healing. I am worried that it is too long and infection could set in. Lastly, she also said having a few drinks was fine. Is it so? They are mini implants I had put in (six of them) with new immediate upper dentures.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. Regarding weight loss with respect to the dental Implants, I do not see any reason from your query that could lead to the weight loss. Dental implants do not lead to weight loss. However, what I could comprehend from your query is that you have been too much thinking about the weight loss due to implants which has set in the anxiety complex in you. Anxiety might be a cause of weight loss. And in response for the immediate dentures, yes they can be kept for weeks and if kept clean for even some months. Immediate dentures are fabricated in such a way that they enable the healing of the extraction site and will not lead to any discrepancies during the fabrication of the implants. They protect and preserve the bone where the implants are to be inserted. Regarding infection to the extraction site, there should not be any infection as long as you keep the mouth hygiene good and clean regularly as advised by your dentist. If you feel any pain or discomfort, then you can approach your dentist for the same. However, that is unlikely if you maintain good oral hygiene. Also, the alcohol or drinks as you call, if you have done your extraction within a week, I would advise you not having an alcoholic drink but if the extraction is done past a week, then I can allow you for a drink or two but not too much as the extraction site would not have healed properly and could lead to the insult of the injury causing pain and discomfort. However, I guess your dentist has done a good job as I can understand from your query. I would just say that you follow your dentist’s advice and visit her on the scheduled date."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been a high BP and sinus bradycardia (heart rate of 52) patient for the last four years.

If he is putting too much pressure on himself, it can lead to significant stress and affect his ability to do well in exams. Remind him that though exams are important, it is not a life or death situation. Continue to encourage and support him to do well but also tactfully advise him that there are multiple career options available. This can help him to relax and eventually help him to do better. It is good to know that he is eating and sleeping well. Encourage him to do atleast 30 minutes exercise or physical play daily. It is time well spent, it will sharpen his memory and reduce his stress levels. If stress continues to increase, it can lead on to depression, anxiety and related emotional and behavioural problems. Do not let exams to take over the family all the time. Have fun whenever possible. Remember a relaxed mind performs better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have minor beta thalassemia which I got from my mother, but unlike her (asymptomatic), I have anemia symptoms like paleness, shortness of breath after the least effort, feeling tired all the time, broken nails and I want to know if it could be due to lack of iron? Could people with minor beta thalassemia also get iron deficiency anemia? Knowing that I get heavy cycles and my diet is very poor.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. Yes, your symptoms point towards iron deficiency anemia. In beta thalassemia minor patient usually feels more fatigue on exertion as compared to normal people without thalassemia. However do not worry regarding thalassemia minor, they can live a normal life. Thalassemia people can develop iron deficiency anemia secondarily. So rule it out by CBC profile with blood indices as well. You can revert back with reports so that I can guide you further."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from headache for the last 20 years. Initially, I used to take Saridon tablets to get relief from headache and it has given results for some time. After a few years, one of the doctors advised me to do pranayama (breathing exercise) and it has given good results. My frequency of headache has come down drastically once in three months or so. Whenever this headache occurs, some red rashes will appear on my forehead, especially in the center of my forehead and will disappear after two or three days. I could not understand the reason for the rashes. When I touch the rash, I do feel some pain. Recently, I consulted a neurologist and he said that it is migraine headache and the tablet Dolo 650 has to be used whenever headache starts. If headache appears twice in a month, then I should use Sibelium 10 mg (Flunarizine). He also said that this headache will be there till the age of 55 years and I am 43 now. My mother also gets headache for the last 40 years. Please clarify the reason my rashes during headache. Also, can I Dolo 650 for headache?","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns.  First of all, I like to inform you that the rash over the forehead is a part of migraine headache and disappears within 72 hours. In other words, a typical migraine track never goes beyond 72 hours and the same is applicable for rashes associated with it. Although the exact pathology is not known, it has been speculated that the rashes appear due to immune system dysregulation. Yes, Dolo 650 mg (Acetaminophen) is able to treat the migraine. This is indicated that the frequency of migraine is very low for around one or two times in a month. In case there is more frequency, then you may need regular treatment.

Before starting, I was diagnosed with folate deficiency and prescribed six months of folic acid tablets. However, my oncologist was not happy with me taking it during chemotherapy so I had to stop after one month. I have now finished chemotherapy and I still have a very sore red tongue and no texture to my tongue or roof of the mouth. I cannot use any toothpaste or eat anything with any strong flavor without an extremely sore tongue. I also have fatigue, shortness of breath, resting heart rate of 90 to 100 and also have angular cheilitis. I asked my general physician to re-test my hematinics. Now I have finished chemotherapy three weeks ago as I am keen to start taking supplements to help my body recover and because I am symptomatic of a deficiency of folate and/or B12? Bizarrely, my results say my folate is now 6, hemoglobin is pretty good at 11 but my B12 is 2000. How can this be? It was 500 when they tested me some months ago and told me I had low folate level. I was symptomatic with sore red tongue and loss of texture with tongue sensation. My GP does not understand and is going to ask my oncologist. I am not sure it is his area and I do not want to be fobbed off without it being properly investigated. Do you have any idea what might cause this? I have started FEC chemo four months back and had four rounds of Docetaxel. I was on Fragmin, Rivaroxaban until for PE prevention of recurrence but had to go on to Fragmin during chemo.","Doctor":"Hello. The folic acid tablets that you had taken for a month helped to raise your folate levels from 4 to 6. The high level of vitamin B12 can only be explained if you were given a single megadose of vitamin as an intramuscular injection during your chemotherapy. Folate levels of 6 are still low and are responsible for angular stomatitis and sore tongue.

The latest one came after 50 days and started with 5 days spotting followed by light flow which is going on for 6th day now and has not stopped. My periods have been regular so far, 30 days cycle and lasts for 3 days with 2nd day heaviest. But, since the last 2 cycles there has not been a heavy day. I have a history of systemic lupus erythematosus since age 14 and now am 31. Recently for acidity I was on Rabeprazole for close to 3 months.","Doctor":"Hello. I understood that your menses have been regular so far and it is just since last 2 months that you have been experiencing delayed menses and metrorrhagia (abnormal bleeding). It seems unlikely that there is a sudden hormonal deficiency. But, likely stress induced hormonal imbalance and late estrogenization has probably occurred. Date should not be a concern here in the delay as the pattern had been regular till last 2 cycles. The delay can also possibly be due to hyperprolactinemia or recent onset hypothyroidism as well. Hence, I would advise you to get a thyroid profile and serum prolactin levels done as well. However, if the bleeding does not stop in next few days then you can consider opting for Progesterone pills like Meprate (Medroxyprogesterone) 10 mg once a day for next 15 days. This shall not just help control bleeding but also regulate it for this cycle. Observe the pattern for next 2 cycles and try to keep the stress levels low in next cycles.

Then went away. About weeks later started hurting again but nothing too bad. I just dealt with it. Now, again I have severe pain. I went to ER, said it was abscessed tooth and gave me Amoxicillin. The pain was still very bad so went back to the doctor. Three days later they prescribed me Clindamycin. Started taking them this morning. The pain is very bad and now my face is starting to get swollen. My whole face hurts, hurts to talk or really do anything. Should I go back to the ER or wait and see if this new antibiotic works? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question and I can understand your concern. I think you are having an acute periapical infection with involvement of buccal and mandibular space infection.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

My parents brought it up to my dentist about two months after it started but without looking at my jaw or even asking me about it they said it is growing pain and they will not worry about it unless I still have it when I am little older but I am also getting way more headaches than I used to and sometimes the pain is so severe it makes me cry. Sometimes, it is getting way worse to the point where I suddenly have to stop talking sometimes because my jaw locks in place. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Lock jaw, clicking sound are one of the classic symptoms of TMJ disorders. TMJ stands for temperomandibular joint which is the joint that moves the mandible up, down and sideways. If there is a lack of cushion effect, the mandible head slides through the other bone surface giving this kind of sounds and pain. It cannot be a growing thing. If this continues, it might lead to loss of bone in the joint or even fracture at some point. Addressing at an early stage can be of massive help. You should be given a custom fabricated mouth guard to be worn daily specially during night times. This mouth guard is a flexible one which can be used easily by yourself and maintained clean. This is the initial treatment approach in such a scenario. You will definitely see a huge difference in 3 to 6 months. I request you to visit the dentist again and stress in your complaint so that the right treatment approach is given to you. TMJ X-ray.

I have done home pregnancy test five times and beta hCG, all were negative. What can be the reason for my delay in periods? Plus my weight is 96 kg and I have PCOD and am obese. What can be the reason for delayed menstruation?","Doctor":"Hi. PCOD is a condition where ovary causes multiple cysts which makes menses irregular and obesity itself increases the condition. So, only Meprate will not solve the problem, you should get an LH and FSH test done and please send me your sonography report. Meanwhile, I would suggest you reduce your weight by physical exercise. In this condition, the patient may have acne and abnormal hair over their body like over jaw area, etc., and the delaying menses which will cause amenorrhea is due to your PCOD.

I do not have feelings like others. I do not feel empathy but can be empathetic on cue as I know the social cues. And I prefer to keep to myself. Can you please advise where I can be diagnosed? I have always thought it was anxiety as this has been a problem in the past. I realize I have never been in love and probably do not know what it really is. I have five kids and saw them all taking birth but I never felt joy or real happiness when they were born even though I knew I should be happy. I am taking Lexam 20 for anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi. With the limited information you have provided, it is difficult to give an accurate opinion. It is possible you are describing some features of autism spectrum traits or Asperger syndrome which can manifest as social communication difficulties and anxiety. It is not uncommon and the majority do not even know they have autism spectrum traits. But whether you actually have enough features to reach the diagnostic threshold can only be confirmed after a detailed assessment. Usually, people with autism spectrum traits would have displayed symptoms from their childhood and would have faced peer relationship difficulties at school. Check with your parents and siblings. Also, these traits can run in families. If your social difficulties and anxiety developed later on in life, it is unlikely to be due to an underlying neuro-developmental condition like autism spectrum condition. If you actually want to know whether you have the condition, speak to your local GP or family doctor about a referral to appropriate local specialist services."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past three days, I have had severe tooth pain and swelling.

The good thing is with appropriate support your anxiety will come down eventually and you can function normally. Nexito (Escitalopram) is a good medication for your condition. It is positive that you are feeling better now. I see that you are prescribed Nexito Forte (which contains Clonazepam in addition to Escitalopram).  I will recommend discussing with your family doctor and switch from Nexito Forte to Nexito (Clonazepam is not recommended for long-term use). Nexito 10 mg once daily can be continued at least for a year after your anxiety comes down and you are feeling better. Then it can be gradually cut down. I will recommend having some psychological therapy or counseling to deal with factors contributing to your anxiety and help manage family problems and stress at work.

The peptic ulcer can lead to minor bleeding in the intestinal tract and so anemia can develop due to it. For ulcer healing, Rabeprazole like antacid can be prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks. Stool routine micro examination and occult blood test are done to rule out parasitic infestation and minor bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. Your CBC and iron profile are suggestive towards iron deficiency for which Orofer XT like Ferrous ascorbate containing medication can be prescribed for two to three months. For high B12 level, you can investigate further with SGOT, SGPT, urea, creatinine estimation to rule out liver and kidney disease. In these diseases, excretion of B12 is affected and so level can be high. The other cause for high B12 is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. For that, you can investigate with full CBC and peripheral smear examination report to check if any abnormal cells are present or not.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

In more than 50 % of cases, the cause is unknown. The rest of the patients it can be due to any infection anywhere in body or thyroid problems or diabetes, etc. I suggest you get the following tests done. CBC with ESR, S.TSH, S.T3, S.T4.

Is it normal to have such a high fever in throat infection? Could it be dengue?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is certainly possible to have such a fever and it is likely she has an upper respiratory tract infection. I think whatever she is receiving is fine. Antibiotics will take at least 48 hours to act and initially, the infection is viral. So, antibiotics may not work for the initial two to three days. I think she should continue the same treatment.

I do understand that when we want our periods to be earlier rather than later. But unfortunately delaying cycles is usually better. If you have 28 days cycles then this month your cycles will start on the expected date. But, if you have 30 or more days cycles I will suggest starting tablet Meprate (Progestin) 10 mg twice daily from two days before the expected date till the day you do not want your periods.

Taking 10 mg, after about 20 days, I felt good again. Then it stopped working after about two weeks. My GP raised the dose to 20 mg. Today is a full week without much improvement. How long should I wait to see if 20 mg will kick in for me? I am also taking Metoprolol.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, try to stay calm because it is your third episode and medications take time to act. If you have come out of your illness twice before then this time too you will come out of your illness. Do not lose patience. As you have mentioned you are taking third time this medication. So this is your third episode. Lexapro is an antidepressant SSRI (Escitalopram). It generally takes 14 days to start the action. As you have mentioned you are taking it for the past two months and you started feeling good so you should wait for another one week for this medication to act before switching to another medication or adding a medication with it. Since it is working for you because you did feel good after taking the medication, so I would suggest you take the medication for one more week minimum to experience the effect. I would like to know more about your past episodes and which drugs were prescribed to you for it? Were you prescribed the same drug in all the episodes you had? Did you improve on the same drug? What symptoms are you experiencing right now? What is bothering you the most? Have you ever gone for psychotherapy in the past?  I think along with drugs you should also go for psychotherapy- Cognitive behavioral therapy will be the best for you along with medication. It will hasten your recovery. Briefing about your previous episodes will let me know better about your past illness and medication and can give you a better outlook on your query."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A pregnant woman aged 24 years with running the 36th week of the gestation period, undergone ultrasound given a report of looped nuchal cord around the neck twice.

The complication could be at labor, at contractions or during Braxton Hicks contractions. Have a strict check on fetal movements and do have recurrent fetal electronic monitoring. In case of reduced fetal monitoring, you need to evaluate electronic fetal monitoring. During labor also this could be stressed labor as cord around the neck that can press neck and can cause compression and reduced fetal hearts. During labor, you need strict and continuous monitoring. In case of abnormal graph during labor, you need to be evaluated by a senior gynecologist and to decide for delivery.

I have bloating after meals for about 15 minutes after which it passes away. I can eat normally, but some times I feel bloated and cannot eat. I keep burping like once in 20 minutes. Is that normal? And also bloating increases when I have anxiety. I am taking Sompraz L (Esomeprazole 40 mg and Levosulpiride 75 mg) once in an empty stomach daily. Whenever I try to leave the medicine I have gas and acidity on the second day. I also take alcohol like 90 ml regularly for three years. There is no pain or anything but only burping and bloating. I wonder is it just anxiety or something serious? I am also very much afraid to visit a doctor least they prescribe endoscopy. I am 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 78 kg. I had an ultrasound about one and a half years ago and it was normal. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, the burping while having meals, or just after the meals is a normal phenomenon. And I assure you it is not alarming in your case. However, it may cause trouble if gas trapped excessively and result in belly swelling. The reason behind this excessive bloating in your case may be aerophagia (engulfing air while taking meals that commonly occur in one who keeps speaking while having bolus) can be due to supragastric belching and may be due to excessive gas production after meals. The last group of people in medical science are termed as bloater, some are early bloaters where bloating occurs within 15 minutes of meal and some are late bloaters where bloating occurs after two hours of meal. This whole explanation is just to make you understand your own condition well. You seem to be late bloater and cause seems to be excessive gas production plus aerophagia. I want you to take a three-week course of antibiotics to reduce the excessive gas production within your bowel. The antibiotic is safe without any side effects except in some may cause diarrhea of mild intensity. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). Tablet Rifxamin 200 mg thrice daily for three weeks and then stop, tablet Digestine (Metaclopramide) 40 mg half an hour before meals for one week and then as per need. You can stop Sompraz L, as Tab Digestine will work in more effective way than this."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got one of my wisdom teeth taken out a week back.

What should I do about the giant hole? It hurts a lot. My breathe stinks and taste is bad as well.","Doctor":"Hello. If it hurts a lot, it means that you have a dry socket condition, where the blood clot gets dislodged from the wound causing infection. You need to start taking antibiotics like Augmentin 625 mg and a painkiller. Also, use warm salt water gargling three times a day. Do not touch the area. And wait it out till you can see a dentist nearby. In such condition it takes time for full healing of the area, thus you have to be patient, get the wound cleaned and debrided by your dentist as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Masturbation is stoppable or not?

Masturbation is a completely normal physiological phenomenon (like eating and sleeping). Almost everyone does it, even married people continue to do it.

Six months back, I went to the doctor, and I was prescribed Ciprofloxacin HCl (Hydrochloride) for a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection). I took the antibiotic for 7 days. I am taking an oral contraceptive, and I am sexually active. During the week I was taking the antibiotic, I had unprotected sex once. The following week, I started my period as usual. I started a new pack of my birth control pills on after my periods. I forgot to take the pill on the eight-day, so I took two on the next day. I have not missed a pill or taken it late since then. There has been an increase in vaginal discharge for about 3 days. At first, there was no color to it, but yesterday, I noticed that there was a pink tint to it, and it is still present today. Everything that I have looked at online says it could be a sign of early pregnancy. What is your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello. In my opinion, if you have had your period this month on time, and you have been on oral contraceptive (birth control) pills, then you are not pregnant at all. Sometimes, spotting continues longer with discharge in the initial days of the cycle because, during the previous proliferative phase, there can be left over endometrium, which is shed after that when you have your period. By \\"proliferative\\" I am referring to growth. During the second part of your menstrual cycle, hormones which your body produce naturally cause growth to occur in the lining of the uterus also called the endometrium. Oral contraceptive pills usually cause a reduction in bleeding and some cases, may cause spotting. So, please do not worry; it is not pregnancy. This spotting should stop. Continue the pills you are taking, as prescribed. One missed pill is not the cause, as you correctly took two the next day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Two years back, I had a left PICA Aneurysm (Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery), for which it was coiled. Since then, I am taking tablet Levipil. Right now, I am taking tablet Levera XR 750 mg once daily. Sometimes, when I sit for a long time that too only when I use the Indian style toilet and sit for a long time like 15 minutes, I feel dizziness as if I was going to fall. This feeling will be there only for about 5 seconds, and after that, I will be normal. When I go out in the sun and come back, I feel the same. Is it due to the tablet or any other reason? I am very much worried about that.","Doctor":"Hi. Dizziness that you are having is a very normal phenomenon, which occurs in a large number of normal individuals. It may happen while standing from sitting position, because of a relatively low cerebral perfusion (blood supply to the brain) for a few seconds. It is during these few seconds when autonomic nervous system adapts itself to bring the cerebral perfusion pressure to normal. It is in those few seconds that such a feeling of dizziness occurs. Coming from sunlight to indoor may cause a similar physiological phenomenon and hence the dizziness. So, keep yourself hydrated well. Drink at least 3 to 4 liters of fluids per day, and these symptoms should improve. Clinically, tablet Levera (Levetiracetam) does not cause such effects. It is just a theoretically listed side effect, but not observed clinically. This tablet is not causing it. This is the safest antiepileptic drug. Please do not worry and continue the same treatment. It is a normal phenomenon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I am on my first day of Deviry, when can I expect my period and will I ovulate in this cycle?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. You are absolutely correct that stoppage of pill causes mid-cycle spotting. Why are you taking birth control if you are trying to conceive? Now coming to your question. The dose of Deviry (Medroxyprogesterone) is 10 mg, twice a day for five days. You only need to take 10 tablets and your period will start about two to seven days after taking the last tablet.

Ovulation symptoms that can help you plan intercourse during those fertile days are cervical mucus changes, heightened sense of smell, breast soreness or tenderness, mild pelvic, or lower abdominal pain, light spotting or discharge, libido changes, and changes in the cervix.

After checking your drug history I would advise you to take antibiotics Metronidazole 400 mg three times daily for three days and also analgesic Aceclofenac 100 mg (Zerodol MR) when you have any pain (if you are not allergic to any of these). Also use Hydrogen Peroxide 0.1 % mouthwash diluted in water (1:1) three times daily for five days.

Had a mask on then took it off while I cleaned up 5 to 10 inhaling residual fumes. However, the mask was old. I know I should not have done it inside. Can this cause any health issues? Ran an air cleaner that helped take care of the smell. Now, most importantly my 15 months old granddaughter came to stay four days later. She never went to the basement. We try to keep the basement door closed. Could she have any health issues near or long term? It is really worrying me.","Doctor":"Hi. The paints usually have toxic chemicals, which on long-term continuous inhalation (more than one month) definitely can accumulate sufficiently in lung and body, to produce the toxic effect. This can happen for the painting professionals without proper precautions. In your case, it is the single time (few hours) exposure. This can produce local irritation on eyes, nose, lungs, and skin. The symptoms are skin itching, burning sensation of eyes, headache, increased secretions from eyes and nose, cough, sometimes wheezing in susceptible cases. There are no possibilities for any other bad effects. That too these effects usually start within 30 minutes to one hour of exposure and last only for one day. Once we breath normal air, there is proper ventilation in the lungs, these paint chemicals from lungs would be washed out. After one day, you will be safe and can forget about this. My suggestion is to open windows and run exhauster fans to expel the smell (indicates the chemicals) of paint from the room. More ventilation, more washout. Three days it may take to completely remove the smell from the room. After that, you can allow the kid in the room. If the paint smell is there, do not allow the child to smell it. It will produce the above mentioned bad effects for her also. In case, if the kid is exposed into the room before complete washing out, no issues. Bring the child out, wash the face, eyes and nose with water. Keep baby in an open air space for 30 minutes. In a few new fresh breathing, the toxic chemicals from the lung get washed away. Usually, after painting, we need to pass new air to wash out the chemicals in the air. For a few days. If not, some other when we enter the room, we will be the victim."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Can you please give the diagnosis of the uploaded MRI brain and CSF studies with a detailed report?

Also, my treating neurologist wanted an opinion on the following. Are there signs of NPH? But do the findings of brain atrophy, ventriculomegaly, hyperdynamic CSF flows suggest of idiopathic hydrocephalus and are some intervention required?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com. The findings in the report and the images are matching and acceptable (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The term NPH is usually applied in cases where there is abnormal CSF hyperdynamic circulation with gait problems or without gait problems if incontinence is there. Confirming NPH without typical features is difficult in your case. There are controversies regarding NPH and CSF hyperdynamic values and different researchers have come to variable conclusions. Since gait problems are most common in NPH, therefore, most researches have mentioned the importance of gait problems when confirming NPH or incontinence if gait problem is not there. Treatment with shunting might help only when NPH is confirmed. If there is no NPH then the diagnosis is likely due to neurodegenerative disorders and the symptoms can be treated by medicines. There are many different and complicated types of neurodegenerative disorders and a clinical emphasis is more important than only MRI findings when confirming a condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had braces years ago due to my bite being the wrong way round. I then have had retainers to wear at night for a few years. I think the retainers are giving me ulcers. I want to stop wearing them. Will my bite go back the wrong way if I do not wear them?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, your bite may go back to a previous alignment if you will not wear retainers properly. This will cause your whole treatment to relapse and it would be bad. Things you can do is you can put some oral gel at ulcer in the daytime and at least wear for 2 to 3 hours for a week so that ulcer may heal up and then come back to 14 hours of wearing from the next week. If some wire is hurting you and creating ulcer, get it fixed from your dentist and then start wearing.  If you cannot go to dentist urgently chew some chewing gum and put it on the point where it is causing the ulcer and wear it. Or you may put a tiny piece of moldable wax too at that point. It will not hurt that bad then and you can wear it. But do wear it somehow. Take care. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female, 28 years old. I do not smoke or play sports or have alcohol. I have BP borderline (130/85) at rest, I suffer from tachycardia at rest. I often have ventricular extrasystoles, frequent bigeminy, and couples of VT. My heart is mad and begins to beat very fast and loud at rest without exercise with chest pain. When I was a child I got echocardiography done that diagnosed a mild mitral regurgitation but I never have done other exams. I got EKG done some days ago, the heartbeat is very very fast at rest. I would like to have an opinion on my EKG, what is it showing?","Doctor":"Hi. Your EKG shows sinus tachycardia and probably left ventricular hypertrophy (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you said you had mild valvular leakage, there might be some other problem as well. Therefore I advise you to have echocardiography done. If your heart rate is high at almost all the times then also have ambulatory EKG (Holter monitoring) done for 24 hours. Sometimes this tachycardia is due to anxiety, pain, anemia, infection, and hyperthyroidism. So, ruling out these entities is a must. Followup after having done the advised tests within 10 days, so you can be guided better and proper. Anxiety, anemia, hyperthyroidism, pain, infection. CBC, TSH, echo, 24 hours Holter monitoring, ESR. Tablet Atenolol 50 mg daily (only after having Holter monitoring done and ruling out other causes of fast heart rate)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband and I have been trying to conceive for five months now. The past few months I have been noticing severe breast pain throughout my entire breast and fullness of both breasts from ovulation until the time I get my period. I read that this could be indicative of a hormone imbalance? My periods are regular and I typically have 30 days cycles.","Doctor":"Hi. Symptoms you have described are effects given by hormones produced before menses and after ovulation. As you are trying to conceive as well and active sexually, the body tries to respond to that too. Attempts for trying to conceive stimulates and activates hormones more efficiently. So those hormonal presence gives effects as well, like breast tenderness. If the pain or tenderness is there all over the cycle and on a specific side only then you need to worry and consult breast specialist. Hot fomentation, warm baths and then oil massage could be helpful. Have folic acid daily. Try to have a complete treatment of any health issue you have. A daily walk and exercise to have normal BMI. Have recreational activities and quit recreational drugs.  Hormonal changes of the cycle. Massage, hot fomentation, warm bath. Can have tablet Postan 500 mg for severe pain. Folic acid, sex in the fertile period."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from severe pain in my cervicothoracic spine and upper right back and scapula and right shoulder and right arm accompanied by numbness in the right forearm since last 40 days. The pain is acute during bending, sitting and walking but I get some relief while lying down on bed on my back. I got my MRI done in which it has been revealed that there is a diffuse annular bulge with posterior right lateral disc extrusion at D1-D2 level which is causing severe compression over right lateral recess with entrapment of the exiting nerve root. I have tried McKenzie neck exercises but my right upper back and cervicothoracic pain has only increased. Please advise how can I get relief ftom acute pain. Please suggest me treatment to get relief from acute pain in cervicothoracic spine region, upper right side back, scapula area and right shoulder and arm.

You need a proper manual therapy assessment and mechanical restoration with mobilization. I would like to advise you to get your D1 properly mobilized with a physiotherapist. The mobilization of the facer joint will also help you a lot. In your case, McKenzie should work better as I do not know what have you done. And what kind of mechanical restoration was done and manipulation performed? Kindly give me details so that we can suggest your correction.  Manipulative correction of deranged spinal alignment will help you to recover faster. Keep icing your upper back and lower part of the neck. Avoid prolong bending forward movement.

I have been worried because my penis head has turned blackish and I have horizontal wrinkles on it. I masturbate once a day for the past three years and often forget to clean the sperm after masturbating. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. I have gone through the attached images (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and it is true that there is some black discoloration at the glans penis (penis head) but it does not look like symptom of any illness or disease. In other words, it can be stated that poor personal hygiene can be the cause and exercising proper care during bath and otherwise can be of much use.  I must acknowledge that images attached to the query are of low resolution but can be considered of average quality for the initial assessment. In case there is no improvement after improving personal hygiene I recommend you to post high-resolution images on the follow-up query. I must also inform you that slight black pigmentation of the penis can be due to the overproduction of melanin which is responsible for the color of our skin. This generally represents injury to the penis because of some injury due to aggressive masturbation which may be applicable in your case. So it is important to remain gentle with yourself when you hold your penis next time. I recommend you to wash with a mild cleanser and rinsing thoroughly so that dead skin can be removed which will change the color to the original. It is also recommended to use antioxidants and mineral rich diet in your daily schedule to rejuvenate the skin of the body. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The doctor has prescribed Losalife H in the morning and Losalex 50 in the night. Is this an excess dose or is it normal?","Doctor":"Hi. It depends entirely on the extent of BP (blood pressure) elevation. Usually, most of the patients become well on once-daily dosing. But in some patients, we need twice daily dosing. So often, once daily is enough. But if the BP is not getting controlled or there is too high elevation say more than 190 mmHg, then we can give twice daily dosing. So the best option, in this case, is monitoring the BP at home using electronic BP apparatus and have the dosing accordingly. Let me know the BP readings if available so that I can suggest the treatment. So overall, if it is a need, a twice-daily dose can be taken."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 18 years. I had a root canal last year. I have many cavities in my teeth. I brush three times a day nicely then also cavities grow up and come on other teeth. Please tell me any of your solutions.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. The cavities (caries) have many causes to occur in the mouth. And overall cleaning with proper technique of brushing and flossing is essential to maintain good oral hygiene. Good oral hygiene with regular dental check-ups will ensure no cavities in the future. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist and get the remaining cavities filled (restored). And have a proper cleaning and scaling done for the teeth. In order for proper brushing technique, ask the dentist you visit to show you the suitable and proper brushing technique. As for now, you can search the modified bass technique for brushing your teeth. Be gentle while brushing. Always brush after breakfast in the morning and after the dinner (before sleeping) in the night. Do regular oral rinses after having meals and floss regularly in order to ward off the cavities. Also, come for the regular dental checkups after six months to your nearest dentist (dental check ups will cost merely some bucks which is better than one time huge amount to spend and that too for drilling and filling your teeth). Maintain good oral hygiene and follow above said things and I can assure you that your teeth will never get any cavities."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have endometriosis, diagnostic or excision lap was done three years back. Recently I have had GI symptoms including extreme pain on defecation, rectal bleeding with a period, and tenesmus. Last exam showed a nodule in my vaginal wall and ultrasound showed left ovarian endometrioma. About a week ago I noticed my vaginal walls seemed to have collapsed so that they are both bulging and pressed together. I felt inside and noted that my cervix was about 1 to 2 inches past the vaginal opening and it is sideways, with the cervix opening to the right side. Does this sound like a rectocele or is it possible that my uterus has tipped over or something? I am not sure what to do as it is very difficult to get in to see my gynecologist. Please help. Currently, I am taking Dienogest 2 mg OD, Taro-Tramadol ER 200 mg OD, Apo-Tramadol 50 mg Q6H PRN, Paroxetine 20 mg OD, Lorazepam 0.5 mg SL PRN.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? You seem to be suffering a lot at this young age of 25 years. From your history and examination findings, I feel there is deep infiltrating endometriosis. Usually, bowel symptoms, distended bowels into the vagina, nodules in ligament could mean that. But the uterus will be stuck and will never descend, especially after a surgery. But when you say cervix is outside the vagina, it means cervical descent or elongation. It could mean a nulliparous prolapse. The best method would be to have an examination done, scan taken, to know if any large cyst is pushing uterus out. If everything is normal, you can have 3 to 4 doses of monthly Lupreolide 3.75 mg i.m. Followed by tablet Ormeloxifene 60 mg weekly twice for any number of years. I have found it more effective than Dienogest. If prolapse is significant, it may resolve if any cyst of pressure from inside is relieved. You have bowel symptoms and you said cervix is pushed to the right, so there must be something on the left side, the location of the colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. Have a scan anyway."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have keratitis and after the treatment, I still have a tiny grey spot on my cornea.

Visit 2 - (October 2014) Exocine 0.3 % - four times daily for a month. Visit 2 - Artelac eye drops - four times daily for a month. Visit 3 - (December 2014) Artelac eye drops - two times daily for a month. Visit 4 - (24th February 2015) - Zylet Etabonate and Prednol, Tobramycine 0.3 % for two weeks. Visit 4 - Artelac eye drops - two times daily. I have been using till now.  I am really worried about my eye. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello.I reviewed your history. It seems from the history that you had keratitis and following the treatment, you have a small corneal opacity. Artelac is an artificial tear eye drops and it can be used for a long time without causing side effects. Hence no need to be worried about the use of Artelac eye drops. The next treatment depends on the site and size of the opacity. If the opacity is superficial and peripheral, then no need to be worried becauseit will be replaced by clear corneal layers slowly as the epithelium of the cornea sheds and regrows. However, if the opacity is deeper and bigger then you may need further surgical intervention like keratoplasty.

I had a cold, but now I have just been coughing for the past 10 days. Please tell me if the blood I see is something to worry about or not. Also, I would like to know what to do about my cough.","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned that you have a blood streak while coughing and only in the morning. You have also mentioned that you have a cold.  There are many possibilities as to what caused the blood streak with your cough. As you have been suffering from a cough, it is highly probable that you might be coughing hard to expel the phlegm in the morning due to more accumulation during the night. During the day, you might be coughing periodically, and a light cough would expel the phlegm.  Coughing too hard causes minor tears in the pharyngeal lining and a small bleed may occur. This is most likely the case with you. And I assure you that it is a simple issue that will resolve spontaneously. This kind of bleeding does not require any treatment. For the cough I would prescribe:Ambrodil-S Syrup: two teaspoonfuls three times daily after food, for a week. Ambrodil-S is a mucolytic agent, which means that it helps to loosen and clear the mucus from your bronchial tract. Tablet Limcee 500: One tablet twice daily for 15 days. Limcee is a Vitamin C supplement. It will boost your immunity and help with early recovery. Gargle twice daily with warm salt water (a half teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water). This is a very important step and it should be practiced whenever you have a cold.  I thought I would mention that another common cause for blood in the sputum is tuberculosis, but it is highly unlikely in your case. If you want to be tested, you can visit any hospital and have a sputum test done (Ziehl-Neelsen sputum test). You will need to submit two sputum samples to the laboratory.  But I would fully expect this situation to clear up soon after following my suggestions, which I would advise you to try first. If this situation persists, then you may want to look into further testing, including possibly a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia. I wish you an early and speedy recovery.

She feels fine and says her throat feels fine. Is this a cause of concern? We have never noticed it before? It has been three months since she was at the dentist and I know they check her tonsils. This is very weird, please advise if this is very serious.","Doctor":"Hi. I have had a look at the pictures you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The tonsils are definitely enlarged in this case, there is no doubt about it. The tonsils have a very rich blood supply and are relatively avascular structure. It is normal to encounter leash of blood vessels over the tonsil or its adjacent areas like the anterior and posterior pillars (these are two walls in between which the tonsils reside). Unless and until the tonsils are inflamed and the child is symptomatic, we do not need to give any sort of antibiotics as it is not indicated. At the same point of time, enlarged tonsil indicates possible previous episodes of recurrent tonsillitis as a result of which the tonsillar tissues get hypertrophied and attains a larger size. It is always better to maintain strict oral hygiene, do saltwater gargles five to six times a day at regular intervals. Avoid anything cold, spicy, and oily food/beverages. Maintaining precautionary measures definitely goes a long way in preventing recurrent sore throats or streptococcal infections. However, in a situation where the child is having recurrent sore throats with associated fever, significant leaves from school, it is always better to get the tonsils removed. There are criteria given by aao-hns (American association of otorhinolaryngologists and head and neck surgeons) who have laid down criteria for a patient to undergo tonsillectomy. In nutshell, visible blood vessels over the tonsils or related adjacent structures is not a worry as it is very common and seen in health and have not pathology related to it. Sticking of the uvula to the right tonsil is due to surface tension of the saliva and enlarged size of the tonsil. This again has no clinical significance. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry or get stressed about. Make sure you advise the child to follow the instructions that I have given above to prevent recurrent sore throats. In addition, she can also use crushed ginger with manuka honey (you can add crushed ginger and honey in a cup and give it together one tablespoon three times a day). Honey has excellent antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial properties and so does ginger. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, This query is for my daughter who is 6 years and 7 months old. She lost her top primary incisor teeth (universal numbering -9) before four months. She still has not got the permanent teeth until now. She however, has lost the other three incisors and got the permanent teeth. Kindly do let me know if the above delay in the growth of these teeth is normal. She is taking Eltroxin 25 mg since birth.","Doctor":"Hello. As you mentioned your daughter is 6 years and 7 months old. Please confirm if she has lost all her upper primary teeth or lowers where the permanent teeth have come? Other thing is if all the upper four primary incisors are gone and three have come. Generally, we need to see which tooth incisor has not come out of four permanent incisors. If missing tooth is lateral incisor means next to two central incisors then we can wait and watch for another two to three months. Other scenario is if only one upper incisor is lost three to four months ago and the rest of the milk (primary incisors are intact) then we can still wait two to three more months. But if out of four upper permanent incisors, only one that too central permanent incisor has not come out, then it is better to take radiograph IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) x-ray first to rule out any hindrance in the eruption of the tooth or any permanent missing tooth. If possible click and share the picture of mouth (oral cavity) with teeth and send it across. Generally, a delay of one year in an eruption of permanent teeth is quite normal. But we need to confirm which tooth is missing and need to see the chronology of other teeth simultaneously to rule out any abnormal changes. Eruption delay if only one primary tooth was lost and counterpart permanent tooth is missing for the past four months. IOPA x-ray of upper front teeth. First need to examine clinically and then if needed IOPA x-ray.

Can I take those medicines? Suspecting it is chickenpox. The itching started 10 days ago, rashes started five days ago. Appears to be small red bumps on thighs and hands. Then appearing as water blisters and healing now.","Doctor":"Hi. Deflazacort is corticosteroids and can be used as per need but can interact with diabetic medications and will act as an anti-inflammatory and can give side effects like weight gain, mood variations, vomitings, etc. Hydroxyzine is antihistamine and can be used but better only in need, do not make it as a habit. Suspecting chicken pox at 28 weeks, you need to report urgently to treating obstetrician. If you tell within 24 hours of the appearance of the lesion, you can have medications like Acyclovir. If severe symptoms, it can be given orally as well.  Chicken pox first needs to check as urgent before treatment for IgG and IgM as well ( IgM recent infection and IgG already immunized petient). In pregnancy, the vaccine could not be given as it is a live attenuated vaccine but after 20 weeks if patient reports within 24 hours of having confirmed leisions of chicken pox could have medical treatment. Take it seriously and just report to your treating obstetrician to have proper examination and treatment accordingly. But it seems you have spent most of the infectious and symptomatic period already but better to have a check up immediately and do have electronic fetal monitoring to check fetal well-being.

It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am currently not on any medication and no formal investigations or diagnosis has been done. It seems to be getting worse lately, as with my recent break-up. However, even back when we were together, I was told that I act like someone who is borderline, and it has become a major issue and reason for our break-up.","Doctor":"Hi. I can only say that if a psychiatrist has labeled you as a borderline then only you should worry about being one. I would advise you to stop being judgmental about yourself and stop being bothered about how the world judges you. From the description which you have provided, I can say that you are having adjustment disorder and nothing else. So stop worrying, psychotherapy would help you a lot and you will have to be more descriptive about how you feel now so that I can help you. You can consult a psychiatrist also if you want."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, The patient is my wife.","Doctor":"Hi. Kindly find answers of your questions as below. Your total leukocyte count and platelet were low initially. But gradually it has been improved so suggest recovery of any unnoticed infection. Moreover, the peripheral smear examination report was normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and not showing any abnormal cells that warrant further investigation. You have to still repeat CBC after few days. The TSH is high, so hypothyroidism should be ruled out. For that repeat TSH estimation after few days and investigate with T3, T4 estimation as well. If there is any abnormality, then gradually all counts go down or high and peripheral smear shows abnormal cells if blood cancer is present. It is difficult to say one reason for low WBC. But the infection can be possible. If no cause is evident then ANA estimation can be done to do work up for autoimmune disease. If your CBC values do not fall within the range in the next few days then hematologist can be consulted for a detailed evaluation. If hypothyroidism is confirmed then Levothyroxine should be started."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old with type 1 diabetes looking to conceive. I am currently 145 pounds and 5'6\\" tall. What do I need to do? Currently, I am taking Insulin.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Before you plan to conceive, just try to lose some weight. For the height of 152 cms, ideal weight is 52 to 57 kg. I am sure this will reduce your requirement of Insulin too. As pregnancy progresses the dose of Insulin will need titration. Try to lose that weight not by changing your diet, but by increasing or changing your daily exercise schedule (a lot of cardiac exercises). One month before you start trying, start on tablet Folic acid 5 mg per day, as this will reduce the risk of fetal anomalies, early pregnancy loses. Have a baseline HbA1c. Only when it is < 6.5 %, which signifies the blood sugars of the previous three months, then you try for pregnancy.

There are two possibilities in you, first is costochondritis (musculoskeletal) and the second possibility is of gastric reflux followed by fibroadenosis. Such a long duration of the pain and pain which increases on movements or pressing over the same site is usually costochondritis. Also, get your breast palpated once for any lumps (fibroadenosis), which can also cause pain if feeling pain is in the breast. You may continue Pantoprazole Domperidone combination (Pan DSR) for a week period, and if there is inadequate relief then get prescribed anti-inflammatory medicines from GP like Naproxen 250 mg twice a day along with Pantoprazole for five days.

I recently went to a doctor, so he gave me some drops to eliminate these fungi, but after getting rid of those few fungi, I do not hear as well as the other ear. Some blood started flowing, and the pain is more. I think that there are infections and something more dangerous because the blood has not stopped. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. As you have rightly put it, there is a possibility of recurrent fungal infection what we call as otomycosis. This condition is very notorious for its recurrence even after treatment. Usually, usage of earbuds i.e. q-tip initiate the entire problem as often the cotton tip is not sterilized in a proper manner thereby introducing infection. The entire fungal blob can obstruct your ear canal, and you will have fullness along with itching and associated pain. It is very essential that the fungal blob be suctioned out completely not leaving backtraces of fungal hyphae as they can form another colony in no time. I recommend you to see an ENT to get this entire blob suctioned out. Continue to use the antifungal ear drops (I usually recommended a combination containing Clotrimazole as it is the most effective in treating such conditions). It will take a while before your ear gets back to normal and there is nothing you need to get stressed about as it is a very common entity we encounter in the outpatient department. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

These are not immediately life-threatening but may be harmful in long term. Firstly, I guess this was a fasting sample even without tea in the morning, if not then you should get it repeated with absolute fasting of at least eight hours as it can falsely elevate triglycerides. Next thing, you should have a period of 2 to 3 months with a healthy lifestyle before starting medicines as medicine may reduce triglycerides but it will again rise after you stop medicines. So maintenance is important with lifestyle changes. So, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and a high-calorie diet. Avoid free sugar, cola drink, and other beverages. Plenty of green leafy vegetables. Reduce alcohol consumption and smoking, non-vegetarian especially meat and chicken, if any. Most important are the exercise to burn your lipids, so should have at least 30 minutes a day and at least five days a week of exercise like brisk walking or running according to your capacity. After 2 to 3 months of a healthy lifestyle, repeat lipid profile and see for the changes.

Those members at home should also do the same. Love him well. Make him attentive to learning, like books, drawing, innovative toys, etc. Keep away from mobile games, television. Keep outing to gardens, parks, etc., and let him play with fellow kids.

Your history suggests a Bartholin abscess or maybe a fungal growth. The growth actually needs to be seen before I can give you any coherent advice.

Stress, overwork, illness, medications, hormonal imbalance all can delay periods. Have serum beta hCG to check pregnancy. If no pregnancy, then wait for weeks at least before menstrual induction (tablet Primolute N 10 mg twice daily for five days and wait for bleeding for 1 to 2 weeks). Next periods could be irregular after withdrawal bleed but gradually periods will get back to normal as soon as the body gets rid of externally induced hormones (I-pill, Primolut N).  Missed periods post pill. Beta hCG. Beta hCG if negative have menstrual induction. Cocp (oral contraceptive pills) for regulating cycles."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have semi acute pain in my left ear due to someone slapped in my ear while ragging last year. I did not visit a doctor because I feel uncomfortable about discussing this issue. But nowadays I feel a sound that is like when water enters our ear. Now, I have feared of phonophobia. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. You might have developed an eardrum hole i.e. perforation since the eardrum is a very delicate structure and cannot tolerate a high volume and high impact gush of air. In such a circumstance, you will definitely have symptoms such as ringing sensations, feeling of air coming out, irritation, unable to tolerate loud sounds, and even decreased hearing. There is nothing to worry as the eardrum heals on its own in four to six weeks provided you follow certain precautionary measures. Precautionary measures include not allowing water to enter the ear. Place sterile cotton in the outer ear and wear a shower cap as well while having a head bath. Cotton places have to be changed every six hours during the day. There is no medication as such required unless your ear has got infected and there is discharge. In such a situation, the healing process might take even more time or sometimes if adequate care and hygiene are not maintained, the hole or perforation might not heal at all and might require surgery to get it closed. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hypothyroidism. With that, I am facing hair fall, skin infections, overweight, high cholesterol, and memory loss. Are all these happening because of thyroid or there are other factors involved? I am a firm believer in Ayurveda but can this be treated with Ayurveda permanently? I do not want to pop hormone pills for the rest of my life. More details about the presenting complaint. I used to be a heavy smoker and drinker. I have started following a good diet from the last 2 to 3 months but the effects are negligible so far. Previous history of the same issue. Never got myself tested but I have been facing these symptoms from the last 4 to 5 years. The current medications: None at present. Past medications of the same issue include Medohar Vati, Brahmi, and Panch nimbadi vati.","Doctor":"Hi. Hypothyroidism may cause these symptoms as you have described. But it is other possibilities too. Hair fall may be due to infection, excessive use of different kinds of shampoo and conditioner, changes in food habits and water, stress, etc. Stress and anxiety may lead to loss of memory. A sedentary lifestyle may cause obesity. But according to your complaints, it seems like hypothyroidism is one of the major cause. It can be managed naturally through ayurvedic medicines and Yoga techniques. Dress, anxiety, changes in food habits, and lifestyles, lack of physical activity, etc. Thyroid profile, lipid profile, blood sugar, blood pressure. Obesity, diabetes. You are taking good medicines, and there is a need to add some other medicines too. Avoid spicy and fried junk foods. Quit smoking and drinking if you have these habits.

Can you tell me what to do with them?","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. Canker sores are a characteristic feature of syphilis. This syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease. Purulent pustules are generally seen which burst to form canker sores. You should get yourself tested for the syphilis infection as soon as possible because syphilis should be treated immediately. Otherwise, it can lead to some of the serious complications to the brain, heart, nervous system, etc. However, you do not need to worry as once detected it can be completely eradicated from the body. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist and also make an appointment with the general physician for eliminating any other cause for the same. If you were my patient, after detailed drug history, I would have prescribed you antibiotics like Penicillin and topical analgesics (if the pain is in the sores) for the infection elimination. I would also advise you to adhere to not having sex during this period as it can spread through having sex. I would also advise you to have good oral hygiene and brush your teeth twice daily and floss regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have just noticed a white spot embedded in my gum behind my lower back molar teeth. The area is a bit swollen and is a little sore. My throat is also a bit swollen and a little sore.","Doctor":"Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. I need to know if you have any cavity or carious tooth near that sore. If yes, it might be due to the infection of the tooth which is exudating via the gum. However, if no carious tooth is there, then it is an aphthous ulcer and it will subside on its own within a week or two. If the sore does not go after two weeks, make an appointment with your nearest dentist to get the sore tested for any anomaly. I would have prescribed you with Mouth Paint Ora-Gel or Dolo Gel in order to get relief from the pain (if any). Rub a drop or two over the white spot gently half an hour before meals. I would also suggest you do warm saline gargles in order to relieve your throat. I would advise you to have good oral hygiene and brush your teeth twice daily and floss regularly. Consider follow up after a week here."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a childless woman for the past six years after marriage. Recently, we went to an IVF center.

I am maintaining a calendar to track my menstrual cycle so that intercourse during ovulation can increase the chances of pregnancy. How are Meprate and intercourse related? Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. Most of the medications given in the process of treatment help in having a regular menstrual cycle, regular ovulation, and to get rid of irregular periods and to support conception. Meprate is progestin. It will act as progesterone which reduces the overgrowth of endometrial thickness, and they help in ovulation. They are given in patients having irregular cycles. After ovulation, it helps in conception. For quitting the medications, you have to consult your treating doctor. Have folic acid regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A 58 year old man had a high fever with rigors yesterday. He has given blood for testing. After the completion of the blood test, he had a febrile illness. Can you suggest medications and do's and don'ts?","Doctor":"Hello. Fever of two days duration with rigors may be non-specific, viral, malaria or a urinary tract infection. Look for rashes on the body because viral fevers are prevalent now. Take Dolo 650 (Paracetamol) as when the fever comes, up to a maximum of four times a day. And, if the fever is more than 101 degrees, do a cold sponging. If he has a cold or cough, he can start antibiotic Augmentin 625 (Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate) twice daily after food for five days. Do a complete blood picture and share the report.

The suggestion was to go for an operation which regretfully I delayed until recently. The symptoms got worse. Now I have an appointment next month with a specialist. Meanwhile, I have pins and needles in the most upper part of my arm, basically in the shoulder for 15 to 20 minutes. They come totally unexpected, whether I move or not. They appear up to 15 times, typically in the morning when getting up. There is no pain, it is just very unpleasant and frightening since I cannot control it. Secondly, during the night when in bed my neck becomes very stiff, causing pain to wake me. A new medical cushion has not helped. My question is that are both symptoms related to CTS since I always thought this is located to the hand only. Can I expect relief after the operation or could this be something different? Currently, I am taking Atorvastatin, Atenolol, Exforge, Tamsulosin, Allopurinol.","Doctor":"Hi. Carpel tunnel syndrome will not cause any symptoms in the upper arm. However, it could be due to cervical nerve compression. This could be associated with or without the carpel tunnel syndrome independently. In my opinion, you should go for nerve conduction velocity NCV testing to be sure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. I decided to contact you because I do not know what to do. I had sex with my husband, and then we found out that he had a chlamydia infection. Since then, I am feeling sick all the time. My stomach was hurting a lot, and I had problems with passing urine, and it started to hurt deep inside. I went to a sexual health clinic, and I had a test (it came out as negative after one week), and they treated me for chlamydia. I was told to wait for a week for the symptoms to stop, but it was just getting worse and worse. I had heavy bleeding, spotting at times, and I was not able to move because of the pain. Those are just some of the symptoms I was having. I came back to the clinic, and they thought it could be PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease). So, they treated me for that. But those antibiotics did not help as well. I still have abdominal pain. I can feel something moving and kicking inside me. It is there all the time. I was at the clinic yesterday, and I had two pregnancy tests. The results came out the same (one clear line and the other one very light). The possibility of me being pregnant is very less because I was taking birth control pills for 2 years, and we always use condoms. Except for one time which was two months ago, but my husband did not ejaculate inside me. I did not have periods for 2 years, and that is why the bleeding worried me. I stopped taking birth control pills one week ago because I was worried that it could be pregnancy. I have read a lot about ectopic pregnancy, and the symptoms are the same as what I have been experiencing. I did two pregnancy tests at home, and they were negative. The sexual health clinic said that there is a possibility that I might have an ectopic pregnancy. I am very scared. It has been two months already, and I cannot stand it. What do I do? Am I pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. If pregnancy is the concern, then the best way to find out is to get a blood serum beta hCG test done. This is a confirmatory test for pregnancy as the urine pregnancy kits may show false positive results. If the level of hCG is more than 1 or raised, then pregnancy is confirmed. If the level is less than 1, then pregnancy is completely ruled out. If the test is positive, then you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy for its site, which could be intrauterine or possibly in the tubes (ectopic). If the USG shows extrauterine pregnancy, then you would require a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the damaged tube along with the ectopic pregnancy. If the pregnancy is intrauterine, then you may decide upon continuing the pregnancy. If the test is negative, then the possible cause remains UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) or a possible PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) or endometriosis. Also, stress per se can cause derangement of hormonal balance and can cause heavy bleeding in spite of being on continuous progesterone pills. This can be controlled with antifibrinolytics in the absence of pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend's son has been diagnosed with hypochondroplasia. He is 11 months old. His height is 50 cm and weight is approximately 5 kg. Kindly suggest the best treatment.","Doctor":"Hi. Hypochondroplasia is a rare and genetically inherited condition. It involves the skeletal system, and the child's height and weight are definitely low. And birth history (attachment removed to protect patient identity) also suggests some abnormality. What about the parents status, is anyone affected or are they normal? Very rare tests have been performed, and he has been examined at reputed institutes and already seen by a genetic specialist. The child needs a multispeciality/multidisciplinary approach: Unfortunately, there are no medications to cure this disease. Genetic disorders can affect many body systems. The best we can do is treat the symptoms that are caused. There are more severe forms of the disease which can be life-threatening. Hypochondroplasia is only a milder form.

I know nail removal is a dreadful thought for people, but, that is normal. It would be done under anaesthesia and is a very simple and quick procedure. And your nail will grow back in time as well. So do not hesitate to carry the needed procedure out. As of now, do not do any procedures on your own. It would cause deep infections and may get worse. Stay healthy and be positive."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, At six weeks and one-day pregnant, I had a gestational sac measuring at five weeks, six days. (I do not always have 28-day cycles, sometimes 30 days), and the gestational sac was empty (no yolk sac, no fetal pole). Two days prior to the ultrasound, my progesterone measured at 5.3 and my hCG was 6009. My hCG had doubled in 72 hours. My intuition is telling me that I am going to miscarry. Given my progesterone level and the fact that my gestational sac is measuring plenty big enough for at least a yolk sac to be seen. My doctor keeps saying just wait. My question is, given everything presented, am I correct to assume a miscarriage? I feel that I have prepared myself to expect it.","Doctor":"Hi. I could understand your concern. It seems you had a bit irregular periods as well. Now sac is there but no fetal pole or yolk sac around 5+ weeks. Beta hCG that shows a progression of pregnancy increasing more than 50 % as you described. This scenario is known as anembryonic pregnancy means no embryo development. It is better to wait for a week or 10 days. Here, you have not mentioned the exact measure of the gestational sac. In case of irregular periods or some other factors dates discrepancy also occurs but still point is that still no yolk sac or fetal pole as you said, then more chances could be suspected like missed miscarriage or anembryonic pregnancy, if still in coming days fetal pole could not be seen. You can prepare yourself to be positive whatever has been written for you as you could have a healthy conception again. In case of an abnormal product of conception normally miscarriage happens so do not be sad. Just wait and see and have rescanned after 7 to 10 days to reach any definite conclusion. In case of bleeding, cramps, abdominal pain immediately report to tertiary care gynecology emergency unit. Irregular periods or abnormal product of conception. Wait and have a transvaginal scan after 7 to 10 days with expertise hands. Anembryonic pregnancy or suspected missed miscarriage. Suspected missed miscarriage.

What I am anxious about is that my fiance got a tattoo done yesterday, unprofessionally (it was done by a local tattoo artist in our village who gives tattoos at the artist’s own home). My fiance had his parent's consent before he got this tattoo. But, young as we are, we are not yet aware of the risks of this unprofessional method of tattooing. This morning, my mother warned me about the risks of getting HIV through the tattoo.I am concerned because I was an eye-witness of the process, the artist just drafted the design with a pen. I saw the artist pour the ink from the bottle to a cup that has obviously been used before. I just found out today that new needles should be used, and I am troubled because I did not see the artist change the needles before he gave my fiance his tattoo. While tattooing the artist is wiping off the blood and extra ink off of my fiance’s skin with wet cotton (he just used tap water in a basin). Lastly, when the tattoo was done, he wiped Petroleum jelly over the area. Now, I am very anxious because months ago I found out that HIV and AIDS are very common in our area.These are my questions. Is it possible that my fiance might have acquired HIV through the tattoo process because of the unsterilized and reused equipment? How high is the risk of him being infected? Should I advise him to get an HIV test? And if yes, what specific type of test and when should he get the test? What other health issues are more likely acquired by my fiance after the tattoo session?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Firstly, stop worrying. There is a solution to your problem. It is true that unsterile needles used for tattooing can lead to the spread of certain blood-borne infections. HIV virus is quite unstable outside the human body, so it is less likely for the virus to have been active on the needles, but we cannot rule out the chance of him acquiring the infection. HIV virus does not usually show up on blood tests very soon. The best thing to do is to talk to your doctor about the exposure and your fiance can take post-exposure prophylaxis. Some medicines will be given that will help to prevent infection in people who might have been exposed to the virus. There may be a risk of other blood-borne infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis or Staphylococcus aureus. These can be prevented by taking appropriate treatment. Please talk to your doctor. I hope that helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 male. I am suffering from central diabetes insipidus for the last three years.

I made sure not to ejaculate inside her and I pulled out in time but we are worried about the effects of pre-ejaculation if that might cause pregnancy. Her period this month completed a few days ago and waiting for a month seems too long. I-pill was my choice but after learning about the side effects am wondering if there is another way to find out if she is pregnant or should we just go for the pill?","Doctor":"Hi. From day 1 to 10 of the period, it is a safe period. There is no chance of pregnancy as there is no ovulation happening during this period. So if you had intercourse during your safe period, there is no chance of pregnancy. Also, you say that you have followed a withdrawal method. So relax and do not worry. However, if you have a doubt then take an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of intercourse. There is no chance of pregnancy. The side effects of the pills are minimal and temporary. However, if you have a doubt then get back to me. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I took an I-pill immediately after unprotected sex. After five hours I had a reflux sort of vomiting, very little but now I do not know if I should take another pill or not?","Doctor":"Hello. Usually, it is not necessary to take an additional pill if one vomited after three hours. If just vomited a little then it is not necessary to take an additional pill. Then also confirm whether you had 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg tablet. If it was 1.5 mg then it is not necessary. However, if you have consumed 0.75 mg then it is better to take an additional 0.75 mg after 12 hours. So, overall it is not necessary to take any additional dose, just confirm the above factors for additional surety."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old.

My mother also suffers from this problem. I use whitening toothpaste but all are in vain. So, please doctor help me and give me a suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and can understand your concern. It seems like you have staining of teeth and plaque accumulation. Our mouth contains a great number of resident bacteria. Sometimes some individuals have staining bacteria which leads to physiological stains. This is not any pathology or disease. This staining often leads to plaque accumulation and bad smell from the mouth. You need professional teeth cleaning (scaling and polishing) regularly (usually every six months). Continue brushing twice daily with any toothpaste that suits you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

For breaking of these oligosaccharides, bacteria in intestines come into action and break these sugars by fermentation and as a result, produce gases in the body owing to flatulence. The pain you are experiencing could be because of that. The other reason could be phantom pain which is a pain in the part of the body which no longer exists.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It looks like a mild swelling, but I am scared. I have attached pictures of the swelling. Is this starting edema because of heart failure? I had some cardiac enlargement on MRI, but I had normal ejection fractions a year ago. What do I do now?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen and reviewed the images which you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like you have mild edema around your ankle. In the absence of any respiratory symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, or other cardiac symptoms such as chest pain, it is not related to any cardiac issues. It could be due to other factors such as slight renal parameter derangement, or wearing very tight socks. I will advise you to get a CBC (Complete Blood Count), RFT (Renal Function Test) and LFT (Liver Function Test) done. If these tests are normal, you can go ahead and get an ECG done. But as of now, there is no need to worry about heart failure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old, and I have this problem for about two weeks.

About 3 to 4 days ago after having a bowel movement, I noticed a little bit of bright red blood on the toilet paper, and my anus was bleeding a little bit for the next minute or so and then it stopped. The next day, I had another bowel movement, and there was a lot less blood on the toilet paper than the day before. The next day it was completely gone. For the next two days, I did not have any bleeding. But yesterday, the bleeding was back except there was a lot more of it had dripped into the toilet. It went away shortly. The same thing happened today. I do not have any pain, constipation, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, or nausea. The only other symptom besides the bleeding is that the outer part of my anus feels irritated after I pass stools.","Doctor":"Hello. You need to get your stool examined for the possibility of parasites which can cause such local irritation. Also, malabsorption of certain compounds in food can lead to local irritation after passing stools. Fresh bleeding is possible if the stools are hard, but there is no such history in your case. I will advise you the following medicines for a week, and if it still does not resolve, please get yourself examined by your physician.

I am an 18 year old male, who plays football and loves to play golf. I am here today to say, and I have an eating disorder. In this case, I am assuming it is an eating disorder or some type of phobia. But anyway, my problem is eating in public. I never had a problem with it when I was young, but it probably started when I was 13 years old. I cannot eat out if I go to a restaurant or a fast food place, I feel like throwing up instantly when I sit down with my food. I cannot eat at school and the worst one is when I receive the body of Christ, I almost jump out of my shoes to try and not to throw up. But luckily that never happened. It is probably been about two years since I ate out of my house. I do not understand how it just happened. I mean like I was fine when I was younger, and now I have this problem. What should I do? My family does not really believe me when I tell them, they just say it is nerves. But since it has been two years, I think it is buried in my head. Now I have some questions. Can this be fixed? What exactly is my problem? Will I ever be able to eat at a restaurant or fast food place again? Can this be fixed without actually going to the doctor? You honestly do not know how much I would love to go sit down with my family at a restaurant and enjoy a meal. I need help and a confidence booster. I can eat perfectly fine at my own house and that is why I am confused. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I think it is not an eating disorder because, in the case of an eating disorder, the problem should be everywhere including your home. However, your problem of eating in public could be because of social anxiety disorder or because of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). So, I would like to seek more clarification regarding the following points: Now, I would like to answer your questions. Yes, this problem of yours can be fixed. Do not worry about that. This could be a social anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Yes, you will definitely be able to eat outside.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 28 year old female. I am suffering from stomach problems.

Also, the pain or uneasy feeling is more pronounced in the lower right side of the abdomen. I recently shifted to another country. After shifting, my problem has worsened.

If the surgery was done at an earlier age then the prognosis is good. Prognosis also depends on the size of ASD and whether a pulmonary vascular obstruction is present or not.

I usually brush my teeth 2 to 3 times daily.","Doctor":"Hi. You can opt for the following treatments stepwise. Start using antibacterial or Chlorhexidine Gluconate mouthwash. This is best for bad breath or stinking mouth and halitosis. Use three times a day for two weeks. Another very helpful method for the cure of bad breath is saline water mouth rinses. (Take a small cup of lukewarm water, add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it). Do these rinses three times a day for 10 days. It will help. But chronic halitosis or mouth stinking is not a healthy thing. You must get the cause identified. This bad breath can be due to any systemic problem (like acidity, stomach ulcer, etc.), mouth breathing habit, poor oral hygiene. Try to fix the problem accordingly first. If you need scaling, get it done and then start with mouthwash or mouthrinses. You will get rid of bad breath soon. Two times brushing of teeth in a day is quite enough, excessive brushing can damage the enamel of your teeth. You can give followup after two weeks. Along with a close picture of your teeth with gums can help me diagnose your cause of mouth stinking more properly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old male. My height is 5'10\\" and I weigh 82 kg. I got married two years back. We both are working professionals and love each other a lot. Since our marriage, we are trying to have intercourse but unable to. We are wanting to have a baby now, but are really worried about the situation. Also, we tried penetration a lot of times but the moment I come close to her I lose the erection. I am very uncomfortable with my foreskin rolled down and she is very uncomfortable when I touch her vagina as the sense of pain takes down the momentum and she feels stressed. She also feels dryness at her vagina. As we both are working hence at the end of the day we feel tired and have less sexual desire. You are requested to help us in our healthy sexual life and family planning too.","Doctor":"Hello. As you have explained, you never achieved intercourse? You both have fear about sex and you have fear for rolling of your foreskin and she also feels pain and uncomfortable. You both need therapy. You want to plan a baby but first, you achieve a successful intercourse, it is important. You have to do a simple exercise like try to uncover your foreskin when you urinate. Does that hurt? During masturbation try to uncover. And for your partner, you should visit a gynecologist for dryness of the vagina. There is vaginal cream that contains estrogen that will be helpful in dryness problem. If she has a fear that intercourse will be painful than there is vaginal dilator that will give her relief. In starting, you should enjoy foreplay. Forget about intercourse. When you both are at peak, then start sex but if you became already preoccupied with that thought that we cannot do then you cannot proceed further. The main problem is that you both are very sensitive and do not want to hurt each other but start playing with each other's genital part that will replace your hesitation to pleasure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What is the procedure to control muscular dystrophy?","Doctor":"Hi. Most of the muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases, like myotonic dystrophies, Duchan- baker dystrophy. If someone has that, no treatment discovered yet, we did not have anything to cure disease, rather diseases are progressive. But dystrophy is due to some medication like statins medication or steroids, we can discontinue medicine and dystrophy will be reversed. Hopefully, I answered your questions. In the meantime, an aggressive fluid should be given to prevent kidney failure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I would just like an independent opinion, I am 34 years old and already had four failed IVF's. Not once was there a positive pregnancy test. I am healthy, gave birth to a healthy baby boy eight years back with my first husband who sadly passed on a few years ago. Remarried a few years later and have been struggling with infertility. Have been on numerous Clomid and IUI cycles with no success. Finally resorted to IVF and thought that after at least three attempts it would be successful as I had a good response to stimulation and good embryo production. The only issue was my husband's sperm morphology and viscosity. Fertilization was done via ICSI and was told that the blastocyst was top grade and perfect looking and already hatching. Is there any reason why the embryos are failing to implant. I am so frustrated, confused and depressed. The whole experience is emotionally and financially draining especially because I have no issues with my uterus, no hormonal issues, etc. My husband blames me, according to him, if the embryos were perfect looking than the problem surely is me. My clinic said I should come in and try again, however, I do not want to try again not knowing what the problem is or what can be done differently.","Doctor":"Hello. I completely empathize with you and understand your concerns here. The primary step where, in your case, things could have gone wrong is the stage of implantation over a non-receptive endometrium of the uterus when a top grade blastocyst is being transferred and each time there is a negative result. The implantation at endometrium is the issue in your case, most likely.  Few things are important for a good endometrium. The endometrial thickness should be more than 9 mm at ET. Good endometrial blood flow in zone 2, 3 and 4 to check for receptivity through transvaginal Doppler study in the mid-cycle before embryo transfer. Before even contemplating IVF, an endometrial biopsy for histopathology report should be obtained to rule out any pre-existent endometritis or and acid-fast bacillus (tuberculous cause). The malefactor is taken care of by ICSI and IVF and hence a high-grade blastocyst is being achieved for transfer. I would like you to share with me the last IVF cycle medicinal protocol, scans, follicular monitoring reports and if possible reports of endometrial biopsy for a histopathology, pap smear report, high vaginal swab culture (if any) for further study and check to ascertain what went wrong in your case."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a small size of a cyst.

Regarding the microscopic hematuria, it could be due to subclinical UTI (Urinary Tract Infection), which happens due to poor hygiene or due to inadequate drinking of water. Since you are a working professional, I presume you do not get much time to care about your diet and general things such as drinking enough water on time. Due to this, the urine keeps turning acidic and makes it a good environment for the local microbial flora to grow and cause UTI. It is not at all a threat as of now. UTI in men can be difficult to treat with because of resistance of organisms to many antibiotics. However, I suggest you try doing the following things: Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking medicines after their consent. Till then take the medicines and most importantly drink enough water. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 years old. I have a sports day at my college coming up. How do I get stamina for a running race?","Doctor":"Hi. To increase your stamina, you should include the following in your diet: Wish you all the best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The symptoms I have are bad cold or strep throat, itchy eyes and throat but no cough. I do not have tonsils, but seems like there is a whitish puffiness on one side of my throat. It started five days ago and it has been getting mildly worse since then. I have been loading up on fruits, vegetables, preventative vitamins, raw garlic and even tried a saline sinus rinse. I just moved to a place where it is very dry and I am used to very humid climate. I have never had hay fever or sinus issues or been affected by pollen. Am I sick? Or is this a severe reaction to the blanket of green pine pollen all over the town? Can pine tree pollen cause swollen throat, earache and headache only on one side of my face?","Doctor":"Hello.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had cysts in both my ovaries. I had medications for a while, but I stopped using them. Since then, I have been vomiting almost everything I eat, and my stomach gets swollen all the time. I feel uncomfortable. I feel really sick every time I go to the restroom (almost every half hour). To be honest, I do not drink much water, and I do not eat well. I feel I lack nutrients and antioxidants. I also have really intense pain in the right lower side of my abdomen, and I also have pain during sexual intercourse.","Doctor":"Hi. Treatment of ovarian cysts depends on the size and type of the cysts and your age. If your age is less than 40 years and if the cyst is a simple one, it will resolve with medications. You can ask your doctor to prescribe some medicines to prevent acidity and vomiting and can continue your medicines (for cyst) along with them. If the cyst is a complex one and causes too much pain (as you have described), it is better to consult your doctor for the removal of the cyst. Most of such cysts can be removed laparoscopically. Hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have three first molars that have been filled with amalgam three years ago. I need to know how can I find out if one of them has caries under the restoration because one more first molar was also restored by amalgam, and three years later, I was experiencing some pain. When the doctor checked, it turned out that it was full of caries, and I had an endodontic treatment. Is there any way to find out if my other amalgam restored molars have caries? Are there any other methods other than radiographs because I know that prolonged exposure to radiographs is not very healthy. And also, last month I was exposed to x-ray 11 times, besides experiencing that severe pain and leading to endodontic treatment. I have a panoramic radiograph which was taken a month ago. Can you tell me how to find out if there is caries underneath the restorations (like how caries looks in a radiograph)?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to icliniq.com. Yes, there are possibilities of caries (tooth decay) underneath amalgam restorations. Please check the panoramic radiograph and see if there are any dark patches below the amalgam fillings in the teeth. It would be best if you could send a photograph of your recent panoramic radiograph (OPG), for confirmation. Your panoramic radiograph is more than enough to find out if there is secondary caries (caries underneath restorations) in your molar teeth. Intra Oral Periapical radiograph (IOPA) is the x-ray of an individual tooth. IOPA might be needed for detailed investigation of an individual tooth during later stages of treatment. You could try digital x-rays which have very low-level radiation exposure compared to conventional x-rays."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got risings, itch, and redness from a cosmetic cream.

Should I take an antihistamine for the swelling and itch? Itch is manageble.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your query. With your descriptions, it seems you have developed irritant contact dermatitis to cosmetic cream which you have used. First of all, never use this cream and similar products in future otherwise on subsequent exposure may lead to fulminant reactions. If you feel your symptoms are regressing then nothing needs to be done, but if you are still symptomatic then can go for 1 % Hydrocortisone cream local application once daily for five days after consulting your GP or nearby dermatologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 34 year old female weighing 300 pounds.

Now I was expecting to get my periods on 7th or maximum by 10th of this month but I have not got my periods yet. What can be the problem? Is it a sign of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello. As per the dates you have provided, you had sex on the 23rd of last month, that is 13 days from your period date, that is the most fertile period of the cycle. But you took emergency contraception, so chances of pregnancy are very less. Also, please can you tell that if your partner was using condoms or you were on any contraception apart for that emergency pill? When you take an emergency pill it also affects your period schedule. It can be 7 to 10 days before or after scheduled date, so the best course will be getting a pregnancy test done using home pregnancy kit.

What long-term complications can be there as my cornea thickness is too low for LASIK surgery.","Doctor":"Hello. Even though your power of - 4 is well within the correctable range and your power has been stable for two years, your corneas were too thin on topography maps for surgery (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The doctors deferred surgery because, during the process of LASIK, we will be removing tissue from your cornea and in a cornea not thick enough this can cause problems like for example keratoconus or in severe cases perforation. Regarding the long-term implications, thin corneas are harmless and usually do not progress unless associated with keratoconus or other similar problems. In case you do have keratoconus, it may show some progress in thinning during pregnancy and lactation. In case you still want to be spectacle-free, the option of implantable contact lenses is viable, provided there are no additional problems in your eye."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},Y={key:1};function W(a,e,l,u,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",F,[(o(!0),i(b,null,w(s.filteredPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),v(m,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[n.isLoading?(o(),i("span",Y,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",j,"See more"))],8,q)):I("",!0)])}const z=c(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-50c54510"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/49.md","filePath":"guide/49.md"}'),E={name:"guide/49.md"},O=Object.assign(E,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(o(),i("div",null,[k(z)]))}});export{R as __pageData,O as default};
