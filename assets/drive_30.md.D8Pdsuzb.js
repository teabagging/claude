On the other hand, since 10=2 times 5, it is enough to know the powers of 2 and 5 that appear in the factorization of the number. So we can write:A=2^{5} times 3^{7} times 5^{7} times 11^{3}=10^{5} times 3^{7} times 5^{2} times 11^{3}Since the number 3^{7} times 5^{2} times 11^{3} is not a multiple of 10, it does not end in 0. Therefore, we see that the original number ends in 5 zeros. In fact, we can calculate the value and get 7277242500000.b) How do we find out which is the highest power of 10 that divides the number B? For this, it is enough to count how many times each factor 2 and 5 appears in the factorization of B and the smaller of these quantities gives the number of zeros at the end of the number B.We start by counting the number of factors 2. Since each even number has a factor 2, we have to count the number of even numbers that exist between 1 and 137. And this is easy to count, as the last even number that appears is 136, which is equal to 2 times 68. Therefore, we have 68 even numbers and, therefore, 68 factors 2.However, that is not all. There are even numbers that contribute more than one factor 2 (for example, 4). In fact, all multiples of 4 contribute two factors 2, so we have to count the multiples of 4 as well, which are in quantity 136 div 4=34. Here 136 is the last multiple of 4 that appears in the product. Similarly, there are numbers that contribute three factors, such as multiples of 8=2^{3}; four factors, such as multiples of 16=2^{4}, and so on with 32=2^{5}, 64=2^{6}, and 128=2^{7}. These are the powers of 2 less than 137. Let's then count all these numbers.The last multiple of 8 before 137 is 136, so there are 136 div 8=17 multiples of 8. The last multiple of 16 is 128, so we have 128 div 16=8 multiples of 16. Continuing, there are 128 div 32=4 multiples of 32, 128 div 64=2 multiples of 64, and one single multiple of 128. Therefore, the number of factors 2 that appear in the factorization of the number B is68+34+17+8+4+2+1=134Now, we just need to count the number of factors 5. For this, we follow the same process as above. There are 135 div 5=27 multiples of 5, 125 div 25=5 multiples of 25, and one single multiple of 125. Therefore, the number of factors 5 is27+5+1=33Therefore, since the number of factors 5 is less than the number of factors 2, it means that the number B ends in 33 zeros."},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinates of the point P(-3,2) with respect to the x-axis are ( ).A: (2,-3)B: (-2,3)C: (-3,2)D: (-3,-2)","solution":"To find the coordinates of the point P(-3,2) with respect to the x-axis, we need to understand how reflection across the x-axis affects a point's coordinates. Reflecting a point across the x-axis changes the sign of the y-coordinate but keeps the x-coordinate the same.Given the point P(-3,2), reflecting it across the x-axis involves changing the sign of the y-coordinate from 2 to -2, while keeping the x-coordinate as -3. Therefore, the coordinates of the point P with respect to the x-axis are:(-3,2) rightarrow (-3,-2)Thus, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Let the set I={x mid |x|<3, xin mathbb{Z}}, A={1,2}, B={-2,-1,2}.

This complement includes all the elements from I that are not in B. As B={-2, -1, 2}, the complement complement_IB must include the elements of I which are {0, 1}, since 0 and 1 are not in B.Having A={1,2}, we want to form the union between A and complement_IB. The union of the sets A and complement_IB combines all unique elements from both sets, hence Acup (complement_IB) = {1, 2} cup {0, 1}.By combining these sets, we get the unique elements {0, 1, 2} since 1 is the common element in both sets and is only counted once.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{{0, 1, 2}}."},{"problem":"The reciprocal of -frac{1}{7} isA: frac{1}{7}B: -frac{1}{7}C: 7D: -7","solution":"To find the reciprocal of -frac{1}{7}, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by -frac{1}{7}, gives us 1.

Understanding the Problem:   - Each subset must have at least 2004 elements.   - The intersection of any two distinct subsets must have exactly 2004 elements.2. Considering Subsets with 2006 Elements:   - If a subset has 2006 elements, it is the entire set ( A ).   - There can be at most one such subset because any other subset would have to intersect with it in all 2006 elements, which contradicts the requirement of having exactly 2004 elements in the intersection.3. Considering Subsets with 2005 Elements:   - Let’s denote a subset with 2005 elements as ( S ).   - If ( S ) is missing one element from ( A ), say ( a ), then ( S = A setminus {a} ).   - Any other subset ( T ) with 2005 elements must miss a different element, say ( b ), so ( T = A setminus {b} ).   - The intersection ( S cap T ) will be ( A setminus {a, b} ), which has exactly 2004 elements.   - There are 2006 such subsets, each missing a different element from ( A ).4. Considering Subsets with 2004 Elements:   - Let’s denote a subset with 2004 elements as ( U ).   - If ( U ) is missing two elements from ( A ), say ( a ) and ( b ), then ( U = A setminus {a, b} ).   - Any other subset ( V ) with 2004 elements must miss a different pair of elements, say ( c ) and ( d ), so ( V = A setminus {c, d} ).   - The intersection ( U cap V ) will be ( A setminus {a, b, c, d} ), which has 2002 elements, not 2004.   - Therefore, subsets with 2004 elements cannot be used.5. Conclusion:   - The maximal number of subsets of ( A ) such that the intersection of any two distinct subsets has exactly 2004 elements is achieved by considering subsets with 2005 elements.   - There are 2006 such subsets, each missing a different element from ( A ).The final answer is (boxed{2006})."},{"problem":"Determine the range of values for a such that the inequality (a-2)x^{2}+2(a-2)x-4 < 0 is always true with respect to x.","solution":"Let f(x)=(a-2)x^{2}+2(a-2)x-4.

Let's find the antiderivative of the given function:F=int(2 x+4) d x=x^{2}+4 x+CConsider, for example, the antiderivatives F_{1}=x^{2}+4 x, F_{2}=x^{2}+4 x+2, F_{3}=x^{2}+4 x-1, and compute the increment of each of them on the interval [-2,0]: quad F_{1}(0)-F_{1}(-2)=0-(-4)=4 ; quad F_{2}(0)-F_{2}(-2)=2-(-2)=4 ; F_{3}(0)-F_{3}(-2)=1-(-5)=4. Thus, the increments of these antiderivatives are equal to each other.Now consider the increment of any antiderivative F=x^{2}+4 x+ +C on the interval [-2,0]. We haveleft(x^{2}+4 x+Cright)_{x=0}-left(x^{2}+4 x+Cright)_{x=-2}=4Therefore, the increment of any antiderivative of the function f(x)= =2 x+4 when x changes from -2 to 0 is 4, i.e., the increments of all antiderivatives of this function are equal to each other and do not depend on C.Let's find the increment of any antiderivative of the function f(x) when the argument x changes from x=a to x=b:(F(x)+C)_{x=b}-(F(x)+C)_{x=0}=F(b)-F(a)The obtained result means that when the argument x changes from x=a to x=b, all antiderivatives of the given function have the same increment, equal to F(b)-F(a).This increment is called the definite integral.Definition 2.

For 80 units of type A and 100 units of type B robots sorting a total of 8200 packages in one hour, we have:[80x + 100y = 8200]2. For 50 units of type A and 50 units of type B robots sorting a total of 4500 packages in one hour, we have:[50x + 50y = 4500]To solve this system, we first simplify the second equation:[50x + 50y = 4500 implies x + y = 90]Now, we can express y in terms of x from the simplified equation:[y = 90 - x]Substituting y = 90 - x into the first equation:[80x + 100(90 - x) = 8200][80x + 9000 - 100x = 8200][-20x = -800][x = 40]Substituting x = 40 back into y = 90 - x:[y = 90 - 40][y = 50]Therefore, each unit of type A robot can sort boxed{40} packages per hour, and each unit of type B robot can sort boxed{50} packages per hour.# Part 2: Maximizing the Number of Type A Robots for Enhanced EfficiencyLet m represent the number of units of type A robots to be purchased, then the number of units of type B robots to be purchased is (200 - m).

Therefore, there are 2^{10} = 1024 possible outcomes.Now, computing this probability directly seems a little hard, so let's compute the complement -- the probability that there is an undefeated team, a winless team, or both.The number of ways that we can have an undefeated team is 5 cdot 2^6, as there are five ways to choose the team itself and 2^6 outcomes for the games that are not concerning the undefeated team. Reversing all the wings to losses yields a winless team, so this situation is symmetrical to the first one. Therefore, there are 5 cdot 2^6 + 5 cdot 2^6 ways for an undefeated or winless team.In the process, however, we have accidentally overcounted the scenario of both an undefeated and winless team. There are 5 cdot 4 cdot 2^3 ways for this scenario to happen, because there are five ways to choose the undefeated team, four ways for the winless, and three games that don't concern either of the teams. Therefore, there are 5 cdot 2^6 + 5 cdot 2^6 - 5 cdot 4 cdot 2^3 = 480 ways to have an undefeated and/or winless team, so there are 1024 - 480 = 544 to not have any.Our probability is thus dfrac{544}{1024}, which simplifies to dfrac{17}{32}, for our answer of 17 + 32 = boxed{049}.Solution by Ilikeapos"},{"problem":"3.

Identify the relationship between ( p ) and ( q ):   Given ( p ) and ( q ) are primes such that ( p + 2 = q ). This implies ( q = p + 2 ).2. Conditions for ( 2^n + p ) and ( 2^n + q ) to be primes:   We need ( 2^n + p ) and ( 2^n + q ) to be primes.3. Consider the modulo 3 analysis:   Assume ( p ) and ( q ) are not divisible by 3. Then ( p ) and ( q ) must be ( 1 ) and ( 2 pmod{3} ) (not necessarily in that order). Since ( q = p + 2 ), if ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( q equiv 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is a contradiction because ( q ) is prime and not equal to 3. Therefore, one of ( p ) or ( q ) must be 3.4.

Prove that no ( n > 3 ) works:   Since ( 2^n ) must be ( 2 pmod{3} ), ( n ) must be odd. Taking modulo 5, we get that ( n ) is not ( 1 pmod{4} ) unless ( n = 1 ), which is already a solution. So assume ( n equiv 3 pmod{4} ).8. Consider modulo 7:   ( 2^n ) is not ( 4 pmod{7} ), so ( n ne 2 pmod{3} ). Also, ( 2^n ) is not ( 2 pmod{7} ), so ( n ne 1 pmod{3} ). Thus, ( 3 | n ).

So ( 2^n + 5 = 13 implies 2^n = 8 implies n = 3 ), which is already a solution.Thus, the only solutions are ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 3 ).The final answer is ( boxed{n = 1, 3} )."},{"problem":"Moor has 3 different shirts, labeled T, E, and A.

Then, the captain must distribute the same number of coins to each of the pirates in this group, in such a way that it is not possible to give each of them any of the remaining coins (respecting the fact that each pirate receives the same amount). The remaining coins are then given to the captain. On Captain Barbarossa's ship, there are 100 pirates (excluding the captain). Barbarossa must divide a treasure that contains fewer than 1000 coins.

When Barbaroxa chooses 99 pirates to divide the N coins, 51 coins are left for him, that is, he can divide N-51 coins among 99 pirates, or equivalently, the number N-51 is divisible by 99. In particular, the number N-51+99=N+48 is also divisible by 99.Similarly, we can conclude that N-29 is divisible by 77. Therefore, the number N-29+77=N+48 is also divisible by 77. Since N+48 is divisible by 77 and 99, then N+48 is divisible by the least common multiple of 77 and 99, which is 693.We conclude that N+48 is a multiple of 693 less than 1000+48=1048, and thus N+48=693.

The eccentricity formula for an ellipse is e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}}. Setting e = frac{1}{2}, we get frac{1}{2} = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}}. Squaring both sides gives frac{1}{4} = 1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}, which simplifies to frac{b^2}{a^2} = frac{3}{4}. Thus, if we let a = 2c, then b^2 = frac{3}{4}a^2 = 3c^2, leading to the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{4c^2} + frac{y^2}{3c^2} = 1.Given that triangle AF_{1}F_{2} is an equilateral triangle, the angle between AF_{2} and the horizontal is 60^circ, making the angle between DE and the horizontal 30^circ since DE is perpendicular to AF_{2}. Thus, the slope of DE is k_{DE} = tan 30^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}.For the line DE passing through F_{1} and perpendicular to AF_{2}, we can express it as y = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}(x+c), considering F_{1} has coordinates (-c, 0).Substituting y = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}(x+c) into the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{4c^2} + frac{y^2}{3c^2} = 1 and simplifying, we get 13x^2 + 8cx - 32c^2 = 0. Applying Vieta's formulas, we find {x}_{1}+{x}_{2} = -frac{8c}{13} and {x}_{1}{x}_{2} = -frac{32{c}^{2}}{13}.The distance |DE| can be calculated using the formula for the distance between two points on a line with slope k: |DE| = sqrt{k^2 + 1}|{x}_{1}-{x}_{2}|. Substituting k = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} and simplifying using Vieta's formulas, we find |DE| = sqrt{frac{4}{3}} cdot sqrt{(-frac{8c}{13})^{2} + frac{128{c}^{2}}{13}} = frac{48}{13}c.

By comparing the coefficients of the highest terms on both sides of (1), we have a_{t} b_{m}=1. Thus, a_{i}=b_{m}= pm 1. Without loss of generality, assume a_{t}=b_{m}=1. If a_{t}=b_{m}=-1, consider f(x)=(-g(x)) cdot(-h(x)). By comparing the constant terms on both sides of (1), we know a_{0} b_{0}=p q. Since p, q are two different primes, assume p divides b_{0}.

What is the least value of n such that for any colouring of the edges of the graph , there will exist at least one monochromatic 4 cycle ?","solution":"1. Step 1: Verify the case for ( n = 4 )   We need to show that there exists a coloring of the edges of ( K_{4,4} ) that avoids any monochromatic ( C_4 ) (4-cycle). Consider the following coloring:      - Vertices on the left side: ( {0, 1, 2, 3} )   - Vertices on the right side: ( {0, 1, 2, 3} )      Connect vertex ( i ) on the left to:   - Vertices ( i ) and ( i+1 ) (mod 4) on the right with blue edges.   - Vertices ( i+2 ) and ( i+3 ) (mod 4) on the right with red edges.      This coloring avoids any monochromatic ( C_4 ). Therefore, ( n = 4 ) does not guarantee a monochromatic ( C_4 ).2. Step 2: Prove the case for ( n = 5 )   We need to show that for any coloring of the edges of ( K_{5,5} ), there will always be a monochromatic ( C_4 ). Enumerate the vertices of one partite set as ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). Let ( r_i ) be the number of red edges from vertex ( i ) and ( b_i ) be the number of blue edges from vertex ( i ). Note that ( r_i + b_i = 5 ) for each ( i ).3. Step 3: Count the number of monochromatic ( K_{2,2} )   A ( 4 )-cycle is just a ( K_{2,2} ). If two vertices are connected with red (or blue) edges to two other vertices, we have a monochromatic ( K_{2,2} ). The number of such triples ( (u, v, w) ) where ( w ) is from the chosen partite set and ( u, v ) are from the other partite set such that both edges ( uw ) and ( vw ) are red is at most ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ).4. Step 4: Use combinatorial arguments   The number of such triples is exactly ( sum_{i} binom{r_i}{2} ). Therefore, we have:   [   binom{5}{2} geq sum_{i} binom{r_i}{2}   ]   Similarly, for blue edges:   [   binom{5}{2} geq sum_{i} binom{b_i}{2}   ]5. Step 5: Apply convexity   Since ( r_i + b_i = 5 ), by convexity, we have:   [   binom{r_i}{2} + binom{b_i}{2} geq 4   ]   with equality only when ( r_i in {2, 3} ).6. Step 6: Sum the inequalities   Adding the two bounds obtained earlier:   [   2 binom{5}{2} = 5 cdot 4 = 20   ]   This implies:   [   binom{5}{2} = sum_{i} binom{r_i}{2}   ]   and each ( r_i in {2, 3} ).7. Step 7: Check for contradiction   If ( r_i in {2, 3} ), then ( binom{r_i}{2} ) is odd. Summing five odd numbers should yield an odd number, but ( 10 = binom{5}{2} ) is even.

This implies that the axis of symmetry of the parabola represented by f(x) is midway between x=-10 and x=12. The axis of symmetry of a parabola given by y=ax^2+bx+c is x=-frac{b}{2a}. In our case, since f(-10)=f(12), the axis of symmetry is at x=frac{-10+12}{2}=1.Given that f(x)=0 has two positive real roots x_{1} and x_{2}, we can use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0, the sum of the roots x_{1}+x_{2}=-frac{b}{a}. Since the axis of symmetry is x=1, and the roots are positive and equidistant from the axis of symmetry, we have x_{1}+x_{2}=2.We are asked to find the minimum value of frac{1}{{x}_{1}}+frac{1}{{x}_{2}}. We can manipulate this expression as follows:begin{align*}frac{1}{{x}_{1}}+frac{1}{{x}_{2}} &= frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{{x}_{1}}+frac{1}{{x}_{2}}right)(x_{1}+x_{2}) &= frac{1}{2}left(2+frac{{x}_{1}}{{x}_{2}}+frac{{x}_{2}}{{x}_{1}}right) &geqslant frac{1}{2}left(2+2sqrt{frac{{x}_{1}}{{x}_{2}}cdotfrac{{x}_{2}}{{x}_{1}}}right) &= 2.end{align*}The inequality step uses the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative real numbers a and b, frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}, with equality if and only if a=b.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that odot(alpha_1, alpha_2) neq odot(alpha_3) and odot(beta_1, beta_2) neq odot(beta_3). This implies that a and b must be even, as the sum of products of pairs of roots must be even.3. Reduction to smaller cases:   Since a and b are even, we can write alpha_i = 2q_i and beta_i = 2p_i for integers q_i and p_i.

Infinite Descent:   Since a and b are even, we can continue this process, reducing a and b by factors of 2 each time. This leads to an infinite descent, which is impossible unless a = 0 and b = 0.5. Conclusion:   The only solution that avoids the infinite descent is (a, b) = (0, 0). Substituting a = 0 and b = 0 into the original polynomials, we get:   [   x^3 = 0,   ]   which has the roots 0, 0, 0 for both polynomials.Thus, the only pair (a, b) that satisfies the given conditions is (0, 0).The final answer is (boxed{(0, 0)})"},{"problem":"8.

Establishing the GCD conditions:   Since ( p ) is an odd prime and ( p mid ab + 1 ), ( p mid ac + 1 ), and ( p mid bc + 1 ), it follows that ( gcd(a, p) = gcd(b, p) = gcd(c, p) = 1 ). This is because if any of ( a, b, ) or ( c ) shared a common factor with ( p ), then ( ab + 1 ), ( ac + 1 ), or ( bc + 1 ) would not be divisible by ( p ).2. Assuming ( a > b > c ):   Without loss of generality, assume ( a > b > c ). We can use the given conditions to derive relationships between ( a, b, ) and ( c ).3. Using the divisibility conditions:   From ( p mid (ab + 1) - (bc + 1) ), we get:   [   p mid ab + 1 - (bc + 1) = b(a - c)   ]   Since ( p ) is a prime and ( gcd(b, p) = 1 ), it follows that ( p mid (a - c) ).   Similarly, from ( p mid (ac + 1) - (bc + 1) ), we get:   [   p mid ac + 1 - (bc + 1) = c(a - b)   ]   Since ( p ) is a prime and ( gcd(c, p) = 1 ), it follows that ( p mid (a - b) ).   Finally, from ( p mid (ab + 1) - (ac + 1) ), we get:   [   p mid ab + 1 - (ac + 1) = a(b - c)   ]   Since ( p ) is a prime and ( gcd(a, p) = 1 ), it follows that ( p mid (b - c) ).4. Expressing ( a, b, ) and ( c ) in terms of ( p ):   Since ( p mid (a - c) ), ( p mid (a - b) ), and ( p mid (b - c) ), we can write:   [   a = jp + n, quad b = hp + n, quad c = gp + n   ]   where ( j > h > g ) and ( 0 leq n < p ).5.

Let the three-digit number be represented as overline{abc}, where a, b, and c are its digits. The number can be expressed as 100a + 10b + c.2. When the digits are reversed, the number becomes overline{cba}, which can be expressed as 100c + 10b + a.3. We need to find the smallest three-digit number such that the sum of the original number and the reversed number consists of only odd digits. Therefore, we need to consider the sum:   [   (100a + 10b + c) + (100c + 10b + a) = 101a + 20b + 101c = 101(a + c) + 20b   ]4. For the resulting number to consist of only odd digits, each digit in the sum must be odd. Let's analyze the conditions for each digit:   - The units digit of the sum is determined by a + c.   - The tens digit of the sum is determined by 2b.   - The hundreds digit of the sum is determined by a + c (with possible carry from the tens place).5. For the units digit to be odd, a + c must be odd. This implies that one of a or c must be even, and the other must be odd.6. For the tens digit to be odd, 2b must be odd. However, since 2b is always even, this implies that b must be such that 2b results in an odd digit when considering the carry from the units place. This means b must be less than or equal to 4 to avoid a carry that would make the tens digit even.7. For the hundreds digit to be odd, a + c must be odd and greater than or equal to 10 to ensure that the sum does not carry over to the next place.8. Let's find the smallest values for a, b, and c that satisfy these conditions:   - Since a + c geq 10 and a + c is odd, the smallest possible values for a and c are 1 and 9, respectively (or vice versa).   - The smallest value for b that keeps 2b within the range of a single digit and avoids carry is b = 0.9. Therefore, the smallest three-digit number that satisfies these conditions is overline{abc} = 109.10. Verify the solution:    [    109 + 901 = 1010    ]    The resulting number 1010 does not consist of only odd digits. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our choice of a, b, and c.11.

Analyze the diagonals: Note that the diagonals of the table can be categorized into two types:   - Diagonals parallel to the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).   - Diagonals parallel to the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).3. Count the diagonals: There are 24 odd-length diagonals in total. This is because each main diagonal has 12 diagonals, and among these, the lengths alternate between odd and even.

Thus, the difference sought is at most 30 and cannot be 30, so it is at most 29.## Construction:Conversely, in the following configuration where each dwarf is represented with their number of nuggets, we verify that the conditions of the problem are satisfied and that the difference between the dwarf with the most nuggets and the dwarf with the least nuggets is exactly 29.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_17def46ea4e6119381e4g-19.jpg?height=605&width=625&top_left_y=340&top_left_x=721)Comment from the graders: The exercise was more or less well done by the students, with many partial solutions. Many students drew the configuration they thought was the best, which is very good. A common mistake found in many papers was to think that trying to \\"maximize the difference as much as possible\\" was a complete proof: it is necessary to demonstrate that it is not possible to do better, and the mere fact of not being able to achieve it should not be considered a proof. Finally, it is regrettable that many students overlooked some of the constraints in the problem statement: one cannot emphasize enough the importance of reading it carefully."},{"problem":"Question 45: Given x in R, find the maximum value of frac{sin x(2-cos x)}{5-4 cos x}.Translate the above text into English, please retain the original text's line breaks and format, and output the translation result directly.","solution":"Question 45, Solution Method One: Let M=frac{sin x(2-cos x)}{5-4 cos x}, and let a=5-4 cos x, then a in[1, 9],begin{array}{l}M^{2}=frac{left(1-cos ^{2} xright)(2-cos x)^{2}}{(5-4 cos x)^{2}}=frac{left(1-cos ^{2} xright)(2-cos x)^{2}}{(5-4 cos x)^{2}}=frac{left[1-left(frac{5-a}{4}right)^{2}right]left(2 frac{5-a}{4}right)^{2}}{a^{2}}=frac{1}{16^{2}} cdot frac{(9-a)(a-1)(3+a)^{2}}{a^{2}} leq frac{1}{16} cdot frac{left.left[frac{(9-a)+(3+a)}{2}right]^{2} times frac{1}{3} frac{3(a-1)+(3+a)}{2}right]^{2}}{a^{2}}=frac{1}{16^{2}} cdot frac{6^{2} times frac{1}{3}(2 a)^{2}}{a^{2}}=frac{3}{16}end{array}Therefore, M leq frac{sqrt{3}}{4}, with equality when a=3 Leftrightarrow cos x=frac{1}{2}.Given x in mathbb{R}, find the maximum value of frac{sin x(2-cos x)}{5-4 cos x}.Solution Method Two: Let M=frac{sin x(2-cos x)}{5-4 cos x}, and let a=5-4 cos x, then a in[1, 9], andbegin{array}{l}text { Solution Method Two: Let } M=frac{sin x(2-cos x)}{5-4 cos x}, text { and let } a=5-4 cos x, text { then } a in[1, 9], text { and } M^{2}=frac{left(1-cos ^{2} xright)(2-cos x)^{2}}{(5-4 cos x)^{2}}=frac{left(1-cos ^{2} xright)(2-cos x)^{2}}{(5-4 cos x)^{2}}=frac{left[1-left(frac{5-a}{4}right)^{2}right]left(2-frac{5-2}{4}right)^{2}}{a^{2}}=frac{1}{16^{2}} cdot frac{(9-a)(a-1)(3+a)^{2}}{a^{2}} =frac{1}{16^{2}} cdotleft(10-left(a+frac{9}{a}right)right)left(a+frac{9}{a}+6right) leq frac{3}{16}end{array}Therefore, M leq frac{sqrt{3}}{4}, with equality when a=3 Leftrightarrow cos x=frac{1}{2}.Solution Method Three: Let M=frac{sin x(2-cos x)}{5-4 cos x}, thenM^{2}=frac{sin ^{2} x(2-cos x)^{2}}{left(sin ^{2} x+(2-cos x)^{2}right)^{2}}=frac{left(frac{sin x}{2-cos x}right)^{2}}{left(left(frac{sin x}{2-cos x}right)^{2}+1right)^{2}}=frac{1}{left(frac{sin x}{2-cos x}right)^{2}+2+frac{1}{left(frac{sin x}{2-cos x}right)^{2}}}Let t=frac{sin x}{2-cos x}, then 2 t=t cdot cos x+sin x leq sqrt{t^{2}+1} Rightarrow t^{2} leq frac{1}{3}, henceM^{2}=frac{1}{t^{2}+2+frac{1}{t^{2}}} leq frac{1}{frac{1}{3}+2+3}=frac{3}{16}Therefore, M leq frac{sqrt{3}}{4}, with equality when a=3 Leftrightarrow cos x=frac{1}{2}."},{"problem":"2.

Understanding Pseudo-Ultrafilters:   A pseudo-ultrafilter ( U ) is a nonempty subset of ( X ) (the set of positive divisors of ( N ) other than 1) that satisfies:   - If ( a ) divides ( b ) and ( a in U ), then ( b in U ).   - If ( a, b in U ), then ( gcd(a, b) in U ).   - If ( a, b notin U ), then ( operatorname{lcm}(a, b) notin U ).3. Pseudo-Ultrafilters for Prime Powers:   Consider a prime power ( p^a ). The number of pseudo-ultrafilters of ( p^a ) is ( a ). This is because:   - Each pseudo-ultrafilter can be formed by choosing any subset of the divisors of ( p^a ) that includes all higher powers if a lower power is included.   - For example, for ( p^3 ), the divisors are ( {p, p^2, p^3} ). The pseudo-ultrafilters are ( {p}, {p^2}, {p^3} ).4. Combining Different Prime Powers:   Given ( N = 2^{10} times 3^5 times 5^2 times 7 times 11 ), we need to consider the pseudo-ultrafilters for each prime power separately. The key observation is that two different primes (or their powers) cannot be in the same pseudo-ultrafilter because their gcd would be 1, which is not in ( X ).5.

We start with the given equation:   [   binom{2014}{m} + binom{m}{r} = binom{2014}{r} + binom{2014-r}{m-r}   ]2. We know that the binomial coefficient binom{n}{k} represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. Therefore, the equation can be interpreted combinatorially.3. Consider the combinatorial identity:   [   binom{2014}{m} binom{m}{r} = binom{2014}{r} binom{2014-r}{m-r}   ]   This identity holds because both sides count the number of ways to choose a group of r elements and then a group of m-r elements from a set of 2014 elements.4. Given that both sides of the equation are equal, we can infer that:   [   binom{2014}{m} + binom{m}{r} = binom{2014}{r} + binom{2014-r}{m-r}   ]   This implies that the sum of the binomial coefficients on both sides must be equal.5. We need to find pairs (m, r) such that the above equation holds. We consider the cases where the binomial coefficients are equal:   - Case 1: binom{2014}{m} = binom{2014}{r}   - Case 2: binom{m}{r} = binom{2014}{r}6. For Case 1:   [   binom{2014}{m} = binom{2014}{r}   ]   This implies that m = r or m = 2014 - r because binom{n}{k} = binom{n}{n-k}.7. For Case 2:   [   binom{m}{r} = binom{2014}{r}   ]   This implies that m = 2014 because binom{2014}{r} is the binomial coefficient for choosing r elements from 2014 elements, and binom{m}{r} can only equal this if m = 2014.8.

This is satisfied, for example, for x=y=2.We conclude that the desired values are -2 and 1.Alternative approach. It is also possible to find the desired form of the given relation with less algebraic manipulation. We describe a possible approach here.Dividing by x^{3} y^{3} givesfrac{1}{x^{3}}+frac{1}{y^{3}}+frac{3}{x y}=1Here we already see something with frac{1}{x} and frac{1}{y} in it. We substitute a=frac{1}{x} and b=frac{1}{y} to make the notation easier. Then we havea^{3}+b^{3}+3 a b=1and we are looking for the value of a+b. There are probably solutions with a=b. We get 2 a^{3}+3 a^{2}=1. Trying numbers or factoring this gives that a=-1 and a=frac{1}{2} satisfy it. Now a+b is equal to -2 or 1. We can now guess that perhaps all pairs (a, b) with a+b=-2 or all pairs (a, b) with a+b=1 work;then the expression would be divisible by a+b+2 or a+b-1, respectively. Trying shows that the latter is indeed the case. We can rewrite it as(a+b-1)left(a^{2}+b^{2}-a b+a+b+1right)=0We also know by now that a+b=-2 does not give a solution for all a and b, but does for a=b=-1. So we would want something with a+1 and b+1 for the right factor. It is now easy to see that the right factor is the sum of three squares. We can now finish it (similar to above)."},{"problem":"2.

Firstly, we notice that frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{a+b}{ab} = frac{4}{ab}.2. This gives frac{4}{ab} geq 1 since a+b=4 and ab leq 4.3.

Therefore, the third smallest positive divisor of n is not p^{2}.Thus, it must be some prime q(q>p).It is easy to see that frac{n}{p q} in mathbf{Z}.Then f(n)=1+p+q equiv 1+p(bmod q),g(n)=n+frac{n}{p}=q(1+p) frac{n}{p q}(bmod q).Hence (1+p)^{k} equiv f^{k}(n)=g(n) equiv 0(bmod q).Since q is a prime, we have q mid(1+p).Thus, p<q leqslant 1+p, which implies p=2, q=3.At this point, 6^{k}=f^{k}(n)=g(n)=frac{3}{2} n.Solving this, we get n=4 times 6^{k-1}.The rest is the same as Solution 1."},{"problem":"Xiaoqiang is a fan of password encryption.

Define the Set and Function:   Let ( S = { a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_{2004} } ) be a set of 2004 elements. Each element ( a_i ) satisfies ( f(a_i) < 2003 ) and ( f(a_i) = f(a_j) ) for all ( i, j ) in ( {1, 2, ldots, 2004} ), where ( f(a_i) ) denotes the number of elements that are relatively prime to ( a_i ).2. Graph Representation:   Construct a graph ( G_{2004} ) with 2004 vertices, where each vertex ( u_i ) corresponds to an element ( a_i ) from the set ( S ). Connect vertices ( u_i ) and ( u_j ) if ( gcd(a_i, a_j) > 1 ).3. Degree of Vertices:   Since ( f(a_i) ) is the number of elements relatively prime to ( a_i ), the number of elements not relatively prime to ( a_i ) is ( 2004 - f(a_i) ). Given ( f(a_i) < 2003 ), we have ( 2004 - f(a_i) geq 1 ). Thus, each vertex in ( G_{2004} ) has a degree ( t geq 1 ).4. Finding the Least ( k ):   We need to find the smallest ( k ) such that in every ( k )-subset of ( S ), there are two distinct elements with a greatest common divisor greater than 1. This translates to finding the smallest ( k ) such that every subgraph ( G_k ) of ( G_{2004} ) has at least one vertex with a non-zero degree.5. Analyzing the Degree:   If ( t = 2 ), then the average degree of the graph is 2. For a subgraph ( G_{1003} ), if all vertices had degree 0, they would only be connected to vertices in ( G_{1001} ) (the remaining vertices in ( G_{2004} )). This would imply ( 1003t ) edges connecting ( G_{1003} ) to ( G_{1001} ), but since each vertex in ( G_{1001} ) has degree ( t ), there can be at most ( 1001t ) such edges, leading to a contradiction.6. Conclusion:   Therefore, in every subgraph ( G_{1003} ) of ( G_{2004} ), there must be at least one vertex with a degree not less than 1.

Find the greatest possible number of unit segments with endpoints at vertices of the small triangles that can be chosen so that no three of them are sides of a single triangle.","solution":"1. Claim: The answer is ( n(n+1) ).2. Complementary Counting: We will use complementary counting to find the minimum number of segments that can be chosen so that every unit equilateral triangle has at least one chosen edge. To minimize this number, we must choose the segments such that:   - Each unit triangle has exactly one edge chosen.   - As many segments as possible belong to two triangles rather than just one (so that we kill two birds with one stone).3. Coloring the Triangles: Color all of the upward-facing triangles black and all of the downward-facing triangles white. There are (frac{n(n+1)}{2}) black triangles and (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) white triangles.4. Choosing Segments: For each white triangle, choose a black triangle (not already chosen) that is adjacent to the white triangle, and choose the segment that is shared by both triangles. This gives (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) segments chosen (one from each black triangle-white triangle pair).5. Remaining Black Triangles: There are now (frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n) black triangles that do not belong to any pair. Choose one segment from each of these triangles, for a total of (n) additional segments. This means that (frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}) segments is the minimum.6. Total Number of Unit Segments: Finally, it is necessary to calculate the total number of unit segments in the figure. No two black triangles share an edge, and it can be seen that all of the unit segments in the figure belong to exactly one black equilateral triangle. This means that the total number of unit segments in the figure is (3left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right)).7. Final Calculation: The total number of unit segments is (3left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right) = frac{3n(n+1)}{2}). Subtracting the minimum number of segments chosen, we get:   [   frac{3n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1)   ]Thus, the greatest possible number of unit segments with endpoints at vertices of the small triangles that can be chosen so that no three of them are sides of a single triangle is ( n(n+1) ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n(n+1) } )"},{"problem":"1.

A circle is inscribed in trapezoid A B C D, touching the lateral side A D at point K. Find the area of the trapezoid if A K=16, D K=4 and C D=6.","solution":"Answer: 432.Solution. Let L, M, N be the points of tangency of the inscribed circle with the sides BC, AB, CD respectively; let I be the center of the inscribed circle. Denote the radius of the circle by r. Immediately note that DN = DK = 4 (the first equality follows from the equality of the segments of tangents), hence CL = CN = CD - DN = 2 (the second is obvious). Since I is the point of intersection of the bisectors of the internal angles of the trapezoid, then angle IAD + angle IDA = frac{angle DAB + angle DAC}{2} = frac{180^{circ}}{2} = 90^{circ}, where the penultimate equality follows from the parallelism of the lines AB and CD. Therefore, triangle AID is right-angled and angle AID = 90^{circ}. Similarly, triangle BIC is also right-angled. Further, since IK and IL are radii drawn to the points of tangency, then angle IKD = 90^{circ} and angle ILB = 90^{circ}. Therefore, IK and IL are altitudes in triangles AID and BIC respectively.We use the known fact that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the altitude dropped to the hypotenuse equals the product of the segments into which it divides the hypotenuse. Then IK^2 = AK cdot KD = 16 cdot 4 = 64 = 8^2, i.e., r = IK = 8, and also 8^2 = IL^2 = CL cdot LB = 2 cdot LB, i.e., LB = 32. Now we have everything to find the area.

Let's break down the solution step by step:1. Condition for Real Roots in Quadratic Equations: A quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 has real roots if and only if its discriminant Delta = b^2 - 4ac geq 0.2. Applying the Condition to Equation ①: For the equation 2023x^2 - S_{2023}x + T_{2023} = 0, the condition for real roots translates to S_{2023}^2 - 4 times 2023 times T_{2023} geq 0.3.

We also need to find the smallest such ( k_0 ).2. Analyzing the number of regions formed by lines:    - For ( n ) lines in general position (no two lines are parallel and no three lines are concurrent), the maximum number of regions ( R(n) ) formed is given by:     [     R(n) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1     ]   - For example:     - 1 line divides the plane into 2 regions.     - 2 lines (if not parallel) divide the plane into 4 regions.     - 3 lines (if no two are parallel and no three are concurrent) divide the plane into 7 regions.     - 4 lines (in general position) divide the plane into 11 regions.     - 5 lines (in general position) divide the plane into 16 regions.3. Special cases with fewer regions:   - If some lines are parallel or concurrent, the number of regions decreases.   - For 5 lines:     - If one pair is parallel, we get 15 regions.     - If two pairs are parallel, we get 14 regions.     - If one triple is parallel, we get 13 regions.     - If two pairs are parallel and the fifth line intersects at two points, we get 12 regions.4.

Therefore, the ordinate of point B is 3.Now, considering the length of AB is 5, we have two scenarios based on the position of point B relative to point A:1. When point B is to the left of point A:   - The distance between A and B is 5 units.   - Since B is to the left, we subtract 5 from the x-coordinate of A.   - Therefore, the abscissa of point B is -1 - 5 = -6.   - In this case, the coordinates of point B are (-6, 3).2.

The sum of the six scores therefore lies between 15 cdot 2=30 (all matches end in a draw) and 15 cdot 3=45 (no match ends in a draw).The sum of the six scores is also equal to a+(a+1)+cdots+(a+5)=15+6a. We see that 30 leqslant 15+6a leqslant 45, so 3 leqslant a leqslant 5. We will prove that only a=4 is possible.First, consider the case a=5. The total number of points is then 15+30=45, so no match ends in a draw. In each match, a team earns either 0 or 3 points, so all scores are divisible by 3. The scores cannot therefore be six consecutive numbers.Now consider the case a=3. The sum of the scores is 3+4+5+6+7+8=33. The teams with 6 and 7 points have each won at least one of their five matches.The team with 8 points has even won at least twice, because 3+1+1+1+1=7<8. Therefore, there are at least 4 matches that did not end in a draw, so the sum of the scores is at least 4 cdot 3+11 cdot 2=34. But we already saw that this sum is equal to 33.

Let's analyze the problem step by step.1. Distinct Primes:   Since (x, y, z) are distinct positive prime integers, the differences (x - y, y - z, x - z) must also be positive primes. Note that 2 is the only even prime number, so at most one of (x, y, z) can be even.2. Case 1: All Odd Primes:   If (x, y, z) are all odd primes, then (x - y, y - z, x - z) are even numbers. The only even prime is 2, so:   [   x - y = 2, quad y - z = 2 implies x - z = 4   ]   However, 4 is not a prime number. Therefore, this case is not possible.3.

Let's break down the solution step by step.1. Expressing the condition in terms of complex conjugates:   Since ( |z| = 1 ), we have ( overline{z} = frac{1}{z} ). Therefore, the condition ( z^{720} - z^{120} ) being real can be written as:   [   z^{720} - z^{120} = overline{z^{720} - z^{120}} = frac{1}{z^{720}} - frac{1}{z^{120}} = frac{z^{120} - z^{720}}{z^{840}}   ]2. Simplifying the equation:   This implies:   [   z^{840}(z^{720} - z^{120}) = z^{120} - z^{720}   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   z^{840} (z^{720} - z^{120}) + z^{720} - z^{120} = 0   ]   Factoring out ( z^{720} - z^{120} ), we have:   [   (z^{840} + 1)(z^{720} - z^{120}) = 0   ]3. Solving the factored equation:   This gives us two cases:   - ( z^{720} = z^{120} )   - ( z^{840} = -1 )4. Case 1: ( z^{720} = z^{120} ):   This implies:   [   z^{120}(z^{600} - 1) = 0   ]   Since ( z neq 0 ), we have ( z^{600} = 1 ). The solutions to ( z^{600} = 1 ) are the 600th roots of unity, which are:   [   z = e^{2pi i k / 600} quad text{for} quad k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 599   ]   Thus, there are 600 solutions in this case.5.

Checking for overlaps:   We need to check if there are any overlaps between the solutions of ( z^{600} = 1 ) and ( z^{840} = -1 ). The solutions to ( z^{600} = 1 ) are:   [   z = e^{2pi i k / 600} = e^{ipi k / 300}   ]   The solutions to ( z^{840} = -1 ) are:   [   z = e^{(2ell + 1)pi i / 840}   ]   For these to be equal, we need:   [   frac{k}{300} = frac{2ell + 1}{840}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   840k = 300(2ell + 1) implies 14k = 5(2ell + 1)   ]   This implies:   [   14k = 10ell + 5 implies 14k - 10ell = 5   ]   This is a Diophantine equation.

However, since 14 and 10 are both even, the left-hand side is always even, while the right-hand side is odd, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no integer solutions, and hence no overlaps.7. Counting the total number of solutions:   Since there are no overlaps, the total number of solutions is:   [   N = 600 + 840 = 1440   ]8.

And the number of different pairs of students is -400 * 399 / 2=79800, which is 200 less than the number of greetings. Therefore, at least 200 pairs had 2 greetings. We can show that exactly 200 pairs can be: Let the 1st student greet everyone from the 2nd to the 201st, the 2nd student greet from the 3rd to the 202nd, ... the 200th student greet everyone from the 201st to the 400th, and then the 201st student greet everyone from the 202nd to the 400th and the 1st, the 202nd student greet from the 203rd to the 400th and from the 1st to the 2nd, and so on.

Therefore, after the first transfer of tokens, they had a number of tokens that is a multiple of 2, but then the first player also had a number of tokens that is a multiple of two, since their total number is even.

Consider ( x = p ).     - We have ( p^n equiv p pmod{n} ). This implies ( p(p^{n-1} - 1) equiv 0 pmod{n} ).     - Since ( p ) divides ( n ), ( p ) must divide ( p^{n-1} - 1 ).     - If ( p^2 ) divides ( n ), then ( p^2 ) divides ( p^{n-1} - 1 ), which is not possible because ( p^{n-1} - 1 ) is not divisible by ( p^2 ) (as ( p ) is a prime and ( n-1 geq 1 )).     - Therefore, ( p^2 nmid n ), and ( n ) is squarefree.   - Step 2: Determine the number of prime divisors of ( n ).     - Let ( n = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ) be the prime factorization of ( n ).     - The number of positive divisors of ( n ) is ( 2^k ).     - Given that ( 2^k ) is not a multiple of 8, ( k ) must be less than 3 (since ( 2^3 = 8 )).     - Therefore, ( k leq 2 ).   - Step 3: Consider the cases for ( k = 1 ) and ( k = 2 ).     - If ( k = 1 ), then ( n ) is a prime number.     - If ( k = 2 ), let ( n = pq ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes.     - For all integers ( x ), ( x^{pq} equiv x pmod{pq} ) must hold.     - By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this implies ( x^{pq} equiv x pmod{p} ) and ( x^{pq} equiv x pmod{q} ).     - By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( x^p equiv x pmod{p} ) and ( x^q equiv x pmod{q} ).     - However, ( x^{pq} equiv x pmod{p} ) and ( x^{pq} equiv x pmod{q} ) cannot hold for all ( x ) unless ( p = q ), which contradicts the assumption that ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes.     - Therefore, ( n ) cannot have exactly 2 prime divisors.3.

Rewrite the given equation:   [   y^2 - 1 = a^2(x^2 - 1)   ]   This can be rearranged as:   [   y^2 = a^2x^2 - a^2 + 1   ]2. Assume ( frac{a}{x} < 2 ):   If ( frac{a}{x} < 2 ), then ( a < 2x ). We need to check if this assumption leads to a contradiction.3. Consider the expression ( (ax - 1)^2 + 2ax - a^2 ):   [   (ax - 1)^2 + 2ax - a^2 = y^2   ]   Expanding ( (ax - 1)^2 ):   [   (ax - 1)^2 = a^2x^2 - 2ax + 1   ]   Adding ( 2ax - a^2 ):   [   a^2x^2 - 2ax + 1 + 2ax - a^2 = a^2x^2 - a^2 + 1   ]   Thus, we have:   [   y^2 = a^2x^2 - a^2 + 1   ]4. Check the inequality ( 2ax - a^2 > 0 ):   Since ( 2ax - a^2 > 0 ), we have:   [   2ax > a^2 implies 2x > a implies frac{a}{x} < 2   ]   This is consistent with our assumption.5. Verify the minimum value of ( frac{a}{x} ):   To find the minimum value, we need to check if ( frac{a}{x} = 2 ) is achievable. If ( frac{a}{x} = 2 ), then ( a = 2x ).6. Substitute ( a = 2x ) into the original equation:   [   y^2 - 1 = (2x)^2(x^2 - 1)   ]   Simplifying:   [   y^2 - 1 = 4x^2(x^2 - 1) = 4x^4 - 4x^2   ]   Thus:   [   y^2 = 4x^4 - 4x^2 + 1   ]   We need to check if ( y ) is an integer. Let ( y = 2x^2 - 1 ):   [   y^2 = (2x^2 - 1)^2 = 4x^4 - 4x^2 + 1   ]   This matches the equation, so ( y = 2x^2 - 1 ) is an integer.Therefore, the minimum value of ( frac{a}{x} ) is 2, which can be achieved by choosing ( (x, y, a) = (n, 2n^2 - 1, 2n) ) where ( n > 100 ).The final answer is (boxed{2})"},{"problem":"From 5 students, 4 are to be selected to participate in competitions in four subjects: mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.

Since for any n in mathbb{N}^*, the three numbers A(n), B(n), and C(n) form an arithmetic sequence,   we have B(n) - A(n) = C(n) - B(n),   which means a_{n+1} - a_1 = a_{n+2} - a_2, or equivalently, a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_2 - a_1 = 4.   Therefore, the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 1 and common difference 4, so a_n = 1 + (n-1) times 4 = 4n - 3.   Thus, the general formula for the sequence is boxed{a_n = 4n - 3}.2. Proof:   (Necessity) If the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence with common ratio q, for any n in mathbb{N}^*, we have a_{n+1} = a_nq. Since a_n > 0, A(n), B(n), and C(n) are all greater than 0, so   frac{B(n)}{A(n)} = frac{a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{n+1}}{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n} = frac{q(a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n)}{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n} = q,   frac{C(n)}{B(n)} = frac{a_3 + a_4 + ldots + a_{n+2}}{a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{n+1}} = frac{q(a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{n+1})}{a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{n+1}} = q,   which means frac{B(n)}{A(n)} = frac{C(n)}{B(n)} = q.   Therefore, the three numbers A(n), B(n), and C(n) form a geometric sequence with common ratio q.      (Sufficiency) If for any n in mathbb{N}^*, the three numbers A(n), B(n), and C(n) form a geometric sequence with common ratio q, then   B(n) = qA(n) and C(n) = qB(n),   which leads to C(n) - B(n) = q[B(n) - A(n)], i.e., a_{n+2} - a_2 = q(a_{n+1} - a_1), or equivalently, a_{n+2} - qa_{n+1} = a_2 - qa_1.   When n=1, B(1) = qA(1), which means a_2 = qa_1, thus a_{n+2} - qa_{n+1} = 0.   Since a_n > 0, we have frac{a_{n+2}}{a_{n+1}} = frac{a_2}{a_1} = q. Therefore, the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence with the first term a_1 and common ratio q.      In conclusion, the sequence {a_n} being a geometric sequence with common ratio q is the necessary and sufficient condition for, for any n in mathbb{N}^*, the three numbers A(n), B(n), and C(n) forming a geometric sequence with common ratio q."},{"problem":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n.

We will use graph theory to model the cities and flight routes.1. Model the Problem as a Graph:   - Let ( G = (V, E) ) be a graph where ( V ) represents the set of cities and ( E ) represents the set of flight routes.   - The graph ( G ) is connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices (cities).   - For every pair of cities ( (A, B) ) connected by a direct flight (edge), there exists another city ( C ) such that ( (A, C) ) and ( (B, C) ) are also connected by direct flights. This implies that every edge in the graph is part of a triangle.2. Initial Setup:   - Start with a single vertex ( A ). According to the problem, there must be cities ( B ) and ( C ) such that ( AB ), ( AC ), and ( BC ) are all connected by direct flights. This forms a triangle.3. Development of the Graph:   - Since the graph is connected, there must be a vertex ( D ) outside the initial triangle (system) that is connected to at least one vertex inside the system. Without loss of generality, assume ( D ) is connected to ( A ).   - According to the problem, there must be a vertex ( X ) such that ( (D, X) ) and ( (A, X) ) are connected by direct flights.4. Types of Development:   - M Development: If ( X ) is inside the system, the system gains 2 more edges and 1 more vertex.   - N Development: If ( X ) is outside the system, the system gains 3 more edges and 2 more vertices.5. Graph Expansion:   - We can expand the system by performing ( m ) times M development and ( n ) times N development until the system includes all 2021 vertices.   - The total number of vertices after ( m ) M developments and ( n ) N developments is:     [     3 + m + 2n = 2021     ]     Solving for ( m ) and ( n ):     [     m + 2n = 2018     ]6. Counting Edges:   - The total number of edges after ( m ) M developments and ( n ) N developments is:     [     3 + 2m + 3n     ]   - Substitute ( m = 2018 - 2n ) into the edge count:     [     3 + 2(2018 - 2n) + 3n = 3 + 4036 - 4n + 3n = 4039 - n     ]   - To minimize the number of edges, we need to maximize ( n ). The maximum value of ( n ) occurs when ( m = 0 ), which gives ( n = 1009 ).7. Minimum Number of Edges:   - Substitute ( n = 1009 ) into the edge count:     [     3 + 2(0) + 3(1009) = 3 + 3027 = 3030     ]Thus, the minimum number of flight routes (edges) needed to satisfy the conditions is 3030.The final answer is (boxed{3030})"},{"problem":"In the long development of mathematics, mathematicians have discovered the mysterious phenomenon of \\"black holes\\" in mathematics.

Identify Narcissistic Numbers in Set A: According to the definition of a narcissistic number, any one-digit positive integer n will satisfy the condition n^n = n, meaning all one-digit positive integers are narcissistic numbers. Thus, we can define set A as A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.2. Solve the Inequality for Set B: The given inequality is frac{x^2 - 5x - 3}{2 - x}  0 because when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.3. Find the Values for Set B: Solving the inequality (x+1)(x-5)(x-2) > 0, we find that the critical points are x = -1, 2, 5. By testing intervals, we conclude that x must be in the ranges -1  5.4. Intersect Sets A and B: Given the natural numbers constraint (xin N^{*}), we find that B = {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} because these values satisfy both the inequality and the requirement of being natural numbers.

Since Acap B has 5 elements, the number of non-empty subsets is 2^5 - 1.Thus, the number of non-empty subsets in Acap B is 2^5 - 1 = 31.

We need to find the number of 5-digit positive numbers that contain only odd digits and have at least one pair of consecutive digits whose sum is 10.2. The odd digits are {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. We need to count the total number of 5-digit numbers that can be formed using these digits.3. Each digit in the 5-digit number can be any of the 5 odd digits. Therefore, the total number of 5-digit numbers is:   [   5^5 = 3125   ]4. Next, we count the number of 5-digit numbers that do not have any pair of consecutive digits whose sum is 10. 5. For any given odd digit, there is exactly one other odd digit that makes the sum 10:   - 1 pairs with 9   - 3 pairs with 7   - 5 pairs with 5   - 7 pairs with 3   - 9 pairs with 16. To ensure no two consecutive digits sum to 10, we have 5 choices for the first digit, and for each subsequent digit, we have 4 choices (excluding the digit that would sum to 10 with the previous digit).7. Therefore, the number of 5-digit numbers without any pair of consecutive digits summing to 10 is:   [   5 cdot 4^4 = 5 cdot 256 = 1280   ]8.

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b). Immediately, we understand that O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}, O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}, and O B = |b| = -b.Let's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point D with coordinates (0 ; d) (Fig. 12). The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D. We get -x_{1} cdot x_{2} = -b cdot d, from which, replacing x_{1} cdot x_{2} with 12b by Vieta's theorem, we get d = 12.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_5b323dccc142e96a9907g-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)Fig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7It remains to note that triangle BTD is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point M, has coordinates (0 ; 3).

We need to show |a_k| leq frac{n+1}{n-1} cdot x for all k.   - Consider the partial sums:     [     a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_k leq k cdot frac{a_1 + a_k}{2} = k cdot frac{x + a_k}{2}     ]     [     a_k + a_{k+1} + cdots + a_n leq (n-k+1) cdot frac{x + a_k}{2}     ]   - Adding these inequalities and using the fact that a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n = 0, we get:     [     0 = (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_k) + (a_k + a_{k+1} + cdots + a_n) - a_k leq (n+1) cdot frac{x + a_k}{2} - a_k     ]     [     Rightarrow frac{n-1}{2} cdot a_k geq -frac{n+1}{2} cdot x     ]     [     Rightarrow a_k geq -frac{n+1}{n-1} cdot x     ]   - Similarly, we can show a_k leq frac{n+1}{n-1} cdot x.4. Case 2: a_1a_n < 0   - Without loss of generality, assume a_1 > 0 and a_n < 0.   - We need to show that |a_k| leq frac{n+1}{n-1} cdot max{|a_1|, |a_n|}.   - Since a_1 > 0 and a_n < 0, a_k must lie between a_1 and a_n due to the concavity condition 2a_k leq a_{k-1} + a_{k+1}.   - This implies a_k cannot exceed frac{n+1}{n-1} cdot max{|a_1|, |a_n|}.Thus, we have shown that lambda(n) = frac{n+1}{n-1} is both a lower and upper bound, satisfying the given conditions.The final answer is boxed{frac{n+1}{n-1}}"},{"problem":"Let the set U={2, 3, a^2+2a-3}, A={|2a-1|, 2}, and complement_U A={5}.

Thus, the solutions are: (p, q)=(2,2),(2,3) or (3,2). We will now assume p and q are odd. Let omega_p and omega_q be the orders of 2 modulo p and q respectively. If p divides 2^p+2^q, then 2^{p-1}+2^{q-1}, and since p divides 2^{p-1}-1, p divides 2^{q-1}+1, hence 2^{2(q-1)}-1. Therefore, omega_p divides p-1 and 2(q-1) but does not divide q-1. If the highest power of 2 dividing omega_p (resp. omega_q) is 2^{v_p} (resp. 2^{v_q}), the fact that omega_p divides 2(q-1) and not q-1 implies that v_p > v_q, because q-1 is divisible by omega_q and thus by 2^{v_q} but not by 2^{v_p}.

This results in fewer combinations than previously calculated due to the restrictions on students B and C.Given the mistake in the initial explanation and calculation, and based on the correct interpretation of the restrictions, the correct answer should align with the options provided.

Let n be a three-digit number in which the sum of the digits is three times the sum of the digits of the number 75 less. Let the consecutive digits of n be denoted by x, y, z, the sum of the digits by s, the digits of the number n-75 by x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, and the sum of the digits by s_{1}. According to our assumption,s=3 s_{1}We will examine what cases can arise when the subtraction of n-75 is performed in the usual way, digit by digit, in the decimal system. What will be important for us is whether a remainder is generated when determining the digits of a given place value, or not.begin{array}{r}x y z -quad 75 -quad 7 quad hline x_{1} y_{1} z_{1}end{array}a) No remainder is generated anywhere, that is,z geq 5, quad y geq 7then quad x_{1}=x, quad y_{1}=y-7, quad z_{1}=z-5, quad sos=s_{1}+12b) There is a remainder at the units place, but not at the tens place, that is,then quad x_{1}=x, quad y_{1}=y-8, quad z_{1}=z+5, quad sos=s_{1}+3c) There is no remainder at the units place, but there is at the tens place, that is,then quad x_{1}=x-1, quad y_{1}=y+3, quad z_{1}=z-5, quad sos=s_{1}+3d) There is a remainder at both the units and tens places, that is,then quad x_{1}=x-1, quad y_{1}=y+2, quad z_{1}=z+5, quad sos=s_{1}-6However, in our problem, according to (1) s-s_{1}=2 s_{1}, so the difference s-s_{1} is positive and even, thus only case a) is possible, since in cases b) and c) this difference is odd, and in case d) it is negative. Solving the system of equations (1) and (3a) for the unknowns s, s_{1}, we find thats=x+y+z=18and s_{1}=6. If, however, the digits of the number n satisfy (4) and (2a), then according to (3a) s_{1}=s-12=6, so (1) is also satisfied, thus the necessary and sufficient condition for the number n to have the desired property is that (2a) and (4) are satisfied.According to the problem, we need to determine the smallest and largest among these numbers. The smallest number is the one whose digits are the smallest, so its first digit is 1 and the sum of the other two is 17, hence the smallest number with the desired property is 189.Since according to (2a) the smallest values of z, y also result in their sum being 12, the largest possible value of x is 6 - so the largest number with the required property is 675.János Lengyel (Budapest, I. István Gymn., II. o. t.)II. solution. Let the two sought numbers be n and N. Both are divisible by 3, because the sum of their digits is three times an integer - namely, the three times the sum of the digits of the numbers n-75 and N-75.Thus, n-75 and N-75 are also divisible by 3, because 75 is also divisible by it, and if both terms of a difference are divisible by a number, then the difference itself is also divisible by it.Accordingly, the sum of the digits of n-75 and N-75 is of the form 3 k and 3 K (where k, K are natural numbers), so the sum of the digits of n and N is of the form 9 k and 9 K, hence n and N are also divisible by 9.Knowing this, the sum of the digits of n and N can only be 9 and 18. Indeed, the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is at most 27 - only in the case of 999 - but this cannot be the value of N, otherwise the sum of the digits of N-75 would be 9, but 999 - 75 is not divisible by 9. Reversing our finding for n-75 and N-75, the sum of their digits can only be 3 or 6.We will show from the other side that the sum of the digits of n-75 and N-75 cannot be 3. Indeed, on the one hand, these numbers can be written as:n-75=9 m-75=9(m-9)+6, quad N-75=9(M-9)+6Thus, they give a remainder of 6 when divided by 9. On the other hand, in general, the (smallest non-negative) remainder of any integer when divided by 9 is the same as if we divide the sum of the digits of the number (in decimal notation) by 9. Indeed, restricting ourselves to at most three-digit numbers, a number written with the digits A, B, C can be written as100 A+10 B+C=9(11 A+B)+(A+B+C)so the remainder of the division (100 A+10 B+C): 9 and (A+B+C): 9 is the same.Accordingly, the sum of the digits of n-75 and N-75 gives a remainder of 6 when divided by 9, and combining this with the above, the sum itself is 6. From this, it follows that the sum of the digits of n and N is 18.The smallest value of n that fits, 189, immediately satisfies, because then 189-75=114, the sum of the digits is 6.The largest value of N-75 that fits, 600, also satisfies, because then N=675, the sum of the digits is 18."},{"problem":"If a+b=2 and a^{2}+b^{2}=2, what is the value of a^{3}+b^{3}?

Let the original number be represented as ( N = 100a + 10b + c ), where ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are digits and ( a neq 0 ) since ( N ) is a positive integer.2. According to the problem, when the leftmost digit ( a ) is deleted, the resulting number is ( 10b + c ).3. The problem states that this resulting number is (frac{1}{29}) of the original number. Therefore, we can write the equation:   [   10b + c = frac{1}{29} (100a + 10b + c)   ]4. To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 29:   [   29(10b + c) = 100a + 10b + c   ]5.

For triangle C_{1} B A_{1}, we have overline{C_{1} B}=frac{overline{A B}}{2}, overline{B A_{1}}=frac{overline{B C}}{2}, and overline{C_{1} A_{1}}=frac{overline{C A}}{2} as the midline in triangle A B C. For triangle B_{1} A_{1} C, we have overline{B_{1} C}=frac{overline{A C}}{2}, overline{C A_{1}}=frac{overline{B C}}{2}, and overline{B_{1} A_{1}}=frac{overline{B A}}{2} as the midline in triangle A B C.From the above, it follows that triangle A B C is composed of four congruent triangles. Let P^{prime} denote the area of each of the four congruent triangles. Then the area of triangle A B C is P=4 P^{prime}. Therefore, it is sufficient to calculate the area P^{prime}.Since A_{1} B_{1} is a midline in triangle A B C, it is parallel to A B, which means that A B A_{1} B_{1} is a trapezoid for which the diagonals satisfy A A_{1} perp B B_{1}. From this, the area of the trapezoid is P_{A B A_{1} B_{1}}=frac{overline{A A_{1}} cdot overline{B B_{1}}}{2}=frac{12 cdot 20}{2}=120 mathrm{~cm}^{2}. Since the trapezoid is composed of three congruent triangles A C_{1} B_{1}, A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}, and C_{1} B A_{1}, each with area P^{prime}, we get P_{A B A_{1} B_{1}}=3 P^{prime}. Therefore, P^{prime}=40 mathrm{~cm}^{2} and P=4 P^{prime}=160 mathrm{~cm}^{2}.Second method. Let A_{1}, B_{1} denote the midpoints of sides B C and A C, respectively, so overline{A A_{1}}= t_{a}=12 mathrm{~cm} and overline{B B_{1}}=t_{b}=20 mathrm{~cm}.

Using the expression of f(x) from part 1, we have f'(x) = x^2 - 1 and thus g(x) = 4ln x - x^2 + 1. The domain of g(x) is (0, +infty).Next, let's find the extreme values of g(x).

If the legs of this triangle are equal to x, then the hypotenuse is x sqrt{2} - this will be the side of the octagon.

The second motorcyclist added that he happened to know that C is 12 km from the road connecting A with B, that is, from point D (the dashed line in the figure). Then the person asking, after making a very simple calculation in his mind, said:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_56f37ca27ac3d928838dg-083.jpg?height=523&width=1106&top_left_y=795&top_left_x=475)- It's clear, from A to B ldotsCould the reader also determine this distance so quickly?","solution":"279. The distances are shown in the figure. The person asking the question only needed to square the 60 km traveled by the first motorcyclist (3600), and divide the result by twice the sum of these 60 and 12 km, which is the distance from road (A B) to (C), i.e., by 144.

The key to solving this problem is to determine the radius and height of the cone from the given information.By taking a cross section of the cone along its axis of rotation, we obtain triangle ABC with inscribed circle ⊙O_1 and circumscribed circle ⊙O_2. Since both circles share the same center, the incenter and circumcenter of triangle ABC coincide, indicating that it is a right triangle. According to the problem, the radius of ⊙O_1 is r=1.

Since both circles share the same center, the incenter and circumcenter of triangle ABC coincide, which implies that it is a right triangle.Given that the radius of ⊙O_1 is r=1, we deduce that the side length of triangle ABC is 2sqrt{3}.

Parity Argument for ( n = 1 ):   - If ( n = 1 ), the numbers to be placed in the cells are ( 1, 2, ldots, 9 ).   - The sum of these numbers is ( 1 + 2 + cdots + 9 = 45 ), which is odd.   - Initially, the sum of all numbers in the cells is ( 0 ), which is even.   - Each move changes the sum of the numbers in the cells by ( 0 ) (since we add and subtract the same amount).   - Therefore, it is impossible to reach an odd sum from an even sum using the allowed moves.   - Hence, ( n = 1 ) is not possible.3. Checking ( n = 2 ):   - If ( n = 2 ), the numbers to be placed in the cells are ( 2, 3, ldots, 10 ).   - The sum of these numbers is ( 2 + 3 + cdots + 10 = 54 ), which is even.   - Since the initial sum is ( 0 ) (even), it is possible to reach an even sum using the allowed moves.   - Therefore, ( n = 2 ) is a potential solution.4.

Should at the end be c_{1}=c_{2}=c_{3}=c_{4}=c_{5}=c_{6}, and soc_{1}+c_{6}=c_{2}+c_{5}=c_{3}+c_{4}the sums of numbers on the opposite faces have to be the same already at the beginning (and after each move).We show that (1) is also a sufficient condition. Let the numbers on faces of the cube satisfy (1). Let k_{i j m} be the move, in which we increase the numbers on S_{i}, S_{j}, S_{m}. Wlog we may assume that c_{1}=p is the maximal number on the cube. We make left(p-c_{2}right) times move k_{246} and left(p-c_{3}right) times move k_{356} after which the numbers on faces S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3} will be the same. Due to (1) the numbers on faces S_{4}, S_{5}, S_{6} are the same as well, let us say q. If p>q we make (p-q) times move k_{456}, if q>p we make (q-p) times move k_{123} and we are done.Now let us determine the number of six element sets M=left{c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, c_{4}, c_{5}, c_{6}right} of positive integers, such thatc_{1}+c_{2}+c_{3}+c_{4}+c_{5}+c_{6}=60 quad text { and } quad c_{1}+c_{6}=c_{2}+c_{5}=c_{3}+c_{4} text {, }that isc_{1}+c_{6}=c_{2}+c_{5}=c_{3}+c_{4}=20 text {. }Wlog we may assume c_{1}<c_{2}<c_{3} (and consequently c_{4}<c_{5}<c_{6} ) and because of (2) we havec_{1}<c_{2}<c_{3}<10<c_{4}<c_{5}<c_{6} .Due to (2), each triple left(c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}right) uniquely determines c_{4}, c_{5}, and c_{6}. Thus the number of sought sets is equal to the number of triples left(c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}right) of positive integers satisfying c_{1}<c_{2}<c_{3}<10, which isleft(begin{array}{l}9 3end{array}right)=frac{9 cdot 8 cdot 7}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}=84 text {. }"},{"problem":"2.

The corresponding function expression of the resulting parabola is ______.","solution":"To solve the problem of finding the new function expression for the parabola after it has been shifted, we start with the given parabola equation:y = x^2 - 2x - 5.First, we complete the square to rewrite the equation in vertex form:[begin{align*}y &= x^2 - 2x - 5 &= (x^2 - 2x + 1) - 5 - 1 &= (x - 1)^2 - 6.end{align*}]This shows the vertex of the original parabola is at (1, -6). Next, we apply the transformations as given: shifting 2 units to the left and 3 units up. Shifting 2 units to the left means replacing x with (x + 2), but since our vertex form is centered around x = 1, we only need to adjust this to (x + 1). Shifting 3 units up means adding 3 to the y-value of our vertex, changing -6 to -3. Therefore, the transformation gives us:[begin{align*}y &= (x - 1)^2 - 6 &rightarrow (x + 1)^2 - 3.end{align*}]Thus, the corresponding function expression of the resulting parabola after it has been shifted 2 units to the left and then 3 units up is:boxed{y = (x + 1)^2 - 3}."},{"problem":"## Task ConditionFind the derivative.y=arcsin e^{-x}-sqrt{1-e^{2 x}}","solution":"## Solutiony^{prime}=left(arcsin e^{-x}-sqrt{1-e^{2 x}}right)^{prime}=frac{1}{sqrt{1-e^{-2 x}}} cdotleft(-e^{-x}right)-frac{1}{2 sqrt{1-e^{2 x}}} cdotleft(-2 e^{2 x}right)==frac{-e^{-x}}{sqrt{1-e^{-2 x}}}+frac{e^{2 x}}{sqrt{1-e^{2 x}}}=frac{-e^{-x} sqrt{1-e^{2 x}}+e^{2 x} sqrt{1-e^{-2 x}}}{sqrt{1-e^{-2 x}} cdot sqrt{1-e^{2 x}}}==frac{e^{x} sqrt{e^{2 x}-1}-sqrt{e^{-2 x}-1}}{sqrt{1-e^{-2 x}} cdot sqrt{1-e^{2 x}}}## Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 7-29"},{"problem":"[Coordinate method on the plane ] [ Intersecting circles ]Find the coordinates of the points of intersection of the circles(x-2)^{2}+(y-10)^{2}=50 text { and } x^{2}+y^{2}+2(x-y)-18=0 .","solution":"Let's find the coordinates of the intersection points Aleft(x_{1} ; y_{1}right) and Bleft(x_{2} ; y_{2}right) of the given circles by solving the system of equationsleft{begin{array}{l}(x-2)^{2}+(y-10)^{2}=50 x^{2}+y^{2}+2(x-y)-18=0end{array}right.We will get: x_{1}=3, y_{1}=3, x_{2}=-3, y_{2}=5.Answer(3 ; 3),(-3 ; 5)."},{"problem":"Given that the complex number z_1 satisfies (z_1 - 2)i = 1 + i, the imaginary part of the complex number z_2 is 2, and z_1 cdot z_2 is a real number, find z_2.","solution":"From (z_1 - 2)i = 1 + i, we can solve for z_1 as follows:z_1 = frac{1+i}{i} + 2To simplify this expression, recall that frac{1}{i} = -frac{i}{i^2} = -i (since i^2 = -1).

This is because ( x^6 ) and ( y^6 ) are non-negative and their sum is 1.3. Given ( x^5 + y^5 = 1 ), we can infer that neither ( x ) nor ( y ) can be negative. If both were negative, the left-hand side (LHS) would be negative, which contradicts the right-hand side (RHS) being positive.4. If one of ( x ) or ( y ) were negative, the other would have to be greater than 1 to satisfy the equation ( (-alpha)^5 + beta^5 = 1 Rightarrow beta^5 = 1 + alpha^5 Rightarrow beta > 1 ), which contradicts ( |y| leq 1 ).5.

In the interval ( 0 < x < 1 ), ( x^5 ) is positive and ( 1 - x ) is positive, so ( f(x) ) is positive. However, ( f(x) ) is decreasing in this interval because ( x^5 ) grows faster than ( 1 - x ) decreases.10. The function ( f(x) ) is zero at the boundaries ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1 ).11. Therefore, the only solutions where ( f(x) = f(y) ) are at the boundaries ( x = 0 ) or ( x = 1 ).12. Checking these boundary values:    - If ( x = 0 ), then ( y^5 = 1 ) implies ( y = 1 ).    - If ( x = 1 ), then ( y^5 = 0 ) implies ( y = 0 ).Thus, the solutions to the system are:[(x, y) = (1, 0) text{ or } (0, 1)]The final answer is (boxed{(1, 0) text{ or } (0, 1)})."},{"problem":"When 2y-x=5, the value of 5left(x-2yright)^{2}+3left(x-2yright)+10 is ____.","solution":"Given the equation 2y-x=5, we want to find the value of 5(x-2y)^2+3(x-2y)+10.First, we solve for x-2y using the given equation:[2y-x=5 implies x-2y=-5.]Next, we substitute x-2y=-5 into the expression:[begin{align*}5(x-2y)^2+3(x-2y)+10 & = 5(-5)^2+3(-5)+10 & = 5 times 25 - 15 + 10 & = 125 - 15 + 10 & = 120.end{align*}]Therefore, the value of the expression is boxed{120}."},{"problem":"Let m and n be two different lines, and alpha and beta be two different planes.

The probabilities are calculated as follows:- For P(X=0), we select all 5 students from the 6 boys, which can be done in C_6^5 ways, and all 5 students for the physics interest group are determined, so:[P(X=0) = frac{C_6^5C_5^5}{C_{10}^{5}} = frac{1}{42}]- For P(X=1), we select 4 boys and 1 girl for the physics interest group, which can be done in:[P(X=1) = frac{C_6^4C_4^1C_5^5}{C_{10}^{5}} = frac{5}{21}]- For P(X=2), we select 3 boys and 2 girls, which gives:[P(X=2) = frac{C_6^3C_4^2C_5^5}{C_{10}^{5}} = frac{10}{21}]- For P(X=3), we select 2 boys and 3 girls, resulting in:[P(X=3) = frac{C_6^2C_4^3C_5^5}{C_{10}^{5}} = frac{5}{21}]- For P(X=4), we select 1 boy and 4 girls, which can be done in:[P(X=4) = frac{C_6^1C_4^4C_5^5}{C_{10}^{5}} = frac{1}{42}]Thus, the distribution table of X is as follows:| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ||-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|| P | frac{1}{42} | frac{5}{21} | frac{10}{21} | frac{5}{21} | frac{1}{42} |To find the mathematical expectation E(X), we calculate:[E(X) = 0 times frac{1}{42} + 1 times frac{5}{21} + 2 times frac{10}{21} + 3 times frac{5}{21} + 4 times frac{1}{42} = 2]Therefore, the mathematical expectation E(X) is boxed{2}."},{"problem":"Example 8.

It is well known that for a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the diagonals. This can be expressed as:   [   2c^2 + 2d^2 = a^2 + b^2   ]3. Substituting the given values of ( a ) and ( b ):   [   2c^2 + 2d^2 = 7^2 + 9^2 = 49 + 81 = 130   ]   Therefore,   [   c^2 + d^2 = 65   ]4.

After some algebra, we get that the complete sum is xy(1 + x + y + xy - x 2 y 2 )/( (1 - x 2 y)(1 - xy 2 ) ). Hence the required limit is 3. A slightly more elegant approach is to note that the sum over pairs (m, n) with m > n/2 is ∑ x 2n+m y n where the sum is over all m, n ≥ 1. That is just x/(1 - x) x 2 y/(1 - x 2 y).

Construction:    - In the first ( n-1 ) moves, each member tells a designated person ( A ) their information. This means ( A ) will have all the information after ( n-1 ) calls.   - In the next ( n-1 ) moves, ( A ) tells each of the other ( n-1 ) members all the information. Thus, after these ( n-1 ) calls, everyone will have all the information.3. Proof of Optimality:   - Define a member as \\"wise\\" if they have all the information.   - Initially, no one is wise. To make at least one person wise, we need at least ( n-1 ) calls because each call can only transfer information from one person to another.   - After one person becomes wise, we need to make the remaining ( n-1 ) members wise. Each call can only increase the number of wise people by 1. Therefore, we need at least ( n-1 ) additional calls to make all ( n ) members wise.   - Hence, the total number of calls required is at least:     [     (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n-2     ]   - Since we have a construction that achieves this in ( 2n-2 ) calls, this number is indeed the minimum.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 2n-2 } )."},{"problem":"From the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, three numbers are randomly selected.

Write m for the number formed by reversing the digits of n.The first digit of n is the last digit of m, and as such must be even, and thus at most 8 .

As 98 and 78 are not divisible by 4 , but 68 is, we conclude that the second digit is at most 6 .

On the board, there are N geqslant 9 different non-negative numbers, each less than one. It turns out that for any eight different numbers on the board, there is a ninth, different from them, such that the sum of these nine numbers is an integer. For which N is this possible?(F. Nilov)","solution":"Answer. Only for N=9.Solution. It is clear that for N=9 the required is possible - it is sufficient to write 9 different positive numbers on the board with a unit sum. We will show that for N>9 the required is impossible. Suppose the opposite; let S be the sum of all numbers on the board.Choose arbitrary numbers alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, ldots, alpha_{7} with sum T; let A be the set of all other numbers on the board. By the condition, for any number beta in A there exists a number gamma in A different from it such that the number T+beta+gamma is an integer. We say that the number gamma corresponds to the number beta. Note that such a number gamma is unique. Indeed, if there were another number gamma^{prime} in A for which the sum T+beta+gamma^{prime} is an integer, then the number gamma-gamma^{prime}=(T+beta+gamma)-left(T+beta+gamma^{prime}right) would also be an integer; this is impossible, since 0<|gamma-gamma^{prime}|<1, as N=7+2 ell>9.Now consider the sumSigma=left(T+beta_{1}+gamma_{1}right)+left(T+beta_{2}+gamma_{2}right)+ldots+left(T+beta_{ell}+gamma_{ell}right)Then Sigma is an integer. On the other hand, each number from A appears in Sigma exactly once; hence, Sigma=ell T+(S-T)=S+(ell-1) T, from which T=frac{Sigma-S}{ell-1}.Now, choosing the numbers alpha_{2}, alpha_{3}, alpha_{4}, ldots, alpha_{8} on the board and denoting their sum by T^{prime}, we similarly obtain that T^{prime}=frac{Sigma^{prime}-S}{ell-1} for an integer Sigma^{prime}. Therefore,alpha_{1}-alpha_{8}=frac{Sigma-S}{ell-1}-frac{Sigma^{prime}-S}{ell-1}=frac{Sigma-Sigma^{prime}}{ell-1}Since alpha_{1} and alpha_{8} could be any two numbers on the board, we get that the difference of any two numbers on the board has the form frac{k}{ell-1} for an integer k.Let mu be the smallest number on the board. Then the board can only contain the numbers mu, mu+frac{1}{ell-1}, ldots, mu+frac{ell-2}{ell-1} (all larger numbers will already be at least 1) - a total of ell numbers. However, the total number of numbers on the board is N=7+2 ell>ell; hence, they cannot all be different. Contradiction."},{"problem":"The price of a BKV student monthly ticket is 465 mathrm{Ft}.

We need to evaluate the limit of the determinant of this matrix as ( n ) approaches infinity, i.e., ( lim_{n to infty} d_n ).2. To understand the behavior of ( d_n ), we need to analyze the structure of the matrix ( A_n ). The entries of ( A_n ) are periodic with period ( 2pi ), but they are not uniformly distributed. This irregularity suggests that the determinant might not have a simple closed form.3. One approach to evaluate the limit is to consider the properties of the determinant and the behavior of the cosine function. The determinant of a matrix is zero if the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. 4. For large ( n ), the entries ( cos 1, cos 2, ldots, cos n^2 ) will cover the interval ([-1, 1]) densely due to the periodic nature of the cosine function. This implies that for sufficiently large ( n ), the rows (or columns) of ( A_n ) will become nearly linearly dependent.5. To make this more rigorous, consider the fact that the cosine function can take values arbitrarily close to each other for different arguments. For example, ( cos(k) ) and ( cos(k + 2pi m) ) are equal for any integer ( m ). As ( n ) increases, the likelihood of having rows (or columns) that are nearly identical increases.6. If two rows (or columns) of a matrix are nearly identical, the determinant of the matrix will be close to zero. This is because the determinant is a measure of the volume spanned by the row (or column) vectors, and nearly identical vectors span a very small volume.7.

The angle is composed of:1. the angle between a triangular face and the base of the corresponding pyramid.2. the right angle between two adjacent side faces of the cube, and3. the angle between the other triangular face and the base of the corresponding pyramid. Its size is thus 45^{circ}+90^{circ}+45^{circ}=180^{circ}.The two adjacent triangles lie in the same plane, and because they are congruent and isosceles and share a common side, their legs form the sides of a rhombus.

The rhombi are congruent to each other.We also show that the rhombi are not squares. The heights of the pyramids placed on top, due to the angle between the lateral and base faces of each pyramid being 45^{circ}, have a length of frac{a}{2}. The heights of the triangular faces forming the lateral faces have, by the Pythagorean theorem, a length of sqrt{2left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2}}, i.e., frac{a}{2} sqrt{2}.Thus, the diagonals of the rhombi have different lengths, namely a and a sqrt{2}.Each of the pyramids placed on top has a volume of frac{1}{3}left(a^{2} frac{a}{2}right), i.e., frac{a^{3}}{6}.The six pyramids placed on top thus have a total volume of 2 a^{3} together with the cube.Solutions of the III.

Calculate the probability of flipping two heads given the coin is weighted towards tails:   - If the coin is weighted towards tails, the probability of heads is (frac{1}{3}) and the probability of tails is (frac{2}{3}).   - The probability of flipping two heads in this case is:     [     P(text{HH} mid text{Tails weighted}) = left(frac{1}{3}right) times left(frac{1}{3}right) = frac{1}{9}     ]4. Use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that the coin is weighted towards heads given that two heads were flipped:   - The total probability of flipping two heads is:     [     P(text{HH}) = P(text{HH} mid text{Heads weighted}) cdot P(text{Heads weighted}) + P(text{HH} mid text{Tails weighted}) cdot P(text{Tails weighted})     ]     [     P(text{HH}) = left(frac{4}{9}right) cdot left(frac{1}{2}right) + left(frac{1}{9}right) cdot left(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{4}{18} + frac{1}{18} = frac{5}{18}     ]   - The probability that the coin is weighted towards heads given that two heads were flipped is:     [     P(text{Heads weighted} mid text{HH}) = frac{P(text{HH} mid text{Heads weighted}) cdot P(text{Heads weighted})}{P(text{HH})} = frac{left(frac{4}{9}right) cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)}{frac{5}{18}} = frac{frac{4}{18}}{frac{5}{18}} = frac{4}{5}     ]5. Calculate the probability that the coin lands heads on the next flip:   - If the coin is weighted towards heads, the probability of heads is (frac{2}{3}).   - If the coin is weighted towards tails, the probability of heads is (frac{1}{3}).   - The overall probability of heads on the next flip is:     [     P(text{Heads on next flip}) = P(text{Heads weighted} mid text{HH}) cdot frac{2}{3} + P(text{Tails weighted} mid text{HH}) cdot frac{1}{3}     ]     [     P(text{Tails weighted} mid text{HH}) = 1 - P(text{Heads weighted} mid text{HH}) = 1 - frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{5}     ]     [     P(text{Heads on next flip}) = left(frac{4}{5}right) cdot left(frac{2}{3}right) + left(frac{1}{5}right) cdot left(frac{1}{3}right) = frac{8}{15} + frac{1}{15} = frac{9}{15} = frac{3}{5}     ]6. Simplify the fraction and find (p + q):   - The fraction (frac{3}{5}) is already in its simplest form.   - Therefore, (p = 3) and (q = 5).   - Thus, (p + q = 3 + 5 = 8).The final answer is ( boxed{ 8 } )"},{"problem":"The mean (average) of five consecutive even numbers is 12 .

However, recognizing that for x leq 9, the square root of x cannot be greater than 3, and considering the domain of the square root function (x must be non-negative for sqrt{x} to be real), we get:   [   forall x in mathbb{R}, x leq 9 implies forall x in mathbb{R}, sqrt{x} leq 3 text{ or } x < 0.   ]   Here, the \\"or x < 0\\" part accounts for the reality that all negative numbers also do not satisfy the original proposition, as their square roots are not real numbers.5. Conclusion: Hence, the correct negation of the proposition p is \\"forall x in mathbb{R}, sqrt{x} leq 3 or x < 0\\", which matches option D. Thus, the correctly negated proposition, following the structured logical steps, is encapsulated as:[boxed{D}.]"},{"problem":"Given that sin α+ sin β= frac {1}{3}, find the maximum and minimum values of y=sin β- cos ^{2}α.","solution":"Since sin α+ sin β= frac {1}{3},We can express sin β as frac {1}{3}- sin α,Then, y=sin β- cos ^{2}α= frac {1}{3}- sin α- cos ^{2}α= frac {1}{3}- sin α-(1- sin ^{2}α)Simplifying further, we get y=sin ^{2}α- sin α- frac {2}{3}=(sin α- frac {1}{2})^{2}- frac {11}{12}.Given that -1 leqslant sin β leqslant 1, we have -1 leqslant frac {1}{3}- sin α leqslant 1.Solving the inequality, we get - frac {2}{3} leqslant sin α leqslant 1.Thus, the maximum value of y occurs when sin α=- frac {2}{3}, which gives us y_{max}= boxed{frac {4}{9}},And the minimum value of y occurs when sin α= frac {1}{2}, which gives us y_{min}= boxed{- frac {11}{12}}."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],M={key:0},L={key:1};function E(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(x,null,w(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),y(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",M,"See more"))],8,z)):v("",!0)])}const N=f(D,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-605442b7"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/30.md","filePath":"drive/30.md"}'),W={name:"drive/30.md"},O=Object.assign(W,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[_(N)]))}});export{R as __pageData,O as default};
