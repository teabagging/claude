ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring and event monitoring which you are having and we ll probably get answers out of it.     Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.Is there any stress or anxiety associated. You can discuss with your doctor regarding reduction in dose of metoprolol as pulse rate is low.     If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases."},{"Patient":"Sometimes during the fall around the time school begins, I get congested and then get laryngitis.

Bleach fumes can cause irritation of air passage and coughing. This is normal.So no need to worry for your coughing. Just inhale fresh air and drink lots of water. No need to worry for any serious permanent lung damage by this kind of short term exposure.Usually permanent lung damage occurs after years of exposure with toxic fumes. So in your case no need to worry much. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is inflammation of esophagus by eosinophil (blood cells).Eosinophilic inflammation is mostly seen with allergies. And your chest is due to esophagitis only. So take following drugs for symptomatic relief.1. Take montelukast (anti allergic) and fexofenadine (antihistamine) combination at night time before going to sleep.2. Take antacid (pantoprazole) on empty stomach twice daily.You will mostly improve with all these.Better to avoid hot and spicy food, junk food and large meals. Hope I have solved your query.

What did I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely because your pain is associated with movements and lifting things.But better to rule out heart diseases first because your pain is on left sided of chest.So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test).If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid sudden jerky movements of chest. Take simple painkiller like paracetamol or ibuprofen. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

My father had an x-ray last week and they found a spot. Is it enough that it shall be assumed that my father has a tuberculosis? No sputum test yet.  second, as the doctor said, he cannot do sputum test not until my father can give a phlegm sample. is that correct?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Not all spots on chest x ray are due to tuberculosis. Spots on chest x ray can be due to tuberculosis, pneumonia, lung nodule, lung cyst etc. So your father is not having tuberculosis only on the basis of spot on chest x ray. You need to get done sputum test first. And for this, he needs to give phlegm for testing. Without this, sputum test is not possible. So get done sputum test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

I also got a chest xray. I am a 44 year old female. Should I be concerned that I could have lung cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Don't think directly about lung cancer. Persistent cough, breathlessness and upper chest pain are commonly seen with bronchitis. Lung cancer can also show similar symptoms. But better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung cancer.

Central chest pain is mostly due to hyperacidity and gastritis.Since your child 's chest pain is reducing after stopping spicy food, possibility of gastritis is more likely in your child.At present, no treatment (drugs) is required.

This recent spot on chest x ray was not present in your previous chest x ray (during college days).So you should definitely concern about this. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and CT thorax.CT is far superior than chest x ray to evaluate such spot. If it is mass like lesion then biopsy is needed to rule out cancer. If it is infectious then bronchoscopy is needed to identify the infection. Don't worry about spread to others.

During the surgery, the corkscrew anchor perforated her heart wall. She had the surgery because she has a weak heart (pumps out to the body at about a 30 now). She had fluid in the sac of her heart and severe pain. The fluid was treated with medicine and she was sent home. Approximately a week later she had severe pain again, had to go back in to have the lead moved because it pushed through the wall. She also had almost a liter of blood drained from around her heart. She went home after 5 days in the ICU and slowly felt better, but another week went by and she was having pain again. She went to the doctors and has inflammation of the left atrium and some fluid. They changed her medicine, but she has been in pain again. This time they took her off the water medicine and have her on prednisone. They also did a chest x-ray which showed the bottom of her left lung as being \\"cloudy\\" Her doctor isn't sure why. My mother in law was a very high energy woman who had no symptoms of any problems before going for a routine EKG during a physical - she is 69 years old and lately she has barely had the energy to be out of bed for more than a couple of hours. You can physically see the change in her when all of the energy drains from her body and it happens very very quickly. Could you help explain why, when her surgeon says she shouldn't be feeling this way that she is, and what a \\"cloudy\\" xray could be? Her surgeon said that if she isnt better in 2 weeks, he is going to recommend her to a different heart specialist because he is at a loss to explain why she isnt getting better.Thank you.","Doctor":"thank you writing me, if you dont mind can i say something.... listen first if u can send me picture of xray then send me i will surely tell you that your mother in law has anythng in lungs or not. other thing that cloudy usually means whitish shadow in xray, it has a number of cause, rule out two things cancer and tuberculosis."},{"Patient":"I am a 30 year old female I just recently had back surgery for a herniated disc fragment pressing on a bunch of nerves includeing my sciatica.

Depending on persons height, weight, target heart rate (THR) is decided by TMT machine.If we achieve THR without getting breathless or rising BP or abnormal ECG then out TMT is good. But if we fail to achieve THR due to breathlessness or accelerated hypertension or ecg changes means our TMT is not good and we need angiography to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD).Since your TMT was stopped due to breathlessness and hence THR was not achieved, possibility of CAD is more in your case.

Each \\"attack\\" lasts for 5-15 min and then goes away bu returns after 5 min. This repeats around 5 times before it finally settles and everything feels normal again. But when the pain is there, it seems to get a bit worse when breathing in.I have noticed that I get this pain many times after meals during the summer (because of BBQ) but I did not get it during the winter. Now as it is spring again we had a BBQ and around 7-9 hours after the meal I got the chest pain again so I am really suspecting some food-related disease.The strange thing is though that even if I eat a pizza or something greasy like that I usually don't get the pains, but I almost everytime get it after BBQ meat. Can it be some one type of fat that may be causing this?Any ideas?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. You might be having meat allergy.

Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. For the past five years i have had intermittent episodes of fluttering/vibration/wobbling feeling in my chest near the left apex. It lasted for more than six months the first time and was bad enough that it extended throughout my circulation and i could 'feel' the blood moving left AND right between my shoulderblades (both lying down and when i walked). The vibration is felt not imagined but did not show up anything 'abnormal' on an ECHO (private as my doc would not refer me) except mild mitral leakage. After seventeen doctors i met a locum who detected a systolic murmur and prescribed proprnalol 120 mg daily for prophylactic reasons. I stayed on this for about a year and the internal wobbling/vibration very slowly dissipated (i quit my very high stress job and was in bed for most of the year) and eventually the symptoms disappeared completely. I reduced the propranalol down to 40 mg a day and then was able to stay off it for a year. But every six months or so, the 'wobble' comes back (it is a 'shaking' inside which is 'autonomous and i have no control over it. It is almost like a bad caffeine reaction which won't turn off but it's not a racing heartbeat; just a very strange regular vibration like the ascending aorta is bouncing up and down very slightly). The propranalol helps with anxiety but if the vibration gets really bad, i double and triple the dose and, normally, the vibration gets killed off over a few weeks and i can drop the dose back down to 40 mg. Sometimes i wonder if long-term use of Propranalol is actually causing the vibration; but apparently there is NO data on this available in spite of the drug having been FDA-approved for more than 60 years (rather strange?). Since Propranalol makes your heart 'think' it doesn't have to work so hard especially under stress, it makes me wonder what happens if you have a true underlying structural or mechanical problem; obviously, Propranalol will only mask any real cause. After fighting this for more than five years i am tired. Recently, my work has been extremely stressful (the environment is like that of an extremely busy Air Traffic Control) and my Mother passed away from cancer; but i was forced to travel 12500 km (twice) last year and this year to help her as she deteriorated, and i had to do it practically alone. A few weeks ago, the vibrations started again. They begin with a repetitive cycling and last all day; they get worse when i lie down and it takes hours for them to almost dissapear (but they do not unless i take 3x40 mg Propranalol at once)...when i turn on my left side to sleep, they get much worse and it is like there is a (loud) heavy rumbling inside my chest. They begin when i am asleep and often wake me up; and appear to be caused by sleep apnea which i was diagnosed with in 2005. But i refused to use CPAP as i felt i could never get used to it (and i only had one apnea episode lasting 1 minute and my oxygenation was normal; but i was asked to fork out 1000 for a machine and i felt i could do better). I do believe sleep apnea has contributed to a very mild structural defect which i probably have in the mitral valve; but the current situation would appear to indicate that i do not need any serious intervention (and i definitely do not want any...this is a very risky area to get involved in and in any case, i can't afford 25,000 for a mitral repair). However, i worry that over time, this vibration is indicating clearly that i have a growing (and i use the word literally) underlying internal heart problem or circulatory/pulmonary valve issue which should have early intervention. But the current status quo in the West indicates that i will be always treated as a head case or anxiety case and left to deal with this alone. That is highly disconcerting. The only thing i can think of is to get a new ECHO again (costs me 500 each time) and compare the numbers with those from the one i had a year ago; and a chext X-Ray to check shape and size. I really understand now (as i did not before) the dangers of premature/unnecessary intervention in the cardiac area; but i am also quite concerned that doing nothing will possibly exacerbate a real but untreated phsyical abnormality which is 'asking' for treatment. I can afford insurance but i am concerned that i will be denied and in any event, do not ever want to have to undertake any kind of surgery if at all possible. Note: i am a smoker of about 2 years and have been cutting back (less than 1/2 a pack a day). But the smoking actually seems to improve the fluttering...and i don't drink much caffeine or use drugs. Any suggestions as to how to eliminate this condition?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Thanks for your detailed history. You have gone through a lot of stress in your life. Since your vibration feeling was improved by propranolol, possibility of stress and anxiety related palpitations is more likely in your case. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Newer anxiolytic drug flunarizine is a good drug for anxiety. Along with flunarizine, counselling sessions will also help you. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

In my opinion, you are mostly having bronchospasm which is causing this suffocating feeling. Pneumonia causes inflammation in airways and this in turn causes bronchospasm.

I have been looking online and trying to understand his diagnosis but I m having a hard time. Their was no significant response to the bronchodialator noted in the test but there was a 21% increase in the FEF 25% (not the FEF 25-75 - that was over 100 and didn t change much after the inhaler). Is a change in the FEF25 a measure to be used to diagnose me with mild asthma ? Are there other numbers that I should be looking at? Everything I have read indicates that my PFT would be classified as normal but I assume there is more to it. He gave me affair 100/50 and a rescue inhaler.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. I have gone through the PFT report you have mentioned. It is absolutely normal. It is not showing any value suggestive of mild asthma. So I don't think you are having mild asthma.

What could the cause be- Do I need to see a doctor about this?","Doctor":"hello,   First thing do you have any symptoms during this reading, because at this heart rate one will severe symptoms like giddiness, fainting, chest pain or heaviness, shortness of breath etc.  If not it's likely to be a false readings. Sometimes it can record each pulse as two and doubles the heart rate.    If you had symptoms, then it can be a cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You can repeat 24 hour holter monitoring. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg once a day.

But better to first rule out heart diseases because you are having left sided chest pain. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have been hospitalized for fear of a PE or mitrial valve prolaspe. All tests came back fine and it wasn't the PE or prolapse. The heart ultrasound was fine and I was told that they sliced the image thru to my kidneys, my lungs, my spleen and gallbladder and nothing showed up abnormal. I have no pain, no fever, nothing but SOB. I have no past history of asthma or any breathing problems.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis.Bronchitis can cause breathlessness with normal reports. So get done PFT. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. If PFT is showing obstructive defect then you will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol).If PFT is normal then no need to worry for any disease.

Please suggest wat we should do","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. ILD (interstitial lung disease) can not be caused by single exposure of any chemical.Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause ILD.It is not possible to find out cause for each and every ILD patient. Some patients can develop ILD just because of aging (old age).So your uncle is not having ILD due to breakage of acid bottle.He might be having age related ILD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cystine (NAC) for ILD rather than searching for cause. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle.

So your current symptom is mostly due to worsening of underlying COPD (lung disease).COPD causes bronchospasm. This in turn causes breathlessness. So you should start treatment for COPD with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here.my 4 year old daughter has to undergo a procedure to check her trachea as she has had croup like cough three time this year.

They now want me to have a PET Scan which I am very hesitant about jumping into.  I am beginning to question both the dr and radiologist. I live in Las Vegas and everyone knows the drs here are the worst and very untrustworthy.  What do you recommend for me to do?

But it is not the only cause.Non smokers after the age of 50 years are also at risk of lung cancer. Your lung nodule is increasing in size from 7 mm to 1.7 cm in 3 months.This is said to be rapidly growing.

Your husband is having coughing, difficulty in breathing and hemoptysis (blood in sputum).All these symptoms are commonly seen with bronchitis (inflammation of airways).So better to take him to pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. He will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, he will be alright with all these.

A week later ,after being on constant IV antibiotics and fluids, her chest x-ray came back worse than a week ago. Also they have said something about a problem with her kidneys.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumonia is lung infection. If not treated appropriately, it can cause generalized sepsis in the body.This sepsis can damage other vital organs like kidney, heart, liver etc. Since her chest x ray is worsening after 7 days of antibiotic and her kidneys are also-ran showing problem, possibility of severe pneumonia with sepsis is more likely.Best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative pathogen and start appropriate treatment. For this bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) is needed. BAL culture and sensitivity should be done. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. So discuss about bronchoscopy and BAL with your doctor.

The er doctor ordered a blood test to check for a blood clot, then a ct scan with the dye or whatever it is that you get through an i.v. The doctor let me know that I have empysema, swollen lymphnodes in my chest, pneumonia (at the time), and that the scan showed two spots on my lungs that he said could be some form of malignous cancer, I probably did not say that exactly correct, but those words was included. I did a follow up with a family doctor. He took a chest x-ray and did a breathing test on me. My percentage was 61 before a breathing treatment, and 81 after a treatment. He said he did not really see nothing to indicate cancer from the x-ray but I did have the swollen lymphnodes and he wanted to examine the ct scan a little more and have another one done in 3 months. Two radiologists, that looked at my scan results from the er, told me I needed to get to a doctor as quickly as possible, and I did, Im kinda concerned that he did not seem to take much interest in the possible spots and am very concerned and would like to know what I am dealing with. The COPD is bad enough and I have alot of trouble with shortness of breath just walking a very short distance and my back has began to hurt alot just under my shoulder blades. Any advice???","Doctor":"Hello, I can imagine that these spots in the lungs are distressing and I hope I can shed some light here. Pulmonary nodules (spots in the lungs) are fairly common, and as you know they can be caused by very minor/benign issues like an infection/pneumonia, or they can be serious and represent a growing cancer. In most cases there is no way to tell right away which one it is. With your COPD, and assuming that you have smoked during your lifetime, you are at a higher risk for lung cancer. The main factor that determines the next step is the size of the nodules. Bigger nodules warrant closer follow up. Smaller nodules can be followed at a wider time interval (for example 12 months instead of 3 months). Three months is a reasonable interval to repeat the CT to assess if there is any growth in the nodules and this is most likely what I would order for you as well if I was seeing you in my clinic (of course this depends on the actual size of and other characteristics of the nodules). If there is growth, you most likely will need surgical resection of the nodules depending on where they are located and the function of your lungs. I hope this answers your questions."},{"Patient":"my friend has a core throat, congestion, c/o chest pain , achy muscles. says she has never felt this bad. i am concerned for her. i work in a hosp and am not aware of anything going around there. some members of her family have had strep throat. she has been on antibiotics","Doctor":"I'm sorry to hear that your friend is feeling under the weather.

These last couple of months she has been experiancing alot of exhaustion, causing her to lose focus in her school work, which she is a senior in high school, before was very motivated for school, now if she can get the energy to go to school she does, otherwise she is in bed, or when she can go out and get some socialization, she comes home before curfew. For a couple of weeks she had alot of crying spells and sever depression moments, after they occured we took her to the doctor and put her on medication; thinking it would help with the exhaustion, crying, socialization, and depression. She is now on cymbalta, before trying this one she was on prozac. In the last month, she hasn't cried at all, she seems to have no emotion, she's sleeping more when she doesn't want to, and when she wants to do something she doesn't get any sleep causing her not to be able to go out. Back pain has been a problem, she has scoliosis already, but in her lower back and its very minor, she has been complaining of back pain only on the right side of her body, where her rib cage is. We have tried popping her back and massaging it, but she is saying that its inside of her ribs not outside. When doing normal activities, like walking in and out of a building, and around the house, outside to her car, which is not far, she becomes severly out of breath and has to take a moment to catch it, and her heart rate starts racing. Everytime she takes a deep breath, she says she feels a pain were her back is hurting, I have noticed that when she is breathing normally its small breaths, not complete breaths. She has been tapping alot as well. When shes sitting on the couch she cant sit still alway tapping her feet or rocking back and fourth. After starting her medication, she has lost weight, going from 120 to 109 in two months. When it comes to urination she has no problem but her urine is constantly a different color every time, sometimes its light, then sometimes its really dark. Before I took her to the doctor I had her write all of her symptoms down, so we went to an urgent care in our town the first visit, he only pressed on her back three times, then gave her very strong muscle relaxers, which did nothing but make her drunk feeling. So I took her back again, the nurse practitioner who always sees her came in and we gave her the symptoms list, she thought it could have been a blood clot in her lung because our family has a genetic disease called antiphospholipid syndrome, which makes our blood clot more than normal. But, my daughter has never been diagnosed with it, so the nurse examined my daughter, saying her oxygen levels were at a 96, which is low for a teen who isnt obese and doesnt smoke. The nurse ordered a chest xray and blood test. They both came out fine according to the nurse. We are having her tested for the syndrome. But, my daughter is still in pain. Could it be something really serious that we are overlooking? Please help, she wants to go back to being a normal teen, and senior.

The fact that it has not grown much over 4 years makes it more likely to be benign, and would only require follow-up imaging. When there is enough concern for malignant tumors (for example if there is fast growth or you have an extensive smoking history), the nodule would need to be surgically resected. If you are having other symptoms such as fevers and chills, then your doctor can evaluate you for an infectious granulomas being the cause of this nodule.

The possibilities depend on the extent of lymphadenopathy. You are right that lymphoma is one of the (many) causes of lymph node enlargement. Depending on the pattern of lymph node enlargement, you will likely need a biopsy of a lymph node. If there are peripheral lymph nodes (like under the armpits, in the neck, or in the groin), these can be biopsied. This type of biopsy can be guided by ultrasound or CT scan. If the lymph nodes are only in the lungs, then these can be biopsied with bronchoscopy using a small ultrasound called EBUS (endobronchial ultrasound).

Smoking often causes a chronic cough, which often is attributed to direct damage to the lung over years in the form of a disease called \\"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\", or COPD (sometimes referred to as emphysema). This can be diagnosed on breathing tests (pulmonary function tests). Although COPD by itself shouldn't cause coughing up blood, severe enough coughing can tear or injure the airways and this can lead to expectoration of blood temporarily. Because of your smoking history, you should have an x-ray of the chest done to make sure there are no lesions or tumors in the lungs that are causing this expectoration of blood. If you expectorate blood again, then you should have a more extensive workup that would include a CT of the chest and possibly even bronchoscopy. COPD is a treatable disease, and there are inhalers available to help reduce coughing. However, the damage that has been done to the lungs is irreversible. I commend you for quitting smoking, as this is the best thing you can do for your health's benefit."},{"Patient":"my heart has been hurting and I have asphorous ulcers over my left chest int he heart area as well as the left of my back in the parallel place, the bubles are similar to the ones caused by the celiacs I suffer from.

Chest area is commonly affected by the herpes zoster. Herpes zoster virus affect thoracic dermatomes. So lesions are parallel to ribs.Fluid filled bubbles is another characteristic of herpes zoster.Ulcers over chest suggest more severe disease.

It often resolves, although this may take a lot of time. Smoking is a well-known irritant that will only make your symptoms worse unfortunately. I would strongly advise quitting completely and never looking back. You may need an inhaler to help counteract the irritation of your airways and thus improve your symptoms. I hope you feel better"},{"Patient":"hi, i have had a very bad cough over the last 2 months that seems to get worse with the cold weather, i have been to my local gp who have done a breath test which was good, tried anti biotics, anti allergy tablets and inhaler nothing works. >im worried may be something worse than it seems.","Doctor":"Hello, I'm sorry to hear you've been struggling with this cough for 2 months. Another common cause of coughing is reflux or heartburn. Symptoms of this include experience a burning pain in the middle of the chest, sour taste in the mouth, and coughing especially when lying down flat. You could try an over the counter acid-suppressant like ranitidine or omeprazole. Some people find benefit from using a wedge pillow or elevating the head of their bed to reduce reflux of stomach acid into the airway. Asthma is also a common cause of cough that can be triggered by cold weather. Asthma may not cause any abnormalities on routine pulmonary function tests (breathing tests). A methacholine challenge test (or bronchoprovocative testing) is another test that may be more likely to diagnose asthma if your symptoms are caused by it. Asthma is treated with various inhalers depending on the severity of your symptoms. I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"My husband 64 years old had kidney transplant 9 months ago. He is diabetic and was on two BP meds before surgery.

His quality of life is much worse now than before the transplant although his kidney is still working beautifully as they like to say. The transplant team seems to be satisfied that the kidney is doing so well and are content with treating that. We are not OK with this. He can go nowhere without assistance because he can t stand for more than a few minutes or walk more than 50 feet without falling. I am at my wits end trying to find answers.

A possible disease that is characterized by coughing and enlarged hilar lymph nodes is sarcoidosis. If your symptoms are typical, you many not need any further tests. If your symptoms are not typical however, you may need a further work up. The first next step would be a CT of the chest to evaluate the lungs and the lymph nodes. Based on this, bronchoscopy may be required. This is where a long tube with a camera and light at the end of it is inserted through the nose or mouth down into the airway to inspect the inside of the airway and possibly take samples of lung tissue or lymph node tissue. I hope you feel better."},{"Patient":"I've been having a tightness in my chest lately. I'm a smoker and sometime's it's hard to take a deep breath. What should I do and what could be the cause?

I've been diagnosed with GAD in the passed but have no previous trouble in this area. So...what could be the culprit","Doctor":"Chest pain can have many possible causes and generally should prompt a medical evaluation to rule out serious causes. Important causes to rule out given your smoking history include heart disease, emphysema and asthma. The initial work up includes a medical history performed by a doctor, an electrocardiogram, and a chest x-ray. Generalized anxiety disorder makes you more prone to panic attacks which can present with chest pain like this, but the other more serious causes should be ruled out first before blaming it on anxiety. I hope you get this figured out soon."},{"Patient":"Dear  Sir, I had two ECGs yesterday within a minute. The first one showed Normal Sinus Rhythm, Septal Infarct and heart beat 83bpm.

My question is whether the mentioned ECG reports can be relied on or not. Awaiting your kind response.

Although the machine can measure many important parts of the ECG, it is not very reliable to interpret the ECG itself. ECG interpretation needs to be done by a trained physician.

Symptom management is your best option at this point. You can take an over the counter cough suppressant or prescription cough suppressants. Your doctor may be able to prescribe an inhaler to help with bronchitis associated cough temporarily if the other cough suppressants don't work for you."},{"Patient":"hello,i waana ask abt my father...actually his skin test for tb infection came negative,then sputum test too was negative,after bronchoscopy doctor went for sputum culture ,there in the 6th week they fond the tb bacteria...although my father is absolutely fine ..no cough ,no sputum problem could u pls tell me that how much the report is reliable","Doctor":"Hello, I understand the confusion that this situation can create, although it is not uncommon in TB. A skin test cannot reliably diagnose an active TB infection and thus a negative test does not rule out tuberculosis. Sputum can often diagnose tuberculosis, but when sputum samples are insufficient, bronchoscopic samples may be collected by a physician. These samples are far more accurate and reliable than simple sputum samples. A positive culture for TB from a bronchoscopic sample is very reliable and indicates infection with tuberculosis. The only important caveat is that the TB culture can sometimes pick up other bacteria as well. The \\"AFB\\" (Acid fast bacilli) culture can start growing bacteria that look like TB but are different bacteria (nontuberculous Mycobacteria). You should ask the doctor if the result so far is positive for Acid Fast Bacilli or for Tuberculosis. It takes a little bit of time to be able to identify the organism is true TB after the initial detection of Acid Fast Bacilli. I hope this clears things up a little bit."},{"Patient":"I have not had a drink in 24 hours but have a horrible pain in the middle of my chest that goes thru to my back and under my arms. it is hard to breathe.

Pain like this can be serious and causes can include tear of the esophagus due to damage by alcohol and vomiting or an ulcer in the stomach. It can also be a tear in a blood vessel or a heart related problem. You should go to the emergency room to have these symptoms evaluated and exclude serious causes.

You should not exceed the doses you are prescribed because this can cause severe side effects that can be fatal, especially because the treatment of TB requires many months of treatment. It is also not advisable to take only 1 medication because this can cause your bacteria to become resistant and this can make it harder to treat your infection in the future.

The CDC lists some of their recommendations here:"},{"Patient":"nervousness,fatigue,loss of appetite,panicky feeling which i got suddenly when i was on the bike with my friend,racing heart when i do any nervousness,fatigue,loss of appetite,panicky feeling which i got suddenly when i was on the bike with my friend,racing heart when i do any small work,tingling sensations in the chest,very sensitive on my left chestsmall work,tingling sensations in the chest,very sensitive on my left chest","Doctor":"Hi,This is Dr Sameer, cardiologist.Increased heart rate & palpitations can have a lot of causes.It can be normal sinus tachycardia due to anxiety or stress or it could be abnormal supra ventricular tachycardia.

It can affect the liver (hepatitis), the intestines (enteritis), or the peritoneum (peritonitis).

Cardiac causes  Heart attack. A heart attack is a result of a blood clot that's blocking blood flow to your heart muscle.Angina. Thick plaques can gradually build up on the inner walls of the arteries that carry blood to your heart. These plaques narrow the arteries and restrict the heart's blood supply, particularly during exertion.Aortic dissection. This life-threatening condition involves the main artery leading from your heart — your aorta. If the inner layers of this blood vessel separate, blood will be forced between the layers and can cause the aorta to rupture.Pericarditis. This condition, an inflammation of the sac surrounding your heart, usually causes sharp pain that gets worse when you breathe in or when you lay down. Noncardiac causes 1.GERD2.PULMONARY CAUSES 3 . MUSCULOSKELETAL causes4.DERMATOLOGY cause5 . PSYCHIATRY causes     Please take rest, and if you have any risk factors like obesity, smoking, alcoholism, hypertension and diabetes.

The last time this happen, I had chest pain for two days. Can you help explain why this is happening and what would be the long term effects.  Thank you. ---- Viv","Doctor":"You may have sensitive airways. This could be full blown asthma or simply just bronchial irritation. If it triggers symptoms that are this severe and prolonged, it would be best to avoid this exposure all together. You can try taking an albuterol inhaler immediately prior to or during this kind of exposure, it may help reduce the symptoms, but avoidance is more important."},{"Patient":"I had heart stroke 10 years back,chronic heavy smoker with on insulin from 4 years,at about 1 1/2 year back always whole abdomen scanning showing impression  fatty liver unattended by any doctor.Now my age is 48 years,just now ocassionally for few moments  chest pain occuring.I request you sir to guide me what to do and which doctor i should consult and the sudden possibilty of the fatty liver wat steps i should take personally and  some guidence to be given to the concerned doctor for correct diagnosis for correct treatment.I am living in india at hyderabad,Andhra pradesh.Kindly help me for which i greatly helpful forever.","Doctor":"Chest pain can be initially evaluated by a general practitioner or Cardiologist. It is important to be evaluated for this, as chest pain can be a serious symptom. The fatty liver is unlikely to be the cause of your chest pain. You can see a Gastroenterologist for this to obtain an ultrasound of your liver and blood work to evaluate your liver enzymes and function."},{"Patient":"in the beginning of February I was urinating blood and they diagnosed me with a UTI and I was on cipro. 3 days after that medication was finished I got a sore throat and fever and had really bad tonsillitis and was prescribed keflex. Now it has been 5 days since that medication was finished and I have a really bad cold, which I think is turning into bronchitis. is this normal or ok... and if I have bronchitis is it safe to go on 3 different antibiotics in 1 month.","Doctor":"Exposure to antibiotics can alter the type of bacteria that live in your body and make them more resistant, and thus harder to treat when you have a future infection. Physicians try to limit antibiotic prescriptions as much as possible to protect you from this effect. That being said, if you have 3 different infections that truly require antibiotics, then it is okay to take the antibiotics. The benefit of treating the infection would outweight this downside. However, keep in mind that bronchitis often does not require antibiotics and gets better on its own."},{"Patient":"Hi I just had some sort of attack, it's happened a few times before but not on a regular basis and I can't seem to find a link.

Endocrine problems like overactive thyroid or pheochromocytoma can also cause this, although they are not common causes of this constellation of symptoms."},{"Patient":"I have a cousin in hospice and hes a tbi patient who has a trach and has a lot of mucus and we r having to stop is bolus feeds im just wondering how long he can survive without them","Doctor":"Hello, I am sorry to hear what you and your family are going through. It must be very tough. The duration of survival without feeding depends on the underlying person. If he has a lot of nutrient stores, then he could theoretically survive for several weeks. Malnourished people on the hand may not survive as long without feeding. Hospice care focuses on the patient's comfort, and it is important to realize that feeding him may not necessarily add to his comfort level and would in fact prolong his suffering."},{"Patient":"I am worried about my husband who has been experianceing chest pain for almost a week (on and off) Some has been with aching in the left arm.

He has agreed to go to the Dr but, I am worried now and don't know if this should wait another 24hours. Help?  This is making my stomach hurt I am so worried....","Doctor":"I certainly agree with you that he should seek immediate medical attention. Chest pain radiating to the arm can be very serious and life-threatening causes such as a heart attack or tear of the aorta need to be ruled out quickly. I hope he feels better."},{"Patient":"about an hour ago I breathed in smoke for about 10-15 min. in an almost out of control fire ( we put it out). immediately after the fire I began coughing up black mucus. since then my lungs and throat feel like they are burning, when I try to speak more than a few words I begin coughing up a creamy white mucus. I have a headache and am nauseated. When I move around i become dizzy. Should I go to the ER or will the symptoms pass over time?","Doctor":"You should go to the ER given the symptoms you have of headache and nausea, which can be indicative of carbon monoxide toxicity, which can be serious. The smoke likely irritated your airways and caused irritative bronchitis."},{"Patient":"hi had indigestion fo years and was taking losec but after a realy bad chest infection and severe coughing, istarted with heartburn and ache that goes through to back on left side and a feeling of something moving like when your pregnant but this only happens when i sit down doc gave me lansaprole but dont seem to be helping thanks","Doctor":"Severe indigestion that leads to lung problems can be serious.There are more advanced treatment options for bad indigestion and reflux that include surgical procedures. You can talk to your gastroenterologist about these options. In the meantime, I would recommend that you sleep with a wedge pillow, with your torso angled up at your hips to help prevent acid from regurgitating into your airways and lungs, which can cause several major problems. If you don't have a wedge pillow, you can use something to elevate the head of the bed (like bricks under 2 corners of the bed)."},{"Patient":"I have sleep apnea and didn't get a good night's rest last night.  This morning my blood pressure was 170 over 105 according to my home digital monitor.  I did almost vomit, but it was more like that vomit reflex when you smell something rancid.  Should staying home from work to get more sleep be enough to level myself out?  I'm 38, 5'10\\" 230lbs.  I don't smoke but occasionally I am exposed to second hand smoke.  I drink maybe a few times a year.  I don't use any illegal drugs, tend to avoid taking medications at all unless I NEED to and haven't used any OTC like Tylenol or aspirin in more than a month maybe.","Doctor":"It is important to get to the root of why you didn't get a good night's sleep. Is it because the CPAP mask does not fit, is it because the pressure is too high or too low? Or is it due to another reason? High blood pressure is a natural response to inefficient sleep, which is what happens in sleep apnea. CPAP can temporarily fix it to allow you to get better quality sleep, and thus improve your blood pressure and make you feel better. Weight loss is crucial as this is the only way to permanently improve the severity of your sleep apnea."},{"Patient":"Is AV Node Ablation a good treatment for my 81 yr old mother (she's a young 81!) with shortness of breath (worsening over the past 90 days)?

If that is the case, the procedure itself would prevent the irregular and sometimes fast electrical activity from the atria from reaching the ventricles. This has the potential to improve shortness of breath that is caused by ventricles that are beating too quickly. However, your mother may also have other causes of shortness of breath that are directly related to the efficiency of the pumping function of the heart.

These include asthma (airways that are hyper-reactive to irritants), COPD or emphysema (damage to your airways and lungs by smoking or biomass), and bronchiectasis (damage to your airways often from prior infections leading to high levels of sputum production and cough). A chest x-ray is a start to help evaluate your symptoms.

A C S Reddy, Professor of Mech Engineering","Doctor":"You may need a second inhaler. Cold weather is often a trigger for asthma symptoms. Assuming that the inhaler you are referring to is albuterol, you will need a second inhaler to control and prevent your symptoms, at least during the winter time. This inhaler should be an inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone, budesonide, or beclomethasone (among others)."},{"Patient":"Hi have hade a  bad cough for 2 days know  and today i have only coughed like 6 times but there like 30 second coughs and they hurt realy bad i  have been taking 24 hour clariton for alergys and when i breath i have a weeping sound and my lungs feel like bubblesi, may I answer your health queries right now","Doctor":"You may have an infection of the airways (bronchitis or bronchiolitis) that is causing these symptoms.

It has lasted up to seven minutes before but then after I stop seeing or thinking about it I'm fine.  One time I was having one of these heat flash things and I stood up and walked to try to get rid of it but it only felt like I was being pushed down and my body just some how sat down and layed itself down. When my head touched the ground I did not even realize I was laying down and I stood back up and my body cooled down and I felt normal.

Average height and weight. I have had a total hysterectomy in 2006. I by chance had a d dimer ran about a year ago now and it was at 900. Thinking this was maybe this was my normal. They checked it again in a couple of weeks and it was 1,200 then 1,800, then 2,200 and as of yesterday it is 2,656. I have been to see Oncologist who ran multiple tests including CT of chest and US of legs. US was negative. CT shows two lung nodules and I will have another CT next month. I also have a positive ANA with an RNP antibody of greater than 8. I was sent to a Rheumatologist for this and that apt was a joke. He told me I didn t have Lupus and that was it. I am very concerned that I have a blood clot forming somewhere in my body that will break off and either give me a stroke, heart attack or aneurism. Any thoughts on why my d dimer is increasing. Any advise or response would be greatly appreciated. I do work in a lab and have been informed that it may be a blood clot. I have back pain and seem to catch myself breathing at a rapid rate without exertion. Please advise. Thank you.","Doctor":"D-dimer can certainly be elevated in the presence of a blood clot, but it can also be elevated in other scenarios as well, most commonly inflammatory disorders. Your doctors have ruled out pulmonary embolism on the chest CT (assuming it was done with contrast as an angiogram) and deep venous thrombosis of your legs with ultrasound. You can also have ultrasounds done of your arms to exclude that, although this is a less common site for clots. If you have any other symptoms, you should be evaluated for any evidence of inflammation in your body which could explain a high D-dimer."},{"Patient":"I am a 55 year old women with COPD among other things.

Does it sound like lung with the no energy , hard to breath and so on?","Doctor":"You should have your heart re-evaluated as this is a common cause of breathlessness and limb heaviness. If nothing concerning is found in the heart, you can proceed to having a chest x-ray done to screen for lung problems that may explain this."},{"Patient":"My blood pressure went up to 198/83 last night and I didn't feel well.

Your thoughts please,I thank you","Doctor":"Oxygen is prescribed when someone's oxygen levels are below a certain number. Assuming that this was the reason he was prescribed oxygen, he should start using it immediately. The CT will not determine whether or not he needs oxygen, although may help explain why he needs it. The oxygen by itself may not necessarily make him feel better, but it is one of the few interventions that will protect his body and allow him to live longer."},{"Patient":"Hi, my blood pressure has decreased over the last few months and has been quite low in the last few days. My personal trainers were concerned and did an ecg to check heart and blood pressure. Blood pressure was 88/68, ECG was fine. Saw my GP yesterday and it was 110/?? but he said it wasn t too low and recent blood tests showed normal results. I m currently being treated for neuroendochrine tumour so have had lots of diarrhoea in the last few months. I think that may be the cause of the low blood pressure. Oncologist said tumours would not have affected my blood pressure. I am drinking plenty of fluids. The diarrhea is not constant so wondering if I should take some medication to stop the diarrhoea. I normally suffer from constipation and have haemorrhoids.","Doctor":"Although the blood pressure reading is low, it may not be dangerous depending on the symptoms that you had during that time and what your baseline blood pressure is. Some people walk around with a blood pressure of 80/60 and feel fine, this is just their normal. If this is dramatically lower than your normal blood pressure, then you should be evaluated for this. Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which can certainly drop your blood pressure."},{"Patient":"I ve had a persistent, productive cough for over a year, with associated breathlessness and fatigue.

What do you think might be the cause?","Doctor":"You should have your doctor evaluate you for COPD (chronic obstructive lung disease), bronchiectasis, and congestive heart failure.

If I press the underside it feels lumpy and as if I have been kicked. I have re called my Doctor and he has said that it is the aftermath of a bad infection. I just would like reassurance, and any advise as to how to speed up the healing process? The right breast is slightly sensitive at the right side, but nothing like the left. I am wondering whether the milk ducts in the breast area coulod have become blocked or infected? I finished breast feeding 12 months ago? I am also experiences intermittant tingling in my hands, which I have had since my first cold symptoms in January. Any advise is much appreciated. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello dearWarm welcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  This seems in relation with underlying lung inflammation still present ,     not  blockage of mammary ducts or else .*  Recommendations for better  recovery  -  Ask for an x-ray  chest  with your doctor , and  lab tests  if  not  done .

I also had a preventative surgery on my left side (as blebs were found in a CT). I'm still experiencing a lot of pain on my right side and it feels as if I cannot breathe properly. I still get pain on my left side, but it's nowhere near as bad. Just wondering if there is anything I can do about it, because my doctor just tells me it's normal, but I know it isn't. I'm 19 and I had the surgeries when I was 15.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Pleura is the layer surrounding lungs. It's main function is to provide lubrication to lungs while breathing (inspiration and expiration).Pleurodesis means artificially we are reducing pleural space and join two pleural layers. It is commonly done to prevent recurrent pneumothorax.So Pleurodesis patients won't have lubricating effect while breathing and hence they feel pain and difficulty in deep inhalation.This is normal thing after Pleurodesis.No treatment is required for this. You can apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest for symptomatic relief.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Previously I was taking seroflo 250 twice a day and tiova once daily, two puffs each time. now I am prescribed by another doctor that I should take foracort 400 twice daily and furamist AZ nasal spray once daily. I am just wondering what should I do??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Seroflo is having salmeterol and fluticasone.Foracort is having formoterol and budesonide.Both are having same group of drugs, only difference is with dosing. Foracort 400 will have higher dose of budesonide.Now in COPD treatment, no role of increasing dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).So need to take foracort 400.COPD treatment guidelines suggests that LAMA (long acting Muscarinic antagonist) like tiotropium, glycopyronium are good for COPD patients. So continue with Tiova inhaler.So in my opinion, you should continue with Seroflo and Tiova.If you are having nasal symptoms like sneezing, running nose or blocked nose then start furamist nasal spray.Hope I have solved your query.

I work as a Secretary in office and being busy my shulder hurts more when I sit in front of the computer for 8 hours.

I would recommend you to continue keeping a record of your readings ( regularly for a week atleast ) and avoid apparatus especially one which measures on the wrist. Readings should be taken from both arms and take the average reading as blood pressure at that moment. If blood pressure continues to drop please reduce dose of lisinopril upto 5mg ( can be reduced to 2.5 mg also) once daily initially, but do not cut the medicine completely. As far as pulse is considered it seems to be within normal range, lisinopril doesn't have direct effect on heart rate though. Please refer back to us or your physician for further evaluation if required.I hope that answers your question.Dr.Uppal"},{"Patient":"I occasionally have a sudden uncontrolled deep inhalation.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,SVT, uncontrolled hypertension, dizzy spells, cyanosis of lips , hands and vertigo (coordination) all indicates symptoms of chronic heart failure and Ischemic hypertensive encephalopathy. First of all, it is very important to distinguish whether the arrhythmia (SVT) is permanent atrial fibrillation (I guess it is as u are on Sotalol), holter monitoring should be done to find out frequency of paroxysmal episodes and proper cardiologist consultation( with lipid profile, recent ECG, holter and echocardiogram) should be seeked in case of severe interruption of day to day activity so that a ablation could be arranged if required. Hypertension can be controlled by taking combos such as Losartan+Hydrochlothizide intially 100/12.5 in the morning. Amiodarone can be used during paroxysmal episodes of atrial fibrillation 200mg (accoring to treating physician's advice) Also supportive therapy should be considered to avoid neuro circulatory complication during hypertensive crisis such as IV Pyracetam infusion after complete evaluation.Dr.Uppal"},{"Patient":"Hi I have a sharp pain on and off in the right side of upper chest.

Still I am waiting the result it will take 9 weeks to know the result.  would you please advise or tell me the possiblity of being TB positive without any symptom of TB?","Doctor":"Hello ! I can understand your concern.  If you are completely asymptomatic and doing healthy then it is quite unlikely that you will have TB.  Not all white things on an x ray are Tb. Sometimes even  twisted positioning of a normal person while taking x ray will cause white shadows in the x ray , which can be misinterpreted as abnormal if we fail to realise that it's rather the rotation of the patient and nothing abnormal . Likewise if you have not taken a proper deep inspiration while taking x ray too , there can be white shadows in the lower portion of lung.  These are just examples to tell you how even a normal person can , due to technical errors while taking x ray , land up with abnormal shadow on x ray . So first thing I would suggest is you review with your physician/ radiologist and discuss again.If in doubt and clinically indicated, you can get a CT chest done to see what the white thing is all about .   hope this helps.

Considering your history you seem to have pleural effusion (fluid collection around the lungs) due to cardiac problem likely heart failure.  As your heart has got weakened, it might be unable to pump blood normally and because of this there is seepage of fluid in the space around the lungs.To confirm this you should go for an echocardiography which gives a clear idea regarding the functioning of your heart.  One more thing to be done is to send the fluid aspirated from around your lungs for analysed.  Complete analysis report of the pleural fluid will point towards the most likely cause for the fluid collection.  The most important treatment for pleural effusion due to cardiac problem is to treat the underlying cardiac problem adequately. Once that is done , eventually the fluid will also reduce - most likely you will need T. Lasix which flushes off the exceed fluid through urine.Also Consume less than 1 litre water per day and restrict salt intake, these help in reducing the fluid collection.

Thick yellow sputum is suggestive more of bacterial infection for which you will need the right choice if antibiotic.  You can empirically take a course of Tab. Amoxyclav or Tab. Azithromycin along with tab. pantoprazole.  One way to differentiate whether it is viral or bacterial is to go for a complete blood count with differential counts , and blood C- Reactive protein assay . However in your case it is rather cost effective to take a course of antibiotic and look for the improvement , rather than spend on these tests. You can get a sputum culture sensitivity done before starting antibiotic as this test tells which organism has caused your Infection and what antibiotic will act against.  This test is also not mandatory . Along with medications, do warm saline gargle and gargle with betadine solution (after diluting few drops in a glass of lukewarm water) thrice daily.

I am 30 years of age, 5 2 and 119 pounds. I have a higher then normal cholesterol level of 193. When researching I have read that anything under 200 is considered normal although the docs do consider it to be a bit high. I have also experienced low blood sugar in the past off and on for about 5 years. I seemed to have low blood sugar issues since I caught the virus mononucleosis in 2007. Honestly, my body has never been the same. I have been waking up at night about an hour after falling asleep with rapid heart rate, higher then normal BP of usually 130 to 145 over 93 and heart rate can get up to 110 to 113 at times. I start shaking all over and become weak all over and lightheaded. I feel cold in my hands and feet. I also have a lot of numbness in my hands and feet while lying down and while sleeping at night. this symptom has been going on over a year. I have been to the ER and was told I had a heart arrhythmia but nothing serious whatsoever. I also had a low Rdw of 12.2 blood test and low phosphorus of 2.1. I also have a drop in blood pressure when lying down. sometimes is goes as low as 87/44 but heart rate is within normal range. These recent blood tests were the only tests that were low. I did have an ekg which was normal and chest x-ray which was normal as well. I was recently thinking maybe I had a thyroid issue or endocrine issue. I have had basic thyroid tests done and they were in normal range but my direct T4 seemed to me to be on the lower end of normal. When I told a Nurse from the ER my recent thyroid test results, He said it was on the low normal side. Do I seem to have some kind of heart issue and why do I have these episodes at night? Sometimes the episodes are so severe I have to get into the shower just to shock my body. It can be very scary. Any suggestions or input you can provided me with would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi,This is Dr Sameer, cardiologist.Increased heart rate & palpitations can have a lot of causes.It can be normal sinus tachycardia due to anxiety or stress or it could be abnormal supra ventricular tachycardia. For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia. If the duration of palpitations are short enough to reach a nearby hospital, we put a 24hr ECG monitoring (Holter Monitor). You also need to do a 2D Echo & thyroid function test to see for any associated abnormality if any.As you have already done a thyroid profile which seem to be normal, I'll recommend you for a echo & holter study to see if their is really some heart abnormality.Your cholesterol is normal & you don't have to worry about that.Normally when we sleep, our body tend to get relaxed & thus our bp falls. This is also a normal phenomenon. But if the bp is falling significantly on changing posture than it sometimes mean fluid deficiency in body & you need to take more of fluids.Rest be stress free, live a healthy life & you Will be absolutely fine.ThanksDr Sameer Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

If their are clots inside your heart & they are moving than you should be alarmed. These clots can go to brain (as you said they have already gone), Lung- causing pulmonary embolism which is also a serious condition. They can go to extremities like hands & legs and can cause gangrene.We generally gives blood thinner to such patients which helps in keeping the blood thin & thus decrease embolism. These blood thinner should continue life long.You will also need a trans esophageal echo(TEE) to know exactly the size of hole & whether it could be closed.So please make a appointment with your cardiologist soon for further management.If you want any further help, I'll be happy to assist you.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, im a 19 year old female, with no major medical conditions, except moderate asthma, which is under control.

GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in esophagus and cause symptoms of chest pain, chest pressure, tightness etc.So take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination twice daily before food.Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.Avoid hot and spicy food.

Plavix needs to be taken up to 3 years then he can alone be on Aspirin. It basically keeps blood thin and avoid stent blockage.      He should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly.

Thanks for posting your query . The course and treatment for pleurisy depends on the cause of pleurisy. Pleurisy due to some causes like viral infection do resolve with just supportive medications and time.

Moderate MR with mild MS does not require surgery at present but it may progress in future & may require surgery. She will have mild breathing difficulty which is a normal disease natural history.

Thanks"},{"Patient":"We have a useless emergency room in our county (rural Texas town).  There is no point going there.  The nearest decent hospital is in Abilene - 75 miles away.  My husband says he feels like there is a balloon in his chest, sometimes cutting off his air supply.  He's been getting excessively hot today.  He has a heart history (currently his heart function is good), mild COPD, very mild apnea, and no new blockages as of january - we just went through a ton of tests - all negative.  His knee needs replaced (35 year old partial replacement is giving him trouble) and he has a lot of pain in the hip on the same side.  He has had 3 strokes, 2 nervous breakdowns, 9 heart attacks, 6 stents and 4 bypasses. He doesn't smoke or drink.  I did some checking on the COPD and found out he should be eating smaller meals more often.  He is often very fatigued with that hip and knee pain; he has a severe allergy to black mold and we almost lost him last fall.  He's been doing well and had a great day until about 4pm - went down like a sack of rocks.  There have been two breaks in his neck - I suspect he has a pinched nerve because he is always having undefined seizures - they are short and he quickly recovers but they look like a stroke.  No one can ever tell us anything.  His vitals are consistently good even when he is having a seizure though I caught him yesterday stop breathing for a SECOND or two when taking his blood pressure during an \\"episode\\".  I've asked about a pacemaker - his cardiologist says he doesn't need one.  But his blood pressure routinely drops low, pulse gets low sometimes.  If he doesn't get his coffee he's in real trouble.  Tonight he's feeling rough, especially since he did too much yesterday and tried to get around quite a bit today.  He hates to sit around doing nothing, just trying to feel good.  The immediate problem is this balloon-feeling in his chest and difficulty breathing.  What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello dearWelcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your concern in depth .*  This seems either acute exacerbation  of COPD or relapsing heart issue .*  Suggestions at present      -  Take him to sit in semi reclining chair in fresh air .    -  Deep breathing exercises immediately improve the oxygenation of        the lungs .    -  Allow  some green tea or coffee .    -  Check pulse , BP and respiration rate for 1 minute , if find alterations         call the doctor  for help .Hope this will help you for sure .Wishing him fine recovery from the same.

My doctor also said it was due to PMSing, but I experience it all month long, and it worsens with PMSing. Every time I have an \\"episode,\\" it leaves me exhausted for days, which is terrible because it happens every few days. Basically, I'm tired all the time and I feel my heartbeat, which is irregular, all throughout my body. Nothing I do seems to help slow my heart down, and it gets worse when I try to sleep. I lost some weight when I was 16, and it became rare that I'd have this problem and I wouldn't get tired back then. I recently turned 18 and the episodes have been a lot more frequent and extreme in the past few months.

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation.Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.Is there any stress or anxiety associated.

Got admitted yesterday. They told me that I have multiple clots in both lungs. This is my second time having these clots. I had them previously in 2010. Just trying to get 2nd opinions on treatment options and the best medications. Doctors unsure about the true causes. I was in the military in 2010 and had a 15 hour plane ride from Kuwait and I was on birth control for many years(since 1993). The doctors say that could have been the causes. I went from May to August 2010 thinking I had asthma. That was what the military doctors told me. This time, during Thanksgiving holidays, I rode to Texas by car from Atlanta which was about 10-11 hrs. I am 48 yrs old. The Drs are wanting to put in a filter this time but I ve not heard good news about those IVC filters and I ve also saw the law suit commercials on them recently. They say that now I will have to take Blood thinning medication for the rest of my life. They also tell me that there are better and newer meds than Coumadin available now?

Treatment of PE depends on size, site and number of clots and severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Since you are having multiple clots, blood thinners are the only option. Also get done 2d echo to know the severity of PH. Newer bloody thinners are available and should be started in your case. Warfarin, fenofibrate are commonly used now a days. You can should avoid broccoli and green leafy vegetables when you are on blood thinners. Salt restriction is must. Treatment duration is minimum 9-12 months.

Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.Albuterol is short acting beta 2 agonist. If used more (more than 5 times a day), this causes sympathetic hyperactivity. This in turn causes tachycardia, palpitations, rise in blood pressure, tremors etc.So albuterol can damage heart if taken too frequently.So better to restrict its use to less than 3-4 times a day in cardiac patients.Hope I have solved your query.

About 1 year ago I  traveled from Miami to peru, where I own an apartment and upon my return after experiencing pretty severe symptoms I was dx with pulmonary embolism.  My apartment is closed several months out of the year and I believe that there may be some mold in it.  Is it possible to get a pulmonary embolism from being exposed to mold for a short period of about a week?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.No, pulmonary embolism can not be caused by mold exposure of any duration (short or prolonged).

About 7 month ago, I felt sudden stabbing pain in my left chest area, followed by a feeling of warmness rediating and releasing from where the stabbing pain originates, followed by nausea and fatigue. This happened three times in a period of 40 minutes. I had ECG and Holter monitor on the next day and everything came back fine. Since then, there has no more stabbing pain, but it develops into a pattern of sudden onset of severe chest, back and sholder pain with slight nausea, very deep and dull, worse off when I stretch or tilt back or trun my head left. Had my blood test, stress test, ECGs a few month ago and Dr don't think I have heart problem. One thing I want to mention is that I did have tremendous pressure in life and some anxiety issues when this first happened, could this pressure and anxiety cause my problem?

Now I suspect that this might have something to do with me swimming three days ago, might have streached a muscle or something but it's really hard to tell. Could it be that it has something to do with my heart? ( Yes that's what I'm worried about ) I mean, I don't smoke, don't drink. I walk atleast 40 minutes per day, usually more and I also attend to Athletic class in school. I'm not overweight, I'm actually rather skinny, but I have been eating more fat products these latest weeks ( Crisps etc ) But only once a week, so yeah, could this be serious or is it just me acting silly?

I used to have multi resistance TB. And I need your help regarding this. My TB history: APRIL 2004: first time detected, cough fever etc. first treatment  for 3 months and I feel ok. (i was in munich germany) MAY 2005: came back: was in hospital for 8 weeks in isolation, MTB detected, treatment with Anti MTB medicines (i was in munich germany)... Strptomycin, Cirpofloxin, ethanbutol taken for 1 yr. and 3 months around. APRIL 2008: TB came back with very badly.. cough, fever etc... dr. suggested medicine (H/R/E/S/LFX)..I feel good but have lymphnodes in stomach. The x rays were become stable. October 2009: I came back to germany and regular CT scan check up... nodes found not decreasing. I had no fever, no cough nothing, I was okay. German doctor said the infection is increasing better to make operation the left most infected part of small upper lobe in left side is removed. (hospitalization in germany 8 weeks) from sept 2009 I have taken following medications till jan 2011: Moxifloxacine 400 mg 1-0-0 Pyrazinamide 500 mg 3-0-0 strptomycine 1 g     1-0-0 (stopped after 2 months) Para aminosaliclic acid (PSA granuals) 0-0-1 Benzbromaron        1-0-0 Omeprazol 20 mg    0-0-1 Terizidon                1-1-2 zyvoxid                  1-0-0 (medications have many side effects, missmaneged some drug after 8 months) Problem of today: I did CT scan in jun 2010 and it looks stable...

The result is negative no bacteria found after 8 weeks also and bronchoscopy result also negative.. no bacteira found after 8 weeks no growth...

Your bronchoscopy was normal. Your sputum AFB culture is also negative.So no need to worry for tuberculosis at present.CT scan is most likely showing old healed lesions. Tubercular lesions on lung heal by fibrosis. And these healed areas are seen on chest x ray and CT scan life long.

First of all no need to worry for heart diseases as your ecg and 2d echo are normal. Belching and central chest pain are seen in GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination twice daily before food.

I have felt this while eating but maybe not to the same severity. Even drinking water doesn't help. It feels even more painful and doesnt go down. Have had her blood tested for celiac but it came out negative. What else could it be?","Doctor":"Hi there,This sounds like achalasia, which is failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax.  The lower esophageal sphincter is a valve that separates the stomach from the esophagus, and it prevents food and stomach acid from going back into the esophagus from the stomach. Sometimes, the sphincter is too tight and doesn't relax very well, which is called achalasia.  The usual diagnosis for this is something called an upper GI, in which the patients drinks some contrast and then x-rays are taken, and you'll see a pattern like a bird's beak at the lower esophageal sphincter.  Another test she should have is manometry, which tests all the pressures throughout the esophagus.The treatment for achalasia is something called a Heller Myotomy, where the muscle fibers near the lower esophageal sphincter are cut in order to allow it to relax.  This can be done laparoscopically with small incisions.  Some medications can be used, but the best treatment, especially in patients who are healthy and of young age is a Heller Myotomy. I hope I have answered your questions.

We can not cure it 100%.We can definitely halt its progression. And for this, you need to follow these steps. 1. Smoking cessation 2. Inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) 3. Adult pulmonary vaccines like influenza and pneumococcal. 4. Enroll in Pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are taught.

You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Continue same treatment (RID AR and fluticon FT nasal spray) for allergic rhinitis for 5-6 months. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I went swimming in the sea on Monday in a wetsuit in Cornwall for about 15 minutes only, and I have developed a very sudden chesty cough.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac diseases for your symptoms. So consult cardiologist and get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, undiagnosed stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Before some day ago on Monday I have pain in my chaste than I go hospital and check to Dr. he say for ECG & Xray after found that report I will go and checked him.

No need to worry for heart and lung diseases as your ecg and chest x ray are normal. Sometimes undiagnosed stress, anxiety can also cause similar kind of chest pain.

I notice that these symptoms come more after I eat.  I am a smoker.  I informed my doctor and she made me pass a stress test for my heart, everthing was good.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more likely. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burping, chest tightness, pressure etc. Smokers are more prone for GERD. So first of all stop smoking immediately. Start pantoprazole and levosulperide combination twice daily on empty stomach. Avoid hot, spicy and large meals. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Go for walking after meals. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these but first quit smoking. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"about a week ago, my son was in his car and he stretched and his chest below the left nipple started to hurt and it was difficult for him to breath fully in and out.  I told him to take 4 to 5 deep breaths to see if that would help if it was gas.  He says that it has gradually stopped hurting as bad, but still hurts some when he breaths and when he bends or stoops over.  He is also coughing, but no mucus.  could he have bronchitis?","Doctor":"Hi there,This could be bronchitis, but most likely this is due to atelectasis, or collapse of the smaller airways in the lungs due to his inability to take deep breaths. I'd recommend he really work on talking deep breaths, which will cause him to cough and will open up his deep airways.  The other possibility is that he has a partially collapsed lung (pneumothorax) which would also cause him to cough.If he continues to have coughing and this is not improving, I recommend he undergo a chest x-ray, which is a good test to show any abnormalities he may have incurred secondary to the car accident. I hope this answers your questions. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"hi ..my question is for my husband.he was being diagnosed 2days ago of having hypertension stage 2. he is 34..he weighs 220lbs. aside from that he has Gout for almost 5 yrs now.his last attack of gout was 2yrs ago.now that he is being monitored of his BP.. his latest bp was 140/110 he is taking AMVASC once a day for maintenance..but unfortunately his Gout surprised him right now..he usually takes colchicine during attacks.now my question is ...is it ok for him to take colchicine knowing that he is having high blood pressure?","Doctor":"hello,Colchicine will not specifically affect blood pressure and safe to have it. It also doesn't have a known interaction with amvasc.          He should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity atleast 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There shouldn't abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

It seems to be more of an electrolyte imbalance probably low potassium.
