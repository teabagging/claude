Part of the bruise is healing while the other part is still a deep red. There was no trauma to the vein prior to the bulging, but it did become very itchy during the hour or so that I dealt with this.

Varicose veins and osteoarthritis are two separate diagnoses and the literature I have read does not show any relation between those two. Bruising behind your left knee should resolve, but if its itching then you should moisturize it daily and also apply benadryl cream to prevent it from itching. Constant itching can cause ulceration which could expose you to a bigger issues.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Based on your questions it seems that you have decided not to seek any medical help till your fibular reconstruction has improved. If you do seek help right away it might be possible to reduce the Talonavicular joint with pinning and since your non weight bearing currently it won't affect your lifestyle much anyways. If you choose to wait and get TN reduced later there is a chance you might ulcerate due to intrinsic pressure on soft tissue that is being created by navicular, not only you are increasing your chance to get a fusion which might over several years cause arthritis in other joints. Locking TN joint right away will reduce motion in subtalar joint significantly. Regarding if you choose to be under TN fusion I would not recommend getting STJ fusion with it because it will limit your motion significantly. In my opinion you should under Talonavicular reduction with temporary fixation right away before you end up compromising your soft tissue.Hope I have answered your query.

Thanks, Maylene M.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. With your given history of reflex sympathetic dystrophy, it is a clinical syndrome of many unknown causes like minor traumas, infections, surgeries, with an unclear course of pain attacks, vasomotor dysfunction, strokes, characterized by pain, swelling, and vasomotor dysfunction of an extremity. So don't worry this syndrome is a bit rare, your back pain and swelling is co-related to your ankle trauma. I don't think there are another complaints. If you early diagnose the RSD you may ask your physician about a sympathetic blockade with anti inflammatory drugs as a first line of treatment. Sometimes surgical sympathectomy is needed if there is spinal injury  for your back swelling and pain. If you are unable to do your usual normal activities or reached late stages which I think and hope you are not you may use spinal stimulation ( Epidural implantation of a spinal cord stimulator which has been shown to provide significant, prolonged pain relief and functional improvement) only if needed or after at least 6 month of chronic pain.Hope I have answered your query.

Since I was about 13 I ve experienced joint pain and noticed I couldn t be as active or flexible as I was before, and in the past 3 years its gone downhill fast, now it s to the point where I constantly ache and my bones feel hot and radiate heat and pain, and my knees and ankles swell at the end of the day, I can t handle walking somewhere like at the mall or something, I get so tired so fast and hurt and then my knees start to hurt to where I can t really bear my weight, my knees lock up, I am no longer able to run long distances, its even hard for me to just chase my dog around, I can t do yoga anymore, the poses hurt my joints, in the morning its so hard for me to get out of bed, all my bones feel hot, and burn, and ache, and sore, and weak, and no matter how much I sleep it doesn t help, I can barely move in the morning, I hurt everywhere, even my muscles feel as if I had just worked out, and it hurts throughout the day, I m fatigued an hour into my day, I can barely handle being at work, I don t have a social life because it hurts too much to be up and out. In the last 5 monts or so I ve noticed my lymphnodes are swollen, I ve had nasuea every day, I ve lost alot of wright without trying, I don t have an appetite, I get sick whenever I eat, I have had diarrhea for the last 3 months straight, especially after eating, in the worst of it I can barely handle driving to work without having to relieve myself. I get headaches when I eat too. I feel slow, and weak, I get extreme headaches a few hours into my day that last anywhere from 5-24 hours and I can barely concentrate sometimes, all I can think about is all the pain. I ve started bruising really easy, especially on my legs, and now I ve noticed really tiny purple/pink bruises (at least I think they are, they don t hurt, or itch or anything) My knees, fingers, neck and back are always popping/cracking and my joints lock up alot. At night its hard to sleep, and as much as it hurts to stand/walk/sit, it doesn t really help to lay down either, I hurt all night, I m restless and my legs are restless, and my head makes my thoughts races because of the pain. My skin hurts sometimes like if my shirts touches it, or if my bf hugs me, or touches me, it feels like bruises all over even though there s nothing there. It s made it hard for us to be intimate, no position don t hurt... I ve also noticed my vision has gotten much worse and now blurry and I pee more often. Does anyone know what s wrong with me??? Also, a side question is, Since the age of 18, I started being intimate, I ve only had 2 serious relationships, one of which I am in now... Since a young age I ve never felt raging hormones, like horny? I never really have a urge for sex, when I do, its not very strong. I ve had little to no feeling down there, now my fiance and I are serious, I love him and attracted to him, but I can never get horny, or wet or anything, I can barely feel anything he does, or if we are doing things together, a fee months into our relationship, I got pregnant, and I miscarried, my body didn t pass the baby on its own and ppp have me the abortion pill, and I had an allergic reaction and went to the how, ended up passing the baby there, after that we didn t do anything for months, before when we had sex it didn t hurt, but now when he is romancing me, it hurts for him to do it, or to be deep. I still don t get excited or anything, and it just sucks for both of us. The only other thing I ve had wrong with down there is I get frequent yeast infections. Please help, I can t afford to go to the doctor but if this is something I can fix please help!! I m just scared...","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I highly recommend that you go to an ER and get this properly evaluated because what you are experiencing sounds more so inflammatory disorder and cant be diagnosed or treated without proper medical evaluation. I understand you cant afford to go to a hospital, but the hospital can work with you and even reduce your payments significantly and set you up with proper clinics and outpatient resources to help you manage your condition properly. I hope you take my advise and seek proper medical attention. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.If the cyst is oozing you need to get that cultured and evacuated completely before it gets infected and spreads into your joint.

No insurance so no real doctor for it.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Its possible that you might have fractured either your toes or metatarsals in your foot. X-rays is definitely first line of treatment but since you are uninsured, I would recommend going to ED at a local hospital where they have to provide you with minimum care, get an x-ray done to rule out any joint damage and recommend getting a cam walker which cost around 35 dollars to take pressure off our toes and metatarsals. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Samuel Parmar"},{"Patient":"Hi. I sustained a spiral oblique fracture of the 5th metatarsal on my left foot 6.5 weeks ago. Was initially in a plaster cast 1week), then given a fibreglass cast for an additional week. Since I am an active runner, I asked for and was given an air cast walker (only to be removed for showering/bathing). I had that for 2 weeks and was rhen advised to start wearing an lrthopædic hard-soled shoe - which I have done now for just over 2 weeks. My 6-week follow-up showed a very small amount of callus formed at the lower end lf the spiral fracture, with barely visible \\"bridging\\" further up the fracture. I was to,d to continue walking in the ortho shoe and to go back for further x-rays in 4weeks' time. My question is: when can I expect to see more callus formation and is it a good idea to be in an ortho shoe rather than a cast? I am 51 year-old female, have hypothyroidism and take 150mcg of Levaxin daily, and am in menopause - but not taking any oestrogen supplements. I am otherwise in very good health. But this fracture is seriously incapacitating me and it would be greta if you could advise as to how long it might take to heal enough so that I can at least start to walk normally in running shoes? Thank you, Theresa","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Bone usually take 6 to 8 weeks to heal. Considering you have little callus formation is good news but you might be putting too much weight on your foot too early. I would recommend wearing your fracture boot at least till there is good amount of callus formation on x-ray. Also depending on your initial x-rays, some spiral oblique fractures are unstable and I will usually recommend surgery if there are no other contra-indications. In your case I would discuss that possibility with your doctors.Hope I have answered your query.

There is no pain or constipation just discomfort. I have experienced this for two weeks now. I am a female and I had a tubligation in 1998. Menstrual is regular usually last about 5 days. But last month only lasted 2 days and was very light. I have no health insurance so do you have any suggestions about what might be happening to my body?","Doctor":"HelloYour tubes were ligated in 1998 i.e your age should be around 45 years . As you mentioned in the query that there is mild degree pain inn lower abdominal region . Scanty menstruation is there . So these symptoms may be due to these reasons , these includes.1 Hyper acidity or gastritis , as you mentioned that there is mild pain with bloating , so such type of pain occurs due to gastritis . So take some antacid but if pain is severe you may need drugs like pantaclo-D according to necessity .2 The nest reason of such type of discomfort may be due to hormonal imbalance due to peri-menopause . Diagnosis can be confirmed by blood examination for estrogen , progesterone level with FSH/LH ratio.3 Tension is one another such cause ,which produces such type of symptoms . So consider this point also .In my opinion at present take some antacid or pantaloc-D . But if symptoms still persists then consult  a primary care physician and get his opinion.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello sir..I have got an extra navicular bone in my right foot. 6 months ago I suffered an injury in which my ankle got twisted.. After that I took a long rest. Still whenever I play, or run, the bone stings a lot. I did MRI also. It says 'Bone contusions with oedema in navicular bone, calcaneum,talus bone,adjoining portion of talocalcaneum joint, cuboid bone and lateral cuniform bone. What would be the appropriate treatment according to you ??","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Best treatment for bone edema is complete non weight bearing to your right foot for couple of weeks and anti-inflammatory medicines. Extra navicular bone in my opinion is just another term for an accessory ossicle present which is painful and gives you similar symptoms as posterior tibial tendonitis. I would highly recommend wearing a cam boot at least if you can't afford to stay on your right foot, and at least two weeks on NSAIDs or medrol dose pak which your primary doctor can prescribe to reduce bone inflammation.Hope I have answered your query.

Its possible that you could be undergoing knee fatigue and your rest periods between activities are long enough so your body is not recovering in time. Usually during activity, blood flow to active muscles and adrenaline happens, but during rest all that goes away and since your muscles and joints never recovered it exhibits signs of fatigue.

to sleep and i woke up with the same pain,more recentally ive been put on gabapenin and pain killers which are not getting me any better as my symptoms have got worse still,i told the consultant the tablets were not working and he said you must not be on a high enough dosage,ill increase them and see you in 6 months,i felt the worst i have ever felt,he was telling me sometimes these thing cannot be found we just have to learn to cope with them,if it was him i bet he would be trying harder,at the moment i am getting pain in my right side halfway between my naval and side,pain in my left side

I had immediately after had experienced great pain, which I knew was my tail bone. I then went to the hospital due the pain and was unable to walk very well but was told at the Hospital that it was possible bruising and was given ibrophen tablets, eventually got better after a few weeks with plenty of rest and ibrophen tablets. However, Many years later in 1998. I had given birth to my son and had experiensed the same pain in the same area (coccyx ) and heard a poping sound in my lower back and felt pain afterwards. I was yet again in a lot of pain. I had found it difficult to look after my son. I had home help within my home; once a day two nurses had inserted pain killers up my bottom end due to the wicked pain I had experienced. I also had physiotherapy but can't remember how many times a week this was done at my home; Eventually this had also got better but unfortunately felt the same pain in my back and the tail bone, when I had my periods. In 2009 had gone for an examination for bowel cancer. Before I had gone to the hospital for the examination was sent some very powerful laxatives, to empty my bowels. I had then yet again experienced the same servere pain in my tailbone but this time the pain has never gone away since. I have had MRI scans but the results came back as clear but still convinced that i have injuried my tailbone and lower back.  It's difficult to keep still in the MRI scanes for a long length of time and wounded if this effected the results.","Doctor":"Hi i am Dr Ahmed Aly    thanks for using helthcaremagic site ,     It does have a few important jobs. It helps to stabilize you when you sit, and many tendons, muscles, and ligaments run through the area.I dont think that could affect the results because MRI scans are less affected by minor moves and if so the MRI radiologist or your physician  would have noticed it at once   The pain should go away in a few weeks, or sometimes months. You can try over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to relieve discomfort until your tailbone heals. These drugs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Naprosyn). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) also can relieve pain. For more severe pain, your doctor can inject a local anesthetic, nerve block, or steroid medicine into the area. Some people get a combination of anesthetic and steroid injections. You can also take an antidepressant or anti-seizure medicine by mouth to ease the pain. Be sure to discuss your treatment options with your doctor. To ease discomfort, sit on a heating pad or ice pack, or go for a massage. The way you sit also matters. Poor posture can put too much pressure on your coccyx. Sit with your back against the chair and your feet flat on the floor to take the weight off your tailbone. Lean forward when you go to sit down. You can also sit on a special donut-shaped pillow or wedge-shaped cushion to relieve pressure on that sensitive area.A physical therapist can show you exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your tailbone. These include your stomach muscles and pelvic floor. You can also try a technique called coccygeal manipulation. This is when a doctor inserts a gloved finger in your rectum and moves the tailbone back and forth to shift it back into position.Most of the time, these treatments will relieve your pain until your tailbone heals. If no treatment has worked, your doctor might recommend surgery as a last resort to remove part of or the entire coccyx. This procedure is called a coccygectomy. Surgery doesn’t always work right away. It can take time before the pain goes away. In some cases, it doesn’t work at all. Surgery can also carry risks, like infection. It’s a decision that you need to make very carefully with your doctor.Start with home pain-relief measures like NSAIDs, heat, and massage. If your tailbone still hurts, check in with your doctor, who can help you find a treatment that works for you  Hope the above information helps you,Thanks for writing into healthcaremagic.  .healthcaremagic site doctors will be ready to assist you whenever needed ."},{"Patient":"sprained my ankle a few months ago, let it heal and was beginning to work out on it again (working out hard)...one day i got out of the car and stepped on it incorrectly and re-injured it badly...rested for a couple months and am now working out on it again. it is still slightly swollen and i feel numbing in my toes sometimes...can i just take ibprofuen and ice it or will i need surgery","Doctor":"Hi No surgery is needed , ice and ibuprofen will be ok , however recurrence  is possible so to prevent that you will need to do physical therapy to strength your lateral peronial muscles to act as first line defence against sprains , also strenghen calf and dorsi flexors Good Luck"},{"Patient":"3 weeks ago I had a fall from the ground to the steps and my right rib area could not get any support and actually the whole fall was supported by the right rib area.

I am 60 yo female in good health X ray showed 3 breaks, near enough joint to consider surgery. CT scan however, showed one break into three pieces. Ortho doc said therefore surgery not necessary and it is less than 1 mm of a fracture so looks good. Seems odd that x ray would be so different than CT scan. Normal? Second question: doc said to do whatever I wanted to do - drive, etc. Any chance using my uninjured forearm that is no longer immobilized all the time, might harm the healing of the injured upper arm? Third question: Will a home TENS unit speed healing? And is it good idea to user TENS on my elbow that is stiff due to having been immobilized? Will heating pad, hot showers etc also speed healing of broken bones? Thanks!","Doctor":"First Ct scan is more reliable than  x ray  ( bone weakness in x ray can be mistaken for fracture ) using your unaffected arm can cause slight extention muscle pull in your fractured arm (it is not relavant to healing ) , tens unit is only effective in radiating pains not in stiffness treatment or healing , howeverhot water and pads can increase healing Good Luck"},{"Patient":"i m an 18 year old girl. my appendicitis surgery was on 10 february 2013 and from that time my body became so weak. like hair loss, weight loss, skin problems, weakness in my body occurd. so im very much deppressed about my body what i do for it i didn t know plz help me...","Doctor":"Appendix surgery doen not cause weight loss and weakness.

He said he couldn t even get all the meds in there, that it was so jammed up, he had to move needle around to get in. The other Dr. said he went directly into the nerve for it to hurt like that. I was still in pain, so only 1 wk. later, another injection & it didn t hurt. The nurse that called to ck. on me, was upset & said I wasn t fully numbed. This Dr. wanted me to have major back surg. It did feel better after 2nd inject. Now, I don t know which way to go. If I have surg. I want to small incisions. I hear good & bad about the stimulator & having surgery. It s tough when I have so much pain & now lately, my fingers are getting twisted & real stiff, & once in a while, looks like a lump.","Doctor":"In my opinion best remedy for sever spasm is a hot bath for 40 minalso try standing on your heels with ankle dorsi flextion , extended knees while leaning forwards for 30 secounds , this should give you immediate relief Good Luck"},{"Patient":"TI have had pid and trichomonias had an hiv test through the blood in November which was negative.

The pain is so bad I can barely go up/down stares, walk or stretch. Now this might be enough to send me to the doctor BUT I am changing doctors because mine DOESN T and WONT do ANYTHING. She will just LOOK at it and say I m fine! Anyhow I have pain on the right side of my left knee. It s around the knee cap area and a bit more to the right. Its kind of in a sort of groove. Also I have stopped stretching it just to make sure I don t injure it further. I have resting it and using my crutches too. About 2 weeks ago I was getting ready for bed and all of a sudden I could not stand on it or put pressure on it. The pain went all the way down to my ankle and all the way up to my hip. I was crying and nearly screaming because it hurt so bad. There are only 2 things i can think of that MAYBE have a correlation to the pain but I don t know because there is nothing else I could of done that would of injured it. 1. I have a benign tumor on the right side of one of my knees. BUT i cant remember which one. 2. Nearly a year ago I managed (in gymnastics) to hyper-extend, dislocate, AND sprain my knee at the same time. Doctors don t consider my dislocation a real one because my bone poped into place on its own...sort of. The pain is an incredibly sharp pain that goes through my knee. It feels like somebody shot me in the knee when ever I walk or stretch. Strange thing is when I m tumbling on the tramp it doesn t hurt AT ALL. Another thing I ve noticed is that occasionally when i am resting my knee some muscles feel like they are twitching. My knee does not hurt when its relaxed.

Since then, the swelling has gone down and the pain has mostly left. My knuckle is still tight and there is some pain if it hits anything or if i try to pop it. But that isn't what concerns me. My knuckle is still significantly larger when compared to the same knuckle on my other hand. Plus, it feel like things are moving around and crunches if you press on it with your finger.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Even though it might not be possible to arrive at a definite diagnosis without a physical examination of your boy friend, you might like to note the following points for him :1) Go for a morning walk and regular exercise within your tolerance limits.2) Take a high roughage diet and plenty of liquids.3) It is best to have home cooked food or carry the same with him if he does eat from outside.4) Try to exclude any component of the food which might be causing allergy to his GI tract causing this discomfort.Till then he could go for a proton pump inhibitor, and an anti spasmodic.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your boyfriends's problem.

Good morning. i am Dr shareef answering your query.Discomfort in the testis could be due to ignored repeated trivial trauma, which causes inflammation causing pain/discomfort in the same. Testis being an intra-abdominal organ embryo-logically, brings the nerve supply to it from above, and so the pain in the testis is frequently radiated/felt as a discomfort in the abdomen/pelvis area. If I were your doctor, after a thorough physical examination I would advise you for the following:1) Support your testes with properly fitting under garments.2) Avoid standing for prolonged period, and avoid lifting heavy weight if you do.3) Advise you for a routine blood tests like a CBC, AEC, HbsAG, HIV test and a urine routine/microscopic examination followed by a culture and sensitivity report if need be.4) Avoid indulgence in any sexual activity if you are active sexually which would prevent further trivial trauma if any to the testes, apart from precipitating any kind of infection if present.5) Prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti inflammatory drug, and a proton pump inhibitor. The antibiotic could change after the report of the culture sensitivity test of urine.If your symptoms and discomfort do not subside with the above measures, then I would not hesitate to advise you for a Doppler ultrasound of your testes and an ultrasound of the abdomen if need be. Further management would depend on a physical examination and related investigations of the situation.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Are there any natural remedies to calm the swelling? Any essential oils?","Doctor":"HelloI understand you have having trouble with swelling and pain in the 5th metatarsal joint.  You do not mention a specific diagnosis, which could indicate various conditions. Do you have swelling or pain in any other joints (could indicate lupus, gout or various types of arthritis or even an infection)? For arthritis you can take glucosamine-chondroitin which is available in both pill and liquid forms. You can also apply topically capsaicin cream or mint essential oil which will help to decrease the pain.  This type of pain is typically treated with pain medications in the category of NSAID's (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).I hope this information is helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi I'm 72 years old and, for my age, fit and healthy. I'm getting an intermittent dull pain in my right groin and right testicle. I have checked the testicle and its fine. I have suffered oedema  in my right lower leg and foot for some time and wear elasticated socks.","Doctor":"HelloI understand your concern.  Pain in the groin and testicle could indicate various conditions.  Could be a pulled muscle or a hernia in the groin with pain radiating into the testicle. Any physician can do certain physical exam tests to check the difference.It could also be a varicocele or hydrocele of the testicular sack that requires a testicular ultrasound for diagnosis. Is the leg edema new, occuring around the same time of the groin and testicular pain?  Have you had any surgery of the leg that is swollen? Leg swelling could be due to a medication, increased salt intake, an injury, or could be due to a blood clot or even cancer.  It is best you check with your physician and see if you need a leg ultrasound or and abdominal CT scan to rule out any of these conditions.Best regards"},{"Patient":"About 2 weeks ago I sprained my knee, while skiing. X Ray at the doctor's office was negative for a fracture but now I have feeling that I have damaged soft tissues. How long does the pain and clicking last? Should I go back to see the orthopedic doctor? They suggested MRI as a next step.","Doctor":"HelloI understand you had a skiing injury and the xray did not show bony fractures.  The possibility remains of a tendon or cartilage injury.  Do you have a lot of pain and swelling? Do you have any bruising and are you able to bear weight on your ankle joint?  If you have any of these symptoms you should go ahead and get the MRI to rule out other injuries.  The pain from a simple sprain can last 3 to 4 weeks, but a tendon or cartilage injury could last longer or even require surgery.I hope you feel better soon"},{"Patient":"When I am in a meeting and have to take notes or if I am in a social setting my hand starts to shake (usually the right) and I get really nervous.

Thank you!","Doctor":"HelloI understand your concern. It sounds like you have social anxiety, made worse when you are in a social setting.  Physical symptoms of social anxiety include nervousness, shaking, upset stomach and palpitations. You should have a physical exam and laboratory studies that may identify a physical cause. If no underlying cause is found such as thyroid disease or a cardiac or neurological condition, there are certain medications that are available called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  They help with the serotonin levels which have been found to be associated with anxiety.  For the shakiness,  betablockers have also been used with success.  These medications must be used under physician supervision.  It sounds like your symtptoms are interfering with your quality of life and there is treatment.I hope you get better"},{"Patient":"Hi,When I sit on chair or lie down, I feel numbness in my hands and legs.

There are multiple causes of paresthesias, including nuerological, vitamin deficiencies and even psychological.If you have seen many physicians already, I assume you had blood tests to check thyroid, B12 level, calcium level, magnesium level, iron level, as well as kidney and liver fuctions.  Some liver and kidney conditions could cause parasthesias. Also some autoimmune diseases cause similar symptoms such as lupus or polymyalgia rheumatica. Next is to get electromyelograms with nerve conducting velocities of your arms or legs.  This will help identify any problem with your nerves or muscles. Some types of neuropathies cause parastheias.  Do you have any medical conditions or are you on any medications that could cause these symptoms?The causes as you can see are varied.You can also see a pain management specialist who can help with the parasthesisas.I hope you feel better"},{"Patient":"I m suffering with very tender skin and sore muscles from mid upper arm(s) and bra line to my neck.

As the X-ray is showing constipation, the Doctor must be meaning fecoliths.Fecoliths are the hard fecal matter and thereby get stuck in the large bowel. The gases get stuck and give a back-pressure to cause distension of the intestines ( abdomen). Another effect is the large intestine produces too much mucus and pour liquid in effect to facilitate passage and in turn will appear as a IBS type of diarrhea, which you feel like.The simple and best treatment in such cases is a soap-water enema' of a conventional type.

I don t eat fast food or junk. I also take a daily multi-vitamin supplement and Aleve twice a day for my tennis elbow.

I don t recall that area feeling particularly itchy recently, or noticing a disturbance in the skin before this. It was a little itchy, which is what led me to the discovery. As soon as I scratched the area, the tiny scabs came off under my fingernails. The skin bled a little. I put hydrogen peroxide on the area and then triple antibiotic ointment.

Always wear a tennis elbow strap doing tricep exercises, otherwise pain in elbow joint. Currently no insurance.","Doctor":"Ok lets keep it simple and really specific for you.I dont like giving generic answers to my patients. so heres something to get your money's worth1) first are you relatively new to the 30min circuit or have you added seomthing in the regimen, if yes you have a   DOMS ( delayed onset muscle soreness).Postexercise muscle soreness, also known as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), is defined as the sensation of discomfort or pain in the skeletal muscles following physical activity to which an individual is not accustomed to.The incidence of DOMS is difficult to calculate, because most people who experience it do not seek medical attention, instead accepting DOMS as a temporary discomfort. Every healthy adult most likely has developed DOMS on countless occasions, with the condition occurring regardless of the person's general fitness level. 2) then your next question would be, why does this happen?its caused by accumulation of waste by- products after muscle activity, these waste products can serve as a pain chemical.small tears in the muscle after an accustomed exercise is an additional factor3) doc what do i do?well DOMS just like in your case is a self limiting disease, meaning it wont get worse. it usually resolves in a week (max) so if the pain goes away on its own, best thing to do will be to stretch before you exercise, adjust the timer to 40mins initially, or switch to a more basic exercises for your arms first then switch gradually after a week to your preferred 30mins regimen.

In 2000 I had bilateral decompressive laminectomies at L4 and L5; also lysis of adhesions and discectomies @ previous L3-4, L4-5 as well as L5-S1.. I have had ongoing problems since then but it has gotten worse.  An xray in 2007 showed some facet joint changes. A CT scan in 2011 shows some left sided L2-3 disc herniation. What was disturbing was that the scan also shows I have had a fusion at the L2-3 level; but I never have as I was told in 2000 to try to hold off for as long as possible. It also shows facet osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease at L2-3, L3-4 and L4-5 and mild degenerative disc disease and osteo at L5-S1; where the osteoarthritis was originally found in 1995. The 2011 report also shows a fracture through the L4-5 right pars interarticularis. What I would like to understand is: could prior surgeries have any impact on the formation or speeding up of the osteoarthritis? Could the perceived fusion be caused by the osteoarthritis, and could the fusion have caused more pressure on adjoining joints causing the fracture and/or the L2-3 herniation, because of issues with other joints is one of the reasons I didn't have a fusion upon advice from my neurosurgeon.

It was found I had a highly elevated white blood cell count, coupled with high inflammatory readings, VERY dark urine, and severe joint pain. The condition persisted, not always as bad every day as the last, but in my shoulders, never unnoticeable. I continue to this day with these symptoms.

I then remembered recently I had been under a trailer a week prior to noticing the marks doing plumbing work. After SOME research on spider bites, many of my symptoms resemble a brown recluse bite. My physician seems doubtful, but these are present in our area, and he cannot account for all of these persistant symptoms and is ready to send me @ 50 miles south to a contagious disease testing facility if he has no answers by this Tues.

That night, had reaction in R knee. Swelling, pain, stiffness. Monday, had 40 cc s drained in R knee with a Cortisone shot By Tues, same thing happened. By Friday, went back to doctor. Had another 40 cc s drained in R knee. By Fri. night, both knees swelled, pain, stiffness. Went to E R (Urgent Care Facility) on Sat Morning. Had 40 cc s drained in R knee AND 20 cc s drained now in L knee. Swelling, pain, and stiffness by Sat night. Tomorrow, Tues morning have ANOTHER appt with doctor again. NOT having any more of the series of the 3 shots. How long is this going to happen before I find relief and get back to my original state before the first and only shot. Also, I was SUPPOSED to get Ortho Visc, and they shot in synvisc, did not know that until the shot was completed. If I would have known that, I would have not had it done, as I had synvisc about l0 years ago, with NO relief. The doctor said the ins. co. probably did not approve the Orthovisc.","Doctor":"Hi It is rather uncommon to have knee swelling after synvisc injection to the extent you are having. The reactions generally happen if you are sensitive to the drug( as you have a past experience also). In my opinion , in your case I would rather rely on anti allergics, knee support ,exercises and anti inflammatory pain killers to help your knee swelling and pain.Repeated aspirations may not help much. In future I will prefer PRP injections to your knee, for better relief."},{"Patient":"I HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM FIBROMYALGIA FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

It hurt horribly bad immediately and the whole arch of my foot felt like it was on fire or something.  The train punctured my foot right about the middle of my arch.  I didn't know this until the next morning though due to it being so dark and me being so tired and needing to get off my foot.  By Friday afternoon, the arch of my foot was really sore and I couldn't stand to have it touched.  Over the rest of the day and throughout last night, it has been having some weird problems off and on that include random spasms (small and usually limited to the arch area), and stiffening of the foot that would come and go.The foot I injured also happens to be the same one that was already injured from a month back but is still refusing to heal.  I was on it for just a few steps when the puncture wound happened (wheel chair wouldn't reach the window and I needed to shut the curtains).  The old injury includes a developing bone spur, a fracture near the heal, and a permanent swollen lump on top in the metatarsals area for my second and third toes.  No one has been able to tell me what is wrong there though yet (even after 2 x-rays and a ct scan) and it's causing me to not be able to move my toes at all.My foot is in a lot of pain now from a combination of problems from both injuries.  I am stuck with a resident / student clinic for doctor care and they wouldn't even take my first injury serious (had to go to an immediate care in the end to get help) so I am not very hopeful that I could find help there with this new injury either.Another important detail to know about me is that I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and have history of wounds (even minor ones) taking a long time to heal.  A lot longer than average times for sure.Can you help me?  Should I be concerned about this new injury?  Could it be messing my old injury up even worse?  Any chance you have a suggestion as to what I could do?Thank-you : )","Doctor":"HiNothing to worry.Just do contrast fomentation alternate hot and cold water dipping twice a day.Wear a silicon insole in foot wear.Take lyrica75mg BD and ace -proxyvon tab 1bd and methycobalamin 1500 ki.

My Doctor did not drain nor did he seem to be trained in this area. I had to use anger to get him to listen to me.

I was on a circle bed. Twice, while being rotated 4 pressure care, my upper body was not restrained and I fell forward, crushing the bone graft. My wound drain was really stuck, unable to be removed using reasonable force. Nurses ignored my instructions to stop and notify my surgeon. My body shifted a bit with the force. I immediately felt as if I was continuously electrocuted down the (L) leg: the worst pain in my life. The leg went densely numb, lost all motor function. These neural symptoms were new. Ever since the bone graft was crushed and the problems with drain removal, I fall frequently, heavily because my (L) leg gives way. I fallen hard enough over the years to crack most teeth, blow out my knees and get knocked out. I try to protect my face but all falls end with a very painful neck. I now have signicant spurs and disc damage at the original site and similar but worse pathology in a cervical disc. Both hands and lower left leg are densely numb, I can t write, and I have quite obvious muscle wasting in my hands, markedly so on the left. I have not worked since the failed surgery in 1993, my mobility is reduced and I am almost totally housebound. Would the cervical spurs be caused by years of heavy falls when almost all falls hurt my neck? I woke up during a general anaesthetic for the spinal surgery and later developed PTSD. I m hospital phobic. Would surgery to my cervical and lumbar regions stop things getting worse? I am afraid of becoming a quadraplegic. I don t want to litigate because I found people r more focused on proving how bad things are then on getting better.","Doctor":"In my opinion you should avoid surgery and focus on low intensity physical therapy with a professional also focus on calcium and vit d supplements if this does not help you have the choice of vertebral fusion which i would put it as last possible choice Sorry for the honestyGood Luck"},{"Patient":"Hi today I was walking down the stairs then I missed four steps I landed on my left foot.

So please can I have an answer that can reduce my anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It is good that you are relieved of your pain now. If you eat from outside specially the fast and fried food, this could be a factor for your pain by the way of some kind of intestinal infection creeping in from possibly food cooked under unhygienic conditions. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive. Apart from this, if considered necessary after clinical examination, I might get an ultrasound of abdomen done to rule out any kind of intra-abdominal pathology. However, you do not have to be anxious by these information. Possibly you might not need any of these if you are completely relieved at present.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem if it persists. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

I tripped & fell on 1/25/14 & of course my hand was bruised & extremely swollen, limited ROM. I had it in a thumb spica splint for a 1 1/2 wks til I could get an apt to see a hand specialist 2/5. They put it in a cast for a month & took it off on 3/5. When they removed it my thumb was extremely stiff & painful, could barely move it. I ve been having hand therapy twice a week & my ROM has improved drastically. The only problem is that the MRI I had on 3/18 showed I had a complete tear of the radial collateral ligament. The Dr says that I m stable & surgery doesn t look needed & I can go to work in 2 wks if I feel ok (I m a RN). What do you think of his decision? They re going to make me a thermoplastic splint to wear as needed. Right now I take off the regular big thumb spica splint off about 6 times a day. I do the heated rice, picking up marbles, & ROM exercises, ice, etc. The pain is minimal 2-4 / 10 (used to be 6-7 / 10 in beginning). So, is surgery always indicated with a complete tear?

I first tried holding the pen in a different manner and that would help for a while. But pretty soon the muscle spasms would return and I was unable to write again. I came up with some pretty creative ways to hold a pen, including putting it between my index and middle fingers and holding it in a closed fist. But nothing would work for long.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound of both kidney. However pain anywhere in urinary tract system causes pain in this area. 2 Ovarian cyst or salpingitis is the another most common cause of this type of pain . Get in an ultrasound of both ovaries .3 Amoebic colitis is another cause of such pain , so please get in blood as stool examination to rule out amoebic colitis .

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would do a general physical examination of yours with special attention to the abdomen to rule out any possibility of appendicitis, which could also give rise to urinary symptoms in some of its positions.

Further management would depend on the results of clinical assessment and related investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

About two months ago I began having swelling in my feet and ankles, but mostly in my left foot/ankle. No pain, no discoloration, can walk/run just fine. It appeared to do this during the time of my menstrual cycle, and would come and go. This last month, the swelling remained. I went to my gyn who said it was bloating and gave me diuretics. It did not help. I then went to my internist who suggested thyroid issues (I do have a very tiny cyst on my thyroid that my doc has watched for the past two years) and venous insufficiency/reflux. My blood test to check thyroid was borderline normal, and I must retest next week. Also, my potassium levels are excellent, and my doctor does not suspect heart, kidney or liver problems. I had a Doppler ultrasound on both legs done last week, and the results were no venous reflux suspected/good circulation and no dvt. I am now being told to wear compression stockings to help with swelling. My only health issues are being overweight, poly cystic ovarian syndrome, large fibroids, large uterus, and severe cramping during menstruation. I take metformin prescribed by an endocrinologist to treat the pcos but I am not diabetic and my glucose levels are excellent. The swelling is in the ankles, foot and just above the ankle. The measurements of my legs (calf and thigh) are the same. The ankles measure 9 inches/right and 10 inches/left. I would like a second opinion.

It was about 4-5 inches long, came out easily with little blood. She also has an other large node in the back of her neck. There are also about 7 enlarged nodes around the one that was removed today. Any feedback?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Lymph node are part of  immune system and help the body to  fight against infection and disease. As lymphatic fluid travels through the body, immune cells in the lymph nodes trap bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful substances and destroy them to help prevent their spread.    As you have stated that your grand daughter had one lymph node removed and she has around 7-8 enlarged lymph node around the removed lymph node. I must inform you that the most common reason for enlarged lymph node is bacterial infection, viral infection as well as skin, tooth and ear infection. You haven't mentioned the position of enlarged lymph node but other causes may include cancers and immune deficiency disorders.    I am sure the removed lymph node would be sent for pathological examination and cause of enlarged lymph node would be known by the results.    Treatment would depend on the cause of enlarged lymph node and simply treating the cause would reduce the size of lymph node. At home you can apply warm, wet washcloth to the area, you can also take over the counter pain relieving drugs and i would advice rest and healthy diet to recover from illness.Hope the information provided would be helpful.

I have an appointment in 3 weeks to see a neurologist but have been waiting years to get here after seeing a lot of different doctors. 3 years ago after the birth of my daughter (c section with spinal block) I started getting a numbness and tingling throughout my legs. Its always at its worst while I am lying down and trying to sleep. It would last days sometimes weeks and then disappear. and randomly from time to time re-appear. I had a few different blood test (I was living in England at the time) and was told it was nothing and it would go away on its own and was probably a result of the spinal block. fast forward 3 years and I give birth to my second child again by C section and spinal block. Straight after surgery I lose feeling in my legs and bottom, the numbness and tingling lasted for 2+ weeks and it was my surgeon who referred me to see the neurologist for further testing. I also had blood tests done at this point which indicated I was severely b12 deficient and there were other things in my blood work that indicated this may be caused by some form of autoimmune disease as my iron levels were fairly normal. I had a low platelet count also my foliate levels were low there were are few other indicators I have a copy somewhere and will add those once I find them. For the last 3 or so weeks the numbness and tingling is back but this time I also have pain that its like a dull ache in my legs with random shooting pains throughout my legs and feet and a mild lower back pain. My bowel movements have been more frequent and a feeling of urgency of using the bathroom when I do feel the urge to go. Again this pain is worse while lying down or resting but I still feel it throughout the day and its getting worse and I see no sign of it going any-time soon. I am finding it hard to sleep. I am unable to take any strong pain medication as I am breastfeeding my son. I am taking ferograd c (sp) which has helped a little with my energy levels but I just feel tired all the time even after a good nights sleep.

I also have a numb area to the side of where I hit, and an excruciatingly painful spot/huge dent where I fell. Could I have chipped my bone or done nerve damage?","Doctor":"Hi going by your description , it looks that you have damaged soft tissues just below the knee. In my opinion such smashing of the soft tissues also causes damage to nerves and subsequent sensation of pins and needles along the compressed nerves.Chipped bone will give you lot of pain on walking.The painful spot / dent is there because of collection of blood in the  region. Do cold compression , take anti inflammatory pain killers for few days."},{"Patient":"I have had a sinus infection for 2 months with 3 rounds of antibiotics still no better ears hurt ,neck feels swollen , I have also had heartburn real bad had some blood work done everything normal but my neck and trouble swallowing is my main problem","Doctor":"Hi welcome to the health care magic Here trouble in swallowing can be from acute pharyngitis associated with sinusitis or from excess mucus leading obstruction So here consult doctor for examination and if inflammation severe enough than short term betamethasone steroid can be prescribed For congestion relief steroid or benadryl like decongestant prescribed according to severity Your sinusitis not getting better with an to boot,  so PNS  x ray and biopsy like other investigation done If needed to do further work up and to reveal fungal infection if suspected in which antibiotic not working Take care Consult otorhinolaryngologist for examination"},{"Patient":"My husband is a WWII AKA amputee. Over the years there has been deterioration of his lumbar area which he receives steroid inj. every 3 months for pain that is a 10# after standing with support of body for more than 5 min. He use to be able to stand most of the days 15 yrs ago. Now he has tremors in both his arms but not painful in arms while his back is hurting. What does this suggest what is happening in his painful lumbar to cause these tremors? Or is can his dementia (frontal lobe) cause involuntary tremors? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi I have read the details you have written. In my opinion your husbands tremors do not appear to be related to his back pain or his amputation. He might be suffering from Alzheimer's disease in which tremors and weakness in his back is also explained( causing lumbar pain on standing).I suggest a check up by neurologist."},{"Patient":"I am having a strange tingling/buzzing sensation just below my rib cage on the left side.

Same thing happened, Tues and Wed. I exercised by using 3lbs dumb bell in Wed and may have caused costochondritis according to the doc.

It wasnt hurting that bad. it was tolerable so i just took some motrin and went on with my day. After being awake for probably 5 or 6 hours, the pain started getting worse. It went from tolerable to unbearable in about 5-10 minutes. The severe pain probably lasted somewhere between 30min to an hour. I was in so much pain that i didnt even notice how long it was. I was almost crying in pain. I laid in my bed and i was doubled over in pain. I could hardly move and it hurt to breathe. It eventually went away after 30 minutes or so but it hurt so bad. It was the worst pain i had ever felt. I was so close to calling 911. The only reason that i didnt was because when i was thinking about calling 911, the pain was starting to get a little better. The severe pain lasted from 30 min to an hour and when it started to calm down it went from unbearable to tolerable again in about 5-10 minutes. I still have a slight pain right now but its nothing too bad. Im just scared that it might happen again. Anybody have any idea what that might have been. The severe pain is gone now so should i still be worried. And by the way I dont have a fever, im not throwing up, and i dont have any other symptoms. And im and 18 year old female if that helps with anything. Should i still go to the doctor because the pain im feeling now isnt really bothering me.

At first the pain was every once in a while (maybe twice a month). I would also become nuaseaed with these pains and at time vomit. Over the last four months the pains have gotten more frequent (two to three time a week) and more intense. The intensity has been to the point that it is intererring with normal daily activities.  I am also still becoming nauseaed with them and voiting from time to time. Recently I have begun to have diahrrea as well when I start having pain. When the diahrrea began I also noticed that my entire abdomine seems to be cramping severly.  I have been to both my PCP and a Gastrologist and had many different tests run on me several times. Both seem to be focusing on my gallbladder but every test that they do comes back negative. Any thoughts on what this could be and what I might needto suggest to m doctors that we start checking into.","Doctor":"HelloSevere pain in the left abdomen from last 3 years  may be due to these possibilities , these includes.1 The first possibility is of Peptic ulcer disease or Hiatus hernia. Diagnosis can be confirmed by upper G. I. endoscopy. Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with blocks. It also might help to avoid eating or drinking for 2 hours before you lie down. To control stomach acid one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy or greasy foods . Also take some antacid but in your case symptoms are ( as severe pain ) you may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors like pantaloc-D twice in day. When such patient visit I usually prescribe them to take \\"REBAMIPIDE\\" 100 mg thrice in day for 4-6 months . 2 . The 2nd possibility is of pancreatitis as it may cause upper left abdominal pain ,which is  worse when bending over or sitting. Pancreatic enzymes like serum amylase & lipase should be measured to rule out any pancreatic cause.3 The last possibility is of any kidney stones which may present such sharp pain radiating to back.
