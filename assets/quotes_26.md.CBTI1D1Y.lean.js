Now consider what changes when one more line is added to make n+1 lines.Since the added line is not parallel to the previous n lines and no three lines intersect at the same point, this line is divided into n+1 segments (line segments or rays) by the original n lines.

Evaluate the maximum distance:   - The maximum value of (sin t - cos (t - 5)) is (sqrt{2}) when (sin t = 1) and (cos (t - 5) = -1).   - Therefore, the maximum value of ((sin t - cos (t - 5))^2) is (2).7.

It seems that it is correct, and the difference comes from the fact that we have not yet considered the set {n+1}, which adds frac{1}{n+1} to the sum and thus produces H(n+1). The problem is that this subset clearly belongs to the second group, but by removing the element n+1 we get the empty set, so since the sum in H(n) is over non-empty subsets, we must not forget to add the contribution from this subset.Since both the base case and the induction step have been proven, the principle of induction ensures that H(n) is satisfied for all integers n, and thus the value obtained with this sum is n."},{"problem":"Let N = 69^{5} + 5cdot69^{4} + 10cdot69^{3} + 10cdot69^{2} + 5cdot69 + 1.

Hence, setting y = 0 gives x = dfrac{x_1y_2 + x_2y_1}{y_1 + y_2} = dfrac{(ty_1 + 1)y_2 + (ty_2 + 1)y_1}{y_1 + y_2} = dfrac{2ty_1y_2 + y_1 + y_2}{y_1 + y_2}.Substituting equations (1) and (2) into the above equation, we get x = dfrac{2t(-dfrac{9}{3t^2 + 4}) - dfrac{6t}{3t^2 + 4}}{-dfrac{6t}{3t^2 + 4}} = 4. Therefore, the line PM always passes through the fixed point (4,0).Thus, the final answers are:- The equation of the ellipse C is boxed{dfrac{x^2}{4} + dfrac{y^2}{3} = 1}.- The line PM always passes through the fixed point boxed{(4,0)}."},{"problem":"3.

For instance, a (9 times 12) rectangle can be tiled with four (3 times 3) blocks horizontally and three (3 times 3) blocks vertically:     [     begin{array}{cccccccccccc}     R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X      X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X      X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R      R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X      X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X      X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R      R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X      X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X      X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R      end{array}     ]3. Counting Red Squares in (9 times 12) Rectangle:   - Each (3 times 3) block contains exactly 3 red squares.   - A (9 times 12) rectangle contains (3 times 4 = 12) such blocks.   - Therefore, the total number of red squares in a (9 times 12) rectangle is (12 times 3 = 36).4. Adjusting for (9 times 11) Rectangle:   - A (9 times 11) rectangle is one column short of a (9 times 12) rectangle.   - Each column in the (9 times 12) rectangle contains 3 red squares (since each (3 times 3) block contributes one red square per column).   - Removing one column from the (9 times 12) rectangle removes 3 red squares.   - Therefore, the number of red squares in a (9 times 11) rectangle is (36 - 3 = 33).The final answer is (boxed{33})."},{"problem":"21.

P must be the opposite side of AB to C (or we could increase CP, whilst keeping AP and BP the same, by reflecting in AB). Similarly it must be on the same side of AC as B, and on the same side of BC as A. For any P in this region the quadrilateral APBC is convex and hence satisfies Ptolemy's inequality CP·AB ≤ AP·BC + BP·AC, with equality iff APBC is cyclic. But AB = BC = CA, so we have CP ≤ AP + BP = 5 with equality iff P lies on the arc AB of the circle ABC. Note that there is just one such point, because the locus of P such that BP=1.5 AP is a circle which cuts the arc just once. Ptolemy's inequality for 4 points A, B, C, D: AB·CD + BC·AD ≥ AC·BD with equality iff ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral (meaning A, B, C, D lie on a circle in that order). Proof Take E inside ABCD such that ∠DAE = ∠CAB and ∠ADE = ∠ACB. Then ADE and ACB are similar, so DE/CB = AD/AC and hence BC·AD = AC·DE. It also follows that AE/AB = AD/AC. But we also have ∠EAB = ∠DAC and hence AEB and ADC are also similar. So EB/AB = DC/AC, and hence AB·CD = AC·EB. Adding, we have: AB·CD + BC·AD = AC(BE + ED) ≥ AC·BD with equality iff E lies on BD, or equivalently ABCD is cyclic. This glosses over one point. It only follows that ∠EAB = ∠DAC if ABCD is convex. For the convex case, we have that ∠EAB = ∠CAB + ∠EAC and ∠DAC = ∠DAE + ∠EAC, or ∠EAB = ∠CAB - ∠EAC and ∠DAC = ∠DAE - ∠EAC. Either way ∠EAB = ∠DAC.

The domain of f(x) is {x | x neq 0} because the logarithmic function ln|x| is undefined at x=0. Additionally, we observe that f(-x) = f(x), which means f(x) is an even function. For x > 0, the term frac{1}{1+x^2} is monotonically decreasing because as x increases, 1+x^2 increases, making the fraction smaller. Similarly, -ln|x| (which simplifies to -ln x for x>0) is also monotonically decreasing because the natural logarithm function ln x increases with x. Therefore, f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty) and, by symmetry of being an even function, increasing on (-infty, 0).Given the inequality f(-ax + ln x + 1) + f(ax - ln x - 1) geqslant 2f(1) for x in [1,3], we deduce that 2f(ax - ln x - 1) geqslant 2f(1), which simplifies to f(ax - ln x - 1) geqslant f(1).

Initial Setup and Problem Understanding:   - We have 2021 coins arranged in a line.   - All coins show H except the n-th coin, which shows T.   - The operation allowed is to choose a coin showing T and flip the coins next to it (left and right).2. Objective:   - Determine all n such that Jack can make all coins show T after a finite number of operations.3.

The probability of getting exactly 5 heads in 10 tosses can be calculated using the binomial theorem, but it is not 1 (certain).

Along with the congratulations hanging lantern, we now have three units to arrange. This can be done in {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ways (since we are arranging 3 distinct items).For the two gauze lanterns (nanmu and huanghuali), they need to be placed in the spaces between these units.

Thus, there are 11 possibilities for alpha (namely, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), four possibilities for beta, and six possibilities for gamma. Since when forming divisors we can combine all possible values of the exponents alpha, beta, and gamma (including the number itself and 1), the number of all divisors is11 cdot 4 cdot 6=264Now let's find the sum of all divisors.

Substituting c = frac{a}{2} into this equation, we get:[left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 = a^2 - b^2 implies frac{1}{4}a^2 = a^2 - b^2 implies b^2 = a^2 - frac{1}{4}a^2 = frac{3}{4}a^2]Given that the point M(1,frac{3}{2}) lies on the ellipse, we substitute x = 1 and y = frac{3}{2} into the general equation of the ellipse frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 to get:[frac{1}{a^2} + frac{9}{4b^2} = 1]Using the relationship b^2 = frac{3}{4}a^2 from above, we substitute b^2 in the equation:[frac{1}{a^2} + frac{9}{4cdotfrac{3}{4}a^2} = 1 implies frac{1}{a^2} + frac{9}{3a^2} = 1 implies frac{1+3}{a^2} = 1 implies frac{4}{a^2} = 1]Solving for a^2 gives us a^2 = 4.

The total difference of 400 could have accumulated only if there were no fewer than 200 liars.Let's divide all the people sitting at the table into groups of consecutive knights and groups of consecutive liars.

Product of roots:   The product of the roots of ( P(x) ) is:   [   x_0 x_1 x_2 = frac{c}{a}   ]   The product of the roots of ( Q(x) ) is:   [   x_0 x_1 x_2 x_3 = -c   ]   Substituting ( x_3 ) from above:   [   x_0 x_1 x_2 left( -frac{b-a}{a} + b - 1 right) = -c   ]6.

After detailed algebraic manipulation, we find that:   [   abc > 28   ] Part B: Find all possible values of ( a, b, c ) if they are non-zero integers with ( b > 0 )1. Integer solutions:   Given ( b = frac{a^2}{a-1} = a + 1 + frac{1}{a-1} ), we need ( b ) to be a positive integer. This implies ( a-1 ) must divide 1, so ( a-1 = 1 ) or ( a-1 = -1 ).2.

Values of ( b ) and ( c ):   For ( a = 2 ):   [   b = frac{2^2}{2-1} = 4   ]   We need to find ( c ) such that ( abc > 28 ). Since ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 4 ):   [   2 cdot 4 cdot c > 28 implies 8c > 28 implies c > 3.5   ]   Since ( c ) is a non-zero integer, the smallest possible value is ( c = 4 ).4. Verification:   [   (a, b, c) = (2, 4, 4)   ]   Substituting these values into ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ):   [   P(x) = 2x^3 + 2x^2 - 8x + 4 = 2(x-1)(x^2 + 2x - 2)   ]   [   Q(x) = x^4 + 3x^3 - 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = (x+2)(x-1)(x^2 + 2x - 2)   ]   Both polynomials have the same roots ( x_0, x_1, x_2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ (a, b, c) = (2, 4, 4) } )"},{"problem":"3.

Given that the slope of the tangent line of f(x) = ln(1+x) - ax at x = -frac{1}{2} is 1,  we have f'(-frac{1}{2}) = 1, i.e., frac{1}{1+(-frac{1}{2})} - a = 1, thus a = 1.

Then 1+ frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{k} + frac{1}{k+1} > ln(k+1) + frac{1}{k+1},  from (Ⅰ), we know x > ln(1+x) (x > -1 and x neq 0).  Let x = frac{1}{k+1}, then frac{1}{k+1} > ln(1+ frac{1}{k+1}) = ln frac{k+2}{k+1},  thus ln(k+1) + frac{1}{k+1} > ln(k+1) + ln frac{k+2}{k+1} = ln(k+2),  thus 1+ frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{k} + frac{1}{k+1} > ln(k+2).

Let's break down the solution step by step.Step 1: Analyze condition pGiven p: |4x-1| leqslant 1, we can solve the inequality by considering the absolute value. This leads to two cases:- 4x - 1 leqslant 1 and- 4x - 1 geqslant -1.Solving these inequalities, we get 4x leqslant 2 and 4x geqslant 0, which simplifies to x leqslant frac{1}{2} and x geqslant 0. Combining these, we find the solution for p as 0 leqslant x leqslant frac{1}{2}.Step 2: Analyze condition qGiven q: x^2 - (2a+1)x + a(a+1) leqslant 0, we can factor this quadratic inequality to get (x-a)(x-(a+1)) leqslant 0. This tells us that the roots of the quadratic equation are x = a and x = a + 1. By the properties of quadratic equations, the solution to this inequality is a leqslant x leqslant a + 1.Step 3: Relating neg p and neg qGiven that neg p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for neg q, it implies that p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q. This means that the range of x satisfying p must be entirely contained within the range of x satisfying q.Step 4: Determining the range of aTo satisfy the condition that p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q, we must have:- a leqslant 0 (since x can be as low as 0 in p),- frac{1}{2} leqslant a + 1 (since x can be as high as frac{1}{2} in p).Solving these inequalities, we get a leqslant 0 and a geqslant -frac{1}{2}.

(It can be shown that the resulting figure will be a parallelogram, but this is not part of the problem statement.)With such a construction, the swimmers' paths will be equal, and their ratio will be 1.Note that nowhere in the reasoning is it used that the initial point N divides the corresponding side of the rectangle A D in a certain proportion.## Answer:the second swimmer's path cannot be shorter than the first swimmer's path; the minimum ratio of the length of the longer path to the shorter one is 1."},{"problem":"Given the curve frac {x^{2}}{a}- frac {y^{2}}{b}=1 and the line x+y-1=0 intersect at points P and Q, and overrightarrow {OP}cdot overrightarrow {OQ}=0 (O is the origin), then the value of frac {1}{a}- frac {1}{b} is ______.","solution":"Let's denote point P as (x_1, y_1) and point Q as (x_2, y_2).Since overrightarrow {OP}cdot overrightarrow {OQ}=0, it follows that the product of the slopes of OP and OQ is -1, i.e., k_{op} cdot k_{oq} = -1; hence, y_1y_2 = -x_1x_2.Combining the two equations, we get: (b-a)x^2 + 2ax - a - ab = 0.From this, we find that x_1 + x_2 = frac{2a}{a-b} and x_1x_2 = frac{a+ab}{a-b}.Subsequently, y_1y_2 = 1 - (x_1 + x_2) + x_1x_2 = -x_1x_2.This leads to 2ab = b - a.Therefore, frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{b} = frac{b-a}{ab} = 2.Thus, the answer is boxed{2}.First, we assume points P (x_1, y_1) and Q (x_2, y_2). According to the given conditions, k_{op} cdot k_{oq} = -1 implies y_1y_2 = -x_1x_2.

We need to determine all sequences ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots ) of positive integers that satisfy this equation.1. Consider the recurrence relation modulo ( n^2+1 ):   [   (n^2+1)a_{n+1} - a_n equiv n^3 + n^2 + 1 pmod{n^2+1}   ]   Since ( n^3 + n^2 + 1 equiv n pmod{n^2+1} ), we have:   [   -a_n equiv n pmod{n^2+1}   ]   This implies:   [   a_n equiv -n pmod{n^2+1}   ]   Hence, there exist integers ( b_1, b_2, ldots ) such that:   [   a_n = (n^2+1)b_n + n   ]2. Substitute ( a_n = (n^2+1)b_n + n ) into the original recurrence relation:   [   (n^2+1)a_{n+1} - a_n = n^3 + n^2 + 1   ]   Substituting ( a_n = (n^2+1)b_n + n ) and ( a_{n+1} = ((n+1)^2+1)b_{n+1} + (n+1) ), we get:   [   (n^2+1)((n+1)^2+1)b_{n+1} + (n^2+1)(n+1) - ((n^2+1)b_n + n) = n^3 + n^2 + 1   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   (n^2+1)((n^2+2n+2)b_{n+1} + n + 1) - (n^2+1)b_n - n = n^3 + n^2 + 1   ]   Expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   (n^2+2n+2)b_{n+1} = b_n   ]3. Analyze the recurrence relation ( (n^2+2n+2)b_{n+1} = b_n ):   - If one of the numbers ( b_n ) is zero, then all subsequent ( b_n ) must be zero. This yields the solution:     [     a_n = n     ]     for ( n ge 1 ).4. If none of the numbers ( b_n ) is zero:   - Multiply the first ( k ) equations ( (n^2+2n+2)b_{n+1} = b_n ) and divide by the product ( b_2 b_3 cdots b_{k-1} ):     [     (k^2+2k+2) cdot (k^2+1) cdot (k^2-2k+2) cdots 5 cdot b_{k+1} = b_1     ]   - This shows that ( b_1 ) must be divisible by every number ( (k^2+2k+2) cdot (k^2+1) cdot (k^2-2k+2) cdots 5 ) with ( k ge 1 ).

This leads to the equation:   2(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}) - 2(ab+ac+bc) = 0.4. Simplify the left side to get:   (a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}) + (a^{2}-2ac+c^{2}) + (b^{2}-2bc+c^{2}) = 0.5. Recognize that this can be rewritten as:   (a-b)^{2} + (a-c)^{2} + (b-c)^{2} = 0.6. Since a square of a real number is non-negative, and the sum of squares is zero, it implies that each square must be zero. Therefore, a=b=c.7. Substituting a=b=c into the given equation a+2b+3c=12, we find:   a + 2a + 3a = 12 implies 6a = 12 implies a = 2.8. Since a=b=c, it follows that b=2 and c=2.9.

If the function f(x) geq b holds for all x in mathbb{R}, find the maximum value of ab.","solution":"1. The derivative of the function f(x) is f'(x) = e^x - a.   - When a leq 0, we have f'(x) > 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}, and the monotonic increasing interval is (-infty, +infty).   - When a > 0, setting f'(x) = 0 yields x = ln a.     So, when x in (-infty, ln a), we have f'(x)  0 and the function f(x) is monotonically increasing. Consequently, the monotonic decreasing interval is (-infty, ln a), and the monotonic increasing interval is (ln a, +infty).2. From (1), we know that for a  0, since f(x) geq b for all x in mathbb{R}, we have b leq f_{min}(x). Since f_{min}(x) = e^{ln a} - aln a + a = 2a - aln a, it follows that b leq 2a - aln a, so ab leq 2a^2 - a^2ln a.   Define g(a) = 2a^2 - a^2ln a (where a > 0). Deriving g(a), we get g'(a) = 4a - (2aln a + a) = 3a - 2aln a.   When g'(a) = 0, we obtain ln a = frac {3}{2}, so a = e^{frac {3}{2}}. Analyzing the derivative g'(a) yields:   - For a in (0, e^{frac {3}{2}}), g'(a) > 0, indicating that g(a) is monotonically increasing.   - For a in (e^{frac {3}{2}}, +infty), g'(a) < 0, and g(a) is monotonically decreasing.   Hence, the maximum value of g(a) is g_{max}(a) = 2left(e^{frac {3}{2}}right)^2 - left(e^{frac {3}{2}}right)^2 ln e^{frac {3}{2}} = e^3 - frac {1}{2}e^3 = frac {e^3}{2}.

Constructing the Table:   Consider the binary vectors of length ( n ). There are ( 2^n ) such vectors. Each element of these vectors can be either 0 or 1. Let's denote these vectors as rows in our table.3. Verifying the Condition:   For any two different binary vectors (left[ a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n right]) and (left[ b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n right]), since they are different, there exists at least one position ( i ) where ( a_i neq b_i ).

This can be done in several ways. We will present only three of them.First method. We will divide all natural numbers into groups based on their remainders when divided by 3 and 5:| n | n^{3} | n^{3} bmod 3 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 0 | 0 | 0 || 1 | 1 | 1 || 2 | 8 | 2 || n | n^{5} | n^{5} bmod 5 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 0 | 0 | 0 || 1 | 1 | 1 || 2 | 32 | 2 || 3 | 243 | 3 || 4 | 1024 | 4 |From the table, it is clear that the statement to be proved is true.Second method. Note that n^{3}-n=(n-1) n(n+1) is the product of three consecutive integers, andn^{5}-n=(n-1) n(n+1)left(n^{2}+1right) equiv(n-1) n(n+1)left(n^{2}-4right)=(n-2)(n-1) n(n+1)(n+2) quad(bmod 5)is the product of five consecutive integers. In the first case, the expression is always divisible by 3, and in the second case, by 5, which is what we needed to prove.The third method is to say that these statements are special cases of Fermat's Little Theorem.Now let's look at the original expression modulo 3:5 n^{3}+6 n^{5}+4 a n equiv 5 n+4 a n equiv(a+2) cdot n quad(bmod 3)This expression is divisible by 3 for any integer n if and only if a+2 is divisible by 3, i.e., when a gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Similarly, 5 n^{3}+6 n^{5}+4 a n equiv(a+4) cdot n(bmod 5), i.e., a+4 is divisible by 5, so a gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.Thus, a equiv 1(bmod 3) and a equiv 1(bmod 5), i.e., a equiv 1(bmod 15).Another solution. Substitute n=1 and we get that if such an a exists, then 11+4 a must be divisible by 15, i.e., a must give a remainder of 1 when divided by 15. It remains to check that if a equiv 1 (bmod 15), then the given expression is divisible by 15 for any natural n. This can be done in many ways (see, for example, the first solution). Here we will present another one.We will prove this statement by induction on n (for n=0 the divisibility is obvious, for negative n it is proved similarly or reduced to the case of positive n by replacing n rightarrow-n). If n=1, the statement has already been verified. Suppose now that we have already proved that 5 n^{3}+6 n^{5}+4 a n is divisible by 15 and we will prove that 5(n+1)^{3}+6(n+1)^{5}+4 a(n+1) is also divisible by 15.

Claim: The only possible value of the ratio ( frac{BD}{DC} ) is ( 1 ).2. Verification for ( frac{BD}{DC} = 1 ):   - When ( BD = DC ), the point ( D ) is the midpoint of ( BC ).   - By Ceva's Theorem, if ( BD = DC ), then for any points ( P ) and ( Q ) on ( AD ), the lines ( BP ) and ( CP ) will intersect ( AC ) and ( AB ) respectively at points ( K ) and ( L ) such that ( KL parallel BC ).   - Similarly, the lines ( BQ ) and ( CQ ) will intersect ( AC ) and ( AB ) respectively at points ( E ) and ( F ) such that ( EF parallel BC ).   - Since ( KL parallel BC ) and ( EF parallel BC ), it follows that ( KL parallel EF ).3. Contradiction for ( frac{BD}{DC} neq 1 ):   - Suppose ( frac{BD}{DC} neq 1 ).   - Let ( X ) be the point on line ( BC ) such that the cross-ratio ((B, C; D, X) = -1). This means ( X ) is the harmonic conjugate of ( D ) with respect to ( B ) and ( C ).   - By the properties of harmonic division and Ceva/Menelaus Duality, ( X ) is the point where ( KL ) and ( EF ) intersect ( BC ).   - Since ( KL ) and ( EF ) intersect at ( X ), they cannot be parallel. This contradicts the given condition that ( KL parallel EF ).4.

Let I, respectively Omega, be the incentre, respectively circumcircle, of the triangle A B C. Let the B-mixtilinear circle omega_{B} touch the sides B C and B A at X and M, respectively, and let the C-mixtilinear circle omega_{C} touch the sides C B and C A at Y and N, respectively. Let D, E, and F be respectively the midpoints of the arcs B C, A C, and A B of Omega not containing other vertices of the triangle A B C.

Each of the triples (P, M, F),(Q, N, E),(P, X, D), and (Q, Y, D) consists of three collinear points.Proof. The homothety centred at P and mapping omega_{B} into Omega maps the point M to a point on the arc A B of Omega which belongs to the tangent parallel to A B, i.e., M maps to F. Thus the points P, M, and F are collinear. The proof for the other triples is similar.Lemma 2. The points M, I, X (respectively, N, I, Y ) are collinear, and M X (respectively, N Y ) is perpendicular to the angle bisectrix BI (respectively, C I ).Proof. By Lemma 1, we have M=A B cap F P, X=B C cap P D, and obviously I=C F cap D A. Application of Pascal's theorem to the hexagon A B C F P D shows that the three points are collinear.

The inversion with respect to this circle preserves B, I, and C, and it swaps Omega and B C; so by Lemma 1 it maps P, I, and Q to X, I, and Y, respectively. Therefore, I lies on P Q if and only if I X D Y is cyclic.Due to Lemma 2, the corresponding sides of the triangles I X Y and J B C are parallel, so there exists a homothety (centred at L ) mapping one to the other. This homothety maps D to somepoint D^{prime}, and the quadrangle I X D Y is cyclic if and only if the quadrangle J B D^{prime} C is cyclic, i.e. if and only if D^{prime}=I, or L I^{2}=L D cdot L J. Since D is the midpoint of I J, this is equivalent to L J=2 L I, which is the case if and only if r_{a}=2 r (standard notation).

We start with the given condition that ( a! + (a+2)! ) divides ( (a+4)! ) for some nonnegative integer ( a ). We need to find all possible values of ( a ).2.

Factor out ( a! ) from the denominator:   [   frac{(a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1)a!}{a!(1 + (a+2)(a+1))} = frac{(a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1)}{1 + (a+2)(a+1)}   ]5. Let ( k ) be an integer such that:   [   frac{(a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1)}{1 + (a+2)(a+1)} = k   ]   This implies:   [   (a+4)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1) = k(1 + (a+2)(a+1))   ]6. Clearly, ( (a+1)(a+2) ) must divide ( k ). Let ( k = (a+1)(a+2)j ) for some integer ( j ). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   (a+3)(a+4) = j(1 + (a+1)(a+2))   ]7.

How many cards of each kind were there?","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Definitions:   - We have 12 cards in total, divided into two sets: ( text{Set}_1 ) (cards 1-6) and ( text{Set}_2 ) (cards 7-12).   - Let ( b_i ) and ( w_i ) be the number of cards with the black side up and white side up initially in ( text{Set}_i ), respectively.   - The cards can be of three types: Black-White (BW), Black-Black (BB), and White-White (WW).2. Initial Condition:   - Initially, 9 out of 12 cards have the black side up. Therefore, ( b_1 + b_2 = 9 ).3. First Turn (Cards 1-6):   - After turning cards 1-6, the number of black sides up decreases from 9 to 4. This means 5 cards that were black side up in ( text{Set}_1 ) are now white side up.   - Therefore, ( b_1 geq 5 ).4. Case Analysis for ( b_1 ):   - Case 1: ( b_1 = 5 )     - ( text{Set}_1 ) must have 5 BW cards and 1 WW card.     - ( b_2 = 9 - b_1 = 4 ), so ( text{Set}_2 ) must have 4 black side up cards and 2 white side up cards.   - Case 2: ( b_1 = 6 )     - ( text{Set}_1 ) must have 6 BB cards.     - ( b_2 = 9 - b_1 = 3 ), so ( text{Set}_2 ) must have 3 black side up cards and 3 white side up cards.5. Second Turn (Cards 4-9):   - Turning cards 4-9 results in 6 cards having the black side up.   - This implies that the net effect of turning cards 4-9 is to increase the number of black sides up by 2.6. Third Turn (Cards 1-3 and 10-12):   - After turning cards 1-3 and 10-12, 5 cards have the black side up.   - This implies that the net effect of turning these cards is to decrease the number of black sides up by 1.7. Analysis of ( text{Set}_2 ):   - Turning cards 7-12 (which is essentially ( text{Set}_2 )) reduced the total number of black sides up by 4 (from 9 to 5).   - Therefore, ( b_2 leq 4 ).8. Combining Conditions:   - From the initial condition, ( b_1 + b_2 = 9 ).   - From the first turn, ( b_1 geq 5 ).   - From the analysis of ( text{Set}_2 ), ( b_2 leq 4 ).9. Conclusion:   - From ( b_1 geq 5 ) and ( b_2 leq 4 ), we get ( b_1 = 5 ) and ( b_2 = 4 ).   - Therefore, ( text{Set}_1 ) has 5 BW cards and 1 WW card.   - ( text{Set}_2 ) has 4 BW cards and 2 WW cards.10.

Since D is on the circle, angle ACD + angle DCB = 160^circ + 100^circ = 260^circ. This means that the arc AD subtends an angle of 160^circ at the center C.4. Let AC intersect the circle again at F. Then, angle ACF = 180^circ because F is the diametrically opposite point of A on the circle.5. We need to find angle BEA. Using the fact that angle BEA is the angle between the chords AB and DF, we can use the formula for the angle between two chords:   [   angle BEA = frac{widehat{AB} - widehat{DF}}{2}   ]   Here, widehat{AB} = 60^circ and widehat{DF} = 180^circ - 160^circ = 20^circ.6. Substituting these values, we get:   [   angle BEA = frac{60^circ - 20^circ}{2} = frac{40^circ}{2} = 20^circ   ]7. Now, consider angle DCF. Since angle ACD = 160^circ, we have:   [   angle DCF = 180^circ - 160^circ = 20^circ   ]8. Since angle BEA = 20^circ and angle DCF = 20^circ, we observe that triangle DEC is isosceles with DE = DC.9. Given that DC is a radius of the circle, we have DC = 20.10. Therefore, DE = 20.The final answer is boxed{20}."},{"problem":"In a traffic study, a survey of 50 moving cars is done and it is found that 20 % of these contain more than one person.

Consider the set of all points on this sphere for which the sum of the spherical distances from these points to P, Q, R, S is not less than 6 pi. What is the area of this set? The spherical distance between two points on a sphere is the length of the shortest arc of a great circle connecting these points.","solution":"Answer: 18 pi, i.e., half the area of a sphere with radius 3.Solution. Since angle Q R S+angle Q S R=angle P R S+angle P S R=90^{circ}, triangles Q R S and P R S are right triangles with a common hypotenuse R S. If O is the midpoint of segment R S, then by the property of the median of a right triangle, O P=O Q=O R=O S=3. Therefore, the radius of the circumscribed sphere is 3, and point O is its center.Let d(X, Y) denote the spherical distance between points X and Y.

The axis of symmetry has the equation x = -frac{p}{2}.For a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, if a > 0, the function is monotonically increasing to the right of the axis of symmetry and monotonically decreasing to the left of it.

Note that|A B|=sqrt{12^{2}+9^{2}}=15Therefore, according to the triangle inequality, the locus of such points M(x, y) is the segment A B.The second equation is the equation of a circle with center at point S(2 a, 4 a) and radius frac{1}{2}.A unique solution to the system is possible if and only if the circle intersects the segment A B at exactly one point.Obviously, a guaranteed unique point of intersection will occur in the case of the circle being tangent to the segment. This will happen when the distance from the point S(2 a, 4 a) to the line containing the segment A B is equal to the radius of the circle, and the point of tangency will fall on the segment A B. The equation of the line containing A B, as it is not difficult to establish, is 3 x+4 y-70=0. According to the formula for the distance from a point to a line (one of the solution options):frac{|3 cdot 2 a+4 cdot 4 a-70|}{sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}}=frac{1}{2}From this, we will obtain two possible values of the parameter a:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_6714d21cf0c92eec56b3g-2.jpg?height=888&width=850&top_left_y=1635&top_left_x=543)The center of the circle lies on the line y=2 x. The point Mleft(frac{70}{11}, frac{140}{11}right) of intersection of the lines y=2 x and 3 x+4 y-70=0 lies on the segment A B. The angle angle OMB is acute, so the point of tangency of the line 3 x+4 y-70=0 and the circle, whose center lies below the segment A B, will definitely fall on the segment A B. This occurs when a=frac{135}{44}. If the center S of the circle lies above the segment A B (this happens when a=frac{145}{44}), then additional reasoning is required. The point of tangency is the projection of the point Sleft(frac{145}{22}, frac{145}{11}right) onto the line containing the segment A B. H will fall on the segment A M if M H leq A M. We have:M H=sqrt{S M^{2}-S H^{2}}=sqrt{left(frac{145}{22}-frac{70}{11}right)^{2}+left(frac{145}{11}-frac{140}{11}right)^{2}-frac{1}{4}}=frac{1}{11}A M=sqrt{left(frac{70}{11}-6right)^{2}+left(frac{140}{11}-13right)^{2}}=frac{5}{11} .![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_6714d21cf0c92eec56b3g-3.jpg?height=618&width=1670&top_left_y=734&top_left_x=158)Therefore, M H<A M, and the point of tangency H lies on the segment A B.At the same time, since A M<frac{1}{2}, a unique solution is possible when the circle intersects the segment A B, but the point A falls inside the circle. This will happen from the moment the circle intersects the segment at point A until the moment of re-intersection at the same point A (excluding these moments).Let's find such positions of the point S(2 a, 4 a) for which the distance from it to the point A is frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, the mileage fee is 2.80 times 6.- Time Fee: The trip does not fall within the special time periods for increased time fees, so the normal rate of 0.38 yuan per minute applies. Thus, the time fee is 0.38 times 10.Calculating the total fare:text{Total Fare} = 2.80 times 6 + 0.38 times 10 = 16.8 + 3.8 = 20.6Therefore, Xiao Liu should pay a fare of boxed{20.6 text{ yuan}}.

Therefore, the mileage fee is 2.75x.- Time Fee: The trip also falls within the 16:00-18:30 time period for the time fee, which is 0.47 yuan per minute. The travel time in minutes is frac{x}{30} times 60 (since speed = distance/time, and here we solve for time given the speed and distance).Calculating the total fare:text{Total Fare} = 2.75x + left(frac{x}{30} times 60right) times 0.47 = 2.75x + 0.94x = 3.69xTherefore, Xiao Liu should pay a fare of boxed{3.69x text{ yuan}}.# Part ②:When x=8, substituting x with 8 in the expression for the total fare:text{Total Fare} = 3.69 times 8 = 29.52Therefore, when x=8, Xiao Liu should pay a fare of boxed{29.52 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"Sindarov V.A.Find all such natural k that the product of the first k prime numbers, decreased by 1, is a perfect power of a natural number (greater than the first power).#","solution":"Let n geq 2, and 2=p_{1}1; then k>1.

Case when (p = q = 3):   - If (p = q = 3), then the congruences become:     [ 3^{n+2} equiv 3^{n+2} pmod{3^n} ]     [ 3^{n+2} equiv 3^{n+2} pmod{3^n} ]   - These are trivially true for any positive integer (n).   - Therefore, ((3, 3, n)) is a solution for any positive integer (n).2. Case when (p, q, 3) are pairwise distinct:   - Assume (p > q) without loss of generality.   - From the given congruences, we have:     [ p^n mid q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} ]     [ q^n mid p^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} ]   - This implies:     [ p^n q^n mid p^{n+2} + q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} ]   - Since (p) and (q) are primes, we have:     [ p^n q^n leq p^{n+2} + q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} < 2p^{n+2} ]   - Therefore:     [ q^n < 2p^2 ]     [ p^2 > q^{n-1} ]   - Additionally, from (q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} geq p^n), we get:     [ q^{n+2} > p^n > q^{n(n-1)/2} ]   - Thus:     [ n+2 > frac{n(n-1)}{2} ]   - Solving this inequality, we find:     [ n leq 3 ]3. Subcase (n = 2):   - For (n = 2), the congruences become:     [ p^2 mid q^4 - 81 = (q^2 + 9)(q + 3)(q - 3) ]   - Since (p > q), (p nmid q - 3). If (p mid q + 3), then (q + 3 < 2p), so (p = q + 3), which is impossible.   - Therefore, (p^2 mid q^2 + 9). Since (q^2 + 9 < 2p^2), we have:     [ q^2 + 9 = p^2 ]     [ (p + q)(p - q) = 9 ]   - Solving this, we get (p + q = 9) and (p - q = 1), leading to (p = 5) and (q = 4), which is a contradiction since 4 is not a prime.4. Subcase (n = 3):   - For (n = 3), the congruences become:     [ p^3 mid q^5 - 243 ]     [ q^3 mid p^5 - 243 ]     [ p^3 q^3 mid p^5 + q^5 - 243 ]   - If (p = 5), then (q^3 mid 5^5 - 3^5 = 2 cdot 11 cdot 131), which is impossible.   - Therefore, (p neq 5) and similarly (q neq 5).5. Further analysis:   - Assume (q mid p - 3). Note that (p^3 leq q^5 - 243 < q^6), so (p < q^2). Thus, (p - 3) is not divisible by (q^2).   - We have (q^3 mid p^5 - 243), so:     [ q mid p^4 + 3p^3 + 9p^2 + 27p + 81 ]     [ 0 equiv p^4 + 3p^3 + 9p^2 + 27p + 81 equiv 5 cdot 3^4 pmod{q} ]   - Thus, (q = 3) or (5), which is impossible.6.

Similarly, let overline{BA} represent the two-digit number formed by the digits B and A. Thus, overline{BA} = 10B + A.3. The product of these two numbers is given by:   [   k = (10A + B)(10B + A)   ]4. Expanding the product, we get:   [   k = 10A cdot 10B + 10A cdot A + B cdot 10B + B cdot A   ]   [   k = 100AB + 10A^2 + 10B^2 + AB   ]   [   k = 101AB + 10A^2 + 10B^2   ]5. We are given that k + 1 is a multiple of 101. Therefore:   [   k + 1 = 101AB + 10A^2 + 10B^2 + 1   ]   must be divisible by 101.6. Since 101AB is already divisible by 101, we need:   [   10A^2 + 10B^2 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{101}   ]7. Simplifying, we get:   [   10A^2 + 10B^2 equiv -1 pmod{101}   ]   [   10(A^2 + B^2) equiv -1 pmod{101}   ]8. Dividing both sides by 10, we get:   [   A^2 + B^2 equiv -frac{1}{10} pmod{101}   ]   Since 10^{-1} equiv 91 pmod{101} (because 10 cdot 91 equiv 1 pmod{101}), we have:   [   A^2 + B^2 equiv -91 pmod{101}   ]   [   A^2 + B^2 equiv 10 pmod{101}   ]9. We need to find digits A and B (between 0 and 9) such that:   [   A^2 + B^2 = 10   ]10. Checking possible values, we find:    - A = 1 and B = 3 (since 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10)    - A = 3 and B = 1 (since 3^2 + 1^2 = 9 + 1 = 10)11. Therefore, the possible values for A and B are (1, 3) and (3, 1).12. Calculating k for these values:    - For A = 1 and B = 3:      [      k = (10 cdot 1 + 3)(10 cdot 3 + 1) = 13 cdot 31 = 403      ]    - For A = 3 and B = 1:      [      k = (10 cdot 3 + 1)(10 cdot 1 + 3) = 31 cdot 13 = 403      ]Thus, in both cases, we get the same value for k.The final answer is boxed{403}"},{"problem":"3.

For x geq 0, the derivative f'(x) of the function segment -x + 3a is f'(x) = -1. Since the derivative is negative, this segment is decreasing.2. For x < 0, the derivative f'(x) of the function segment x^2 - ax + 1 is f'(x) = 2x - a. To ensure the function is decreasing on (-infty, +infty), we need:- For x < 0, 2x - a < 0.

If no promotion event is held, the annual sales volume will only be 1 ten thousand units. It is known that the fixed input for producing the product is 80,000 yuan, and producing every ten thousand units of the product requires an input of 160,000 yuan. The manufacturer sets the price of each unit to be 1.5 times the average annual per-unit cost of the product (the product cost includes fixed input and additional input, but not the promotion expense).1. Express the annual profit y (in ten thousand yuan) as a function of the annual promotion expense m (in ten thousand yuan).2. At what annual promotion expense m will the manufacturer's annual profit be maximized? What is the maximum annual profit in ten thousand yuan?","solution":"1. From the problem statement, we know that when m=0, x=1, which implies that k=2 since 1=3-k. Hence, we have x = 3 - frac{2}{m+1}. The sales price per unit is 1.5 × frac {8+16x}{x} (in ten thousand yuan).Therefore, the profit function y can be expressed as:y = x left[1.5 times frac{8+16x}{x} right] - (8 + 16x + m)Substituting for x, we have:y = x left[1.5 times frac{8+16(3 - frac{2}{m+1})}{3 - frac{2}{m+1}} right] - left(8 + 16(3 - frac{2}{m+1}) + mright)After further simplification:y = 12 - 4frac{2}{m+1} - my = 4 + 24 - 8frac{2}{m+1} - my = 28 - left(frac{16}{m+1} + m right)Finally, we further simplify and find the profit function:y = 28 - frac{16}{m+1} - m + 1y = 29 - frac{16}{m+1} - m, quad text{for } m ge 0.2. To find the maximum profit, we need to consider the expression:-frac{16}{m+1} + (m+1)For the given function, the sum of a positive quantity and its reciprocal is always greater than or equal to twice the square root of the product (by AM-GM inequality), hence:frac{16}{m+1} + (m+1) ge 2sqrt{16} = 8,with equality holding when:frac{16}{m+1} = m + 1.Solving for m gives us m=3 (in ten thousand yuan).

If only 10 numbers are known, then either each column contains exactly one known number, or there is a column where both numbers are unknown. In the former case, any number x can be taken as the difference between the two numbers in each column, and the other number in each column can be calculated based on the known number; in the latter case, adding any x to both unknown numbers in the column still satisfies the requirement.

Let's check the smallest odd ( n ), which is ( n = 1 ):   [   text{For } n = 1, text{ the sequence is } {1}, text{ and the average is } 1, text{ which is an integer.}   ]   Thus, ( n = 1 ) is a solution.4. Now, consider ( n geq 3 ). We need to check if the sequence can be reordered such that the average of the first ( k ) terms is an integer for all ( 1 leq k leq n ).5. For ( k = n-1 ):   [   frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1}}{n-1} = frac{frac{n(n+1)}{2} - a_n}{n-1}   ]   Let ( frac{n(n+1)/2 - a_n}{n-1} = m ) for some integer ( m ). This implies:   [   n(n+1) - 2a_n = 2m(n-1)   ]   Since ( n ) is odd, let ( n = 2l + 1 ) for some integer ( l ). Then:   [   (2l+1)(2l+2) - 2a_n = 2m(2l)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2l^2 + 3l + 1 - a_n = ml   ]   This implies:   [   a_n equiv 1 pmod{l}   ]   Therefore, ( a_n in {1, frac{n+1}{2}, n} ).6. Check the possible values of ( a_n ):   - If ( a_n = 1 ):     [     2l^2 + 3l = 2ml implies 2l + 3 = 2m implies m = l + frac{3}{2}     ]     This is a contradiction since ( m ) must be an integer.   - If ( a_n = n = 2l + 1 ):     [     2l^2 + 3l + 1 - (2l + 1) = 2ml implies 2l^2 + l = 2ml implies l = m     ]     This is a contradiction since ( l ) must be an integer.   - Therefore, ( a_n = frac{n+1}{2} ).7. For ( n geq 5 ):   [   frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-2}}{n-2} = frac{frac{n(n+1)}{2} - a_n - a_{n-1}}{n-2}   ]   Substituting ( a_n = frac{n+1}{2} ):   [   frac{frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n+1}{2} - a_{n-1}}{n-2} = frac{frac{(n+1)(n-1)}{2} - a_{n-1}}{n-2}   ]   This implies:   [   frac{(n+1)(n-1)}{2} equiv a_{n-1} pmod{n-2}   ]   Since ( n geq 5 ), ( frac{n+1}{2} leq n-2 ) and ( frac{n+1}{2} + (n-2) > n ), forcing ( a_{n-1} = frac{n+1}{2} = a_n ), which is a contradiction.8.

There are three possible options for the number of points per question: 2,3,4,6 or 2,3,5,6 or 2,4,5,6. The second option is not possible, because the student who answered the questions worth 2 and 3 points correctly would have the same score as the student who only answered the question worth 5 points correctly.

We must now prove that no such set has sum greater than 61. Suppose such a set S existed. Then S must have more than 4 elements, otherwise its sum would be at most 15+14+13+12=54.  S can't have more than 5 elements. To see why, note that at least dbinom{6}{0} + dbinom{6}{1} + dbinom{6}{2} + dbinom{6}{3} + dbinom{6}{4}=57 of its subsets have at most four elements (the number of subsets with no elements plus the number of subsets with one element and so on), and each of them have sum at most 54. By the Pigeonhole Principle, two of these subsets would have the same sum. If those subsets were disjoint, we would directly arrive at a contradiction; if not, we could remove the common elements to get two disjoint subsets.Thus, S would have to have 5 elements. S contains both 15 and 14 (otherwise its sum is at most 10+11+12+13+15=61). It follows that S cannot contain both a and a-1 for any aleq 13, or the subsets {a,14} and {a-1,15} would have the same sum. So now S must contain 13 (otherwise its sum is at most 15+14+12+10+8=59), and S cannot contain 12, or the subsets {12,15} and {13,14} would have the same sum.Now the only way S could have sum at least 62=15+14+13+11+9 would be if S={ 15,14,13,11,9}.

After expanding and simplifying, we get:   [   (a-1)^2(9a^4 - 84a^3 + 310a^2 - 580a + 601) geq 0   ]9. This inequality holds because:   [   9a^4 - 84a^3 + 310a^2 - 580a + 601 = (3a^2 - 14a + 6)^2 + 78a^2 - 412a + 565 > 0   ]10.

Similarly, P C=2 sqrt{3}.Since operatorname{arc} A C: operatorname{arc} C B=2: 1, it follows that angle A O C : angle C O B=2: 1.

Hence B C=2.We now turn our attention to the triangle A C B. In this triangle angle A C B=90^{circ} because it is the angle in a semicircle, A B=4 and B C=2.

We take r_{0}=frac{q-1}{n} b_{n-1}, then the n-th term coefficient and (n-1)-th term coefficient of fleft(q x+r_{0}right) are equal to those of q^{n} f(x). (12 points) Therefore, we can know that q^{n} f(x)-fleft(q x+r_{0}-1right) and fleft(q x+r_{0}+1right)-q^{n} f(x) are both (n-1)-th degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients. So when x is sufficiently large, there is fleft(q x+r_{0}-1right)1, hence operatorname{Im}(alpha)=0. Therefore, all roots of f(x) are real.

This means that no pair can consist of two even numbers.1. Identify the even and odd numbers:   The set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} contains four even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8} and four odd numbers {3, 5, 7, 9}.2. Pair each even number with an odd number:   Since we cannot pair two even numbers together, each even number must be paired with an odd number. We need to count the number of ways to pair the four even numbers with the four odd numbers.3. Calculate the number of bijections:   The number of ways to pair four even numbers with four odd numbers is the number of bijections (one-to-one correspondences) between the two sets. This is given by the number of permutations of the four odd numbers, which is 4! (4 factorial).   [   4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24   ]4. Consider the special case where 4 and 8 are paired together:   We can also pair 4 and 8 together, while pairing 2 and 6 with odd numbers. We need to count the number of ways to pair 2 and 6 with two elements of the set {3, 5, 7, 9}.   - First, choose 2 odd numbers out of 4 to pair with 2 and 6. The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers out of 4 is given by the binomial coefficient binom{4}{2}.     [     binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6     ]   - Next, pair the chosen odd numbers with 2 and 6. There are 2! ways to pair 2 and 6 with the chosen odd numbers.     [     2! = 2 times 1 = 2     ]   - Therefore, the total number of ways to pair 2 and 6 with two odd numbers is:     [     6 times 2 = 12     ]5. Combine the results:   We have 24 ways to pair each even number with an odd number, and 12 ways to pair 4 and 8 together while pairing 2 and 6 with odd numbers.

REGIONS IN A CIRCLEPlace n points on a circle and connect them pairwise with chords. Assume that no three chords have a common point inside the circle. Into how many regions will the circle be divided by these chords?","solution":"Solution. Suppose we draw the chords one by one sequentially. A new chord divides different regions, increasing the number of parts (Fig. 2). The additional number of regions is equal to the number of segments into which the new chord is divided by the chords it intersects. Therefore, this number is one more than the number of such intersection points. From this observation, it is easy to prove the remarkable formula expressing the number of regions in a circle resulting from drawing L chords, no three of which intersect at internal points of the circle and have P intersection points within this circle. The number of regions isP+L+1For L=1 we have P+L+1=0+1+1=2 (Fig. 3). A new line intersecting the first givesP+L+1=1+2+1=4and a line not intersecting the first givesP+L+1=0+2+1=3Suppose the value P+L+1 is valid for some L geqslant 2. Let an additional line give k new intersection points. By intersecting k other lines, it passes through k+1 regions, increasing their number by k+1. Thus, for L+1 lines and P+k intersection points, the total number of regions is(P+L+1)+(k+1)=(P+k)+(L+1)+1This is the proof of the formula by induction.It is clear that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the intersection points X and quadruples ( A, B, C, D ) of n points taken on the circumference (Fig. 4).

A set S of points is called convex if for every pair of points A and B in S, the segment A B is entirely contained in S.)The number expressing the number of regions can be beautifully derived by tracing the number of regions that decrease in our partition if we erase lines one by one. Each segment of a line separates two regions, which merge into one when this line is erased. The number of disappeared regions will be one more than the number of intersection points on this line. Since each intersection point lies on two lines, when one of them is erased, it also disappears from the other. Therefore, each intersection point appears exactly once during the process of erasing segments, and for each line, the number of disappeared regions is(number of disappeared intersection points on the line) +1. After erasing all L lines, we see that the total number of regions is P plus one for each of the L lines. Therefore, P+L regions will disappear.

Therefore, we have:yleft(y^{2}-8right)+y^{2}-8=4or equivalently y^{3}+y^{2}-8 y-12=0. We notice that y=3 is a solution. By performing the Euclidean division of y^{3}+y^{2}-8 y+12 by y-3, we find:y^{3}+y^{2}-8 y-12=(y-3)left(y^{2}+4 y+4right)=(y-3)(y+2)^{2}We deduce that y=z=3 or y=z=-2.

To analyze its behavior, we differentiate it with respect to x to get f'(x) = e^{x} - 1. - For f'(x) > 0, we solve e^{x} - 1 > 0 which gives x > 0. This means f(x) is monotonically increasing for x > 0.- For f'(x)  0, and considering the continuous nature of f(x), it reaches its minimum at x = 0. Therefore, we have f(x) geqslant f(0) = e^{0} - 0 = 1. Thus, we have proved that f(x) geqslant 1 always holds when m = 0.Proof of (2): To discuss the monotonicity of f(x), we differentiate f(x) to get f'(x) = e^{x} - me^{-x} + (m-1). This can be rewritten as f'(x) = frac{(e^{x}-1)(e^{x}+m)}{e^{x}}, given m leqslant 0.- Setting f'(x) = 0 gives us the critical points x = 0 or x = ln(-m).     - When m = 0, we have f'(x) = e^{x} - 1, which implies monotonicity as discussed in part (1).    - For m in (-1, 0), ln(-m)  0. Here, f(x) is monotonically increasing for x in (-infty, 0) cup (ln(-m), +infty) and decreasing for x in (0, ln(-m)).Proof of (3): For -e leqslant m leqslant -1, we have 1 leqslant -m leqslant e, which implies 0 leqslant ln(-m) leqslant 1. From the monotonicity discussed in part (2), f(x) is decreasing in (0, ln(-m)) and increasing in (ln(-m), +infty). Thus, the minimum value of f(x) in (0, +infty) occurs at x = ln(-m), leading to f(x) geqslant f(ln(-m)) = e^{ln(-m)} + m e^{-ln(-m)} + (m-1)ln(-m).

For example, golfballs can be stacked into a pyramid with 3 levels, as shown in Figure 2. The four triangular faces of the pyramid in Figure 2 include a total of exactly 13 different golfballs.

Solution 1Suppose that the pyramid has n layersAt each layer, the golfballs that form part of the triangular faces of the pyramid are the golfballs that are part of the perimeter of the layer.At each layer, the golfballs that are not part of the perimeter are not part of the triangular faces.The top layer is 1 times 1 and this 1 golfball is a part of the triangular faces.The next layer is 2 times 2 and all 4 of these golfballs form part of the triangular faces.The next layer is 3 times 3. There is 1 golfball in the middle of this layer that is not part of the triangular faces.The next layer is 4 times 4.

There is 1 golfball in the top row, 2 golfballs in the next row, and so on, with n golfballs in the bottom row.Thus, each of the four triangular faces includes 1+2+3+cdots+n=frac{1}{2} n(n+1) golfballs.The very top golfball is included in each of the four faces.Each of the other golfballs along the edges of each triangular face is included in two faces. There are n-1 golfballs in each such edge.To determine the total number of golfballs included in the four triangular faces in terms of n, we- begin with 4 times the number of golfballs in one face,- subtract 3, to account for the fact that the very top golfball is included 4 times, thus is counted 3 extra times, and- subtract 4 times(n-1), to account for the fact that each golfball below the top along each of the 4 edges is included twice in the total instead of once.Thus, the total number of golfballs included in the four triangular faces is4left(frac{1}{2} n(n+1)right)-3-4(n-1)=2 n(n+1)-3-4 n+4=2 n^{2}+2 n-3-4 n+4=2 n^{2}-2 n+1For the total number of golfballs included in the four triangular faces to be 145, we havebegin{aligned}2 n^{2}-2 n+1 & =145 2 n^{2}-2 n-144 & =0 n^{2}-n-72 & =0 (n-9)(n+8) & =0end{aligned}Therefore, n=9 or n=-8.Since n>0, then n=9, so there are 9 layers.Solution 3We count the number of golfballs, by level, that are included in the four triangular faces. The top level consists of 1 times 1=1 golfball. This golfball is included in the triangular faces. The next level consists of 2 times 2=4 golfballs. All 4 golfballs are included in the triangular faces. The next level consists of 3 times 3=9 golfballs. Only the middle golfball of this level is not included in the triangular faces, so 8 golfballs are included in the triangular faces.In general, for a level that is k times k with k>2, how many of the golfballs are included in the triangular faces?The golfballs on the perimeter of this square are included in the triangular faces. How many such balls are there?We start by counting each of the balls on two opposite edges. This gives k+k=2 k golfballs. On the two remaining edges, the balls at each end are already included, leaving k-2 golfballs on each of these edges to be counted.In total, this gives k+k+(k-2)+(k-2)=4 k-4 golfballs from this level that are included in the four triangular faces.We make a table of the level number, the number of golfballs included in the four triangular faces at this level, and the running total of such golfballs.

After selecting the first group, we are left with 3 groups (the one just formed and the other two interest groups) that need to be assigned to the 3 interest topics. This assignment can be done in A_{3}^{3} ways since each group will be assigned a unique topic.3. Therefore, by combining these steps, the total number of ways to assign the students is given by the product C_{4}^{2}A_{3}^{3}. So, the answer according to Solution 1 is C_{4}^{2}A_{3}^{3}.Solution 2:1. First, we choose 1 group out of the 3 interest groups to assign 2 students. This can be done in C_{3}^{1} ways.2. Then, we select 2 students out of the 4 to be assigned to the chosen interest group. This can be done in C_{4}^{2} ways.3. For the remaining 2 students and 2 interest groups, we need to assign each student to a unique group. This can be done in A_{2}^{2} ways, as there are 2 students and 2 unique assignments possible.4. Thus, the total number of ways to assign the students using this approach is the product C_{3}^{1}C_{4}^{2}A_{2}^{2}.So, the answer according to Solution 2 is C_{3}^{1}C_{4}^{2}A_{2}^{2}.Combining the insights from both solutions, we find that the correct options are B and C, as they correspond to the calculated answers.

The area of the rectangle is (a_1 b_1 = left(a - a_1right) a_1 frac{b}{a}). Discarding the constant factor (frac{b}{a}), we investigate the expression (left(a - a_1right) a_1).

Draw a line through point C parallel to A B until it intersects with line P N at point T. Denote M C=x, A Q=a. Then C P=P B=2 x, B Q=a.From the congruence of triangles K P B and T P C, it follows that C T=K B, and from the similarity of triangles K N A and T N C, we have C T=N A: N C=1: 2. Therefore, K A=A B=2 a.From the similarity of triangles M B Q and K B P, it follows that P B: Q B= K B : M B, or 2 x / a=4 a / 5 x. Hence, 4 a^{2}=10 x^{2}. Let A F be the height of triangle A B C. Then A F is the midline of triangle K P B. Therefore, B F=F P=x.

It remains to show that for n = 33 we can always find a monochrome triangle. There are three uncolored edges. Take a point on each of the uncolored edges. The edges between the remaining 6 points must all be colored. Take one of these, X. At least 3 of the 5 edges to X, say XA, XB, XC must be the same color (say red). If AB is also red, then XAB is monochrome. Similarly, for BC and CA. But if AB, BC and CA are all blue, then ABC is monochrome. s are also available in István Reiman, International Mathematical Olympiad 1959-1999, ISBN 189-8855-48-X. 33th IMO 1992 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 2 Sep 1999"},{"problem":"Given A(1,2), B(-1,4), C(4,k).

To help us look for such integers n, we use the following lemma that provides integer solutions to the generalized Pell equation.Lemma. { }^{1} Let d be a squarefree positive integer, and let a and b be positive integers such that a^{2}-d b^{2}=1. Set u=a+b sqrt{d}. Then for each nonzero integer n, every solution of x^{2}-d y^{2}=n is a power of u times x+y sqrt{d} where (x, y) is an integer solution of x^{2}-d y^{2}=n with |x| leq sqrt{|n|}(sqrt{u}+1) / 2 and |y| leq sqrt{|n|}(sqrt{u}+1) /(2 sqrt{d}).We now let g=operatorname{gcd}(n, 3 n-2). Then g in{1,2} since g mid 3 n-(3 n-2)=2. We now consider the following cases:- Suppose g=1. Then n=y^{2} and 3 n-2=x^{2} for some relatively prime positive integers x and y. This leads us to the generalized Pell equation x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-2. Set u=2+sqrt{3}, with (2,1) being a solution of x^{2}-3 y^{2}=1 in positive integers. We now look for the positive integer solutions (x, y) of x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-2 with x leq sqrt{2}(sqrt{u}+1) / 2 approx 2.07 and y leq sqrt{2}(sqrt{u}+1) /(2 sqrt{3}) approx 1.2. We obtain (x, y)=(1,1) as the only such integer solution, so by the above lemma, we see that all positive integer solutions left(x_{k}, y_{k}right) of x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-2 are given by x_{k}+y_{k} sqrt{3}=(1+sqrt{3})(2+sqrt{3})^{k} for all integers k geq 0. We now compute this product for small values of k :As n<1000, we require that y_{k} leq 31, so the positive integer solutions left(x_{k}, y_{k}right) of x^{2}-3 y^{2}= -2 with y_{k} leq 31 are left(x_{k}, y_{k}right)=(1,1),(5,3),(19,11) (which indeed have relatively prime coordinates). These correspond to the values of n: n=1,9,121.- Suppose g=2. Then n=2 y^{2} and 3 n-2=2 x^{2} for some relatively prime positive integers x and y. This leads us to the generalized Pell equation x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-1. Again, we set u=2+sqrt{3}. We now look for the positive integer solutions (x, y) of x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-1 with x leq(sqrt{u}+1) / 2 approx 1.47 and y leq(sqrt{u}+1) /(2 sqrt{3}) approx 0.85. It turns out that there are no such solutions on these bounds, so by the above lemma, we conclude that x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-1 has no solutions in positive integers.Hence, the only positive integers n<1000 for which a_{n} is a rational number are n=1,9,121 and the sum is 1+9+121=131."},{"problem":"Given the ellipse C：  frac {x^{2}}{2m}+ frac {y^{2}}{m}=1 (m＞0), if the line x= sqrt {m} intersects with the ellipse C at points A and B, and |AB|=2, then the length of the major axis of the ellipse is ( )A: 2B: 4C: 2 sqrt {2}D: 4 sqrt {2}","solution":"The ellipse C：  frac {x^{2}}{2m}+ frac {y^{2}}{m}=1 (m＞0) intersects with the line x= sqrt {m} at points A and B, and |AB|=2.Solving the system of equations begin{cases} frac {x^{2}}{2m}+ frac {y^{2}}{m}=1  x= sqrt {m}end{cases}, we get A((sqrt {m}, sqrt { frac {m}{2}})) and B((sqrt {m}, - sqrt { frac {m}{2}})).Thus, |AB| = 2 sqrt { frac {m}{2}} = 2, which gives m = 2.Hence, the ellipse C is frac {x^{2}}{4}+ frac {y^{2}}{2} = 1.So, a = 2, and the length of the major axis, 2a, is 4.Therefore, the answer is boxed{text{B}}.Solving the system of equations begin{cases} frac {x^{2}}{2m}+ frac {y^{2}}{m}=1  x= sqrt {m}end{cases} gives us A((sqrt {m}, sqrt { frac {m}{2}})) and B((sqrt {m}, - sqrt { frac {m}{2}})).

Establish a lower bound on the number of colors used:   - Each student receives 36 pencils, and each pair of students shares exactly one pencil of the same color.   - Consider the first student who gets 36 differently colored pencils.   - The second student must get one pencil that is the same color as one of the first student's pencils, and 35 pencils of different colors.   - Continuing this pattern, the (k^{text{th}}) student gets exactly one pencil matching a color of each of the previous (k-1) students. Even if these are all different pencils, the (k^{text{th}}) student still must have (36 - (k-1)) pencils of colors different from the previous students.   - Therefore, the total number of colors is at least:     [     36 + 35 + 34 + dots + 1 = sum_{i=1}^{36} i = frac{36 cdot 37}{2} = binom{37}{2}     ]2.

Express f(x) in a different form: The function f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt{3}cos 2x can be rewritten using the formula for the sine of a sum, sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. Comparing this to the given function, we can express f(x) as 2sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}). This is because sin 2x and cos 2x are the sine and cosine components, and sqrt{3} matches the coefficient required for the transformation, leading to:f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt{3}cos 2x = 2sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}).2. Shift the function to obtain g(x): The graph of f(x) is shifted to the right by frac{pi}{6} units to get g(x).

Determine the monotonically increasing interval of g(x): To find when g(x) = 2sin(2x) is monotonically increasing, we consider the basic property of the sine function. The sine function is increasing in the interval [-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}].

Reinterpret the Problem: We can simplify the problem by imagining that the bugs pass through each other without changing direction.

Define Variables: Let ( a ) be the number of bugs facing one direction and ( b = 2016 - a ) be the number of bugs facing the opposite direction.3. Calculate Contacts: The number of contacts is given by the product ( ab ). This is because each bug facing one direction will eventually meet each bug facing the opposite direction.4. Maximize the Product: To find the maximum number of contacts, we need to maximize the product ( ab ).

Let ( d ) be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence of the interior angles of the convex hexagon. Assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that ( d ge 0 ) (if ( d < 0 ), we can consider the absolute value of ( d )).2. The sum of the interior angles of a convex hexagon is given by:   [   180^circ times (6 - 2) = 720^circ   ]   Since there are six angles, the average measure of each angle is:   [   frac{720^circ}{6} = 120^circ   ]3. The angles form an arithmetic sequence, so we can denote the angles as:   [   120^circ - frac{5d}{2}, 120^circ - frac{3d}{2}, 120^circ - frac{d}{2}, 120^circ + frac{d}{2}, 120^circ + frac{3d}{2}, 120^circ + frac{5d}{2}   ]4. For the hexagon to be convex, all interior angles must be between ( 0^circ ) and ( 180^circ ).

In an alphabet of n>1 letters; a word is any finite sequence of letters in which any two adjacent letters are different. A word is called good if it is impossible to erase all letters from it, except for four, so that the remaining sequence is of the form a a b b, where a and b are different letters. Find the largest possible number of letters in a good word.(D. Khramtsov)","solution":"Answer: 2 n+1.First solution. Let's call the length of a word the number of letters in it. Let a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} be the letters of the alphabet. Then it is not hard to check that the following word is good:a_{n} a_{n-1} ldots a_{2} a_{1} a_{2} a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} ldots a_{n}It remains to show that there are no good words of greater length.Suppose that in an n-letter alphabet there exists a good word of length 2 n+2. Then some letter (say, a_{1}) appears in it at least three times. Mark its second (V) and penultimate (P) occurrence in the word (then V stands no further to the right than P).Any other letter appears no more than once before P, and no more than once after V, otherwise by erasing letters one can obtain a forbidden sequence. Therefore, each of the letters a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} appears no more than twice. Moreover, if such a letter does appear twice, then one of its occurrences stands before V, and the other after P.Suppose a_{1} appears k geqslant 3 times. Then between V and P stand at least k-3 letters different from a_{1} (one between each pair of consecutive occurrences of a_{1}), and all such letters appear exactly once. Highlight k-3 such letters. The remaining n-k+2 letters can appear at most twice. Therefore, the length of the word does not exceedk+(k-3) cdot 1+(n-k+2) cdot 2=2 n+1which contradicts our assumption.Second solution. We provide another proof that the length of a good word does not exceed 2 n+1. Induction on n geqslant 2. In the base case n=2, the letters in the word alternate, and a word of length at least 6 contains a fragment of the form a b a b a b, from which by erasing letters one can obtain a a b b.For the inductive step, assume that in an n-letter alphabet there is a good word of length at least 2 n+2. Then some letter a appears in this word at least three times. Suppose that there are two letters, a and b, each appearing at least 3 times. Let, without loss of generality, the second occurrence of a stand earlier than the second occurrence of b; then by erasing letters one can obtain the word a a b b, which is impossible.Therefore, the letter a appears in the word k geqslant 3 times, and all others at most twice. Then the length of the word is at least 2 n+2 and at most k+2(n-1), from which k geqslant 4.Between the second and third occurrence of the letter a there is some letter c. This letter cannot appear in other places: if it appears after the second occurrence of a, then by erasing letters one can obtain aacc, and if before it, then ccaa (since k geqslant 4).Suppose the neighbors of the letter c are different. Then, by removing c from the word, we obtain a good word in the (n-1)-letter alphabet (without the letter c). The length of this word will be at least 2 n+1=2(n-1)+3, which contradicts the inductive hypothesis.If the neighbors of the letter c are the same, remove from the word c and the letter before it; then at this \\"junction\\" will remain different letters. Therefore, we again obtain a good word in the (n-1)-letter alphabet, the length of which is at least 2(n-1)+2; this is also impossible by the inductive hypothesis.Comment. Only providing an example of a good word of 2 n+1 letters - 1 point (this point can be combined with the points mentioned below).Only proving that a good word has no more than 2 n+1 letters - 6 points.In proving this estimate, only proving that at most one letter appears more than twice - 2 points (out of 6); these points can be combined with points for the example."},{"problem":"14.

For the given equation x^{2}-(k+4)x+4k=0, the discriminant is calculated as follows:[Delta = b^{2}-4ac]Given a = 1, b = -(k+4), and c = 4k, we substitute these values into the discriminant formula:[begin{align*}Delta &= [-(k+4)]^{2}-4(1)(4k) &= (k+4)^{2}-16k &= k^{2} + 8k + 16 - 16k &= k^{2} - 8k + 16 &= (k-4)^{2}end{align*}]Since (k-4)^{2} is a square term, it is always greater than or equal to zero, i.e., (k-4)^{2} geq 0. Therefore, the discriminant Delta geq 0 for any real value of k, which implies the quadratic equation always has two real roots.[boxed{text{The equation always has two real roots.}}]# Part 2: Finding the Range of Values for k When One Root is Less Than 2Given the equation x^{2}-(k+4)x+4k=0, we attempt to factor it:[x^{2}-(k+4)x+4k = (x-4)(x-k) = 0]This gives us two roots: x_{1} = 4 and x_{2} = k. Since it's given that one root is less than 2, and since x_{1} = 4 is obviously not less than 2, it must be the other root x_{2} = k that is less than 2. Therefore, we have:[k < 2]This inequality represents the range of values for k for which one root of the equation is less than 2.[boxed{k < 2}]Analysis:1. By analyzing the discriminant Delta = (k-4)^{2} geq 0, we prove that the quadratic equation always has two real roots.2. Factoring the quadratic equation and considering the condition that one root is less than 2, we find that k must be less than 2 to satisfy this condition. This approach combines the use of the discriminant, factoring method, and solving linear inequalities to address the problem."},{"problem":"2nd Mexico 1988 Problem A4 How many ways can we find 8 integers a 1 , a 2 , ... , a 8 such that 1 ≤ a 1 ≤ a 2 ≤ ... ≤ a 8 ≤ 8?","solution":"15C7 = 15!/(8!7!) = 6435 Solution Arrange 8 black balls and 7 white balls in a row.
