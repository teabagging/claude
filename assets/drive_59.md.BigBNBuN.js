We will solve this game analytically. The average payoff of the first player, if he uses the optimal mixed strategy x^{*}=left(x_{1}^{*}, x_{2}^{*}right), and the second player uses a pure strategy corresponding to the first column of the payoff matrix, is equal to the value of the game v:150700 x_{1}^{*}+85860 x_{2}^{*}=vThe same average payoff is obtained by the first player if the second player applies a strategy corresponding to the second column of the payoff matrix, that is,89900 x_{1}^{*}+141650 x_{2}^{*}=vConsidering that x_{1}^{*}+x_{2}^{*}=1, we get a system of equations to determine the optimal strategy of the first player and the value of the game:left{begin{array}{c}150700 x_{1}^{*}+85860 x_{2}^{*}=v 89900 x_{1}^{*}+141650 x_{2}^{*}=v x_{1}^{*}+x_{2}^{*}=1end{array}right.Solving this system, we find:left{begin{array}{c}x_{1}^{*}=0.48 x_{2}^{*}=0.52 v=116983end{array}right.The optimal strategy for the company:P^{*}=x_{1}^{*} * F_{1}+x_{2}^{*} * F_{2}=0.48(2200 ; 3500)+0.52(3800 ; 2450)=(3032 ; 2954)Thus, it is optimal for the company to supply 3032 mathrm{~m}^{3} of natural gas and 2954 m ^{3} of liquefied gas."},{"problem":"4.

Upon receiving the task, the club members immediately started producing helium gas at a rate of xL per day. It is known that the cost of raw materials for producing 1L of helium gas is 100 yuan. If the daily production of helium gas is less than 4L, the additional cost per day is W_1=4x^2+16 yuan.

The production cost consists of raw material cost and additional cost.(1) Write the relationship between the total cost W (in yuan) and the daily production x (in L).(2) When the club produces how many liters of helium gas per day, the total cost is minimized?

Surface Area Calculation:   The total surface area ( A ) of a sphere with radius ( r ) is given by:   [   A = 4 pi r^2   ]   Each town occupies an area of:   [   A_{text{town}} = frac{4 pi r^2}{1000}   ]3. Latitude and Longitude Constraints:   Suppose the maximum and minimum latitudes of a town are given by points ( ell_M ) and ( ell_m ). The width ( w ) of the latitudinal band occupied by the town is:   [   w = |ell_M - ell_m|   ]   The surface area of this band is proportional to its width:   [   A_{text{band}} = 2 pi r w   ]4. Longitudinal Band Calculation:   If the most easterly and westerly points of the town subtend an angle ( theta ) with the center of the sphere, the area of the longitudinal band is:   [   A_{text{longitudinal}} = r theta w   ]   The town must fit within this area:   [   r theta w = frac{4 pi r^2}{1000}   ]5. Summing Widths and Angles:   Let ( {w_i}_{i=1}^N ) be the widths of the latitudinal bands made by the towns, and let ( {theta_i}_{i=1}^N ) be the angles representing the widths of the longitudinal bands of the towns. Then:   [   sum_{i=1}^N w_i le 2r quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^N theta_i le 2pi   ]6. Area of Each Town:   The area of town ( i ) is at most:   [   A_i = r theta_i w_i = frac{4 pi r^2}{1000}   ]7. Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:   Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:   [   left( sum_{i=1}^N w_i right) left( sum_{i=1}^N theta_i right) ge left( sum_{i=1}^N sqrt{w_i theta_i} right)^2   ]   Substituting the constraints:   [   2r cdot 2pi ge left( sum_{i=1}^N sqrt{w_i theta_i} right)^2   ]   Since ( w_i theta_i = frac{4 pi r}{1000} ):   [   left( sum_{i=1}^N sqrt{frac{4 pi r}{1000}} right)^2 = N left( sqrt{frac{4 pi r}{1000}} right)^2 = N cdot frac{4 pi r}{1000}   ]8. Solving for ( N ):   [   4 pi r^2 ge N cdot frac{4 pi r}{1000}   ]   Simplifying:   [   4 pi r^2 ge frac{4 pi r N}{1000}   ]   [   1000 r ge N   ]   [   N le sqrt{1000}   ]   Since ( sqrt{1000} approx 31.62 ), the maximum integer value for ( N ) is:   [   max(N) = 31   ]The final answer is ( boxed{31} )."},{"problem":"8.

Find the maximum number of divisors of a sympathetic number.## - Solutions -","solution":"Let n be a fixed friendly integer, and let d be a divisor of n. If d equiv 1(bmod 3), then d+2 equiv 0 (bmod 3), and since d+2 is prime, this means that d+2=3, so d=1.Now suppose there exist two primes p and q, distinct from 3, which both divide n. Then p equiv q equiv 2(bmod 3), so p q equiv 1(bmod 3), and p q does not divide n. We conclude that n must necessarily be of the form 3^{k} or 3^{k} p^{alpha}, with k in mathbb{N}, alpha in{0,1} and p a prime such that p equiv 2(bmod 3). The integer n will then have sigma_{0}(n)=(k+1)(alpha+1) divisors.We will now show that sigma_{0}(n) leqslant 8. First, since 3^{5}+2=245 is not prime, we know that k leqslant 4. Consequently, if alpha=0, we know that sigma_{0}(n)=k+1 leqslant 5, and if k leqslant 3, then sigma_{0}(n) leqslant 2(k+1) leqslant 8 as well. We therefore need to show that the pair (k, alpha) cannot be equal to (4,1).To do this, proceed by contradiction, and suppose that n=3^{4} p. Since 3^{4} times 5+2= 407=11 times 37, we know that p neq 5, so p is invertible modulo 5. Now, since 3^{2} equiv-1 (bmod 5), the integer 3 has order 4 modulo 5. Therefore, there must necessarily be an integer ell between 1 and 4 such that 3^{ell} equiv-2 p^{-1}(bmod 5), and then 3^{ell} p+2 is not prime. ^{2}.We have therefore shown that sigma_{0}(n) leqslant 8. Conversely, if n=3^{3} times 5=135, then n of course has 8 divisors, which are 1,3,5,9,15,27,45 and 135 itself. It is easily verified that 3,5,7,11,17, 29, 47 and 137 are all prime numbers, for example because they have no prime factor p leqslant 12=sqrt{144} other than themselves.Therefore, the integer n=135 is friendly, and the maximum number of divisors sought is therefore equal to 8.## V.

However, a bold symmetry argument, for example, can sometimes allow one to bypass this long process (but, alas!, these arguments are rarely applicable outside a particular case...)## Before starting the resolutionEven before thinking about a resolution path, the first reaction is always to look for obvious solutions, such as:-x mapsto 0-x mapsto 1-x mapsto a-x mapsto x-x mapsto x^{2}-x mapsto 1 / x-x mapsto frac{e^{x}+e^{-x}}{2} 1In the vast majority of cases, the functional equation has one or more solutions of this form, which are generally the only ones. Having an idea of what one is looking for can indeed be useful when one is looking to prove it.In parallel, proving that a functional equation admits only \\"simple\\" solutions (or, more generally, solutions of a certain form) is generally not enough to conclude: it remains to verify that all candidate solutions are (or are not!) valid, which avoids, for example, going from 7 / 7 to 5 / 7 on a functional equation exercise.Also, keep in mind that a solution function is not necessarily simple (polynomial, continuous, differentiable...), but can on the contrary be a highly pathological object (we will notably see a little later functions that cover, in a certain sense, the entire plane!)## SubstitutionThe first reflex to have in front of a functional equation is to substitute one of the unknowns with a value that is easily manageable, such as 0, 1, or f(0). This technique has several advantages:- It allows simplifying the functional equation, allowing, for example, to manipulate f(x) instead of f(x+f(y)) by taking (x, y) leftarrow(x-f(y), y)- It allows obtaining information about the behavior of f at particular values, thus allowing more effective substitutions (for example by simplifying the expression obtained even more).This strategy is particularly useful in the case of expressions of the form x+f(y) and f(x cdot f(y)), which both simplify to f(0) by taking (x, y) leftarrow(0,0); or similarly x cdot f(y) and f(y cdot f(x)), which simplify to f(0) by taking (x, y) leftarrow(1,0).1.

We are to find the eccentricity of the ellipse.1. First, we find the focus of the parabola y^2 = 4x. The focus of a parabola in the form y^2 = 4px is (p, 0). Here, p = 1, so the focus is F(1, 0).2. Since PF is perpendicular to the x-axis, the point P must have the same x-coordinate as F. Therefore, P is (1, y_0).3. Substituting x = 1 into the equation of the parabola, we find y_0 = sqrt{4 cdot 1} = 2. So, P is (1, 2).4. Since P is on the ellipse, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the ellipse: frac{1}{a^2} + frac{4}{b^2} = 1.5. The distance from F to the center of the ellipse is the semi-focal distance, c. Since F is (1, 0) and the center of the ellipse is (0, 0), c = 1.6. The relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse is a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Therefore, a^2 = b^2 + 1.7.

Since A and C are angles in a triangle and A+C < pi, we conclude that A, C in (0, frac{pi}{2}). Thus, we can find cos C (and hence cos A) using the Pythagorean identity:[cos C = cos A = sqrt{1 - sin^2 A} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^2} = frac{sqrt{5}}{3}.]Hence, because cos(A + C) = -cos B in triangle triangle ABC:[cos B = -cos(A + C) = -frac{sqrt{5}}{3}.]Therefore, the final answer for part (1) is boxed{-frac{sqrt{5}}{3}}.Part (2): Finding the Area S of triangle ABCStarting with the given 6S = b(a+c) and using the area formula S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A, we have:[6 times frac{1}{2} times bc sin A = b(a+c).]With b=3 and B=frac{pi}{3}, we use the Law of Sines: [frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{3}{sin frac{pi}{3}} = 2sqrt{3}.]This gives us sin A = frac{a}{2sqrt{3}}.

Part 1: Determining Set AGiven the function y={(frac{1}{2})}^{|x|-3}, we need to find its range, which forms set A. 1. We start by considering the expression inside the exponent, |x|-3. The absolute value ensures that |x| is always non-negative, so the smallest value |x|-3 can take is -3 when |x|=0. Therefore, we have |x|-3geqslant -3.2. Given the property of exponential functions, as the exponent decreases, the value of {(frac{1}{2})}^{|x|-3} increases. Thus, we have 0＜{(frac{1}{2})}^{|x|-3}≤{(frac{1}{2})}^{-3}.3. Simplifying the inequality, we find 0＜{(frac{1}{2})}^{|x|-3}≤8. This means the range of the function, or set A, is boxed{A=left(0,8right]}. Part 2: Determining Set BFor the function y=lg (x^{2}-4x), its domain forms set B. The condition for the logarithm to be defined is that its argument must be greater than zero, so we solve x^{2}-4x gt 0.1. Factoring the inequality gives x(x-4) gt 0, which is true for x lt 0 or x gt 4.2. Thus, the domain of the function, or set B, is boxed{B=left(-infty ,0right) cup left(4,+infty right)}. Part 3: Analyzing the Options- Option A: Acap B=left(4,8right]. We found A=left(0,8right] and B=left(-infty ,0right) cup left(4,+infty right). The intersection of A and B is indeed left(4,8right].

Given that B lies on the parabola, we can deduce |y_{2}|=2.4. The coordinates of B_{1} become B_{1}(-1, y_{2}).5. The distance |OB_{1}| can be calculated as |OB_{1}|=sqrt{1+y_{2}^{2}}=sqrt{1+4}=sqrt{5}.6.

This is only possible if D cdot E-C is divisible by 100. Since D, E, and C are all between 0 and 9 and are distinct, D cdot E-C is at most 9 cdot 8-0=72, and at least 0 cdot 1-9=-9. Between -9 and 72, there is only one number divisible by 100, which is 0, so D cdot E=C. Furthermore, the left side of (2) must also be 0, so the expression in parentheses must be 0. We can write 10 cdot A as 11 cdot A-A and rearrange the equation:B+E-A=11 cdot(D-A)Since D and A are distinct, the right side, and thus the left side, is a non-zero number.

Let's look at how the colored points are arranged when no new moves are possible. If there are two adjacent uncolored points, one of them can be colored.

If one group ends with a blue (red) point, the next group begins with a red (respectively blue) point, otherwise the point between the indicated groups can be colored. Therefore, if we remove the uncolored points, we get an alternation of red and blue points - meaning there are an equal number of red and blue points, and the total number of colored points is even.

As you go around the polygon, extending each side to form an exterior angle and adding these angles together, the total will always be a full circle, which is 360^{circ}. Therefore, the sum of exterior angles does not increase with the number of sides.

Specifically, it is the top semicircle of the circle (x-2)^2 + y^2 = 4. The area under this curve from x=0 to x=2 corresponds to a quarter of the circle's area.

What is the maximal number of distinct lines that can be determined by the sides of these rectangles?","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of distinct lines that can be formed by the sides of 2022 rectangles within a square, where no two rectangles share an interior point. We will use induction to prove that the maximum number of lines is ( n + 3 ) for ( n ) rectangles.1. Base Case:   - For ( n = 1 ), a single rectangle (which is the square itself) has 4 lines (the sides of the square). Thus, ( f(1) = 4 ).   - For ( n = 2 ), two rectangles can be formed by dividing the square into two smaller rectangles either horizontally or vertically. This results in 5 lines (4 original sides plus 1 new line). Thus, ( f(2) = 5 ).2. Inductive Step:   - Assume that for any ( k leq n-1 ), the maximum number of lines is ( f(k) = k + 3 ).   - We need to show that ( f(n) leq n + 3 ).3. Inductive Hypothesis:   - Consider the case where there is only one rectangle that has an edge on the left edge of the main rectangle. By the inductive hypothesis, we can apply the induction to the remaining ( n-1 ) rectangles. Thus, we have:     [     f(n) leq f(1) + f(n-1) - 3 leq 4 + (n-1 + 3) - 3 = n + 3     ]4. Partitioning the Main Rectangle:   - If there are at least two rectangles, choose one at the bottom and call it ( A ). Draw the line determined by the top side of ( A ). Assume this line intersects ( a ) rectangles and partitions the main rectangle into two big rectangles ( X ) and ( Y ). Now we have ( 2a ) rectangles.   - Apply induction to the big rectangles ( X ) and ( Y ):     [     f(n) leq f(X) + f(Y) - a - 3 leq X + Y - a + 3 = n + 3     ]     Here, ( a ) lines are counted twice (once for each rectangle), plus the line we drew and the two sides of the main rectangle.5. Construction:   - To construct the maximum number of lines, divide the main rectangle into rows. Each row will add new lines, and the total number of lines will be ( n + 3 ).Thus, by induction, we have shown that the maximum number of distinct lines determined by the sides of 2022 rectangles is ( 2022 + 3 = 2025 ).The final answer is ( boxed{2025} )."},{"problem":"9.

Analyze the Torpedo Boats' Capabilities:   - The first torpedo boat can shoot at any 10 successive positions.   - The second torpedo boat can shoot at any 10 positions, but they must be next to each other (i.e., positions (i, i+1, ldots, i+9)).3.

The second torpedo boat will then target the remaining positions to maximize the number of destroyers hit.     - Suppose there are (x) destroyers in (A_1). The first torpedo boat targets (A_1), hitting (x) destroyers. The second torpedo boat targets the remaining positions, hitting at least (leftlceil frac{10-x}{2} rightrceil) destroyers.

What is the smallest value of n so that if the outer layer of unit cubes are removed from the block, more than half the original unit cubes will still remain?","solution":"1. Calculate the total number of unit cubes in the cubic block:   The total number of unit cubes in an ( n times n times n ) cubic block is given by:   [   n^3   ]2. Determine the number of unit cubes in the outer layer:   The outer layer consists of all the unit cubes that are on the surface of the cube. To find the number of these cubes, we need to consider the six faces of the cube, each of which is an ( n times n ) square. However, we must subtract the cubes that are counted multiple times at the edges and corners.   - Each face has ( n^2 ) unit cubes.   - There are 6 faces, so initially, we count ( 6n^2 ) unit cubes.   - Each edge of the cube (12 edges in total) has ( n ) unit cubes, but each edge is shared by 2 faces, so we subtract ( 12n ) unit cubes.   - Each corner of the cube (8 corners in total) is shared by 3 faces, so we add back 8 unit cubes.   Therefore, the number of unit cubes in the outer layer is:   [   6n^2 - 12n + 8   ]3. Calculate the number of unit cubes remaining after removing the outer layer:   The number of unit cubes remaining after removing the outer layer is:   [   n^3 - (6n^2 - 12n + 8)   ]4. Set up the inequality to find the smallest ( n ) such that more than half of the original unit cubes remain:   We need the remaining cubes to be more than half of the original cubes:   [   n^3 - (6n^2 - 12n + 8) > frac{n^3}{2}   ]5. Simplify the inequality:   [   n^3 - 6n^2 + 12n - 8 > frac{n^3}{2}   ]   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:   [   2n^3 - 12n^2 + 24n - 16 > n^3   ]   Subtract ( n^3 ) from both sides:   [   n^3 - 12n^2 + 24n - 16 > 0   ]6.

Rectangle Containment:   Note that every rectangle can contain at most one square in the main diagonal.   - Proof:     Suppose a rectangle contains two (or more) squares in the main diagonal; let two of the squares in the main diagonal be ((a,a)) and ((b,b)), where (a < b). So the rectangle has the squares ((a,b)) and ((b,a)). However, ((b,a)) is not in the (n)-staircase as the first paragraph stated. So a rectangle can only contain at most one square in the main diagonal.3. Number of Rectangles:   Since there are (n) squares in the main diagonal, there are at least (n) rectangles. Since the area of the rectangles are all distinct, the minimum total area of the rectangles is:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   However, the area of the (n)-staircase is also (frac{n(n+1)}{2}), so there are exactly (n) rectangles, the areas of them are (1, 2, 3, cdots, n), and all rectangles contain exactly one square in the main diagonal.4. Rectangle Dimensions:   We will prove that each rectangle must have the dimensions (1 times k) for some (k) (depending on its area).   - The largest area of the rectangles is (n).   - Note the square ((1,n)). It can only be covered by a rectangle of area (n), since all other rectangles are not large enough to be able to cover both the square ((1,n)) and one of the squares of the main diagonal. With area (n), that rectangle can only cover ((1,n)) and either ((1,1)) or ((n,n)), since other squares will give a rectangle with area larger than (n). Both choices of ((1,1)) and ((n,n)) give the rectangle dimensions (1 times n), and the remaining region is an ((n-1))-staircase with the largest area of the rectangles remaining is (n-1), which can use the proof above. So all rectangles have dimensions (1 times k) for some (k).5. Inductive Proof for Placements:   We will prove by induction that the number of ways to partition the (n)-staircase is (2^{n-1}).   - Base Case:     For (n=1), it's obvious.   - Inductive Step:     Suppose the claim is true for (n=k). For (n=k+1), note that the rectangle with the area (k+1) can only be placed in two possible ways, and the remaining region is a (k)-staircase that can be partitioned in (2^{k-1}) ways. So the number of ways a ((k+1))-staircase can be partitioned is:     [     2 cdot 2^{k-1} = 2^k     ]     This is consistent with the claim. So the claim is proven.So the number of ways to partition an (n)-staircase is (boxed{2^{n-1}})."},{"problem":"P is a point inside the square A B C D such that P A=1, P B=2 and P C=3.

Since the prime factorization of 10 is 2 cdot 5, this is precisely when the prime factorization of n! contains 2 and 5, one of which is exactly the 100th power, and the other is at least the 100th power. It is expected that 5 will appear with a smaller exponent, so we first check when the exponent of 5 will be 100.Since every fifth natural number is divisible by 5, the product of the numbers up to n can only be exactly divisible by 5^{100} if there are at most 100 numbers divisible by 5 up to n, i.e., if n leq 500.Now let's write n in \\"base 5,\\" i.e., in the form n=a+5b+25c+125d+625e+ldots, where the coefficients are non-negative integers less than 5 (such a representation exists for every positive n by the division algorithm). Since n leq 500, only the first four terms in this representation can be non-zero: n=a+5b+25c+125d.Let's check how many numbers up to n are divisible by 5, 25, and 125. Every fifth number is divisible by 5, every twenty-fifth by 25, and every one hundred and twenty-fifth by 125. Therefore, the number of such numbers is respectively b+5c+25d, c+5d, and d.Thus, in the product, the factor 5 appears (b+5c+25d) times, an additional 5 appears (c+5d) times, and another 5 appears d times. Therefore, the total number of 5 factors is:(b+5c+25d) + (c+5d) + d = b + 6c + 31d = 100d > 3 is impossible because 31 cdot 4 > 100. Since b, c leq 4, we have:- If d=3, then b + 6c = 7. The only solution is b=1 and c=1, giving n = 1 + 5 cdot 1 + 25 cdot 1 + 125 cdot 3 = 406.- If d=2, then b + 6c = 38. The only solution is b=2 and c=6, but c leq 4, so this is not possible.- If d=1, then b + 6c = 69. The only solution is b=3 and c=11, but c leq 4, so this is not possible.- If d=0, then b + 6c = 100. The only solution is b=4 and c=16, but c leq 4, so this is not possible.Thus, the only solution is n = 406.Remark. The above procedure can be performed for any natural number k instead of 100. However, we do not always get a solution.For example, can n! end in 5 zeros? Here only n=a+5b is possible. Then the number of zeros is (a+5b) + b = a + 6b = 5. This is only possible if b=0, which implies a=5, contradicting a leq 4. Similarly, it is impossible for 5 + 6b zeros, where 0 leq b < 5. For k=36, for example, only c=1 is possible. This would imply a + 6b = 5, which, as we have seen, is impossible. But it is also impossible for k=31+30. This would only be possible if c=1. The resulting a + 6b = 30 equation would only hold if b=5, which contradicts b leq 4. For 31 leq k < 62, only c=1 is possible, which implies 0 leq a + 6b < 31. Given 0 leq a, b leq 4, we must exclude numbers of the form 5 + 6b and a + 30. These are:k=5+31; 5+6+31; 5+12+31; 5+18+31; 5+24+31; 30+31(The next number to be written does not satisfy k < 62.) Therefore, n! cannot end in 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, or 61 zeros.Similarly, it is impossible for the number of zeros to be:k=5+31c; 5+6+31c; 5+12+31c; 5+18+31c; 5+24+31c; 30+31cwhere 1 < c < 5.For n geq 625, finding the cases to exclude becomes more complex, but the result can be stated."},{"problem":"B1.

Recognize that the first three terms form a perfect square trinomial, which can be factorized using the formula a^2 pm 2ab + b^2 = (a pm b)^2.3. Apply the formula to the expression: (a-2b)^2 - 4(a-2b) + 4 = [(a-2b) - 2]^2.4. Now, the expression is in the form [(a-2b) - 2]^2 - c^2, which resembles the formula a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b).5. Apply the difference of squares formula to get the final factorized form: [((a-2b) - 2) + c][((a-2b) - 2) - c].Therefore, the factorized form of the given expression is boxed{((a-2b) - 2 + c)((a-2b) - 2 - c)}."},{"problem":"In the sequence 1, frac{{sqrt{3}}}{3}, frac{{sqrt{5}}}{{x+y}}, frac{{sqrt{x-y}}}{{27}}, frac{1}{{27}}, ldots, the ordered pair of real numbers left(x,yright) is ( ).A: left(frac{{15}}{2}, frac{1}{2}right)B: (7,0)C: (8,1)D: (15,8)","solution":"To analyze the sequence given, we observe its pattern in a more generalized form.

But if the sum of 100 non-negative numbers is zero, then all these numbers are zero; thus, our system of inequalities actually turns into a system of equalities:a_{1}-4 a_{2}+3 a_{3}=0, alpha_{2}-1 a_{3}+3 a_{4}=0, ldots, a_{160}-4 a_{1}+3 a_{2}=0which can also be rewritten as follows:a_{1}-a_{2}=3left(a_{2}-a_{3}right), a_{2}-a_{3}=3left(a_{3}-a_{4}right), a_{3}-a_{4}==3left(a_{4}-a_{5}right), ldots, quad a_{99}-a_{100}=3left(a_{100}-a_{1}right), quad a_{100}-a_{1}=3left(a_{1}-a_{2}right).Now we sequentially obtain:a_{1}-a_{2}=3left(a_{2}-a_{3}right)=3^{2}left(a_{3}-a_{4}right)=3^{3}left(a_{4}-a_{5}right)=ldotsldots=3^{99}left(a_{100}-a_{1}right)=3^{100}left(a_{1}-a_{2}right)But from the equality a_{1}-a_{2}=3^{100}left(a_{1}-a_{2}right) it follows that a_{1}-a_{2}=0; therefore, a_{2}-a_{3}=frac{1}{3}left(a_{1}-a_{2}right)=0, and a_{3}-a_{4}=frac{1}{3}left(a_{2}-a_{3}right)= =0, ldots, and a_{100}-alpha_{1}=frac{1}{3}left(a_{99}-a_{100}right)=0.Thus, all our numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{99}, a_{100} are equal to each other; therefore, if a_{1}=1, then a_{2}=a_{3}=ldots=a_{100}=1."},{"problem":"On an 6 times 6 chessboard, we randomly place counters on three different squares.

If S_a(n)=(S_b(n))^c for all positive integers n where a, b are positive rationals and c is positive integer then we call (a,b,c) as [i]nice triple.[/i] Find all nice triples.","solution":"1. We start with the given function ( S_r(n) = 1^r + 2^r + cdots + n^r ), where ( n ) is a positive integer and ( r ) is a rational number. We are given that ( S_a(n) = (S_b(n))^c ) for all positive integers ( n ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are positive rationals and ( c ) is a positive integer. We need to find all such triples ((a, b, c)) that satisfy this condition.2. Asymptotically, ( S_r(n) ) grows like ( frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1} ). This is derived from the fact that the sum of the first ( n ) ( r )-th powers can be approximated by the integral:   [   int_1^n x^r , dx = left[ frac{x^{r+1}}{r+1} right]_1^n = frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1} - frac{1^{r+1}}{r+1} approx frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1}   ]   for large ( n ).3. Given ( S_a(n) = (S_b(n))^c ), we substitute the asymptotic forms:   [   frac{n^{a+1}}{a+1} approx left( frac{n^{b+1}}{b+1} right)^c   ]   Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:   [   frac{n^{a+1}}{a+1} approx frac{n^{c(b+1)}}{(b+1)^c}   ]4. Equating the exponents of ( n ) on both sides, we get:   [   a + 1 = c(b + 1)   ]5. Equating the coefficients, we get:   [   frac{1}{a+1} = frac{1}{(b+1)^c}   ]   This implies:   [   a + 1 = (b + 1)^c   ]6. From the two equations ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ) and ( a + 1 = (b + 1)^c ), we get:   [   c(b + 1) = (b + 1)^c   ]   Dividing both sides by ( b + 1 ) (assuming ( b + 1 neq 0 )), we get:   [   c = (b + 1)^{c-1}   ]7. We now analyze the equation ( c = (b + 1)^{c-1} ) for positive rational ( b ) and positive integer ( c ).8. For ( c = 1 ):   [   1 = (b + 1)^0 = 1   ]   This is always true, and from ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ), we get ( a = b ). Thus, the nice triples are ( (k, k, 1) ) for any positive rational ( k ).9. For ( c neq 1 ):   [   c = (b + 1)^{c-1}   ]   Since ( b + 1 ) must be an integer, let ( b + 1 = k ) where ( k ) is an integer. Then:   [   c = k^{c-1}   ]   We need to find integer solutions for ( c ) and ( k ).10. For ( c = 2 ):    [    2 = k^1 implies k = 2 implies b = 1    ]    Substituting ( b = 1 ) into ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ):    [    a + 1 = 2 cdot 2 = 4 implies a = 3    ]    Thus, the nice triple is ( (3, 1, 2) ).11.

Since ( f'(x) ) has at most ( n-1 ) roots, it has exactly one root in ( [y_1, y_2] ). Given ( f(0) > 0 ), ( f(x) > 0 ) in ( [y_1, y_2] ). Thus, ( f'(x) < 0 ) in ( [0, y_2] ).6.

Then:   [   x = r   ]   We need to find the smallest (n) such that:   [   r^n > 100   ]   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:   [   ln(r^n) > ln(100)   ]   Simplifying, we obtain:   [   n ln(r) > ln(100)   ]   Solving for (n), we get:   [   n > frac{ln(100)}{ln(r)}   ]   Substituting (r = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}), we have:   [   ln(r) = lnleft(frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}right)   ]   Using the approximate value (lnleft(frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}right) approx 0.4812), we get:   [   n > frac{ln(100)}{0.4812} approx frac{4.6052}{0.4812} approx 9.57   ]   Therefore, the smallest integer (n) is:   [   n = 10   ]The final answer is (boxed{10})."},{"problem":"3.

After eliminating y, we obtain: (4y_0^2 + 3x_0^2)x^2 - 24x_0x + 48 - 16y_0^2 = 0.Since point P(x_0, y_0) lies on curve C, we have frac{x_0^2}{4} + frac{y_0^2}{3} = 1, which simplifies to 4y_0^2 + 3x_0^2 = 12.Therefore, the equation can be simplified to x^2 - 2x_0x + x_0^2 = 0, producing a solution x = x_0.Substituting x = x_0 into the equation y = frac{12 - 3x_0x}{4y_0} yields y = y_0.

Calculate the minimum volume of the tetrahedron, whose three faces are contained in the faces of the trihedral angle  OABC , and the fourth face contains the point  P .","solution":"Let  mathbf{Q}  denote the considered parallelepiped with volume  V . Let  OA ,  OB ,  OC  be its three edges. We draw a plane through point  P  intersecting the rays  OA^rightarrow ,  OB^rightarrow ,  OC^rightarrow  at points  K ,  L ,  M  respectively (thus forming the tetrahedron  OKLM ; its volume is the quantity we need to minimize).Consider the following three numbers (ratios of triangle areas):Of course,  x, y, z > 0 ,  x + y + z = 1 .Let the distances from points  P  and  M  to the plane  ABC  be denoted by  d  and  h , and the distances from these points to the line  KL  - by  d  and  h . Due to the parallelism of the line  CP  to the plane  OAB , the proportion holds:Similarly, we can interpret the numbers  x  and  y . Thus,From the formula for the volume of a pyramid and the relationships (1) and (2), we obtain the equality:Twice the area of triangle  OAB  is the area of the face of the parallelepiped  mathbf{Q}  contained in the plane  mathbf{OAB} ; the number  d  is the length of the corresponding height of this parallelepiped. Therefore,  d cdot 2mathrm{area}(OAB) = mathrm{volume}(mathbf{Q}) = V . From this and the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality for the numbers  x ,  y ,  z , it follows that:The obtained inequality becomes an equality when  x = y = z = 1 , i.e., when the segments  OK ,  OL ,  OM  are three times longer than  OA ,  OB ,  OC , respectively. This happens when the plane  KLM  is drawn through point  P  parallel to the plane  ABC .The number  frac{9}{2} V  is thus the sought minimum.Note. When the segments  OA ,  OB ,  OC  are pairwise perpendicular and have equal length, they can be taken as the unit vectors of a Cartesian coordinate system. The entire reasoning can then be elegantly expressed in the language of analytic geometry. For:  A = (1,0,0) ,  B = (0,1,0) ,  C = (0,0,1) ,  P = (1,1,1) ; any plane passing through point  P  is given by an equation of the form  ax + by + cz = 1 , with positive coefficients  a ,  b ,  c  chosen so that  a + b + c = 1 . (It is not hard to notice that the numbers  a ,  b ,  c  are nothing else but the numbers  x ,  y ,  z  from the previous solution method; this time we need the letters  x ,  y ,  z  to denote the variables of the coordinate system; hence the change in notation.) The considered plane intersects the coordinate axes at points  K = (1/a, 0,0) ,  L = (0,1/b,0) ,  M = (0,0, 1/c) .The parallelepiped  mathbf{Q}  is now a unit cube; its volume  V  equals  1 . The tetrahedron  OKLM  has a volume of  (1/6)(1/a)(1/b)(1/c) . As before, applying the inequality between means, we observe that (with the constant sum  a + b + c = 1 ) the product  abc  reaches its maximum when  a = b = c = frac{1}{3} ; the volume of the tetrahedron  OKLM  then reaches its minimum, equal to  frac{9}{2} .Thus, the thesis of the problem is proven in a very special case, where  |OA| = |OB| = |OC| = 1 ,  OA perp OB perp OC perp OA . This \\"very special\\" case is, however, in a certain sense, quite general. It should be obvious to those familiar with the concept of affine transformations and their simplest properties. Any parallelepiped can be affinely transformed into a unit cube; and the ratio of volumes is an invariant of affine transformations of three-dimensional space. And it is precisely these two observations that suffice to deduce the thesis of the problem in full generality from the special case considered above."},{"problem":"668.

By forgetting Donald and fraudulently \\"forgetting\\" the vote he might have received, replacing it with a blank vote, Théo can distribute the remaining n-1 students into at most three groups.Then Théo brings Donald back to the class: among the three groups, there is at least one that does not contain the person for whom Donald might have voted, nor the potential voter of Donald. Théo then places Donald in this group, which concludes the induction.In summary, the integers sought are the integers k geqslant 3.Comment from the graders Many students understood that certain cases forced Théo to choose k geqslant 3. It was then necessary, for all n, to give an example of a vote for which 3 groups were necessary.Subsequently, numerous strategies for distributing the students into 3 groups were proposed, but few were correct. In such a case, trying to prove that the distribution works is always useful: either the distribution is correct, and proving it is necessary to get all the points; or it is not, and failing to prove it often helps to understand why the strategy fails. It is also important not to hesitate to test the distribution given for certain votes: this often easily reveals the problems.Finally, some students transformed the problem into a graph coloring problem, then claimed that if one could color any subset of 4 vertices of the graph without having two adjacent vertices of the same color, one could color the entire graph without having two adjacent vertices of the same color.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given ( n ) sets, each containing 4 elements. The difference set of any two of these sets is equal to one of the ( n ) sets. We need to determine the maximum possible value of ( n ).2. Difference Set Definition:   The difference set of two sets ( A ) and ( B ) is defined as:   [   (A setminus B) cup (B setminus A)   ]   This is the symmetric difference of ( A ) and ( B ), which includes elements that are in either ( A ) or ( B ) but not in both.3. Exploring Small Cases:   Let's start by examining smaller cases to identify a pattern.   - Case ( n = 1 ):     If there is only one set, say ( A = {a, b, c, d} ), there are no other sets to compare it with, so this case is trivial.   - Case ( n = 2 ):     Suppose we have two sets ( A ) and ( B ). The difference set ( (A setminus B) cup (B setminus A) ) must be one of the two sets. This is not possible because the symmetric difference of two sets of size 4 will have at most 8 elements, which cannot be one of the original sets of size 4.   - Case ( n = 3 ):     Consider three sets ( A, B, ) and ( C ). The symmetric difference of any two sets must be one of the three sets. This is possible if the sets are structured in a specific way. For example, if:     [     A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, quad B = {1, 2, 5, 6}, quad C = {3, 4, 5, 6}     ]     Then:     [     A Delta B = {3, 4, 5, 6} = C, quad A Delta C = {1, 2, 5, 6} = B, quad B Delta C = {1, 2, 3, 4} = A     ]     This satisfies the condition.4. Generalizing the Pattern:   From the above cases, we observe that the sets can be structured such that their symmetric differences are also among the sets. This structure can be extended to larger ( n ).5. Maximal Collection:   To find the maximal ( n ), we need to consider the combinatorial structure of the sets. The construction provided in the solution suggests that for sets of size ( 2^n ), we can have ( 2^{n+1} - 1 ) sets. For sets of size 4, this corresponds to ( n = 2 ), giving us ( 2^{2+1} - 1 = 7 ) sets.6. Verification:   We verify that for ( n = 7 ), the sets can be structured such that their symmetric differences are also among the sets. This is consistent with the construction provided.Conclusion:The maximum possible value of ( n ) is ( 7 ).The final answer is ( boxed{7} )"},{"problem":"## Task 5 - 311245Let a be any real number with a geq 2.

From the given information, we know that x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}=1, x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}=x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}=4, and P=(-1,0).Hence, |BC|^{2}+|CA|^{2}+|AB|^{2}=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}+(x_{2}-x_{0})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{0})^{2}+(x_{1}-x_{0})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{0})^{2}=2(x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2})+2(x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2})+2(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2})-2(x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{0}+y_{1}y_{0}+x_{2}x_{0}+y_{2}y_{0})=18-2(x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{0}+y_{1}y_{0}+x_{2}x_{0}+y_{2}y_{0}).Since PA perp PB, we have overrightarrow{{PA}} cdot overrightarrow{{PB}}=0. Also, overrightarrow{{PA}}=(x_{0}+1,y_{0}) and overrightarrow{{PB}}=(x_{1}+1,y_{1}). Therefore, (x_{0}+1)(x_{1}+1)+y_{0}y_{1}=0, which implies x_{0}x_{1}+y_{0}y_{1}=-1-(x_{0}+x_{1}).Thus, x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{0}+y_{1}y_{0}+x_{2}x_{0}+y_{2}y_{0}=x_{2}(x_{0}+x_{1})+y_{2}(y_{0}+y_{1})-1-(x_{0}+x_{1})=(x_{0}+x_{1})(x_{2}-1)+y_{2}(y_{0}+y_{1})-1.① When BC perp x-axis, line BC intersects circle O only at point P. In this case, A(1,0), |BP|=|CP|=sqrt{3}, and |AB|=|CA|=sqrt{2^{2}+(sqrt{3})^{2}}=sqrt{7}.Therefore, |BC|^{2}+|CA|^{2}+|AB|^{2}=(2sqrt{3})^{2}+(sqrt{7})^{2}+(sqrt{7})^{2}=26.② When BC is not perpendicular to the x-axis, line BC intersects circle O at two points. Let the other intersection point be A'. Since A'P perp AP, A'A is a diameter of circle O, so A'(-x_{0},-y_{0}).Using the midpoint of A'P and the midpoint of BC, we find x_{1}+x_{2}=-x_{0}-1 and y_{1}+y_{2}=-y_{0}, which gives us x_{1}+x_{0}=-1-x_{2} and y_{1}+y_{0}=-y_{2}.Consequently, x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{0}+y_{1}y_{0}+x_{2}x_{0}+y_{2}y_{0}=(-1-x_{2})(x_{2}-1)+y_{2}(-y_{2})-1=1-(x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2})-1=-4.This means that |BC|^{2}+|CA|^{2}+|AB|^{2}=18-2times(-4)=26.In conclusion, |BC|^{2}+|CA|^{2}+|AB|^{2} is indeed a constant value, equal to boxed{26}."},{"problem":"Express the inequality that the quintuple of the sum of a and 3 is not less than 6.","solution":"According to the problem, we have 5(a + 3) geq 6.

Point A lies first on the ray from C through F and second on the free leg of an angle of size 90^{circ} - frac{alpha}{2} drawn at M on MF on the side of the line through M and E, on which C does not lie.Point B lies first on the ray from C through E and second on the free leg of an angle of size alpha drawn at A on AC on the side of the line through A and C, on which E lies.(II) It follows from this that a triangle ABC meets the conditions of the problem only if it can be obtained by the following construction:1. We construct the square CFME with side length rho.2. We draw the ray from C through F.3. We draw an angle of size 90^{circ} - frac{alpha}{2} at M on MF on the side of the line through M and F, on which C does not lie. If its free leg intersects the ray from C through F, the intersection point is called A.4. We draw an angle of size alpha at A on AC on the side of the line through A and C, on which E lies.5. We draw the ray from C through E. If it intersects the free leg of the angle constructed in (4), the intersection point is called B.(III) Proof that every triangle ABC constructed in this way meets the conditions of the problem: According to the construction, the angle at C is a right angle. Similarly, the angle BAC has the size alpha according to the construction. M has the distance rho from AC and BC according to the construction. Since furthermore, according to the construction,angle CAM = angle FAM = frac{alpha}{2} quad text{and} quad angle MAB = angle CAB - angle CAM = frac{alpha}{2},AB is also a tangent to the circle with radius rho around M, just like AC. Therefore, M is the center of the incircle of the triangle ABC.(IV) Construction step (1) is uniquely constructible up to congruence. Similarly, construction step (2) is uniquely constructible. Furthermore, because 0^{circ} < 90^{circ} - frac{alpha}{2} < 90^{circ}, (3) is also uniquely constructible. After that, (4) and because 0^{circ} < alpha < 90^{circ}, (5) is also uniquely constructible.Therefore, the triangle ABC is uniquely determined by the given pieces up to congruence.# Task 3 - 130823Determine all rational numbers r with the following property:If you subtract r from the numerator of the fraction frac{3}{4} and add r to its denominator, you get a fraction that is half as large as frac{3}{4}.","solution":"Assume there is a rational number r that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

The total points scored by Mada can be expressed as:   [   3y + 2(11 - y) = 3y + 22 - 2y = y + 22   ]6. Since Adam and Mada scored the same number of points, we set their point totals equal to each other:   [   30 - x = y + 22   ]7. Substituting ( y = x ) into the equation, we get:   [   30 - x = x + 22   ]8. Solving for ( x ):   [   30 - x = x + 22    30 - 22 = 2x    8 = 2x    x = 4   ]9. Therefore, Adam made 4 two-point shots and ( 10 - 4 = 6 ) three-point shots. Mada made 4 three-point shots and ( 11 - 4 = 7 ) two-point shots.10. The total points scored by Adam is:    [    2(4) + 3(6) = 8 + 18 = 26    ]11. The total points scored by Mada is:    [    3(4) + 2(7) = 12 + 14 = 26    ]12. The total points scored in the game is:    [    26 + 26 = 52    ]The final answer is (boxed{52})."},{"problem":"There are 4 newly graduated teachers to be assigned to four schools, with each teacher having a different assignment (represented by numbers).1.

We start with the given product:   [   prod_{n=2}^x log_{n^n}(n+1)^{n+2}   ]2. We simplify the logarithmic term:   [   log_{n^n} (n+1)^{n+2} = frac{log (n+1)^{n+2}}{log (n^n)} = frac{(n+2) log (n+1)}{n log n}   ]   This uses the change of base formula for logarithms: (log_a b = frac{log b}{log a}).3. The product then becomes:   [   prod_{n=2}^x frac{(n+2) log (n+1)}{n log n}   ]4. We observe that the product telescopes. To see this, consider the product up to (x):   [   prod_{n=2}^x frac{(n+2) log (n+1)}{n log n}   ]   Each term (frac{(n+2) log (n+1)}{n log n}) can be written as:   [   frac{n+2}{n} cdot frac{log (n+1)}{log n}   ]5. The telescoping nature of the product means that many terms will cancel out. Specifically, the (log (n+1)) terms will cancel with (log n) terms from the next factor, leaving:   [   frac{(x+2) log (x+1)}{2 log 2}   ]6. Simplifying further, we get:   [   frac{(x+2) log (x+1)}{2 log 2}   ]7. For this expression to be an integer, (frac{(x+2) log (x+1)}{2 log 2}) must be an integer. This implies that ((x+2) log (x+1)) must be an integer multiple of (2 log 2).8. Since (log 2) is irrational, ((x+2) log (x+1)) must be an integer multiple of (log 2). This implies that (x+1) must be a power of 2. Let (x+1 = 2^k), then (x = 2^k - 1).9.

We start by focusing on the numerator and the denominator separately.- Numerator Simplification:The numerator is 1 + frac{1}{x-2}. To combine these terms into a single fraction, we find a common denominator, which is x-2:[1 + frac{1}{x-2} = frac{x-2}{x-2} + frac{1}{x-2} = frac{x-2+1}{x-2} = frac{x-1}{x-2}]- Denominator Simplification:The denominator is frac{x^2 - 2x + 1}{x-2}.

Thus, the denominator becomes:[frac{(x-1)^2}{x-2}]- Combining Numerator and Denominator:Now, we combine the simplified numerator and denominator:[frac{x-1}{x-2} cdot frac{x-2}{(x-1)^2} = frac{x-1}{(x-1)^2} cdot frac{x-2}{x-2}]Since (x-2) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, as does one (x-1) term, we are left with:[frac{1}{x-1}]2.

Now perform an inversion about G with radius G A=G B=G C. Then the images of X, Y, Z (call them left.X^{prime}, Y^{prime}, Z^{prime}right) lie on (G B C),(G A C),(G A B), so they are the feet of the perpendiculars from A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1} to line X Y Z, where A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1} are the respective antipodes of G on (G B C),(G A C),(G A B). But now A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} is an equilateral triangle with medial triangle A B C, so its centroid is G. Now the centroid of (degenerate) triangle X^{prime} Y^{prime} Z^{prime} is the foot of the perpendicular of the centroid of A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} onto the line, so it is G. Thus X^{prime} G+Y^{prime} G+Z^{prime} G=0, which yields the desired claim.Proof 2: Let W be the point on line X Y Z such that W G=2 G X (in directed lengths). Now note that (Y, Z ; G, W) is a harmonic bundle, since projecting it through A onto B C gives left(B, C ; M_{B C}, infty_{B C}right). By harmonic bundle properties, this yields that frac{1}{Y G}+frac{1}{Z G}=frac{2}{W G} (in directed lengths), which gives the desired.Proof 3: Let P neq G be an arbitrary point on the line X Y Z. Now, in directed lengths and signed areas, frac{G P}{G X}=frac{[G B P]}{[G B X]}=frac{[G C P]}{[G C X]}, so frac{G P}{G X}=frac{[G B P]-[G C P]}{[G B X]-[G C X]}=frac{[G B P]-[G C P]}{[G B C]}=frac{3([G B P]-[G C P])}{[A B C]}. Writing analogous equations for frac{G P}{G Y} and frac{G P}{G Z} and summing yields frac{G P}{G X}+frac{G P}{G Y}+frac{G P}{G Z}=0, giving the desired.With this lemma, we may now set X G=g and know thatfrac{1}{g}+frac{1}{g-5}+frac{1}{g-8}=0Solving the quadratic gives the solutions g=2 and g=frac{20}{3}; the latter hence gives the maximum (it is not difficult to construct an example for which X G is indeed 20/3)."},{"problem":"The Princeton University Band plays a setlist of 8 distinct songs, 3 of which are tiring to play.

Hence, by (i), we get that x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} and x_{4} are even. Similarly, by (ii), we get that y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3} and y_{4} are even. Thus the LHS of (iii) is divisible by 4 and m is also even.

Conformal Mappings## 1^{circ}. Concept of Conformal Mapping.Definition. A mapping of a neighborhood of a point z_{0} onto a neighborhood of a point w_{0}, realized by the function w=f(z), is called conformal if at the point z_{0} it has the property of preserving angles between curves and the constancy of dilations (Fig. 14).This means that:1) if under the mapping w=f(z) the curves gamma_{1} and gamma_{2} are transformed into the curves Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2}, respectively, then the angle varphi between the tangents k_{1} and k_{2} to the curves gamma_{1} and gamma_{2} at the point z_{0} will be equal to the angle Phi between the corresponding tangents K_{1} and K_{2} to the curves Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2} at the point w_{0}, i.e., Phi=varphi.2) if in the complex plane z we take an infinitesimally small circle centered at the point z_{0}, then in the plane w it will correspond to an infinitesimally small circle centered at the point w_{0}.Therefore, it is said that a conformal mapping has the property of angle conservation and similarity in the small.If under the mapping w=f(z) the angles between corresponding directions are equal not only in magnitude but also in the direction of measurement, then such a mapping is called a conformal mapping of the first kind.A conformal mapping in which angles are preserved only in absolute magnitude but the direction of their measurement is reversed is called a conformal mapping of the second kind.A simple example of a conformal mapping of the first kind is the mapping w=z, and of the second kind is the mapping w=bar{z}.In the following, we will consider only conformal mappings of the first kind.A mapping w=f(z) is called conformal in a domain D if it is conformal at every point of this domain.Criterion for Conformality. For the mapping w=f(z) to be conformal in a domain D, it is necessary and sufficient that in this domain the function w=f(z) is univalent and analytic, and f^{prime}(z) neq 0 for all z in D.If we do not assume the univalence of f(z), then the mapping realized by this function will not be one-to-one, and thus will not be conformal. For example, the function w=z^{4}, defined in the half-ring 1 leqslant|z| leqslant 2,0 leqslant arg z leqslant pi, is analytic in it, and, moreover, the condition w^{prime}=4 z^{3} neq 0 is satisfied everywhere in the half-ring. However, the function w=z^{4} maps the given half-ring onto the region 1 leqslant|w| leqslant 16,0 leqslant arg w leqslant 4 pi, i.e., a region that twice covers the corresponding ring on the w-plane, which violates the one-to-one correspondence.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_f7d63c3a5e94c3f2f1bbg-119.jpg?height=466&width=946&top_left_y=159&top_left_x=216)Fig. 14"},{"problem":"Three, (25 points) A chemical plant, starting from January this year, if it does not improve its production environment and continues to produce as it is, will earn 700,000 yuan per month.

If triangle triangle F_2AB forms an equilateral triangle with an area of 4sqrt{3}, then find the equation of the ellipse C.","solution":"To solve for the equation of ellipse C: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, we need to determine the values of a and b. Since the foci of the ellipse are F_1 and F_2, and the triangle triangle F_2AB is equilateral with an area of 4sqrt{3}, we can proceed as follows:First, let's recall the relationship between the distance of the foci from the center of the ellipse (c), the semi-major axis (a), and the semi-minor axis (b) in an ellipse: c^2 = a^2 - b^2. For an equilateral triangle, the height can be expressed as a function of the side length (which can be represented as 2c since F_2A and F_2B are radii of the ellipse). Using the fact that the altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ right triangles, the height (h) of the equilateral triangle can be calculated from the length of 2c by: h = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} times 2c = frac{2csqrt{3}}{3}. The Area (A) of an equilateral triangle can be calculated by: A = frac{1}{2} cdot text{base} cdot text{height} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2c cdot h. Since the area is given as 4sqrt{3}, we have: 4sqrt{3} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2c cdot frac{2csqrt{3}}{3}, which simplifies to: c^2 = 3. Using the relationship c^2 = a^2 - b^2, we now look for a second equation to solve for a and b. Since A of the triangle triangle F_2AB is 4sqrt{3}, and we have the base of the triangle as 2c (F_2A and F_2B being radii of the ellipse), the area can also be calculated by: A = frac{1}{2} times 2c times frac{b^2}{a}. Plugging in the given area 4sqrt{3}, we have: 4sqrt{3} = frac{1}{2} times 2c times frac{b^2}{a}, which simplifies to: frac{b^2}{a} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. Combining the two equations involving a, b, and c we get: a^2 = b^2 + 3. Now, we have two equations in two unknowns, a^2 and b^2, and two known values c^2 and  frac{b^2}{a}. We can solve this system to find the values of a^2 and b^2: a^2 = left( frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right) a + 3, which simplifies to: a^2 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}a - 3 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for a, we have: a = frac{frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} pm sqrt{left( frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} right)^2 + 4 cdot 3}}{2}. Taking the positive root (as a > 0) and simplifying, we find: a = frac{frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} + sqrt{12 + frac{12}{3}}}{2} = frac{frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} + sqrt{16}}{2} = frac{frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} + 4}{2} = 3. Thus: a^2 = 9, and plugging this into c^2 = a^2 - b^2, we get: 3 = 9 - b^2, which means b^2 = 6. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is: frac{x^2}{9} + frac{y^2}{6} = 1.

Define the sum and product:   Let ( S_i = sum_{j=1}^i x_j ) and ( P_i = prod_{j=1}^i x_j ). We need to find the maximum ( S_n ) such that ( S_n = P_n ).2. Express ( x_n ) in terms of ( S_{n-1} ) and ( P_{n-1} ):   Since ( S_n = P_n ), we can write:   [   x_n = frac{S_{n-1}}{P_{n-1} - 1}   ]   because ( S_n = S_{n-1} + x_n ) and ( P_n = P_{n-1} cdot x_n ).3.

This is because multiplying by ( a ) or ( b ) (which are non-zero and less than ( 2017 )) and taking modulo ( 2017 ) will map each integer ( k ) uniquely to another integer in the same set.3. Sum of the sequences:   Consider the sequence ( S_k = A_k + B_k ). Since ( A_k ) and ( B_k ) are permutations of ( {1, 2, ldots, 2016} ), the sequence ( S_k ) will take values in the range ( 2 ) to ( 4032 ) (since ( 1 + 1 = 2 ) and ( 2016 + 2016 = 4032 )).4. Counting values greater than ( 2017 ):   We need to count how many of the sums ( S_k ) are greater than ( 2017 ).

Therefore, ( (a+b)k ) modulo ( 2017 ) will also be a permutation of ( {1, 2, ldots, 2016} ).5. Distribution of sums:   For each ( k ), ( S_k ) can be written as:   [   S_k = (a+b)k pmod{2017}   ]   If ( S_k leq 2017 ), then ( S_k ) is simply ( (a+b)k ).

Testing Possible Values:   - If ( c = 0 ):     [     a = 2b     ]     Since ( a ) must be a digit in base-7, ( b ) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.     - For ( b = 3 ):       [       a = 2 times 3 = 6       ]       Thus, ( N = 6 times 49 + 3 times 7 + 0 = 294 + 21 + 0 = 315 ).   - If ( c = 2 ):     [     a = 2b + 1     ]     - For ( b = 2 ):       [       a = 2 times 2 + 1 = 5       ]       Thus, ( N = 5 times 49 + 2 times 7 + 2 = 245 + 14 + 2 = 261 ).   - If ( c = 4 ):     [     a = 2b + 2     ]     - For ( b = 2 ):       [       a = 2 times 2 + 2 = 6       ]       Thus, ( N = 6 times 49 + 2 times 7 + 4 = 294 + 14 + 4 = 312 ).   - If ( c = 6 ):     [     a = 2b + 3     ]     - For ( b = 1 ):       [       a = 2 times 1 + 3 = 5       ]       Thus, ( N = 5 times 49 + 1 times 7 + 6 = 245 + 7 + 6 = 258 ).7.

We will consider all cases in which this can be achieved.First case: all four chosen numbers are divisible by 3.Then the four numbers are chosen from the set {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}. From 5 different numbers, we can choose 4 different numbers in 5 ways (since we are choosing one that we will not take).Second case: all four chosen numbers give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.Then the four numbers are chosen from the set {1, 4, 7, 10, 13}.

Thus d=(q-1,2 m) is either 1 or 2. Therefore, (p-1)^{2} equiv 1(bmod q)This holds precisely when p-1 equiv 1(bmod q), or p-1 equiv-1(bmod q).In the first case, from (1) we get (p-1)^{m} equiv 1 equiv-1(bmod q), so q=2 and thus p equiv 2(bmod q) implies p=2.

We claim that all subsequent terms are divisible by p^{alpha+2}, and thus 1+(p-1)^{n}=p^{alpha+1}(m+p cdot K), and the second factor is indeed not divisible by p.Let k geq 2, and consider the k-th term left(n=p^{alpha} cdot mright) :binom{n}{k} p^{k}=frac{n}{k}binom{n-1}{k-1} cdot p^{k}=frac{p^{alpha+k} cdot m}{k}binom{n-1}{k-1}If p geq 3 and k geq 2, then p^{k-1}>k (this is evident by induction on k), and thus the exponent of the prime p in the denominator k is at most k-2. Since the exponent of p in the product p^{alpha+k} cdot m cdotbinom{n-1}{k-1} can only be reduced by division by k, this exponent is indeed at least alpha+k-(k-2)=alpha+2.In the second case, we have arrived at the conclusion that the prime p can only be 3, and the condition then becomesn^{2} mid 2^{n}+1It is known that this only holds for n=1 and n=3.

Consider an arbitrary triangle with vertices A, B, and C. From each vertex, draw two distinct segments to the opposite side.2. Each pair of segments from different vertices will intersect at least once inside the triangle. 3. To minimize the number of intersection points, we need to consider the optimal arrangement of these segments. 4. From vertex A, draw two segments to the opposite side. These two segments will intersect with the segments from vertex B and C.5. From vertex B, draw two segments to the opposite side. These segments will intersect with the segments from vertex A and C.6. From vertex C, draw two segments to the opposite side. These segments will intersect with the segments from vertex A and B.7. The minimum number of intersection points occurs when each new segment intersects with all previously drawn segments. This results in:   [   boxed{6}   ] Problem 61.

Since b-20 > 0, the possible values for b-20 are the divisors of 41. The divisors of 41 are 1 and 41. Therefore, we have:   [   b - 20 = 1 implies b = 21   ]   [   b - 20 = 41 implies b = 61   ]3.

Indeed, the cube has 12 edges. If the midpoints of six of them are the vertices of the section, then no more than four of the remaining six points lie in the same plane. Therefore, the two such sections have two common vertices, which lie on opposite edges of the cube. Since both sections are symmetric with respect to the center of the cube, these vertices lie on opposite edges of the cube. Consequently, the sections intersect along a segment connecting the midpoints of these edges. The length of such a segment is equal to the diagonal of a face of the cube, which is sqrt{2}.## Answer"},{"problem":"7 Given that the inverse function of f(x) is f^{-1}(x), if f^{-1}(x)=frac{x}{x+3}, then the solution set of the inequality f(x)>1 is qquad .","solution":"(7) Since f^{-1}(x)=frac{x}{x+3}, then f(x)=frac{3 x}{1-x}, so the solution set for f(x)>1 is frac{1}{4}<x<1."},{"problem":"12・17 The equation about the complex number z is 10 z^{2}-3 i z-k=0, where i^{2}=-1.

By the Lemma, ( f(m) = 404 ).     - The largest prime factor ( q ) of ( m ) must divide 403, so ( q = 13 ) or ( 31 ).     - This is impossible since ( q leq p = 5 ).   - Case III: ( p = 101 ):     - Let ( m = frac{n}{101} ).

Points M and N are (m, 0) and (0, -frac {m}{t}), respectively. Thus, the slope of line l is k_{l}= frac {1}{t}.Since the slope is positive, we have t>0. Let points P and Q be (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively.Then, overrightarrow {NP}=(x_{1}，y_{1}+ frac {m}{t}) and overrightarrow {NQ}=(x_{2}，y_{2}+ frac {m}{t}).From overrightarrow {NP}=λ overrightarrow {NQ}, we get x1=λx2 (①) and y1=μy2 (②).Multiplying equations ① and ②, we obtain x1y1=λμx2y2. Since λμ=1, we have x1y1=x2y2.This implies that (ty1+m)y1=（ty2+m）y2, which leads to (y2-y1)[m+t（y1+y2）]=0.As y1-y2≠0 (since kl>0), we have m+t（y1+y2）=0.Solving the system of equations begin{cases} x=ty+m  frac {x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1end{cases}, we get (t2+4)y2+2tmy+m2-4=0.From the problem, we know that y_{1}+y_{2}=- frac {2tm}{t^{2}+4}. Therefore, m- frac {2t^{2}m}{t^{2}+4}=0. Since m≠0, we have t2=4.As t>0, we get t=2. Consequently, the slope of line l is k_{l}= frac {1}{t}= frac {1}{2}.In conclusion, the slope of line l is a constant value, boxed{k_{l} = frac{1}{2}}."},{"problem":"A certain item has a cost price of 4 yuan and is sold at a price of 5 yuan. The merchant is planning to offer a discount on the selling price, but the profit margin must not be less than 10%. Find the maximum discount rate that can be offered.","solution":"To solve for the maximum discount rate that can be offered while maintaining a profit margin of at least 10%, we proceed as follows:1. Let x represent the discount rate (in percentage) that can be applied to the selling price of the item.2. The selling price after applying the discount is given by 5(1 - frac{x}{100}) yuan, not 5 times 0.1x as mistakenly noted in the original solution. This correction is crucial for the accuracy of the calculation.3. The profit after discount is then 5(1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 yuan.4. To ensure a profit margin of at least 10% on the cost price, the profit must be at least 4 times 10% = 0.4 yuan.5. Therefore, we set up the inequality 5(1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 geq 0.4.6. Simplifying the inequality: 5 - frac{5x}{100} - 4 geq 0.4 Rightarrow 1 - frac{5x}{100} geq 0.4.7. Further simplification gives 0.6 geq frac{5x}{100} Rightarrow 60 geq 5x Rightarrow 12 geq x.8. This implies the maximum discount rate that can be offered while maintaining at least a 10% profit margin is 12%.However, there seems to have been a misunderstanding in the original solution's calculation and interpretation of the discount rate.

Initial Consideration:   - We are given that ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with real coefficients such that ( P(a_1) = 0 ) and ( P(a_{i+1}) = a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots ), where ( {a_i}_{i=1,2,ldots} ) is an infinite sequence of distinct natural numbers.   - Clearly, ( P ) cannot be a constant polynomial because if ( P ) were constant, then ( P ) would be identically zero, and the sequence ( (a_i) ) would not consist of distinct numbers (it would be constant and equal to 0). Therefore, ( deg P geq 1 ).2. Rational Coefficients:   - Since ( P ) takes more than its degree natural values at natural arguments, it will have rational coefficients. This follows from the fact that a polynomial that takes integer values at integer points must have rational coefficients (by the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for a set of ( deg P + 1 ) natural arguments).3.

Claim: (AC = CM)   Proof 1:   - Let the midpoint of (CM) be point (N).   - Since (angle OMA = 90^circ) and (N in (AMO)), this means that (angle ONA = 90^circ).   - If (overline{AN} cap (ABC) = X), since (ON perp AN), this implies that (N) is the midpoint of (AX).   - Now (NA = NX) and (NC = NM), so (ACXM) is a parallelogram.   - Therefore, (angle CAM = angle CAX + angle XAM = angle CBX + angle CXA = angle CBX + angle CBA = angle ABX = angle AMN = angle AMC Rightarrow CA = CM).   Proof 2:   - Let (S) be the midpoint of (AC).   - Now (AMONS) is cyclic, but (SN) is a midsegment in (triangle AMC), so (SN parallel AM) and (AMNS) is cyclic.   - Therefore, (AMNS) is an isosceles trapezoid.   - Now (AS = NM Rightarrow CA = CM).2. Using the median formula:   - Let (a = BC), (b = AC = CM), (c = AB).   - The median formula is given by (m_c = frac{1}{2}sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2}).   - Since (b^2 = CM^2 = frac{1}{4}(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2)), we get:     [     b^2 = frac{1}{4}(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2) Rightarrow 4b^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2 Rightarrow 2b^2 = 2a^2 - c^2 Rightarrow c^2 = 2(a^2 - b^2)     ]     [     c^2 = 2(a - b)(a + b)     ]3. Finding integer side lengths with minimal perimeter:   - We want (a, b, c) to be positive integers with minimal sum (the perimeter of (triangle ABC)).   - If (gcd(a, b) = d > 1), then (left(frac{a}{d}, frac{b}{d}, frac{c}{d}right)) are the side lengths of a triangle which satisfies the conditions in the problem with a smaller perimeter.   - Thus, we can assume that (a, b, c) are pairwise coprime.4. Case 1: (a - b = 2s^2), (a + b = 4t^2) for positive integers (s, t):   - Then (a = s^2 + 2t^2), (b = 2t^2 - s^2), (c = 4st).   - The perimeter is (4t^2 + 4st).   - If (s = 1, t = 1), we get ((a, b, c) = (3, 1, 4)), impossible.   - If (s = 1, t = 2), then ((a, b, c) = (9, 7, 8)), so the least possible perimeter in this case is (24).5.

First, let the first digit be 2 or 6. In both cases, there are 3 possibilities for the second and third digits: 202, 242, 246, and 686, 642, 646. Notice that the third digit is also either 2 or 6. The fourth and fifth digits can then be chosen in 3 ways, and so on. Thus, after every odd-numbered digit, we have 3 possibilities for the next two digits. This is a total of 49 times (after the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ..., 97th digit). The 99th digit will again be 2 or 6, so the 100th digit can be chosen in 2 ways. This results in (3^{49} cdot 2) cases for both 2 and 6 as the starting digit. The 100-digit numbers thus written are all different, and our method leads to all 2- or 6-starting numbers that meet the problem's conditions.If the number starts with 4 or 8, it can be continued as follows: 42, 46, 86. Here, the second digit is 2 or 6, so there are 3 possibilities for the third and fourth digits, the fourth digit is 2 or 6, and so on. Thus, after each even-numbered digit (2nd, 4th, ..., 98th), the next two digits can again be 3 ways, which is (3^{49}) cases for each of the three starting digits.

Express ( z ) in exponential form:   Given ( z + frac{1}{z} = 2 cos 3^circ ), we can write ( z ) as ( z = e^{itheta} ). Therefore, ( frac{1}{z} = e^{-itheta} ).2. Simplify the given equation:   [   e^{itheta} + e^{-itheta} = 2 cos 3^circ   ]   Using Euler's formula, ( e^{itheta} + e^{-itheta} = 2 cos theta ).

Then we can write it as frac{p^{2}}{q^{2}} with p, q non-negative integers, q neq 0 and operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1. Due to the condition operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1, frac{p^{2}}{q^{2}} is the most simplified version of this fraction, so there is an integer c neq 0 such that 4 n-2=c p^{2} and n+5=c q^{2}. Now,22=4(n+5)-(4 n-2)=4 c q^{2}-c p^{2}=cleft((2 q)^{2}-p^{2}right)=c(2 q-p)(2 q+p)So c is a divisor of 22. Furthermore, 22 is divisible by 2, so the right-hand side is also divisible by 2. If there is a factor of 2 in 2 q-p, there is also a factor of 2 in 2 q+p, because these two factors differ by 2 p and that is even. Conversely, if 2 q+p is divisible by 2, then 2 q-p is also divisible by 2. But 22 contains only one factor of 2, so it cannot be that both 2 q-p and 2 q+p are divisible by 2. We conclude that 2 q-p and 2 q+p are precisely odd, and c is therefore even. Finally, p geq 0 and q geq 1, so 2 q+p geq 2, so the factor 11 from 22 must be in 2 q+p. We conclude that there are only two possibilities:- c=2,2 q+p=11,2 q-p=1;- c=-2,2 q+p=11,2 q-p=-1.In the first case, we find 2 p=11-1=10, so p=5 and q=3. This gives 4 n-2=50, so n=13.

We have two scenarios based on the information given:1. The two cars are moving towards each other, and after 2 hours, they are 20 kilometers apart. This means the sum of the distances covered by both cars plus 20 kilometers equals the initial distance between them. Therefore, we have:[50 times 2 + 40 times 2 + 20 = S.]2. Alternatively, considering the possibility of a misunderstanding in the problem's interpretation, if the two cars after meeting continue to travel for a distance that results in them being 20 kilometers apart, then the equation would be:[50 times 2 + 40 times 2 = S - 20.]Solving both equations:1.

What is the sum of these two prime numbers?","solution":"1. We start with the given condition that (5p) can be expressed in the form (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{5} rightrfloor) for some positive integer (n). This implies:   [   5p leq frac{n^2}{5} < 5p + 1   ]   Multiplying through by 5 to clear the fraction, we get:   [   25p leq n^2 < 25p + 5   ]2. Next, we consider the possible values of (n^2 mod 5). Since (n^2) can only be congruent to (0, 1,) or (4 mod 5), we analyze these cases:   - If (n^2 equiv 0 mod 5), then (n^2 = 25k) for some integer (k). This implies (n^2) is a multiple of 25, which is not possible since (25p) is not a perfect square for prime (p).   - If (n^2 equiv 1 mod 5), then (n^2 = 25p + 1).   - If (n^2 equiv 4 mod 5), then (n^2 = 25p + 4).3. We now solve for (p) in each of the valid cases:   - For (n^2 = 25p + 1):     [     n^2 - 1 = 25p implies (n-1)(n+1) = 25p     ]     Since (25p) is a product of two consecutive integers, one of them must be 25. Thus, we have:     [     n-1 = 25 quad text{or} quad n+1 = 25     ]     Solving these, we get:     [     n = 26 quad text{or} quad n = 24     ]     Substituting back, we find:     [     p = frac{26^2 - 1}{25} = frac{675}{25} = 27 quad (text{not prime})     ]     [     p = frac{24^2 - 1}{25} = frac{575}{25} = 23 quad (text{prime})     ]   - For (n^2 = 25p + 4):     [     n^2 - 4 = 25p implies (n-2)(n+2) = 25p     ]     Again, since (25p) is a product of two integers differing by 4, one of them must be 25. Thus, we have:     [     n-2 = 25 quad text{or} quad n+2 = 25     ]     Solving these, we get:     [     n = 27 quad text{or} quad n = 23     ]     Substituting back, we find:     [     p = frac{27^2 - 4}{25} = frac{725}{25} = 29 quad (text{prime})     ]     [     p = frac{23^2 - 4}{25} = frac{525}{25} = 21 quad (text{not prime})     ]4.

Maximizing ( S(pi) ):   To maximize ( S(pi) ), we need to maximize the product ((pi(1) - pi(10))(4 + pi(1) + pi(10))). The maximum difference (pi(1) - pi(10)) occurs when (pi(1) = 10) and (pi(10) = 1):   [   S(pi) = (10 - 1)(4 + 10 + 1) = 9 cdot 15 = 135   ]5. Counting Permutations:   To achieve the maximum value ( S(pi) = 135 ), (pi(1)) must be 10 and (pi(10)) must be 1.

Let the five numbers be ( a, b, c, d, e ). We need to find the numbers such that their sum equals their product:   [   a + b + c + d + e = a cdot b cdot c cdot d cdot e   ]2.

Everyone wants to buy one ticket. What fraction of the possible line-ups allow the cashier to sell the tickets without running out of change?","solution":"I. solution. There is no deadlock if, no matter how long we look at the queue, at least as many people are waiting with 100 forints as with 200 forints.Let's denote the former by s and the latter by k, and calculate how many permutations of four s and four k letters do not result in a deadlock. In a good order, the first person must pay with a 100 forint note, and the last with a 200 forint note, so any good order is of the form s k.Let's group the good orders according to the position of the first viewer who wants to pay with 200 forints. If this is K, then 2 leq K leq 5.(i) K=5. There is only one such order: s s s k k k k, and this is clearly good.(ii) K=4: s s k{ }^{k} ldots ldots ldots. By writing the fourth s letter in any of the three possible positions, we get a good order, so in this case, we get 3 good orders.(iii) K=3: s s k-— — — k. The remaining two s letters can be written in binom{4}{2}=6 ways into two of the four free positions. Out of these 6 orders, only 1 is not good, the one where the two s letters are in the last two free positions. In this case, we get 5 good orders.(iv) K=2: s k qquad k. The third position can only be filled with an s letter, otherwise, the queue would get stuck: s k s k. This essentially leads us to the previous case, and we get another 5 good orders.Having examined all possibilities, we have found 14 good orders. Since we can choose the four positions for the s letters out of 8 in binom{8}{4}=70 ways, the cashier can issue the tickets without deadlock in frac{14}{70}=frac{1}{5} of all orders.II. solution. Using the notation from the previous solution, we now count the \\"bad\\" orders. A deadlock occurs when an equal number of s and k letters appear before the deadlock, and a k letter stands at the deadlock position. The deadlock itself thus occurred at the (2 m+1)-th position (m=1,2,3,4).Now let's modify such sequences as follows: if the deadlock occurs at the (2 m+1)-th position, then we swap the s letters for k letters and the k letters for s letters in the first (2 m+1) positions. We do not change the letters in the positions after the deadlock.s s k k kleft|_rightarrow quad k k s s sright|qquadThis way, we get a sequence consisting of 5 s and 3 k letters. Conversely, if we consider a (5 s, 3 k) sequence, we can uniquely obtain a bad sequence from it: since there are more s than k, there will be a first position where the s letters outnumber the k letters, and this will occur at some odd position. Swapping s leftrightarrow k up to this position, we get a bad sequence.The number of bad sequences is thus binom{8}{3}=56, and the number of good sequences is binom{8}{4}-56=14.Based on the work of Csötönyi Nóra (Bonyhád, Petőfi S. Gimn., 10. o.t.)Remarks. 1. The above counting can also be given a geometric interpretation: each sequence can be represented by a broken line starting from the origin: for an s letter, we step forward by the mathbf{f}(1,1) vector, and for a k letter, by the mathbf{l}(1,-1) vector.Thus, we get broken lines starting from the origin and ending at the (8 ; 0) point. A path is bad if it touches or crosses the y=-1 line. For the \\"bad\\" broken lines, perform the mathbf{f} leftrightarrow mathbf{l} swap up to the first intersection point with the y=-1 line, and we get a path starting from the origin and ending at the (8,2) point. There are binom{8}{3} such paths.2. Another, more intuitive way to execute the above \\"reflection\\" and the corresponding counting is as follows:Reflect the part of a bad path (0,0) rightarrow(8 ; 0) after its first intersection with the y=-1 line over the y=-1 line. This way, we get a path starting from (0,0) and ending at (8,-2), consisting of (3 s, 5 k). Conversely, any such path clearly intersects the y=-1 line; reflecting the part of the path after the first intersection point, we get a bad sequence.Thus, the number of bad sequences is binom{8}{3}.3. By any of the above methods, we find that if 2 n customers are waiting in front of the cashier, with half of them having 100 forints and the other half 200 forints, then the total number of orders is binom{2 n}{n}, and the number of bad ones is binom{2 n}{n-1}.In this case, the cashier can issue the tickets without deadlock in frac{binom{2 n}{n}-binom{2 n}{n-1}}{binom{2 n}{n}}=frac{1}{n+1} of all orders.Using the reflection method, we can also get an answer to the question of the problem if the number of people waiting with 100 forints and 200 forints is different. If n viewers are waiting with 100 forints and m with 200 forints (n geq m), then we similarly find (Fig. 3) that the number of bad orders is binom{n+m}{m-1}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_69853f92c6134195fcb5g-2.jpg?height=952&width=1216&top_left_y=126&top_left_x=454)"},{"problem":"Which of the following operations is incorrect?A: -48div 2^{3}=-6B: (4+5)^{2}=4^{2}+5^{2}C: (-3)^{2}÷(-4^{3})=-frac{9}{64}D: -3times 2^{2}-(-3times 2^{2})=0","solution":"To analyze each operation step-by-step:A: -48div 2^{3}=-6First, calculate the exponent:2^{3} = 8Then, divide:-48 div 8 = -6This shows that option A is correct.B: (4+5)^{2}=4^{2}+5^{2}First, perform the addition inside the parentheses:4 + 5 = 9Then, square the result:9^{2} = 81However, calculating the right side:4^{2} + 5^{2} = 16 + 25 = 41Since 81 neq 41, option B is incorrect.C: (-3)^{2}div (-4^{3})=-frac{9}{64}First, square -3:(-3)^{2} = 9Then, calculate -4^{3}:-4^{3} = -64Finally, divide:frac{9}{-64} = -frac{9}{64}This shows that option C is correct.D: -3times 2^{2}-(-3times 2^{2})=0First, calculate the exponent:2^{2} = 4Then, multiply by -3:-3 times 4 = -12Subtracting the negative of the same value:-12 - (-12) = 0This shows that option D is correct.Therefore, the incorrect operation is:boxed{B}"},{"problem":"6.

Case 1: ( A geq 2 )   - Observation: If ( x_i ) is negative, then ( x_{i+1} = A - frac{1}{x_i} ) will be positive because ( A geq 2 ) and ( -frac{1}{x_i} ) is positive and less than 1 in magnitude. Therefore, ( x_{i+1} ) will be greater than ( A - 1 geq 1 ), ensuring it is positive.   - Subcase 1.1: ( x_1 geq A )     If ( x_1 geq A ), then:     [     x_2 = A - frac{1}{x_1} leq A - frac{1}{A} leq A - frac{1}{2} leq 2 - frac{1}{2} = 1.5     ]     Since ( x_1 geq A geq 2 ), ( x_2 ) will be positive and less than or equal to ( 1.5 ).     - Inductive Argument: If ( x_n geq 1 ), then ( x_{n+1} = A - frac{1}{x_n} geq A - 1 geq 1 ). Thus, ( x_n ) will never be less than 1, ensuring all terms are positive.   - Subcase 1.2: ( x_1 < 1 )     If ( x_1 < 1 ), then:     [     x_2 = A - frac{1}{x_1} > A - 1 geq 1     ]     This means ( x_2 ) will be positive and greater than or equal to 1, leading us back to the situation in Subcase 1.1.2. Case 2: ( 0 leq A < 2 )   - Choose ( x_1 = 1 ). Then:     [     x_2 = A - 1     ]     If ( A < 1 ), ( x_2 ) will be negative. If ( A geq 1 ), ( x_2 ) will be non-negative but less than 1.   - If ( x_2 ) is negative, then ( x_3 = A - frac{1}{x_2} ) will be positive and greater than ( A ). However, since ( A < 2 ), ( x_3 ) will be less than 2.   - The sequence will oscillate between positive and negative values, ensuring infinitely many negative terms.3. Case 3: ( A < 0 )   - If ( A < 0 ), choose ( x_1 = 1 ). Then:     [     x_2 = A - 1 < 0     ]     This means ( x_2 ) is negative. The sequence will continue to oscillate between positive and negative values, ensuring infinitely many negative terms.From the above analysis, we conclude that the only values of ( A ) for which the sequence has only finitely many negative terms are those where ( A geq 2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ A geq 2 } )"},{"problem":"For real numbers m and n, the operation \\"otimes\\" is defined as follows: motimes n=m^{2}-2mn.

The axis of symmetry of the parabola is given by x = -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{-4}{2(1)} = 2. The vertex of the parabola, located at this axis of symmetry, is (2,0).Given that 1 < x_1 < 2 and 3 < x_2 < 4, and knowing the shape and symmetry of the parabola, we can conclude that for values of x between 1 and 2, and between 3 and 4, the function values increase as we move away from the vertex.

Let us agree to denote the number at the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column of the table by a_{ij}; in this case a_{ij} = 1, ldots, n^2, where i, j = 1, ldots, n. Let now 1 = a_{ji}; then according to the problem's condition, 2 = a_{j_2 j_2}, quad 3 = a_{j_3 j_4}, and so on, up to n^2 = a_{j_{n^2} j_{n^2}+1}. Of course, the numbers l_1, dot{j}_2, j_3, ldots, j_{n^2}+1 are not all distinct: they can only take n different values 1, 2, ldots, n. Note that each specific value k appears in the sequence of numbers j_1, j_2, j_2, j_3, j_3, ldots, j_{n^2}, j_{n^2}, j_{n^2}+1 exactly 2n times, since our table contains n numbers in the k-th row and n numbers in the k-th column. Since each number repeats twice \\"inside\\" the chain j_1, j_2, j_2, j_3, ldots, i_{n^2}, i_{n^2}+1 (i.e., not in the first or last position), it follows from the fact that the value j_1 must appear in the chain an even number of 2n times thatI_{n^2+1} = j_1 - our chain must necessarily end with the same number j_{mathrm{f}} with which it began.Thus, the problem requires us to estimate the difference between the sum of the numbers in the j_1-th row of the table and the sum of the numbers in the j_1-th column, the number of which coincides with the number of the row under consideration. But, due to the rule of forming the table, if a_{j j_1} = s (where j neq j_{n^2} and, consequently, the pair (j, j_1) is not the last in our chain, i.e., s neq n^2), then s+1 = a_{j_1 j_2}; in other words, each number in the j_1-th column, except for n^2, corresponds to a number s+1 in the j_1-th row. In this case, the numbers s+1 = a_{j_1 y_2} obtained in this way are all the numbers in the j_1-th row, except for the single number 1 (which, obviously, cannot follow any number in the d_1-th column, since it is the smallest in the table); therefore, if we denote the numbers in the j_1-th column, except for n^2, by s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{n-1}, then the numbers in the j_1-th row, except for 1, will be s_1+1, s_2+1, ldots, s_{n-1}+1. And from this it follows that the difference between the sum of the numbers in the j-th column and the sum of the numbers in the j-th row will be equal to:begin{aligned}& left(s_1 + s_2 + ldots + s_{n-1} + n^2right) - & quad - left[left(s_1 + 1right) + left(s_2 + 1right) + ldots + left(s_{n-1} + 1right) + 1right] = n^2 - nend{aligned}"},{"problem":". Find all integers a, b, c satisfying 1<a<b<c such that (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) divides a b c-1.","solution":". This is another type of exercise, where the fundamental remark is that if a, b, c are \\"large,\\" then (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) is too close to a b c-1 to be a divisor of it.It is clear that (a-1)(b-1)(c-1)<(a-1) b c=a b c-b c<a b c-1. On the other hand, if (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) geqslant frac{a b c}{2}, then frac{a b c-1}{(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)}<2 cannot be an integer, as there is no integer strictly between 1 and 2. The function frac{x-1}{x}=1-frac{1}{x} is increasing and tends to 1 as x grows to infinity. In particular, since 1<a<b<c, which implies a geqslant 2, b geqslant a+1, c geqslant b+1 geqslant a+2, frac{b-1}{b} geqslant frac{a}{a+1}, frac{c-1}{c} geqslant frac{a+1}{a+2}, so that frac{(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)}{a b c} geqslant frac{a-1}{a+2}.The quotient q=frac{a b c-1}{(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)} therefore satisfies:if a=2,1<q<frac{a+2}{a-1}=4, so q=2 or q=3,(B) if a=3,1<q<frac{a+2}{a-1}=5 / 2, so q=2,(C) if a geqslant 4,1<q<frac{a+2}{a-1} leqslant 2 since the function frac{x+2}{x-1}=1+frac{3}{x-1} is decreasing.The only possible solutions are therefore for a=2 or a=3.For a=2, we are reduced to seeing when frac{2 b c-1}{(b-1)(c-1)} is 2 or 3. Since the numerator is odd, the quotient q cannot be 2, and the equation 2 b c-1=3(b-1)(c-1) expands to b c-3 b-3 c+4=0, or (b-3)(c-3)=5. Since b<c, the only solutions are b=4 and c=8. We verify that 3 times 7=21 divides (2 times 4 times 8)-1=63.For a=3, we similarly reduce to 3 b c-1=4(b-1)(c-1), since q=2 so q(a-1)=4, or b c-4 b-4 c+5=0, or (b-4)(c-4)=11, hence b=5 and c=15, which provides the last solution (3,5,15). Indeed, 2 times 4 times 14=112 divides (3 times 5 times 15)-1=224.The problem therefore has two solutions: (2,4,8) and (3,5,15).Solution to Exercise 100.

These fields must be covered by 1 times 1 rectangles. Thus, l geq (n-k)^2.We have (k-n+1)^2 geq 0, so k^2 + n^2 + 1 - 2kn + 2k - 2n geq 0, and thus n^2 - 2kn + k^2 geq 2n - 2k - 1. We conclude that l geq (n-k)^2 geq 2n - 2k - 1, which is exactly what we wanted to prove. Therefore, in all cases, N geq 2n-1, and this proves that the minimal value of N is 2n-1."},{"problem":"29.30.

The intersection of the cylinders is described by the inequalities x^{2}+z^{2} leqslant R and y^{2}+z^{2} leqslant R. Its section by the plane z=z_{0} is described by the inequalities x_{0} leqslant R^{2}-z_{0}^{2} and y_{0} leqslant R^{2}-z_{0}^{2}. Thus, the section is a square with side 2 sqrt{R^{2}-z_{0}^{2}}.

Since the first encountered cyclist can with equal probability turn out to be any of the 10000 cyclists in the city, the total number of equally probable outcomes of the experiment here is 10000. It remains to calculate the number of \\"favorable outcomes,\\" i.e., the number of numbers that do not contain the digit 8. This number can be determined using the following method. We will conditionally prepend several zeros to all numbers containing fewer than four digits so that they become four-digit numbers (for example, instead of the number 26, we will write 0026), and replace the number 10000 with the number 0000. In this case, the number of numbers not containing the digit 8 will obviously remain the same. But now the numbers 0000, 0001, 0002, ldots, 9999 represent all possible four-digit numbers, where, in particular, a zero or several zeros can stand in the first place. If such a number does not contain the digit 8, then the first place can be occupied by any of the nine digits 0,1,2, ldots, 7,9; similarly, the second, third, and fourth places can be occupied by any of these nine digits. Combining nine possible values of the first digit with nine values of the second, third, and fourth digits, we will obviously get a total of 9^{4} four-digit numbers that do not contain the digit 8 (see the solution to problem 9).Thus, out of 10000 equally probable outcomes (meeting any of the cyclists), 9^{4} outcomes will be favorable for us, from which it follows that the desired probability is frac{9^{4}}{10000}=(0.9)^{4}=0.6561."},{"problem":"Find all reals  k such that\\r[ a^3 plus{} b^3 plus{} c^3 plus{} d^3 plus{} 1geq k(a plus{} b plus{} c plus{} d)\\r]\\rholds for all  a,b,c,dgeq minus{} 1.\\r\\r[i]Edited by orl.[/i]","solution":"To find all reals ( k ) such that [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 + 1 geq k(a + b + c + d) ]holds for all ( a, b, c, d geq -1 ), we need to analyze the inequality under different conditions.1.

Substituting x_1 = -3, y_1 = f(-3) = 3, and m = f'(-3) = -4, we get:   [   y - 3 = -4(x + 3).   ]   Simplifying this equation gives us:   [   y = -4(x + 3) + 3 = -4x - 12 + 3 = -4x - 9.   ]Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at the point (-3, f(-3)) on the curve y = f(x) is boxed{y = -4x - 9}."},{"problem":"9.

Suppose the cards (from top to bottom) are initially arranged as follows: first all the odd-numbered cards (in any order), followed by the even-numbered cards, with the top card being 2n. Then the first k moves are uniquely determined - the odd-numbered cards are moved to free positions; the next move, if n > k, is impossible, and if n = k, the only move is to place card 2n-1 back into the original stack, which is meaningless because we return to the previous position. Therefore, this stack cannot be moved.Now, let's show how the process of moving can be organized when n < k.We will divide all the cards into pairs (1,2), (2n-1,2n) and assign each pair to an unoccupied cell (at least one cell is not assigned to any pair; let's call it a free cell).Now, we will try to place each card from the top of the red cell into its assigned cell. This may not be possible only if the card has the number 2i, and the card 2i-1 is already in the cell; in this case, we can move the card 2i to the free cell, place the card 2i-1 on top, assign this cell to our pair, and call the previously assigned cell free. Thus, in the end, we will have the cards arranged in cells by pairs.

Given Data and Initial Setup:   - Triangle (ABC) with (AB = AC = 20) and (BC = 15).   - Point (D) in (triangle ABC) such that (triangle ADB sim triangle BDC).   - Line (l) through (A) intersects (BD) and (CD) at (P) and (Q), respectively.   - Circumcircles of (triangle BDQ) and (triangle CDP) intersect at (X).2. Similarity and Tangency:   - From (triangle ADB sim triangle BDC), we have (angle ADB = angle BDC) and (angle ABD = angle BCD).   - This implies that the circumcircle of (triangle BDC) is tangent to (AB) and (AC).3. Pascal's Theorem Application:   - Let (BQ) intersect the circumcircle of (triangle BDC) at (R).   - By Pascal's theorem on hexagon (RBBDCC), the intersection of (BD) and (RC) lies on line (QA).   - Since (BD cap QA = P), it follows that (R, C, P) are collinear, implying (R = BQ cap CP) lies on the circumcircle of (triangle BDC).4. Miquel Point and Orthogonality:   - Let (O) be the center of the circumcircle of (triangle BDC).   - (X) is the Miquel point of cyclic quadrilateral (RBDC), so (X) lies on (PQ) and (OX perp PQ).   - Since (OX perp XA) and (AO) is a diameter of the circumcircle of (triangle ABC), (X) lies on the circumcircle of (triangle ABC).5. Locus of (X):   - The locus of (X) as (l) varies is the circumcircle of (triangle ABC).6.

The slope of the given tangent line 7x-4y-12=0 is dfrac{7}{4}. We'll use this information:Since f(x) = ax-dfrac{b}{x}, the derivative f'(x) = a+dfrac{b}{x^2}. Therefore, f'(2) = a+dfrac{b}{4}= dfrac{7}{4}.To find the actual values of a and b, we need a second equation.

Now, setting x=0, we find the y-coordinate of the intersection with the y-axis (line x=0):y = -dfrac{3}{x_0} - dfrac{3}{x_0} = -dfrac{6}{x_0}, giving the point (0,-dfrac{6}{x_0}).Setting y=x for the intersection with the line y=x, we solve the equation:x = x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0} + x - x_0 implies x = 2x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0}.Since y=x, we have y= 2x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0}, which simplifies to (x_0 - dfrac{3}{x_0}) + x_0 = 2x_0, thus confirming the intersection point (2x_0, 2x_0).The area of the triangle formed by these points and the origin can now be found using the formula for the area of a triangle:Area = dfrac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}.Here, the base is the x-coordinate of the intersection with y=x, which is 2x_0, and the height is the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the intersection with the y-axis, which is left| -dfrac{6}{x_0} right|. Therefore, the area is:Area = dfrac{1}{2} times 2x_0 times left| -dfrac{6}{x_0} right| = boxed{6} (because the x_0 terms cancel out).Thus, the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line at any point on the curve y=f(x) and the lines x=0 and y=x has a constant value of 6."},{"problem":"Given that the point (a, b) is outside the circle x^2+y^2=r^2, the positional relationship between the line ax+by=r^2 and the circle is (　　)  A: Separate  B: Tangent  C: Intersect but not through the center  D: Intersect and pass through the center","solution":"Since the point (a, b) is outside the circle x^2+y^2=r^2,  we have a^2+b^2 > r^2.

Vector Representation:   - First, we find the vectors overrightarrow{OA} and overrightarrow{OH} based on the given points O, A, and the definition of H.   - Given: O(0,0,0), A(-1,1,0), and B(0,1,1).   - Thus, overrightarrow{OA} = A - O = (-1,1,0) and overrightarrow{OH} = H - O = (x,y,z).2. Parallel Vectors:   - Since H lies on the line OA, and BH perp OA, by vector properties, overrightarrow{OH} parallel overrightarrow{OA}.   - This implies there exists a scalar lambda such that overrightarrow{OH} = lambda overrightarrow{OA}.   - Hence, (x,y,z) = lambda(-1,1,0) = (-lambda, lambda, 0).3. Perpendicular Condition:   - The condition BH perp OA translates to overrightarrow{BH} cdot overrightarrow{OA} = 0.   - We find overrightarrow{BH} = H - B = (-lambda, lambda - 1, -1).   - The dot product overrightarrow{BH} cdot overrightarrow{OA} = (-lambda) cdot (-1) + (lambda - 1) cdot 1 + (-1) cdot 0 = lambda + lambda - 1.4.

What is the maximum value of N? Find the number of all possible different types of such families for the maximum N. Two families of subsets have different types if one cannot be obtained from the other by permuting the elements of X.","solution":"Answer. The maximum N is 25, and there exist two different types of families of 25 subsets that satisfy the condition of the problem.Solution. Consider an arbitrary family of N distinct non-empty subsets such that each element of the set X is contained in exactly two subsets of this family. If there are x one-element subsets, then the total sum mathrm{S} of the cardinalities of the subsets in this family is at least x + 2(N - x) = 2N - x. On the other hand, each element of the set X is contained in exactly two subsets of this family, so mathrm{S} = 34, which means mathrm{N} does not exceed (34 + x) / 2. Finally, the number of one-element subsets x does not exceed the number of elements in X, which is 17, so N does not exceed 25. Note that for N = 25, the number of one-element subsets in the family can be 16 or 17.1) If x = 17, then the remaining 8 \\"large\\" subsets must be two- or more-element subsets. If there are y two-element subsets among them, then the total number of elements in the 8 large subsets is 17 and is at least 2y + 3(8 - y) = 24 - y, so y is at least 7. If it is greater than 7, then the three- and more-element subsets in total would contain one element, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is 7 pairwise disjoint two-element subsets and one three-element subset. Together with the 17 one-element subsets, they form the first example of the family of subsets sought in the problem. An example of a family of this type: 17 one-element subsets {1}, {2}, ldots, {17}, 7 two-element subsets {1, 2}, {3, 4}, ldots, {13, 14}, and one three-element subset {15, 16, 17}.2) If x = 16, then the remaining 9 subsets must be two- or more-element subsets. If there are y two-element subsets among them, then the total number of elements in the 9 large subsets is 18 and is at least 2y + 3(9 - y) = 27 - y, so y is at least 9.

In total, they contain 18 elements, so two of them intersect at one element (which does not lie in any one-element subset), while the rest are pairwise disjoint.

To fully justify the answer, in this problem (as in the analysis of any game situation), two statements need to be proven: 1) no matter how the second player plays, the first can achieve no less than 32; 2) no matter how the first player plays, the second can lose no more than 32. To prove statement 1), we will indicate a strategy for the first player that guarantees, regardless of the second player's moves, that the difference between the two remaining numbers will be no less than 32. This strategy is described very simply: at each move, cross out every other number, that is, cross out the second, fourth, sixth, ... number from the remaining ones (we assume that the numbers are arranged in ascending order). Then after the 1st move, the difference between any adjacent remaining numbers will be no less than 2, after the 2nd move - no less than 4, after the 3rd move - no less than 8, after the 4th move - no less than 16, and after the 5th move - no less than 32. To prove statement 2), it is sufficient to indicate a strategy for the second player that will allow him, regardless of the first player's moves, to lose no more than 32. It consists of the following. On the first move, he crosses out all numbers less than 512 or all numbers greater than 512 (it is clear that either of these sets will not exceed 256). After this, the difference between the extreme remaining numbers will be no more than 512. Similarly, on the second move, he can ensure that all remaining numbers are in one of the segments [0,256]; [256,512]; [512,768]; [768,1024], that is, reduce the difference between the extreme numbers to at least 256. In the same way, on the 3rd move, he can reduce this difference to 128, on the 4th move - to 64, and on the 5th move - to 32. Of course, similarly, it could be proven that if the game consists of n moves and starts with the numbers 0,1,2, ldots, 2^{2 n}, then the \\"price of the game\\" is 2^{mathrm{n}}.

For a good distribution, the fourth can only receive e).If we start the II. examination with the distribution of the e) type four-card set and examine the number of aces and jacks, we arrive at the same result. Neither the d) nor the e) type four-card set can appear in more distributions.Finally, if we start with the a) type four-card set and distribute four of them, we get a good distribution. Thus, the four possible distributions are:text { 1. cabe, } quad text { 2. ddee, } quad text { 3. daae, } quad text { 4. aaaa. }Naturally, a different distribution is counted if the four cards are exchanged among the four players.

This results in 2304 cases in total.In the 2nd case, the first player can receive cards in binom{4}{2}binom{4}{2} ways, the second in binom{2}{2}binom{2}{2} ways, the third in binom{4}{2} binom{4}{2} ways, and the fourth player's cards are given. This results in 1296 cases in total.In the 3rd case, similarly, 4^{4} cdot 3^{4}=20736 different distributions exist, and in the 4th case, 4^{4} cdot 3^{4} cdot 2^{4} cdot 1^{4}=331776.Including the exchange of cards among the players, in total 24 cdot 2304 + 6 cdot 1296 + 12 cdot 20736 + 1 cdot 331776 = 643680 different distributions satisfy the requirements described in the problem.

Case Analysis:   - Case 1: ( 2n-1 ) is not divisible by 3:     - In this case, the graph consists of a single cycle of length ( 2n-1 ).     - The maximum size of an independent set in a cycle of length ( 2n-1 ) is ( leftlfloor frac{2n-1}{2} rightrfloor = n-1 ).     - Therefore, if we color ( n ) vertices, there must be at least one pair of consecutive black vertices, ensuring that the coloring is \\"good.\\"   - Case 2: ( 2n-1 ) is divisible by 3:     - In this case, the graph is the union of 3 disjoint cycles, each of length ( frac{2n-1}{3} ).     - The maximum size of an independent set in each cycle of length ( frac{2n-1}{3} ) is ( leftlfloor frac{frac{2n-1}{3}}{2} rightrfloor = frac{2n-1}{6} ).     - Therefore, the total maximum size of an independent set in the entire graph is ( 3 times frac{2n-1}{6} = frac{2n-1}{2} = n-1 ).     - Thus, if we color ( n ) vertices, there must be at least one pair of consecutive black vertices in at least one of the cycles, ensuring that the coloring is \\"good.\\"5. Conclusion:   - In both cases, the smallest value of ( k ) such that every coloring of ( k ) points is \\"good\\" is ( k = n ).The final answer is ( boxed{n} )."},{"problem":"102. Deck of Cards.

Determine the ratio of the angles: frac{widehat{BAC}}{widehat{CAA}}","solution":"![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_732985225e470d5c7305g-019.jpg?height=455&width=564&top_left_y=1667&top_left_x=756)To take advantage of the relationship of the hypothesis with a sum of lengths, the three points must be collinear. We will therefore consider a point ( J ) on ( (CA) ) such that ( AI = AJ ), with ( A ) between ( C ) and ( J ), so that ( CJ = CB ). Let's call ( alpha ) the angle ( widehat{AJI} ). Since triangle ( AJI ) is isosceles, ( widehat{AIJ} = alpha ), so ( widehat{IAC} = 2alpha ), which implies ( widehat{BAC} = 4alpha ), since ( (AI) ) is the bisector of ( widehat{BAC} ). Moreover, ( CJ = CA + AJ = CA + AI = BC ), so triangles ( JCI ) and ( BCI ) are congruent: two equal sides and the angles between these two sides are equal, since ( (CI) ) is the bisector of ( widehat{BCA} ). Therefore, ( widehat{IBC} = widehat{IJC} = alpha ), and since ( (BI) ) is the bisector of ( widehat{CBA} ), ( widehat{CBA} = 2alpha ), which implies ( frac{widehat{BAC}}{widehat{CBA}} = 2 ).## - Inscribed Angle -The concept of an inscribed angle is a particularly important case of using angles. Let ( A, B, C ) be three points on a circle with center ( O ). The inscribed angle ( widehat{BAC} ), which intercepts the arc ( BC ), is half the measure of the central angle ( widehat{BOC} ). Indeed, extend ( (AO) ), which intersects the circle at ( D ). In triangle ( AOC ), the exterior angle ( widehat{DOC} ) is equal to the sum of the base angles, ( widehat{OAC} + widehat{ACO} ), but these angles are equal because triangle ( AOC ) is isosceles. Therefore, ( widehat{DOC} = 2 times widehat{OAC} ), and similarly, ( widehat{BOD} = 2 times widehat{BAD} ). Depending on the configuration, the central angle ( widehat{BOC} ) is the sum or the difference of the central angles ( widehat{DOC} ) and ( widehat{BOD} ), but in both cases, it is twice the measure of the inscribed angle ( widehat{BAC} ).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_732985225e470d5c7305g-020.jpg?height=676&width=1590&top_left_y=1022&top_left_x=232)It follows essentially that if points ( B ) and ( C ) are fixed, the inscribed angle ( widehat{BAC} ) will always have the same measure, regardless of the position of point ( A ). Provided that when ( A ) crosses the chord ( BC ), the inscribed angle is transformed into its supplementary angle, and the central angle becomes the reflex angle equal to twice the supplementary angle. This equality of inscribed angles is used in both directions: on the one hand, if ( A, B, C, D ) are on the same circle, with ( A ) and ( D ) on the same side of ( (BC) ), the angles ( widehat{BAC} ) and ( widehat{BDC} ) are equal; on the other hand, conversely, if ( A, B, C, D ) are four points (with ( A ) and ( D ) on the same side of ( (BC) )) such that ( widehat{BAC} = widehat{BDC} ), then the four points ( A, B, C, D ) are concyclic, i.e., on the same circle. It is common to use the theorem in both directions, on the one hand to prove that four points are concyclic, and on the other hand to conclude that other angles, not initially known, are equal."},{"problem":"582.

Question: For what value of a is l(a) maximized? Find this maximum l(a).---The function f(x) = ax^2 + 8x + 3 is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient a, meaning it opens downwards. We need to find the maximum positive number l(a) such that |f(x)| leq 5 for all x in the interval [0, l(a)].First, we need to determine the points where f(x) = 5 and f(x) = -5. These points will help us find the interval where |f(x)| leq 5.1. Solve f(x) = 5:   [   ax^2 + 8x + 3 = 5 implies ax^2 + 8x - 2 = 0   ]   Using the quadratic formula x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, we get:   [   x = frac{-8 pm sqrt{64 + 8a}}{2a} = frac{-8 pm sqrt{64 + 8a}}{2a}   ]   Let the roots be x_1 and x_2.2.

We need to find the value of a that maximizes the length of this interval.The length of the interval is given by the difference between the largest and smallest roots. For the interval to be maximized, the roots should be as far apart as possible. This occurs when the discriminants of the quadratic equations are maximized.For the equation ax^2 + 8x - 2 = 0, the discriminant is:[Delta_1 = 64 + 8a]For the equation ax^2 + 8x + 8 = 0, the discriminant is:[Delta_2 = 64 - 32a]To maximize the interval, we need to balance these discriminants. The maximum interval length occurs when the roots of the two equations are symmetric around the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of the parabola f(x) = ax^2 + 8x + 3 is at:[x = -frac{8}{2a} = -frac{4}{a}]For the interval to be symmetric around the vertex, the roots of the equations should be equidistant from the vertex.

For each of the 6 positions, choose a code that differs from K only in that position. The corresponding digit in the chosen code will be called bad. Suppose Bender is unlucky, and on the first check of a non-Koreiko code, he gets the chosen code, but does not check the bad digit (there are four unchecked positions, so a code with a bad digit in one of these positions could have been selected). Suppose the same happens on the second and third checks of non-Koreiko codes (there are four unchecked positions, and of the four chosen codes with bad digits in these positions, no more than two have been previously checked, so such a code could have been selected). When all codes have been checked, we will see which N<3 positions have been checked in code K. Among the four unchecked positions, at least one coincides with the position of the bad digit in one of the three checked chosen codes - code L.

We define the centre of a unit square as the intersection of its diagonals.Find the smallest integer m such that, choosing any m unit squares in the grid, we always get four unit squares among them whose centres are vertices of a parallelogram.","solution":"1. Initial Assumption and Counterexample for ( m = 2n - 1 ):   - We need to show that ( m = 2n - 1 ) is not sufficient. Consider choosing all the unit squares in the first row and one additional square from the diagonal. This results in ( 2n - 1 ) squares.   - The centers of these squares lie on two lines: the first row and the diagonal. Since these lines are not parallel, no four centers can form a parallelogram. Hence, ( m = 2n - 1 ) is not sufficient.2. Using the Pigeonhole Principle for ( m = 2n ):   - We will show that ( m = 2n ) is sufficient using the pigeonhole principle.   - Place the grid in a coordinate plane such that the center of the bottom-left square is at ((0,0)) and each square has a side length of 1.   - The center of a square at position ((i, j)) in the grid has coordinates ((i + 0.5, j + 0.5)).3. Counting Vectors:   - Consider the vectors formed by the centers of any two chosen squares. The vector between the centers of squares at ((i_1, j_1)) and ((i_2, j_2)) is:     [     vec{v} = ((i_2 + 0.5) - (i_1 + 0.5), (j_2 + 0.5) - (j_1 + 0.5)) = (i_2 - i_1, j_2 - j_1)     ]   - The coefficients (i_2 - i_1) and (j_2 - j_1) can each range from (-(n-1)) to (n-1), giving (2n - 1) possible values for each coefficient.   - Therefore, there are ((2n - 1)^2) possible distinct vectors.4. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:   - If we choose (2n) points, the number of vectors formed by these points is:     [     binom{2n}{2} = frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = 2n^2 - n     ]   - By the pigeonhole principle, since (2n^2 - n > (2n - 1)^2) for (n geq 2), there must be at least one vector that is repeated.5. Ensuring Non-Collinearity:   - The repeated vector implies that there are at least two pairs of points with the same vector difference, meaning they form a parallelogram.   - Since the number of vectors defined by (2n) points is greater than the number of distinct vectors, there must be at least one set of four points forming a parallelogram.Conclusion:Thus, the smallest integer ( m ) such that any ( m ) unit squares in the grid always contain four unit squares whose centers form a parallelogram is ( m = 2n ).The final answer is ( boxed{2n} )."},{"problem":"9.

Therefore, the relationship between the sides can be expressed as:[a^{2} + c^{2} = b^{2}]This equation is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, where a and c are the lengths of the legs, and b is the length of the hypotenuse.

(Note that the thousands and tens digits must be the same.)For 5 a b a 5 to be as large as possible, we start with a=b=9.This gives 59995 which is not divisible by 15 .

First, let us show that for any integer n, there exists a factorization n=r s such that f(n)=r+s and f(2 n)=2 r+s. To do this, we exploit the functional equation with m=1. It provides a quadratic equation in f(2 n) whose discriminant is Delta=f(n)^{2}-4 n. This must be an integer, i.e., there exists an integer a such that f(n)^{2}-4 n=a^{2}. We then have (f(n)+a)(f(n)-a)=4 n. The two factors must be even, since their product is 4 n and their sum is 2 f(n). We set f(n)+a=2 r and f(n)-a=2 s for integers r and s. We then have f(n)=r+s and r s=n. Finally, solving the quadratic equation gives the two solutions f(2 n)=2 r+s or f(2 n)=2 s+r, and by swapping the roles of r and s if necessary, we can retain only the first.Now, let us apply the previous result without reservation. For n=1, we necessarily have r=s=1, and thus f(1)=2, f(2)=3. Also, if n=p is a prime number, we must have r=1, s=p or r=p, s=1. In both cases, f(p)=r+s=p+1. Now let n be an odd number. According to Bertrand's postulate, there exists a prime number p between frac{n}{2} and n, and from the case we just treated, f(p)=p+1. The increasing nature of f then implies f(n) geqslant f(p)=p+1 geqslant frac{n}{2}+1. Consider a factorization n=r s for which f(n)=r+s. If neither of the divisors r and s is 1, they are both at least 3 (since n is assumed to be odd), hence f(n)=r+s leqslant frac{n}{3}+3, which contradicts the other estimate as soon as n>12. Thus, for any odd number n>12, we also have f(n)=n+1. The only odd number that escapes the generic methods above is n=9, which can be easily handled manually: the two possible factorizations n=r s are 9=9 times 1 and 9=3 times 3, but in the second case, we would have f(9)=6, which contradicts the increasing nature of f given that f(7)=8; thus f(9)=10. It only remains to treat the case of even numbers. For this, we show that if f(n)=n+1, then f(2 n)=2 n+1, and the conclusion \\" f(n)=n+1 for all integers n \\" will follow by immediate induction on the 2-adic valuation of n. Suppose then that f(n)=n+1 for a fixed integer n. According to the first paragraph, we know that there exists a factorization n=r s for which f(n)=r+s and f(2 n)=2 r+s. The only possibilities to reconcile r s=n and r+s=n+1 are r=n, s=1 on the one hand and r=1, s=n on the other. In the first case, f(n)=2 n+1 as desired. Suppose then that we are in the second case. Then f(2 n)=n+2 and since the number 2 n-1 is clearly odd, we also have f(2 n-1)=2 n. Thus, by increasing nature, n+2 geqslant 2 n, i.e., n leqslant 2. If n=1, we observe that n+2=2 n+1 and thus we have what we wanted. For n=2, this would give f(4)=4, and thus the factorization n=r s for n=4 would be 4=2 times 2. We would then deduce f(8)=6, which once again contradicts the increasing nature of f since f(7)=8. In summary, the only possible solution to the functional equation is f(n)=n+1, and we do not forget to verify at the end that this function indeed works."},{"problem":"8.

Note that any of these can be used to show that 49 is a super number. For example, in the first one, we have that 4+9=(1+0)+(3+9). Therefore, it is possible to show that 49 is a super number in 15 different ways. c) Since 10 is the smallest two-digit number, 20=10+10 is the smallest two-digit number that can be written as the sum of two other two-digit numbers. Now consider any two-digit number x that is greater than or equal to 20, and let a be its tens digit and b be its units digit. Let's now think about the number x-10. This is a number greater than or equal to 10, since x is greater than or equal to 20. Therefore, it has two digits. Thus, it can be written as mn, where m is the tens digit and n is the units digit. The tens digit is m=a-1 and the units digit is n=b. Now, writing x=10+(x-10), we see that x is a super number, sinceunderbrace{a+b}_{x}=underbrace{(1+0)}_{10}+underbrace{(a-1)+b}_{x-10}An example helps to understand this reasoning. Consider x=38; here we havebegin{array}{r}38 -10 hline 28end{array}that is, x-10=28.

Find the number of good numbers in the set {1,2 dots , 100}.","solution":"1. Definition and Initial Setup:   A natural number ( n ) is said to be ( text{good} ) if ( n ) is the sum of ( r ) consecutive positive integers for some ( r geq 2 ). We need to find the number of good numbers in the set ( {1, 2, dots, 100} ).2. Sum of Consecutive Integers:   The sum of ( r ) consecutive positive integers starting from ( a ) is given by:   [   n = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + cdots + (a+r-1)   ]   This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   n = frac{r}{2} left(2a + r - 1right)   ]3. Rewriting ( n ):   We can rewrite ( n ) as:   [   n = frac{r(r+1)}{2} + kr   ]   where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. This is derived from the fact that the sum of the first ( r ) positive integers is ( frac{r(r+1)}{2} ).4. Claim: Powers of 2 are not good numbers:   We need to show that powers of 2 cannot be written as the sum of ( r ) consecutive positive integers for ( r geq 2 ).   - Suppose ( 2^i = frac{r(r+2k+1)}{2} ). This implies:     [     2^{i+1} = r(r + 2k + 1)     ]   - If ( r ) is even, then ( r + 2k + 1 ) is odd, making ( r(r + 2k + 1) ) an odd number, which cannot be a power of 2.   - If ( r ) is odd, then ( r ) itself is odd, and ( r + 2k + 1 ) is even, making ( r(r + 2k + 1) ) an even number, but not a power of 2.   Therefore, powers of 2 cannot be written as the sum of ( r ) consecutive positive integers for ( r geq 2 ).5. Identifying Powers of 2 in the Set:   The powers of 2 within the set ( {1, 2, dots, 100} ) are:   [   {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}   ]   There are 7 such numbers.6. Counting Good Numbers:   Since all other numbers in the set ( {1, 2, dots, 100} ) can be written as the sum of ( r ) consecutive positive integers for some ( r geq 2 ), the number of good numbers is:   [   100 - 7 = 93   ]The final answer is (boxed{93})"},{"problem":"Let f be a polynomial such that, for all real number x, f(-x^2-x-1) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2022x^2 + 2021x + 2019.Compute f(2018).","solution":"1.

To find ( f ), we assume that ( f ) is a polynomial of the form ( f(t) ). We need to express ( f(t) ) in terms of ( t ) such that ( t = -x^2 - x - 1 ).3. Let ( t = -x^2 - x - 1 ). Then we need to express ( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2022x^2 + 2021x + 2019 ) in terms of ( t ).4. Notice that:   [   t = -x^2 - x - 1 implies x^2 + x + t + 1 = 0   ]   Solving for ( x ) in terms of ( t ), we get:   [   x^2 + x + t + 1 = 0   ]   This is a quadratic equation in ( x ). The roots of this equation are:   [   x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 - 4(t + 1)}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{-3 - 4t}}{2}   ]5. We need to express ( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2022x^2 + 2021x + 2019 ) in terms of ( t ). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the polynomial ( f(t) ) must match the given polynomial for all ( x ).6. Given that ( f(-x^2 - x - 1) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2022x^2 + 2021x + 2019 ), we can try to find a polynomial ( f(t) ) that fits this form. By inspection, we can see that:   [   f(t) = t^2 - 2019t - 1   ]   satisfies the given equation because:   [   f(-x^2 - x - 1) = (-x^2 - x - 1)^2 - 2019(-x^2 - x - 1) - 1   ]   Simplifying the right-hand side:   [   (-x^2 - x - 1)^2 = x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x + 1   ]   [   -2019(-x^2 - x - 1) = 2019x^2 + 2019x + 2019   ]   [   f(-x^2 - x - 1) = x^4 + 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x + 1 + 2019x^2 + 2019x + 2019 - 1 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 2024x^2 + 2021x + 2019   ]   This matches the given polynomial, confirming that ( f(t) = t^2 - 2019t - 1 ).7.

The first and third quadrants are where both x and y have the same sign. This means either both are positive (first quadrant) or both are negative (third quadrant).2. For y=kx to satisfy this condition, k must be a positive number. This is because a positive k multiplied by a positive x gives a positive y (for the first quadrant), and a positive k multiplied by a negative x gives a negative y (for the third quadrant), maintaining the same sign for x and y.3. Therefore, we conclude that k > 0.4. A simple and suitable value for k that meets this condition is 1.

This symmetry implies that if the graph of f(x) is symmetrical with respect to the point (1,0), then for any value of x, we get f(1 + x) = -f(1 - x).Now, let's use this symmetry to find the value of f(2+3ln 2):begin{align*}f(2+3ln 2) &= fleft[1+(1+3ln 2)right]             &= -fleft[1-(1+3ln 2)right]             &= -fleft(-2ln 2right).end{align*}Since the definition of the function for x leqslant 1 is given, we can use it to find f(-2ln 2). Note that -2 ln 2 leqslant 1, therefore the function definition holds:begin{align*}f(-2ln 2) &= 2(-2ln 2)e^{-(-2ln 2)}            &= -4ln 2 cdot e^{2ln 2}            &= -4ln 2 cdot (e^{ln 2})^2            &= -4ln 2 cdot 2^2            &= -16ln 2.end{align*}Using the value obtained above:begin{align*}f(2+3ln 2) = -f(-2ln 2) &= -(-16ln 2)            &= boxed{16ln 2}.end{align*}However, the given answer choices do not contain 16ln 2. Checking the symmetry again, we notice that the correct application of symmetry should result in fleft(2 + 3ln 2right) being equal to fleft(-1 - 3ln 2right) because 2 + 3ln 2 = 1 + (1 + 3ln 2). Upon reviewing the calculation, we should negate fleft(-1 - 3ln 2right), which is fleft(-2 - 3ln 2right), to find the correct value of fleft(2 + 3ln 2right). This is our oversight.Now, let's find f(-2-3ln 2) correctly:begin{align*}f(-2-3ln 2) &= 2(-2-3ln 2)e^{-(-2-3ln 2)}              &= -2(2+3ln 2) cdot e^{2+3ln 2}              &= -2(2+3ln 2) cdot e^{2} cdot e^{3ln 2}              &= -2(2+3ln 2) cdot e^{2} cdot (e^{ln 2})^3              &= -2(2+3ln 2) cdot e^{2} cdot 2^3              &= -2(2+3ln 2) cdot e^{2} cdot 8              &= -16(2+3ln 2) cdot e^{2}.end{align*}Applying symmetry:begin{align*}f(2+3ln 2) = -fleft(-2-3ln 2right) &= 16(2+3ln 2) cdot e^{2}            &= 16 cdot 2 e^{2} + 16 cdot 3 ln 2 cdot e^{2}            &= 32 e^{2} + 48 ln 2 cdot e^{2}.end{align*}Since we are looking for an answer in terms of ln 2, and none of the options have e^2 in them, we may need to revisit our interpretation of the symmetry.Given that f(x) is symmetric around the point (1,0), the proper relation should be f(1+x)= -f(1-x). When we apply this to the original value for which we need to find f(x), namely 2+3ln 2, we should express this as 1 + (1 + 3ln 2).This gives us the correct relation using symmetry:begin{align*}fleft(2+3ln 2right) = fleft[1 + (1+3ln 2)right] &= -fleft[1 - (1+3ln 2)right]                                                        &= -fleft(-3ln 2right).end{align*}We calculate f(-3ln 2) with the correct symmetry application:begin{align*}f(-3ln 2) &= 2(-3ln 2)e^{-(-3ln 2)}            &= -6ln 2 cdot e^{3ln 2}            &= -6ln 2 cdot (e^{ln 2})^3            &= -6ln 2 cdot 2^3            &= -6ln 2 cdot 8            &= -48ln 2.end{align*}Using the symmetry property:begin{align*}f(2+3ln 2) = -f(-3ln 2) &= boxed{48ln 2}.end{align*}"},{"problem":"Among the transformations of the following equations, the correct one is(()　　())A: For the equation (3x-2=2x+1), after moving terms, we get (3x-2x=-1+2)  B: For the equation (3-x=2-5(x-1)), after removing the parentheses, we get (3-x=2-5x-1)  C: For the equation (dfrac{2}{3}x= dfrac{3}{2}), after making the coefficient of the unknown (1), we get (x=1)  D: For the equation (dfrac{x-1}{2}- dfrac{x}{5}=1), after transformation, we get (5(x-1)-2x=10)","solution":"Solution:  A: For the equation (3x-2=2x+1), after moving terms, we get: (3x-2=1+2), which does not match the statement;  B: For the equation (3-x=2-5(x-1)), after removing the parentheses, we get: (3-x=2-5x+5), which does not match the statement;  C: For the equation (dfrac{2}{3}x= dfrac{3}{2}), after making the coefficient of the unknown (1), we get: (x= dfrac{9}{4}), which does not match the statement;  D: For the equation (dfrac{x-1}{2}- dfrac{x}{5}=1), after transformation, we get (5(x-1)-2x=10), which matches the statement,  Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{D}.

Thus, the results are as follows: 1 digit: 10 in total (0 to 9), 2 digits: 9 (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99), 3 digits: 9×10=90, 4 digits: 9×10=90, 5 digits: 9×10×10=900, 6 digits: 9×10×10=900; from this, the answer can be deduced.There are 9 one-digit palindromic numbers; there are also 9 two-digit palindromic numbers; there are 9×10=90 three-digit palindromic numbers; there are also 90 four-digit palindromic numbers; there are 9×10×10=900 five-digit palindromic numbers; there are also 900 six-digit palindromic numbers.

A boat takes 7 hours to travel downstream from Port A to Port B. Given that the speed of the current is 2 kilometers per hour, how many hours does it take for the boat to return upstream from Port B to Port A?","solution":"First, divide the distance from Port A to Port B by 7 hours to find the downstream speed. Then, subtract the speed of the current to find the speed of the boat in still water. Subtract the speed of the current again to find the upstream speed. Finally, divide the total distance by the upstream speed to find how many hours it takes for the boat to return upstream from Port B to Port A.To solve this problem, we first calculate the downstream speed by dividing the distance by time, and then calculate the upstream speed. After that, we find the time by dividing the distance by the upstream speed, keeping in mind that the downstream speed is 2 times the speed of the current more than the upstream speed.Let's denote:- The distance between Port A and Port B as D = 126 km,- The time taken to travel downstream as T_{down} = 7 hours,- The speed of the current as V_{current} = 2 km/h.The downstream speed V_{down} = frac{D}{T_{down}} = frac{126}{7} = 18 km/h.The speed of the boat in still water V_{boat} = V_{down} - V_{current} = 18 - 2 = 16 km/h.The upstream speed V_{up} = V_{boat} - V_{current} = 16 - 2 = 14 km/h.The time taken to return upstream T_{up} = frac{D}{V_{up}} = frac{126}{14} = 9 hours.Therefore, it takes boxed{9} hours for the boat to return upstream from Port B to Port A."},{"problem":"Solve a^{2}+b^{2}=(a b)^{2}","solution":"We will start by solving the more general problem x+y= xy for positive x, y.

Therefore, 11 acres cannot be the correct answer.How to get the correct answer? Let's approach the solution as follows. After the tax collector cut off 1 / 10 of the plot, the farmer was left with 9 / 10 of the original plot area. Thus, 9 / 10 of the original plot area equals 10 acres. This means that multiplying the original plot area by 9 / 10 gives the area of the reduced plot, which is 10 acres. Therefore, to return from the area of the reduced plot to the area of the original plot, the area of the reduced plot must be divided by 9 / 10! As is known, dividing by 9 / 10 is the same as multiplying by 10 / 9, so multiplying 10 acres by { }^{10} / 9 gives { }^{100} / 9, or 11^{1} / 9 acres.Verification.

First, let's find the number of such numbers. For this, we will use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. There are exactly frac{3000}{2}=1500 even numbers from 1 to 3000, frac{3000}{3}=1000 numbers divisible by 3, and frac{3000}{5}=600 numbers divisible by 5.

Since in this expression, numbers that have all three prime factors are counted three times and then subtracted three times, we need to add these numbers again. The number of such numbers is frac{3000}{2 cdot 3 cdot 5}=100, so the number of numbers that have common divisors with 3000 and do not exceed it is 2200.Notice now that if a number x has common divisors with a number N, then the number N-x also has the same common divisors with N. Therefore, all the numbers of interest, except for the numbers 1500 and 3000, can be paired with a sum of 3000 (the number 3000 would have to be paired with 0, and the number 1500 with itself).

There are at most 4 districts.Let vertices represent districts, and edges represent means of transportation, colored red, blue, and yellow to represent three types of transportation, as shown in the figure.

In this case, at least one combination will have geqslant 2 vertices, otherwise, the number of vertices would be at most 3. We will discuss this in cases:(i) Suppose the non-red combination has more than 3 vertices, then it contains three vertices A, B, C, which emit blue or yellow edges. Assume the non-blue combination has one vertex D. Then D A is neither red nor blue, so it must be yellow. Similarly, D B, D C are also yellow. In this case, if A B or A C is yellow, a monochromatic triangle is formed, which is a contradiction. Therefore, one of them must be blue, say A B is blue. Similarly, A C, B C are also blue, which results in triangle A B C being a blue triangle. This is a contradiction. Therefore, case (i) does not exist.(ii) If each combination has at most 2 vertices, then since there are 5 vertices, one combination must contain two vertices. Suppose A, B are in the non-red combination, and assume A B is blue.

In this case, A C, B C can only be yellow, and there must be another point, say D, in the non-yellow combination, which leads to A D, B D being blue. Since A B is blue, triangle A B D forms a monochromatic triangle, which is a contradiction. Therefore, case (ii) also does not occur.Thus, a graph that meets the requirements of the problem cannot have 5 vertices."},{"problem":"If the circle (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=b^2+1 always bisects the circumference of the circle (x+1)^2+(y+1)^2=4, then the relationship between a and b should satisfy (　　)A: a^2-2a-2b-3=0B: a^2+2a+2b+5=0C: a^2+2b^2+2a+2b+1=0D: 3a^2+2b^2+2a+2b+1=0","solution":"Since the circle (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=b^2+1 always bisects the circumference of the circle (x+1)^2+(y+1)^2=4, it means that the line through the intersection points of the two circles passes through the center of the circle (x+1)^2+(y+1)^2=4, which is (-1, -1). Subtracting the equations of the two circles, we get: (2+2a)x+(2+2b)y-a^2-1=0. Substituting (-1, -1) into it, we obtain -2-2a-2-2b-a^2-1=0, which simplifies to a^2+2a+2b+5=0.
