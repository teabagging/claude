This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually, I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air. 2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Babies of this age may pass motion 10 days once or 10 times a day also. If the baby is active and feeding well, don't worry. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Head injuries in children are very common and sometimes they can lead to serious consequences. While not every head injury is necessarily cause for concern, when it comes to children, it is always better to be on the safe side. Head traumas followed by loss of consciousness and, possibly vomiting afterwards are a definitive cause for concern and always yields medical attention. It is possible that your daughter is just sleepy because she is tired from all that jumping, however is she has been asleep for longer than three hours than there is something going on and you should seek medical help while trying to wake her up. In any case, being watchful for the next 48 hours after a fall or head trauma is always the sensible thing to do.Wishing you all the best"},{"Patient":"My 11-year-old granddaughter hit her head on the corner of a wall about 3 days ago.

Tuesday night he vomited his dinner. I suspected he had a 24 stomach bug that many people have been getting over the past month. His pediatrician always recommends a regiment of frequent sips of Gatorade until he can keep everything down for 6 hours. Twice after he vomited a small bit of mucus, then finally Wednesday afternoon he seemed well enough to eat - crackers, toast - small amounts. He vomited again late Wednesday afternoon & evening, so we repeated the process. Thursday morning he vomited a tiny bit of mucus, but by the evening he was able to tolerate foods. However, I noticed then that his temperature was extremely high - 104-105 F. I began giving him 10cc doeses of Children s Tylenol every 5-6 hours as needed. His pediatrician is out of town, and I spoke to a covering doctor. He said everything should be okay, as long as he doesn t have any severe abdominal pain, which he didn t. He is still going through a cycle in which he spikes a high fever, and Tylenol brings it down for about 4-5 hours. He also gets lethargic, sleepy and whinny when it spikes. He is about 90% of his normal self when the Tylenol is in effect. There are no other symptoms. I am concerned that this fever has gone on for this long. His ped returns tomorrow morning and his covering doctor is off today. At what point should I seek further medical attention? Should I take him to the ER, even though he feels okay when on Tylenol? (I m in NJ, where there is a deep freeze and would prefer to not take him out in the cold.) Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi, There are Humpty number of causes for vomiting in 6 years old. Given the scenario, it looks like your son may be having acute gastroenteritis or a viral illness. As you mentioned, children will get tired when they have a high-grade fever. But if they are active when afebrile, then it is unlikely due to any serious infection. I would suggest you give an adequate dose of Tylenol as advised by the pediatrician and keep him well hydrated. If fever persists for more than 5 days or if he has persistent vomiting, new appearance of the rash, lethargic when afebrile, decreased oral intake and urine output, then you need to consult a pediatrician immediately.

I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

However the pores of his nose have been opened and sweat drops are visible on the nose at the high temperature but skin of the entire body other than nose gets reddish then turns to yellow then cracks. His eyes, ears and other parts of the body have become normal but sweating glands are blocked so far. Resultant, the layer of entire skin is getting removed at the interval of six hours.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician). Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups. Hope I have answered your query.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them. 2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. 3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too. 4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I would suggest you do as follows : Start spending more time with her as her friend. Share views on one or other things /topics. Go slowly. Gain her confidence so that she speaks out about her feelings n thoughts. 2. Involve her in some sports activities  &  also in some hobbies. Instrumental play. Music and all. 3. Good books,  spiritual videos - discussions will also help. Overall to say just let her be busy with some constructive directions. Internet should be stopped gradually.

How long viral fever can be and what should be done if fever gets very high?","Doctor":"Hi, By what you say I feel that this could be a recurrent viral illness. I will explain you how a viral illness behaves so that you can be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of  every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Please type your query here...my baby had a blood smear with a few acanthocytes. He was born at 36 weeks and small but has gained weight very well and is now 75th percentile. He is otherwise well but has mild persistant jaundice. His platelet count is 725 which is high. He is also being treated for iron and folate deficiency. Donthe acanthocytes always indicate some kind of disease or could it be related to his iron deficiency?","Doctor":"Hi, Acanthocyte is nothing but the abnormal shape of red blood cells. It can be seen in iron deficiency Anemia also, where because of less iron the red blood cells shape can get distorted. The thing I'm worried about your child is persistent jaundice, which is not seen in iron deficiency Anemia. If your child is less than a month old, then I would wait and follow up. But if older, then I would advise you to get evaluated and keep a watch on the growth and development. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Please type your query here...My 9 year old son is experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain without exertion. He is very active and can play a full game of basketball without a problem. He doesn t have a cough, cold or any other noticeable symptoms.?","Doctor":"Hi, The common cause of shortness of breath and chest pain in children due to heart failure or pulmonary embolism or any chest infections, rarely due to foreign body obstruction. Your son has no exertional dyspnea or cough and cold, so the above causes are unlikely. Some times heart rhythm abnormalities can present as shortness of breath and pain over chest. So, I would suggest you to do a baseline ecg and get a opinion from pediatric cardiology. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Cerebral palsy is a common term but has many subtypes in it. we need to know about what type of cerebral palsy that your child has, such as spastic type or hypotonic or choreoathetoid type and any associated problems like developmental delay, seizures etc. We need to assess the child clinically to decide on further management. There is treatment for cerebral palsy but no definite cure. Some require physiotherapy alone and some may require medications along with physiotherapy. Many children with milder form of cerebral palsy do well with minimal supportive care. I would suggest you to get a pediatric neurologists opinion, who can guide on further management.

Constipation can aggravate the problem but you need to do an Ultrasound Pelvis to rule out any other cause. Meanwhile you can start Lactulose 20 ml at night regularly to avoid constipation, drink plenty of water and eat fruits and vegetables. Also if there is any vaginal discharge it needs treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I don't think Benadryl will cause pain over that area. Since a doctor already examined him and he is having occasionally vague pain, I don't think it's a serious thing to worry. If there is any swelling at the shaft or any painful urination or hematuria, then he should be evaluated. The pain might be due to tight underwear and positional compression during sleep, which can be attended easily by simple changes. Hope I have answered your query.

The doctors ave said she cud be on them until the age of 4, she has also had 2 scans on her kidneys but have both been ok. Why is she on antibiotics for so long","Doctor":"Hello, It is challenging to come to diagnosis with a limited history provided in the query. However, the use of long term antibiotic therapy is called for patients who suffer with immunodeficiency. The antibiotics prevent the risk of acquiring recurrent severe infections in such patients. As you have mentioned your grand child is five months old; it is likely that she is suffering from some form of rare congenital immunodeficiency. In this condition the normal infection-fighting system of the body does not function fully, making the person prone to severe infections. Apart from antibiotics other forms of treatment available for such patients includes antibody infusion, and stem cell transplantation. In addition, kidneys are usually normal as the immune cells are usually a component of blood. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Had a low fever, threw up at 2:30, and at 3 I was ablt to get some tylenol in her, still working on pedialyte. Should I be concerned as that there were also small chicken bones that I myself had to pull out?","Doctor":"Hello, It is likely that your child is suffering from viral gastroenteritis due to consumption of contaminated food, or water. There is nothing to be concerned about at this stage as she is accepting fluids orally, and minute chicken bones are less likely to cause any harm. I would suggest you keep your child well hydrated, and well rested at home till she recovers fully. The use of medication for stomach cramps and vomiting is not necessary as most viral enteritis is self-limiting. However, use of pedialyte is an excellent way to keep your daughter hydrated; do continue using it. In addition, Tylenol is safe on stomach compared to other fever medication and can be used for fever in gastroenteritis. If the symptoms persist beyond 3 days or worsen consider taking your child to a GP. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Any night awakening because of abdominal pain? Any recent history of viral infections? Any altered bowel habits or blood-tinged stools? Her weight and growth pattern? Her schoolings and absenteeism? Anyone in the family has migraine history? I know you are worried, but we need these details before commenting on the causes.

It would have been better if we have an image of those lesions. Enterobius infection can cause anal lesion and skin lesion. He may require a course of deworming and hand hygiene is very important.

What I want to know is there a large chance the cancer was on that ureter too and should it of been removed as a precaution?","Doctor":"Hi, It's very unfortunate that your granddaughter had rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue tumor which usually arises from muscles which are attached to bones. It's very unlikely that it arises from the ureter. The tumor can encompass the ureter and may compress, which needs to be corrected. I would advise you to follow up with your pediatric surgeon or urologist advice. Hope I have answered your query.

There are many conditions that may cause walking and talking problem (Global developmental delay) such as muscle related problem, Nerve related problem or could be due to brain injury during birth (perinatal asphyxia leading to cerebral palsy).

I don't think there is a relation between rash and ampicillin in this scenario. Purpuric rash occurs due to many reasons but purpura only over upper legs and buttock region, raises the suspicion of a condition called Henoch schonlein purpura. It is a self limiting condition (vasculitis - inflammation of the blood vessels) which may affect kidneys, skin and gut.

Is there anything we should be doing?","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern. It's unfortunate that your child has issues with the kidney. I will help you to clear your doubts and guide you further management. Stage 5 reflux disease is something which needs to be attended as early as possible. MCU (Micturition Cysto Urethrogram) will give a better idea about the grade of reflux and DMSA scan may be required to assess how much of kidney been affected. She needs to be on uroprophylaxis (medicines to prevent urinary tract infection) till reflux disease is corrected.

It's a safe tablet for the above symptoms. It may alleviate the symptom that your daughter has, but the cause for dysuria (i.e pain while passing urine)should be found and treated. A common cause for dysuria in that age group is cystitis, urinary tract infection or sometimes renal stones. As urine culture is not available near to you, a urine routine test can be done, which will give us a lot more information. If any constipation or voiding dysfunction is there, that need to be sorted out and toilet training should be done if not yet trained.

Nephrotic syndrome is a common disorder in children in the age group of 2 to 8 years. Its unfortunate that your child is having this issue for past one and half years. Recommended treatment for nephrotic syndrome is steroids. Response to steroid treatment is very good. But if the disease is not under control or child is having frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome, then the child may require steroid-sparing agents.

From the history, what I could infer is that she has features of  extrahepatic portal venous obstruction. It's not so uncommon in children. Sometimes there can be inciting factors such as umbilical sepsis or catheter insertion during newborn period but most of the time cause is unknown. Usually these children can develop following issues 1. Bloody vomiting due to increased pressure in the abdominal blood vessels and collateral formation 2. Low hemoglobin (Anemia) or Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) due to enlarged spleen 3. Splenic injury during contact sport or fall. If it is extra hepatic portal venous obstruction, your child needs regular Endoscopy and follow up with pediatric gastroenterologist. If any massive bleed is there, it needs to be addressed immediately. on the long term, surgery like shunts (splenic renal) can be done to reduce the pressure in the abdominal blood vessels. Rarely splenectomy is indicated. Management based on the symptoms and it varies with individuals. I would suggest you to follow up with a pediatric gastroenterologist for further care.

The docs just tell them it s normal, have him drink prune juice, etc to no avail. This sounds very serious to me as I ve seen the pain he goes through and have cried myself watching him. What should be our next step in helping this poor little guy?","Doctor":"Hi, Constipation is common in young children. It may be due to: (1) Inadequate/ improper toilet training in toddlers (2) Predominant milk based and no fiber diet (3) Stool withholding maneuvers due to fear of getting pain while passing hard stools (4) Some times hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) and rarely surgical conditions such has Hirschsprung's disease may also cause constipation. As the stools get stagnant in the bowel, they get harder and children can experience painful bowel movements due to excessive stretching of bowel wall. Sometimes these excessive stretching may cause blood in stools. I am sorry to hear that your grand son is suffering in pain. I would like to help him by giving some medicines to empty the bowel. First step is to remove the hard stools struck down in colon by giving an enema, followed by maintenance dose of laxatives to soften the stool. I would like to teach them about toilet training if not trained. Along with this, high fiber diet (green leafy vegetables) would help.

Please type your query here...My almost 3 year old little girl is very social athletic and smart. She is the middle child with an older 6 year old and younger 18 month old sisters. She is sweet and loving most of the time and very affectionate. BUT she has these tantrums every now and then that can last 30 minutes to an hour. They are very obsessive and often can only be calmed down by fixing the action. EXAMPLE: If I unhook her car seat belt and she wanted to she will melt down (uncontrollable hysterical crying and screaming) until I put her back in the car and let her undo the belt. That is great if it is something fixable, but we had a swim lesson that was the last one and they did it more free instead of structure and when we were leaving she did not feel she had her swim lesson that day so she had a melt down which lasted one hour until she fell asleep then when she woke up one hour later she continued to cry for about 10-15 more minutes then fell asleep again for a little while longer. When she woke up the final time she was OK, but I though it would go on forever since I could not recreate her swim lesson. I try to work on calming with breathing deep and blowing out bubbles or something else. I have tried deep pressure treatments. I have tried to calmly talk to her. She is not hurting herself of others, but the obsessive nature is troublesome to me. She does not seem to have an obsession with anything in particular, but she will just get fixated on arbitrary things. She does not show a lot of aggression, but will get frustrated with her younger sister at times and will squeeze her. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, You have to stop giving her whatever she demands. She has to learn that she can't have her way always. Be gentle with her and be patient.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting, you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops once daily for 14 days) & ORS (each small packet mixed in 200 ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your pediatrician). Regarding diet - You can use Cerelac - any flavour will do.

I had severe heartburn at night which is now relieved by taking Prevacid, one cap qd 30 minutes before eating breakfast. A year ago I started having severe upper left quadrant abdominal pain, relieved by lying down. I had an MRI that didn t show any abnormal findings. I had an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. The upper EGD showed a small hiatal hernia with some esophageal varices. The stomach showed small ulcers and a sample later reveled H-pylori, treated with antibiotics. The colonoscopy could not proceed past the upper left portion of the large intestine due to an extreme bend in the intestine they could not get past. The lower colon presented with diverticula with no signs of diverticulosis. I then had a barium x-ray that did not show abnormal results. It s a year later and the pain continues. It s just left of center at the edge of the rib cage. It s more predominant after eating, but also presents during stress or moderate to heavy physical activity. It is no longer relieved by lying down, but diminishes within one to two hours after onset. The pain can be sharp or dull and normally is a 3 on a 1-10 scale.

At this age, you can start giving Cerelac stage one rice or Nestum rice stage 1 etc. All are same in calories and energy. Only thing is palatability which is subjective for each kid. Other home-made food options will be - 1. Daal and rice well cooked and made into a porridge along with ghee 2. Boiled apple or banana and mashed into a paste. 3. Any made cereal porridge preparation with additional ghee added. Remember certain principles like - 1. Add one food material/cereal or fruit per week.

It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass a small amount of diarrhoea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhoea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the baby takes milk, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a waveform which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting.

First due to rapid weight loss and poor feeding, which was attributed to a viral infection, she was discharged and 2 days later re-admitted due to poor feeding. The main problem since approx a week old seems to be that she cannot take more than 3 ounces of feed without vomiting or falling asleep. Whilst in hospital she has been fed through a tube and whilst they feed little and often this worked ok, however each time they try to up the volume and feed at longer intervals the same problem re-occurs. The doctors have checked bloods, saliva, water sample etc and have now put her back on 2 hourly tube feeds to ensure she is getting sufficient feed. My sister is convinced that there is something internal that is preventing the baby from taking more than 3 ounces, but the hospital seem reluctant to investigate. They are treating the baby for reflux and have 2 days ago changed her to a non-cows milk feed in case it is lactose intolerance, however the same problems still seem to be occurring - vomiting and sleepiness. The doctors asked if they could feed the baby for 24 hrs (bottle) so they could observe for themselves, and I assume to see if there was any issues with mums and dads techniques, but the sames problems occurred, hence she is now back on the 2 hourly tube feed.

Howover the last 24 hours she has been very unsettled, with a bloated tummy which has been making alot of loud gurgling noises all day, accompanied by 3 soiled nappies but only lightly soiled with very watery yellow poo. she keeps wanting to feed but it seems only for comfort as her tummy seems very full and hard. she sounds like she is constantly straining which makes her bring up small amounts of milk even as long as 40mins after a feed. what do you think is wrong with her and what should i do to settle her if she is already full?","Doctor":"Hi, This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually, I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air. 2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope I have answered your query.

I do not think refusing breastfeeding or milk is a sign of whiplash injury and if there are no raised intracranial pressure signs then the trivial fall should not be worried about.

You will feel the difference in no time.A very good remedy for stomach aches, especially if the cause is indigestion, is to eat a plain toasted bread and drink a cup of tea, any you like.Drink one cup of cola or soda, the bubbles will help to get rid of the pain.Put something warm on your stomach (not too warm so you won't get a burn), lie down to rest. You can put a warm towel by soaking it in warm water.           Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, My son is 2years and 3 months old. He s having a viral fever since the last three days.

I suggest you see your pediatrician and get a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If it is positive then she will require antibiotics. If it is negative then it might be viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics at all. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like Cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.

What is the weight of the patient? Dose can be 10 -20 mg per kg per dose for 4 times a day with a maximum of 4 g in 24 hours. Following a single dose, one may not see sudden reduction in fever. Plus even if fever does come down on taking adequate dose of paracetamol, there is always a possibility of fever coming back after about 5 to 6 hours as the blood levels of the drug goes down. That is why dosage is advised every 6 hours initially. The antibiotic given helps to treat and remove the cause (infection) for the fever. So in that case too a single dose is not going to be helpful. A minimum of few doses of antibiotic ( 2 to 3 days, 625 mg three times a day) has to be given. To help a better recovery give a good deal of fluids along with normal food. Preferably 1 to 1.5 liters of oral re-hydration fluid should go in. This will help in better recovery. If cough is present then that will take a bit longer to get cured. DO not panic. Patient should recover in next 2 to 3 days.

Paracetamol is usually given every 6 hours (maximum 4 times a day) and ibuprofen is usually given every 8 hours (maximum 3 times a day). These two drugs could be alternated as they do not interfere with each-other's path. Usually you should initiate with paracetamol (according to the dose recommended by your doctor) and if the fever is not dominated within the range of it's effect (within 6 hours) then you could start ibuprofen (according to the dose recommended by your doctor) as well. For example, if you start paracetamol at 1 pm and the baby gets fever again at 4 pm, then you should give ibuprofen. The next dose of paracetamol should be given at 7 pm (or 6.30 if the fever is high) and the next ibuprofen dose at 12 pm (or a little earlier, if needed), and so on.

Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Is ondem to be given empty stomach and what can be given for stomach cramps ?? She is not interested in eating anything, can I let her be or should I insist on eating a little bit ?","Doctor":"Hi, She most likely has gastroenteritis due to a viral infection and not from food poisoning.  You can return to the place where you purchased the food to inquire if other customers went back to the store complaining about vomiting and diarrhea. Paracetamol can be given to a toddler for pain such as stomach cramps.  Ondem is given to prevent nausea and vomiting that takes place after chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. It has side effects: -irregular heartbeats, -chest pain, -shaking, -fainting and dizziness, -headache, -constipation. I would recommend she not have the Ondem. Does she have fever? At this point you can give her fluids such as apple juice, pear juice, Pedialyte. These should be room temperature, not chilled, Jell-O. Offer 1-2 oz every 1-2 hours. If there is no vomiting after 4 hours, offer 3-4 oz every 2-3 hours. It is necessary to make sure she does not become dehydrated(no tears, dry tongue and mouth, doughy feel of skin, and reduced frequency of urination). When she becomes hungry, you may give her anything she wants. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Does she have a fever?  Is she coughing?  Has she been exposed to anyone else who is ill?  If she were experiencing eye allergies, her eyes would be red and she would be rubbing them. It is most likely that she has a cold(a viral upper respiratory infection). Liquid cold medicines are not recommended for infants because all of them have side effects. It will be safer to purchase Saline Nose Drops in the supermarket or pharmacy (available over-the-counter).  Put one drop into each nostril. She will sneeze and blow the nasal mucus to the front of her nose so that you can suction the secretions out with an infant bulb syringe.

Has your son ever had bladder control? Does he have constipation? Has he had a urine examination? This would look for reasons he is unable to stay dry, such as diabetes, urinary tract infection. Other causes include genitourinary anomalies, medication, and emotional stress. How long does he usually go between times he wets? Let's assume that it is three hours.  Then while at home see that he goes to the bathroom every two and a half hours to empty his bladder. You may keep a log of the times he urinates. At school make sure his teacher allows him to go to the boy's room at the same interval.  Perhaps your son can wear a wristwatch. No caffeinated drinks. Alarms have helped many children to stay dry at night.  They consist of a sensor which is usually attached to his underpants. During the night, as soon as the sensor is wet, an alarm alerts the child to wake up and go to the bathroom. You can contact a medical supply store to inquire if they carry them.

At her age mono causes an illness like a cold- cough, runny nose, fever. Not with vomiting and not with swollen glands in the neck. She probably has a viral infection due to a virus different from the one causing mono.

Perhaps there is a material that the current potty is made of that is causing this reaction. Cloudy urine can mean an infection. So it would be a good idea to take him to his paediatrician for a physical exam and to have a urine sample examined. Many toddlers can get a lot of colds, especially if they are in daycare or other places with small children. If he has a good appetite and is growing and developing normally, then as he gets older, his immune system will be able to resist more and more of the viruses that cause colds.

We took him to an ENT specialist who insisted he put grommets in both ears and remove his adnoids. After the surgery the next day he said that his ears were extremely blocked with pus etc and after two weeks we saw a hearing specialist who said that he seemed to be okay but the machine consistently gave a negative reading on one ear - so had to go straight back to the ENT who said not to worry about it, there is nothing wrong with his hearing etc. His cold like symptoms did start to clear over the next month or so for about three months and then he has been hit again with another dose of symptoms. One of the grommets in his ear has almost come out around the same time he started the symptoms again. We thought that this may have been the problem but our local chemist took one look at him and said he had allergies to something, he said it could be a number of things. He is rather fair skinned and his red/purple rings under his eyes are also starting to look a little scaley. He is starting to rub his eye a little but nothing out of the norm. He is a terrible sleeper since 5 months old and has slept through the night less than a dozen times since. He drinks plenty of fluids and eats like a champion and I would like to know how to isolate foods that may be affecting him. I am extremely exhausted as I am the only one that attends to him during his sleeplessness and I think I myself have developed some sort of sleep apnia. I would really hope that I can find some sort of quick answer to a very long on going issue.","Doctor":"Hello, I have a few questions, please: -what are his cold symptoms (a cough, runny nose, fever)? -did the ENT doctor prescribe an antibiotic for his ear infections? -placement of the grommets seems to have relieved his cold symptoms, did you take your son back to ENT doctor when one of the grommets began to come out of his eardrum? Is there a family history of allergic conditions? E.g. asthma, eczema, or hay fever? Children with eye allergies have red eyes and are constantly rubbing their eyes. The normal amount of sleep for a healthy toddler is 12-13 hours a night plus one nap(which is included in the 12-13 hours). To manage his night wakings he ought to have a set sleep schedule and bedtime routine.  A consistent nightly bedtime will enable him to fall asleep more easily. A consistent bedtime routine (20-45 minutes) and includes 3-4 soothing activities (bath, pyjamas, story reading). Continue to allow him to nap.  Let him have a transitional object(blanket, doll, stuffed animal). Do not respond immediately to his movements or sounds.  Give him a chance to return to sleep independently. Parental sleep disruptions, family tension often result from nighttime sleep disturbances. Behavioural interventions (e.g. counselling) result in fewer sleep problems for the child, but also help alleviate parental stress, improve parental stress and management of daytime behaviours. He should continue to eat a regular, wholesome diet.  There is no evidence that eliminating food s from his diet will relieve his cold symptoms and it could cause a dietary deficiency.

Your child complained and you took him to the eye doctor immediately! Many young children have myopia.  In fact, it is the most common vision defect in this age group. Normally both eyes line up together. In a lazy eye, one of the eyes deviates so the eyes do not line up together.  The patch makes a correction so that with time both eyes will line up normally. If you had not taken your child to the ophthalmologist and his lazy eye wasn't correct, your son would have vision loss.

I then took her to a pharmacist and he gave me a liquid form cortazan, medicine name is pre lone , it then started going away and as soon as she was running around and jumping up and down the jungle gyms did the rash come back really aggresively and now on her face it was very red, we then took her to a doctor and he told me she has a allergic reaction to something, but she has never had this before, I never changed her diet or the washing powder, it has been ever since the vaccination. The rash then started going away since giving her the medicine. But 3days now the rash has come back, it goes away and comes back and sometimes worse then the other times, but not as red, but itchy. Please help","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and do understand that your daughter is suffering from Urticaria. The exact cause for this is not clear as it can result due to food allergy, medicine allergy, changes in local weather, etc. Hence considering the vaccination to be the cause of this condition can be ruled out. To have a cure for this condition I would like to suggest the following Ayurvedic medications for 15 days which I usually give to patients who come to my clinic.1. Tablet Laghusutashekara Rasa - 1 tablet twice daily before food with warm diluted milk.2. Haridra Khanda - 1 teaspoon twice daily before food mixed with warm diluted milk. 3. If the rashes are worst and are not going away, then give her a bath with water boiled with neem leaves. I would like to suggest to evaluate Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC) and Immunoglobulin (IgG) assay for the confirmation of diagnosis as the values of these will be high. Also I would like to suggest the following diet for 2-3 months:1. Avoid oily and fried preparations2. Avoid use of too much spice in preparations 3. Avoid curds (Buttermilk can be taken) and also non-vegetarian food.4. Fermented food, Bakery products, caffeine substances and Cocoa substances are to be avoided.5. In vegetables she should avoid Brinjal and Drumstick while in fruits avoid using pineapple. Rest of the available fruits and vegetables can be used. Start with dietary changes for the next two months and get back to me later for further assistance. Hope I have answered your query.

Anyway, hiatal hernias are usually found on chest s rays, it is associated with gastroesophageal reflux. That's why mainly the treatment focus on controlling the reflux from the stomach.In your case, because you already take antiacid medications, probably a good thing to do would be to be seen by a gastroenterologist.Rarely hiatal hernias need to be surgically repaired."},{"Patient":"My daughter broke her left wrist four months ago playing soccer.

Four months later she has pain at the base of wrist and arm swelling purple discoloration and rwcently her thumb pops in and out of socket and a strange painful bump has appeared on her wrist on her pinky side she can move the wrist but much pain still exists","Doctor":"Hi, If I was your treating doctor for this condition, I would have come up with the following possibilities. 1. The first possibility is improper union of the bone as there was a fracture with displacement. This can be evaluated by an X-ray of wrist joint. If it is so then a surgical intervention would be necessary. 2. The second possibility is Tendinosis which again can be evaluated physically with Finkelstein test. If this is the condition then I would suggest to make it immobilized with a crepe bandage and splints to give it sufficient amount of rest. It can be treated effectively with medication. 3. The third possibility is the complication of fractures namely osteomyelitis which is a serious problem. Usually this is accompanied by fever. This can be assessed by X-ray which will relieve the damage to the bone. An MRI is more precise as it gives of bones and soft tissues. I suggest you to consult an Orthopedic at the earliest and get an MRI done to rule out serious conditions like Osteomyelitis and malunion of bones. Hope I have answered your query.

I have very rarely had a dry night. I am currently using goodnights (I m small) but they are quickly going to be to small. My doctor (last seen 7-8 months ago) knows and keeps telling me I will grow out of it. What sort of protection will be good when the goodnights get to small? Also is there a second opinion on the medical side?","Doctor":"Hello, It is good of you to come forward and seek help for this problem.  Some are too shy to ask for help. The information you have given me indicates that you have primary nocturnal enuresis(meaning you have never had sustained dryness at night). Causes for this type of night-time incontinence include: -Impaired arousal during sleep-the arousal centre in the brain fails to respond to full bladder sensation; adolescents with night-time wetting have diminished arousal during sleep. -There is a chemical in the brain, that when active, causes the kidney to hold on to water and make less urine, but in some adolescents, this chemical is not working properly. Therefore the kidney does not hold in as much water and so more urine is produced which can spill out at night. I don't think you ought to wait any longer for your body to correct this problem on its own. You might wish to find a pediatric urologist to investigate your enuresis.  This specialist will probably want to study a sample of your urine. One last piece of advice: drinking caffeine-containing beverages may make night-time wetting worse.

Although it is common in children between 2 and 6 years as their appetite fluctuates in accordance with their age and energy levels, but if you notice that loss of appetite is accompanied with weight loss also then consult a Pediatrician immediately to identify the cause and correct it. PS. at his age common causes to look out for are anemia, intestinal worms, and constipation since they are preventable with some extra care and attention. 2. Make sure to exclude temporary causes of loss of appetite like teething, sore throat, growth changes, till then keep following things in mind: . feeding tests the patience of the mother, but it is the most important part of treatment. . small feeds every 1/2 hour. . undiluted milk thickened with 1 tablespoon of skimmed milk powder. . gradually increased solid foods like potato, mashed banana, sweet potato, pulses. . minimum handling of the baby. . multivitamin syrup: 10 drops twice daily.

When a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her  fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. Mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. The apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force feed her to eat more. Most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. I agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped.  No persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment.  She will eat when she wishes. Place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family.  The food is placed before her and it is expected she will take what she wants.  Encourage holding and drinking from cup and eating with spoon. Allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. If she will not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal.  If she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. She will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats.A small child can eat some of the meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. Parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. A child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. As long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. Allow her to feed herself as much as possible. As soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. She needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided.

How serious is this?!","Doctor":"Hi, I am sorry your daughter is suffering so. I am sure it is difficult for you to help her. As a cardiologist the physician she has been seen by specializes in conditions that affect the heart. As chest symptoms and dizziness can be due to heart problems, the heart specialist is evaluating your adolescent for these possibilities. An EKG will show AV block and a cardiac arrhythmia. An ultrasound of the heart will find mitral valve prolapse(or regurgitation). Not all young people with AV block and mitral valve regurgitation have chest pain or discomfort. The heart monitor will look for a cardiac arrhythmia over a much longer period of time that the few seconds it takes to perform an EKG. Salt supplementation and extra fluids are treatments for patients who faint and are felt to be dehydrated. Other possibilities of dizziness: -anaemia -drugs(SOME antibiotics), alcohol, and aspirin -heat exhaustion. Still, another condition is hyperventilation syndrome. This usually occurs during adolescence, for both boys and girls. Symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome include dizziness, headache, chest pain, fast breathing, difficulty breathing, fainting, along with panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden episodes of fear, screaming, weeping, hyperventilation, chest pain, dizziness, and memory difficulties.  Attacks are about 20 minutes in duration.

Since then poop is messy loose and smelling like garlic especially today. Today is 3rd day after 2nd dose. Otherwise baby is perfectly fine and playing.Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hi, First of all, its great to hear that the child is dewormed. Abdominal discomfort is very common in growing children. It occurs mainly due to normal spasm in normal situations. Simple antispasmodics solve it. But if the child shows untoward symptoms (irritated, crying, severe vomiting, frequent vomiting, fever, swelling of the abdomen, no passage of stool, the passage of blood per anum); then it alarms to get medical attention. Otherwise, in most situations, it's a regular phenomenon in children. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I had anal intercourse about three months ago since then I have been experiencing lower abdominal pains.

Can I give her zifi 100 mg ready syrup . Last year doctor had advised her same antibiotic with crocin d s for fever and cough. What should be the dosage for her.","Doctor":"Hello, I am sorry your daughter is ill. With the symptoms you listed-cough and fever- it is likely that she has a viral respiratory illness.  There are more viruses than bacteria that cause respiratory infections. How high is her fever?  Is her appetite normal? Does she have her usual level of activity?  The severity of a viral respiratory illness is usually less that for a bacterial respiratory illness. Zifi is a brand name for the antibiotic called Cefixime.  While this is a good antibiotic to treat various bacterial infections, it does not treat viral infections. In fact, no antibiotic does.Plus, Zifi, like all drugs, has side effects. Some of its side effects are: - headache -loss of appetite -bloody or watery stool -dizziness -itchy rash -swelling of face, lips, tongue So for the symptoms you provided, this medicine most probably will not be effective and it could cause side effects. Based on the information given, I feel it is not a good idea to give her this medicine. Hope I have answered your query.

The rectus abdominis muscle is in the front of the belly. In addition to keeping the stomach and intestines inside the belly, this muscle helps the body bend at the waist.

The vomitting is controlled by giving her Ondem syrup 4ml twice a day. For loose motions i have been prescribed to give one vial a day of enterogermina, and if motions exceeds 5 times, 2 vials a day. I was advised to start Diof anitbiotic syrup if motions continue beyond three days without any change, 5ml twice a day. we have accordingly given her DIOF syurp in the morning, but immediately after consuming it she puked it out. The no of times she has passed motions today has increased compared to previous two days when she showed signs of improving. The food/water intake is normal, she is active and playing and does not show signs of fatigue. My question is what determines that her infection is bacterial and not viral, as no tests have been conducted before prescribing the medicine. The only details asked was consistency color and odor, which was watery, green and odorless. Do these details suffice to determine nature of infection as bacterial as opposed to viral? My only concern is not to give an antibiotic without being sure, especially to a child. Kindly advice","Doctor":"Hi, Your infant has gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhoea).  Viruses and bacteria can cause gastroenteritis. In either case without good handwashing technique GE is very contagious. Bacterial gastroenteritis is usually more severe than viral gastroenteritis (GE). Bacterial GE is usually associated with fever and sometimes the diarrheal stool is bloody. The danger with GE is that the child can become dehydrated, but fortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case with your child. My recommendation is not to give an antibiotic until a stool specimen is obtained to take to lab for culture.  Then it will be known if she has a bacterial cause. If there is a bacterial cause for her GE, the lab will also determine which antibiotics will kill the bacteria. From what you have shared, I believe she will be okay without the antibiotic at this point. Hope I have answered your query.

Infant sleep behavior should be understood in the context of the relationship and interaction between infant and caregiver which impacts greatly on the quality and quantity of sleep. How long has your grandson had trouble with sleeping? Temporary sleep disturbances that occur with acute illness usually are self-limited.  Certain factors are associated with chronic sleep problems such as inability to self-soothe, difficult temperament, maternal depression, and insecure maternal-infant attachment. How much is he crying? Vomiting? Does his diet consist of anything other than breast milk? What about baby's environment? Noisy? Proper temperature? Smoking? Too bright? Does he sleep in his own bed? If he is not feeding as well at the breast as he used to, he could be losing weight. Should he be losing weight this is a situation that must be investigated immediately. I wish you were able to share more information with me.  However, in the USA, one of the well baby office visits with his pediatrician is at four months of age.

These adhesions cause pain whenever the organs are moved due to having sex or any manipulation of the external genital organ. The bleeding post sex need s to be evaluated with the help of a PAP smear exam to rule out any cervical pathology. You may visit your gyn and get yourself evaluted with the help of an ultrasonund to rule out any other pathology.

Healthy infants who were full-term at birth should remain on formula until their first birthday. Fairlife is milk that has been processed a special way.  Since it is milk, he should not have it for another month. From one to two years of age, he ought to drink whole milk. His growing body needs the additional fats in whole milk.From two years of age and older, he should drink fat-free or two % cow milk. Hope I have answered your query.

It started at 103.7 and has fluctuated up and down with Tylenol and Ibuprofin, the lowest being 99.7 with hour doses in between. The fever has not broken. She started with a slight headache, has chills and tired. She feels good to play most of the day, but today she actually went to sleep at 5:45 saying she was exhausted. Any ideas before I take her to urgent care.","Doctor":"Hi, The most common cause of these symptoms-fever, headache, chills, and fatigue-would be a viral illness. Children can be infected by so many different viruses as they are being exposed to many for the first time, so their immune systems do not yet provide protection from these germs. It is most reassuring that she acts normally most of the day. If she had a serious illness like meningitis, she would be sick all of the time. Although, there is no documentation that giving a febrile child two medicines for fever is any better than giving just one, many parents give two. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi my baby is 7 months old...He is continuously losing water by stool..Doctors say it is diarrhea and have given medicines...but his excretion through stool somehow doesn t seem to stop..we are very tensed..6-7 days now...liquid stool isn t stopping... What medicine would you suggest?Gramogyl or what??","Doctor":"Hi, Babies who are breast fed rarely have diarrhea. A common cause of watery diarrhea in young infants is gastroenteritis due to a virus.  The virus causes inflammation of the inside lining of the small intestine.  This causes loss of the chemical that is normally on the intestinal lining that breaks down the sugar(lactose) that is in regular milk-based formula.  This sugar then is carried out the intestinal tract pulling water with it.  The results are frequent, watery stools. Another cause could be cow's milk allergy. His doctors have most likely already obtained stool specimens to look for infections. Soybean-based formula does not contain lactose and many parents offer this instead of milk-based formula when infant has diarrhea. I am uncomfortable in suggesting medicines to treat infantile diarrhea because of the concern for side effects. Hope I have answered your query.

(his Body weight 28 kg) as given by child specialist. But when he takes this medicine he has tendency for vomiting. I  actually dropped this medicine because I have seen some small spots in his body and thought to be measles. But my doctor told me that he was given vaccination, so he wanted to see my son and instructed me to use P-500 as it will work for headaches. What is opinion in this regard.","Doctor":"Hi, Since your young man is vomiting, he is not able to keep anything down.  This includes medicine. I have done some investigation and discovered that P-500 does not come in suppository form. I would recommend that you obtain acetaminophen suppositories to replace the oral medicine.  Should the suppository be soft, then place it in the refrigerator (NOT freezer) for 30minutes before administering. Place a small amount of Vaseline on the end to be inserted. Push with a finger (using a disposable glove) until all of the suppositories is within his rectum. Take your finger out and hold his buttocks together for a couple minutes. His dose should be 320-400 mg by rectum every 4-6 hours. If he needs this med. For more than2-3 days, he ought to be seen by his paediatrician. Sometimes if you give him nothing by mouth for 6-8 hours you allow time for his stomach to settle down. Then, if there has been no vomiting, begin with a few teaspoons of crushed ice.  Repeat in another hour. Next offer 2-3 oz of apple or pear juice. Then you can advance fluids as he desires. When he says he is hungry, let him eat anything he wishes.

My doctor has recommended for Taxim-o twice daily. But culture shows the component of Taxim-o resistant to E-coli. What shall I do, shall we continue with the same medicine or change?","Doctor":"Hi, The antibiotic being given to your baby for his UTI needs to be changed as soon as possible!  Continuing to take the medication that the E. coli is resistant to will not sterilize his urine to cure his UTI. And the longer he has the infection, the greater the chance of complications developing. Also, a young infant needs to have his urinary tract studied for any abnormalities when he gets a UTI(for example, ultrasound of kidneys, bladder, and urethra). Hope I have answered your query.

Lactose sensitivity is often seen in formula-fed infants. Breastfeed your baby & continue to give him the medications prescribed by the paediatrician. Make sure he is well hydrated. The mother should be cautious about what she is eating as the baby may develop food allergies on behalf of the food taken by the mother. Till the baby is not fine to take boiled food, avoid spicy oily junk food, avoid dairy & soy products & also eggs since you are breast feeding. Hope I have answered your query.

But she has frequent cough and vomit it looks common cold so I want to give her a viral syrup. so, my question is, is julmentin work with viral tretment like a ferin?","Doctor":"Hi, Julmentin is an antibiotic (like Amoxicillin) and despite my research, I was not able to find a drug named \\"Ferin.\\" A doctor makes a prudent decision when he/she takes the culture of the child's throat prior to prescribing an antibiotic. The reason for the culture is to see if the throat infection (or pharyngitis) is due to the strep bacteria. If it is, then giving the patient an antibiotic will shorten the child's discomfort. If the culture is negative for the strep germ, then her throat infection is caused by a virus which will not respond to an antibiotic. I feel as you do that an illness with throat infection, cough, and vomiting is likely to be caused by a virus. If your daughter is not dehydrated (no tears, no saliva, dry mouth and tongue, reduced urine output) and body temperature under 101, it will be safe to put her to bed with nothing given by mouth. This will allow her stomach to settle. When she awakes, offer a few spoonfuls of crushed ice chips. Then let her return to sleep. Should she wake again during the night, offer more ice chips. In the morning, if there has been no vomiting through the night and she is hungry, you may give her anything she wishes to eat. Then allow her to rest some more in bed. There are many cold and cough syrups sold in supermarkets and pharmacies.  Despite this, there is NO good evidence that they are effective and they certainly can cause side effects. This is even true for Codeine. If she stops vomiting, the best treatment for cough will be keeping her well hydrated (which will help her respiratory secretions become thin and watery and easier to cough out); give her throat lozenges. Hope I have answered your query.  If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help."},{"Patient":"my niece has had extreme lower abdominal pain and no pain relief is helping and she is in extreme pain for hours, up to 10hrs, started when she was carrying her son, spent 2 months in hospital and numerous tests have found nothing now this is happening again and morphine, tramadol (intravenis), panadol don't aid her in any way.

The best way to deal with it is to try to convince the kid that it is not only her but many kids of her age have this problem and they yet have to do what they have to do. Keep the child with you but try to be more interactive socially with others when the child is still on your lap so that she will learn to socialize and to be near strangers.

There is a relapsing course.  And there is a family history of (an allergic disease)eczema, asthma, or hay fever. What is it about your infant's eczema/rash that is \\"unusual\\"? Your daughter may have constipation because breast milk is so well absorbed by her gut that there may not be enough residue for her to poop frequently.

(her weight &height also perfect but she does not take her meal properly)...","Doctor":"Hello, Let me begin by saying that all tonics and medicines are unnecessary.  All attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped.  There must be no persuasion on your part, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening, and no punishment. All tricks to make her eat must be absolutely stopped.  No walking about the room. She should sit up at the table and eat the food or leave it.  Mother, you avoid anxious looks at the plate and no need for praise when she eats her dinner. No negative attitude if she does not eat and no suggestion that she is being naughty.  Your daughter should not be prevented from doing what she wants to do because she has not eaten her dinner.  If she does not want the meal, it should be taken from her. There should be nothing between meals. This includes milk.  She must wait until the next regular mealtime.  If it happens again at next meal, she should still be left without food.  She will soon eat when she gets hungry and no one makes a fuss about what she eats.  You may allow her to eat some of the meat course, then dessert, and return to the meat. Her mother, you, should make it plain that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it, she can leave, but that is all there is. Make her food attractive, with bright colors.  Put a small amount on her plate and let her ask for more.  There should be variety so she does not get tired of one food.  With her poor appetite,  give her no more than a pint of milk per day.  She should be allowed to help prepare the meal, helping with potatoes, fruit, and pastry.  Allow to have meals with her parents or other children. If she is playing with her food when the rest of the table has been cleared and washing up has been done, her food should be removed.  If she cries, make no fuss, just allow a reasonable amount of time for her to eat, and then without any threats or argument, remove the food. See that she gets as much outdoor exercise as possible and avoid over-fatigue. A healthy three-year old needs 11-12 hours of sleep over a 24 hour period. Hope I have answered your query.

It does not contain ingredients that will reduce his reflux.  Many infants with reflux and no weight loss, cough, or wheeze will thrive.  Infants with reflux usually get better over time with no treatment with the regurgitation beginning to resolve by the end of the first year.  Methods to reduce his reflux include frequent burping while feeding and holding him upright on your shoulder for 20-30 minutes after each feeding.  Your infant ought to be followed by his pediatrician for changes in feeding, weight, or respiratory complaints. If you make these changes and he is still not sleeping at night, you can think about adding rice cereal, one tablespoon, to two ounces of formula to thicken the milk.  This will increase the calories he takes in.  If you decide to do this, you should carefully crosscut the opening of the nipple, but this can lead to increases in coughing and gagging.  Should these suggestions be of no help, you should take your baby to his doctor for follow-up.  Hope I have answered your query.

Most recently I have noticed a smelly discharge coming from my belly button - it has been happening every couple of days at the moment. It leaks a clear smelly fluid. I cleaned it and the cotton wool was yellow after? For the last 5-6 weeks I've been suffering with a very bloated/ swollen stomach that gives me pain sometimes down low on the left near my pubis and sometimes the pain is high up by my navel. Along with this, I suffered a bout of strong nausea and have been having some pain between my shoulder blades. Also, I have had bad back pain for almost two years now that suddenly started one day when I was walking fast and it has never gone away. It is my lower back (tailbone area can be centered or to the left or right. But always in the same area of the lower back) that seems to get worse and feel tight when I walk at a decent pace. I have received physiotherapy on it, but it did nothing for the pain. I have not seen a doctor or had any tests about my back since the physio.Im wondering if these symptoms are consistant with anything? I am due to have an ultrasound scan soon on my stomach incase its anything to do with my ovaries/womb? I am sick of feeling sick! It seems something new is added to the list each week. Usually, I am very rarely ill. so all these symptoms are starting to get me down as I feel there is no diagnosis in sight. please advise if you can?","Doctor":"Hi there ~I understand your concerns.  The smelly discharge from your belly button is concerning and I am thinking that you have an infection there that needs to be treated.  It is not uncommon to have this sort of infection and systemic antibiotics need to be prescribed.  I hope you see a doctor for this as well as the other reasons you have been describing.  I feel like you may also have a urinary tract infection as well as something going on in your lower abdomen most probably your bowels, so a lower GI endoscopy might reveal your problems.  I also feel like you need a pelvic examination and an ultrasound from a gynecologist for the pain in your lower abdomen.I hope this helps.  Take care and have a lovely day!"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old has been throwing up for the past week. Watery stools soon follow the bout of vomiting. Its not all day.

Strong smelling farts as well.(Have not been concerned because throwing up has always been an issue, doctors can not figure out why. But she has never thrown up this many days in a row)","Doctor":"Hello, Please get the stool examination of child along with ultrasound abdomen to rule out any gut infection or gross abdomen pathology.

I have given her 0.5 ml per dose and four doses a day. So, I believe I have given her 200 mg per day. But on the packet of the medicine, it is written that it should not cross 60 mg per day. And overdose in infant is scary. Plz inform should I take her to doctor or my interpretation of dose guide is wrong.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would like to know why you felt you needed to give your 2 month old a dose of fever medicine.  Did she have a fever?  If she had a fever, what was it? Had she been acting ill- would not allow you to comfort her? not taking her milk like normal? vomiting?  diarrhea? For how many days did you give her Pacimol drops four times a day? Overdose of this medicine can damage the liver causing her skin and eyes to become yellow and bleeding to occur. If you gave her more than the label on the bottle said to give her for just one day and she is acting normally with normal skin coloration and no bleeding, I believe she will be okay if you just watch her and not give her any more Pacimol.  In the future carefully follow the directions on the bottle.  Did you give the medicine by dropper or syringe? If a two month old infant has a fever, it could be serious like meningitis, or it could be minor, like a cold.  It is important to know the cause of the fever in a young infant before giving the fever medicine. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi my 5 year old son has very congested the past week, I think it is due to high pollen.I have tried saline nasal spray to try and relieve congestion. However in the last few days he has had a nose bleed in the morning and then twice today.. he also had few spots on his bum the last few days nowhere else just his bum. What should I do.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Ask A Doctor.  I have read your query and here is my advice.   He may have nasal allergies. Nose bleeds can be caused by allergy.  Other signs of allergy include a personal or family history of hay fever, asthma, and eczema.  Does your son also have cough, a fast respiratory rate, or his neck muscles pulling when taking a breath?  These can be indications that he is working hard to breathe and are seen in respiratory infections below the nose, for example: croup ,pneumonia.    It would be helpful to know whether the spots on his bottom are raised, flat, circular, irregularly shaped, or itchy.  Keeping your son well hydrated will make his nasal secretions thin and watery and easier for him to blow out. Putting a small amount of Vaseline inside the front part of his nostrils may ease the irritation.  Oral medicines that can be taken at his age are: Loratadine(a non-sedating antihistamine for allergy) or pseudoephedrine(a decongestant).  Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Closure of the anterior (front) fontanel usually occurs between 4 and 26 months of age.  Was she a premature baby?  In preemies the closure of the anterior fontanel is delayed. A slight depression may be present for a time after the anterior fontanel closes. A sunken anterior fontanel is an important sign of dehydration in infants. Should she have a sunken fontanel, then she needs to be seen by a doctor right away. Premature babies usually feed every 2 hours, but a full-term infant has a large enough stomach to take enough milk to feed every 3-4 hours. Two months of age is a regular time to have a well-baby examination. I recommend that you make an appointment with her regular health care provider as soon as  possible for her check-up. The provider will check her weight and speak to you about her feedings at that time. I hope this is helpful to you.

Because of lack of effectiveness and potential for side effects cough and cold medications are not recommended for young child (less than 4-6 years old).

I have read your query and here is my advice. Are you certain that your grandson's rash is due to chickenpox? With the availability of the varicella (chickenpox)vaccine, chickenpox is much less common than it used to be. The vaccine is given in the USA to a healthy child in two doses: at 12-15 months of age and between 4 and 6 years of age. So it is possible that he is fully immunized against chickenpox already. However, if he does have chickenpox, it is absolutely essential that you take him to the doctor immediately! A complication of chickenpox is pneumonia.

Some physical causes of bad behavior in a young child include:-a certain type of seizure-diarrhea due to an illness that causes inflammation of the large intestine-brain tumor-various medications  A child can learn bad behavior by being allowed to wreck furniture, write on the wall, or ride tricycle around the room.  He must have discipline.  So when he is stopped from doing inappropriate or harmful things, he will not cry or have a temper tantrum.      Your grandson needs love, affection, and security.  When a child is behaving badly, unpleasant, bad tempered, it is then he MOST needs loving.   On some occasions children who injure themselves can have emotional problems.

One reason may be ear ache due to water retention after bath , that can lead to simple earache and otitis externa (ear infection), so that should be sorted out and taken care of.

It may be an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hyperactivity is a disorder of the mental makeup of the kid and not a physical deformity of the brain. Some kids may respond to iron simply and some kids my need other medications like Atomoxetine. But whatever it is the kids needs a thorough psychological evaluation and may be after behavioral therapy it might get better.

One doctor thought he had appendicitis but a cat scan did not show anything. One doctor said he has a infection, but did not give him any antibiotics. What should we do?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  Sometimes a low white blood cell count can be due to a viral infection and last for a couple of weeks.  There are other kinds of germs that  cause low white blood cell count.  These include bacteria, fungus, and germs carried by ticks.  When these ticks bite a human, he/she becomes infected.  Your list of your grandson's symptoms is worrisome.  Because a high fever with headache could possibly be due to meningitis which is a MOST serious infection of the coverings of the brain.  I strongly urge you to take him for medical care, perhaps this time to an emergency room right away!  Hope I have answered your query.  If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help.

Migraine headaches which she has never had before.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  If your daughter developed fever first and her eyes are red only over the whites of her eyeballs, with no swelling nor redness of her eyelids,and no drainage, then perhaps she is developing Kawasaki syndrome.  Other features that are part of this syndrome include:-red rash over the body-a strawberry tongue-redness of the lips followed by cracking and bleeding of lips-an enlarged gland in the neck-swelling of hands and feet  Your daughter needs to be seen by her pediatrician as soon as possible because Kawasaki's can involve the heart.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I wish I could ask you questions about your child's history.  Frequently, if one family member has migraine headaches, then another family member does also. Usually there is not red eyes with migraine.  Some people with migraines have a funny feeling or pain just before their headache begins; others do not.  Characteristic of a migraine's pain is that it has a pounding quality. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and vision changes such as seeing spots, blinking lights. Often persons with this type of headache have photophobia and phonophobia and get relief when lying down and sleeping.  Remember that I am unable to ask for more history nor can I perform a physical exam. My advice is just possibilities.  There are other conditions that cause fever as well as other conditions that cause headache.  I insist you take your child to her pediatrician AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Hope I have answered your query.

Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice which I trust will make your infant more comfortable.  The best treatment is 5% permethrin cream which should be applied from head to feet.  Leave it on her skin for 12 hours before you rinse it off.  Permethrin needs to be applied thoroughly in thin, even coat especially to web spaces between fingers and toes, navel, genitals, andthe crack between the buttocks.  Give a second treatment with permethrin one week later to kill any remaining insects.  Be aware that itching can persist for several weeks after treatment.It can be treated with anti-itch(e.g. Prax or Pramagel) or 1% hydrocortisone cream.  All available over-the-counter.  Three more bits of advice, please:-Clothing, towels, and bed linen need to be machine washed in HOT water and dried on HIGH-HEAT setting.-Household members and other close contacts should also be treated at the same time as your infant daughter is treated for the first time.-Those who are not infants should have the permethrin cream applied from neck to feet.

If the pain is easing on local pressure or raises the legs and increases on eating indicates that the pain below the naval may be due to :Lymph node mass or diverticulitis.It is also possible that it may be of he sensory nervous system, the nerves in the back being pressed by the compressing inter-vertebral discs.I would advise your friend to do the following:First of all get a clinical evaluation and physical examination done by a general Surgeon as the history is not going with any of the settled diagnostic character, in fact is contradictoryIt is possible that he is malignaring , telling the lies for whatever the reasons may be.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting, you need not worry. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops once daily for 14 days) and ORS , as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your pediatrician). Regarding diet - Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridge & soups.

The skin color that you describe on your granddaughter can  be very dark on the neck(and head), especially when there has been delay in delivery of the shoulders after the birth of the head.  The coloring disappears spontaneously in a few days.  Brief periods(a few seconds) of not breathing are common in normal full-term infants.  Periods of not breathing for more than 15 secondscan happen in normal newborns.  If the hospital felt your baby was stable and healthy, then there are no more tests that need to be done.

Both of these medications are frequently prescribed by psychiatrists to treat children who have depression.  A psychiatrist has more experience with these drugs than any other physician.  Each is usually an effective medicine. If a mental health doctor determines that his patient is not responding adequately to the first anti-depressant, he/she will frequently add a second one.  Please note that risperidone is sometimes prescribed also for irritability.  Since I do not know your son, I cannot give an opinion about whether he needs another evaluation; however, you are free to seek a second opinion(I hope from a pediatric psychiatrist.) or discuss with your son's current psychiatrist your dissatisfaction.  Whatever you decide, do NOT stop you son's medications without a doctor's instructions. The treating doctor has the responsibility to talk to you about how long your son will need to take his meds.

The first thing might be try to know whether the symptoms you are experiencing are also experienced by others who ate the same food. This could be important to give an idea on food intoxication. If others are not complaining, that it would be worthwhile somewhat avoiding the particular food type in future. Depending on whether you are experiencing only abdominal pain, or is accompanied by diarrheoa or vomoiting the management would be different. If pain is mainly above the navel and moving to the back, this could be indicative of gastritis, and if present, antacids could give relief. If its only abdominal colics, anti spasmodic drugs could help for now.In case symptoms persist for two or more days, you might to consult your primary care physician for reevaluation.

I want help in this regard Her Date of Birth is 15th Mar 2013, Age: 4.5 Years, Weight: 15.5 Kilograms FIRST ATTACK: The first attack happened on 27.07.17 morning @ 5:30 am, my daughter 4.5 year old suddenly started crying in sleep and was yelling that something was happening to her leg, when I checked immediately, her left leg was shaking. Immediately I massaged her leg and make her stand but she was not able to stand and her legs were loose and she was not able to control her leg movements. Later I make her sit on stool and massaged her leg after that she was ok and was playing actively as usual. Later seeing her active I went to office at 7:40am on that day. This episode lasted 1.5 minutes & she was conscious during this period. When I was in office my wife called me at 8:15am again said her leg was again paining & jerking, her left leg became hard and she fell down shaking her left leg and body. She has massaged her leg and within 1 â 1.5 minute she was again normal playing as usual. I came and took her to local pediatrician who has said that it may be due to calcium deficiency and prescribed calcium syrup. Again after coming back from doctor while she was playing again her left leg muscles became stiff and again her left leg was shaking at 11:30 am. Again the same has repeated at 3:00 PM. We have rushed to our regular family pediatrician on that day at by 6:00 PM and at 6:15 PM at his table the same has repeated. On seeing her doctor has said that she is having Simple Focal Seizures and she was admitted to the Hospital HOSPITALIZATION: Immediately we rushed her to Hospital by 27.07.17 evening 8 PM, she was kept on Anti-convulsion IV Fluids and a series of tests have been done on her. Next day all test results were reviewed by Pediatric Neurologist and she said that all other reports were normal but need to start LEVIPIL Syrup (Composition: Levetiracetam -100mg/ml) as she got that many attacks on one single day, They have suggested to use 2ml Levipil twice per day with Multi Vitamin Syrups and was discharged. (I have attached Test Reports during Hospitalization) Next Attack: Later after discharge since she was absolutely OK, I have not started Levipil and have given Multi Vitamins only. On 31.07.17 at 9:43 AM again she got the attack similarly her left leg muscles became stiff and her left leg was shaking, she was totally conscious and was responding to all the commands given by us. Immediately we have called our Pediatric Neurologist and she asked us to start 2 ml Levipil immediately. Later after starting the same the Seizure attacks were stopped. On 09.09.17 (40 Days After starting the medicine) Again on this day 09.09.17 at 5:30 PM similar attack has happened, Her left leg became stiff and was shaking. She was conscious during this period. What has happened on this day was, I forgot to give medicine on morning. The dose was delayed by 3 Hrs in the morning. Upon consulting our Pediatric Neurologist, she suggested not to miss the dose and we will increase the dose if it seizure repeats only. Later we have made sure that she gets the medicine correctly and later the seizures had stopped. So we were continuing the same dose of 2ml Levipil twice per day and maintained timings strictly On 26.10.17 (46 Days after Previous Attack) Despite adhering to strict timing in medicine dose on 26th Oct â17 at 5:00 PM, she has got similar attack immediately when she came back from school. Her left leg became stiff and was shaking, she was conscious during this period and responding to all commands given by us. Upon consulting our Pediatric Neurologist, she suggested to increase Levipil Dose from 2 ml to 3 ml twice per day. Since she was going through exams in the school, I thought that this was due to stress of exams and I have increased the dose from 2ml to 2.5 ml twice per day, and later she was OK. Her body weight on this day was 16.1 Kg On 29.10.17 (Within 3 Days after Previous Attack) Despite after increasing the Levipil dose from 2ml to 2.5ml Twice per day on 29th Octâ17 at 3:20 PM, she has got again similar attack. As suggested by our Pediatric Neurologist, I have increased the dose again from 2.5 ml to 3ml Twice per day and started observing her. On 31.10.17 at 7:20 AM (Within 1.5 Days after Previous Attack) Despite increasing the dosage to 3ml she has again got the similar attack on 31.10.17 at 7:20 AM but this time the duration was less compared to 1 to 1.5 Minute previously it was now nearly 40 Secs. Upon consulting our Pediatric Neurologist, she suggested to continue 3 ml twice per day, till next 5 days as it will take some time to settle and we will wait for the dose to work, and she said that if the dosage is not working we will increase to 3.5ml twice per day. On 31.10.17 at 7:40 PM (Within 12 Hrs after Previous Attack) Again similar attack came in the evening at 7:40 PM with same 30-40 Sec duration, as suggested we have continued 3 ml twice per day dosage On 01.11.17 at 8:30 AM (Within 13 Hrs after Previous Attack) Again similar attack came in the morning at 8:30 AM with same 30-40 Sec duration, as suggested we are continuing 3 ml twice per day dosage On 01.11.17 Evening, I have increased the dosage of Levipil from 3ml to 3.5ml Twice per day On 03.11.17 Morning at 8:45 AM again she has got similar attack As per Doctor advice, not increased the dose further and kept at 3.5 ml only From last one week (26.10.17) she has got 5 attacks and the duration between attacks is gradually reducing, I am very much worried on the condition of my daughter, please guide me what to do. Also I have few questions on my mind. 1.     Why is she getting attacks again from last one week despite correct medical dose 2.     Is there any diet related issue to this, I have made few inclusions in the diet of my daughter from last one month apart from regular diet a.     Added habit of eating nuts in her daily diet at evening after coming from school â 5 Nos Cashew Nuts, 5 Nos Hazel Nut, 5 Nos Pista, 2 Nos Dried Cranberry & 5 Nos Almond b.     Daily one boiled egg c.     Changed from Low fat milk to High Fat Milk d.     Started using Pediasure Powder with milk e.     Weekly Twice Lamb curry (Mutton) with Liver 3.     What is the long term from here, will she be coming out from this with use of medicines, our doctor has said that long term treatment is required and we have to use medicines may be for 1 or 2 years timeline 4.     Apart from seizure attacks, she is totally normal in her behavior & activities and is actively playful. Not able to understand why so many attacks are happening? 5.     Is there any other alternate treatment for this in Homeopathy or Ayurveda for this condition 6.     I have seen online sites that reducing Carbohydrates will reduce the tendency for seizures, how far this is correct Seizures Episodes Summary Till Now: 27.07.17 5:30 am, 8:30 am, 11:30 am, 3:00 pm, 6:15 pm [5 Attacks on this day] Hospitalized on 27th July 8pm 31.07.17 9:43 AM Levipil started from 31st July 17 09.09.17 (40 Days After starting the medicine) 6:45 pm Morning Medicine delayed by 3 Hrs on this day 9th Sept 26.10.17 (46 Days after Previous Attack) 5:00 pm Suspected Exam stress Increased Levipil Dosage from 2ml to 2.5 ml 29.10.17 (Within 3 Days after Previous Attack) 3:20 pm Increased Levipil Dosage from 2.5ml to 3ml 31.10.17 (Within 1.5 Days after Previous Attack) 7:20 AM, Continuing same dose 31.10.17 (Within 12 Hrs after Previous Attack) 7: 40 PM, Continuing same dose 01.11.17 (Within 13 Hrs after Previous Attack) 8:30 AM, Continuing same dose On 01.11.17 evening, increased dosage from 3ml twice to 3.5ml Twice Again on 03.11.17 again she got similar attack at 8:40 AM","Doctor":"Hello.  Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  To begin with, I think you are a highly intelligent person.  You have presented the most complete accounting of your child's history than any other parent I have seen since starting work with 'Ask A Doctor.'  This is a great aid to me.  Thank you.     The anti-seizure medication your daughter's neurologist(I hope this doctor is a pediatric neurologist) is one that is often given to pediatric patients.  To be effective in controlling seizures, anti-seizure medicines must obtain a certain level in the blood.  (Levels are different for each medicine.)  When a new seizure medicine is begun, it usually takes several doses to reach this level in the patient's blood.  If a medicine is taken once or twice a day, then it will take a few days to reach this level.  Sometimes doctors draw blood from their patient and send it to the lab to determine the blood level.  Causes of seizures despite taking anti-seizure medicine:-not giving medicine as prescribed-missing doses -patient gaining weight-lack of adequate sleep(A five year old child ought to have 11-12 hours of sleep in 24 hours.)-taking other drugs that interfere with the seizure medicine-there are patients who require more than one medicine to control seizures  May your daughter do well.

Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  Dysuria and hematuria  can be due to kidney disease, sexual abuse, urinary tract infection, or bladder stones.  When did your son's incontinence begin?  Has your son ever been continent of urine?  Is he wet all of the time?  Only during the day?  Only at night?  Is he ever dry?  Constipation can be a cause of urinary incontinence. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Has he injured his left shoulder and chest?  Did he do vigorous exercise prior to onset of the pain?  In addition to a fractured boneother possibilities are a pulled elbow or inflammation of the thin tissue that covers the lungs.  Does he have any nausea or vomiting, abnormal eye movements, or ringing in his ears(which are related to dizziness)?  Is he able to ride his bicycle without difficulty(which is related to weakness)?------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Since his shoulder pain, dizziness, and weakness are so recent in onset, perhaps we can put them aside for the present, see how he does over the next several days,and concentrate on his kidneys.  May I ask, what were symptoms that lead to the diagnosis of kidney disease?  Does a pediatric nephrologist monitor your son?  How often is your child see by the kidney specialist?  Does your son take any medication?  How are his lab studies doing? Complete Blood Count, BUN, and Serum Creatinine.

But it happens more often in teens who have attentional disorders, reading difficulties, substance or alcohol abuse, and sleep deprivation(An adolescent the age of your son should get 9 to 9 and a half hours of sleep a night.)  Teens who have attention deficit or learning disabilities can be forgetful because of deficiencies in ability to ORGANIZE, remember, and complete tasks.  May I suggest that your son take the same dose of the medicine that he will be taking during the school year. So that his doctor can seen how effective it is and whether your son has any side effects.  Of course, these meds are started at a low dose and increased gradually every week or so.

Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  A side effect of Motrin(ibuprofen) is to cause stomach inflammation which can make the stomach's inside lining bleed. The blood is carried along with intestinal contents through the entire intestinal tract.  By the time it reaches the end it is black and makes stool black.  Blueberries, Pepto-Bismol, and iron supplements also make stool black.  A hive rash is an allergic rash and could be due to Motrin, especially if the hives appeared very soon after you gave him the dose.  Tylenol does not irritate the stomach and is safer.   Hard stool is usually due to not enough liquid intake.  You may want to try giving apple and pear juices.  If that doesn't help, prune juice, 1-2ounces one-two times per day might be beneficial.  Frequent colds and coughing could be from being in close contact with other young children who are infected with various viruses.  How old is your child?  Does he attend daycare?  Also, cold and cough syrups are NOT recommended to give to children five years or under because their is no evidence that they are effective for colds and they have side effects.

She seemed exhausted as were we, wanted to give her a nice bath upon arriving home, but she wouldn t have it. It was a heart wrenching situation and as grandparents, we feel so badly for her. Her mom has said that she has meltdowns , but we never realized it was like this. She had one after going last Tuesday after going halloweening in her neighborhood.","Doctor":"Hello.  Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  You must have been frightened when you witnessed your granddaughter's behavior.  You did the right thing coming for help.  I want to give you insight about her problem.  Temper tantrums can occur between one year and five years of age.Children who aren't able to express their feelings with words are more likely to continue having tantrums.  These types of children include those with speech and language delays and those with autism spectrum disorders.  Tantrums that are severe, frequent, or persist after the age of five years can be a sign of depression, low self-esteem, ADHD.  Children who hurt themselves, destroy property, or utter phases which express low self-esteem like, \\"I hate myself, no one loves me,\\"may have significant emotional problems.  Tantrums occurring frequently in school can be a sign of learning disabilities or speech and hearing problems.  From what you have shared with me I feel she is not having the usual kind of temper tantrum.  Your granddaughter should be evaluated by a child psychiatrist who can provide talk therapy and prescribe medication should the latter be necessary.  Hope I have answered your query.  If you have any further questions,I will be happy to help.  Arnold Zedd, MD, FAAP"},{"Patient":"My child is suffering from fever which comes a gap of 6-7 days after July.

Please suggest me is it normal or otherwise","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your doctor is right in telling that it is seasonal change induced recurrent viral illness. I will explain you how a viral illness behaves - so that you can be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope I have answered your query.

He has has these before in the winter, so we didn t think too much of it. (There is a humidifier in his bedroom that runs all night every night, and we put Vaseline in his nostrils at bedtime.) Just a few days later, he had a meltdown from being overly tired, and his nose started to bleed again. Just a little this time; it stopped fairly quickly. After this episode, he developed a hacky, dry cough, and he s had another incident of his nose bleeding slightly when he started to cry. He doesn t have a fever, but this dry cough has persisted for two and a half days now, and he s never had nose bleeds this frequently before. We have just today added a larger humidifier in our living area of the house to see if that will help. He takes a high-quality multi vitamin every morning, and we are adding a children s C supplement now. Any ideas what this could be? (It hasn t been a particularly cold or dry winter here.)","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Ask A Doctor Service.  I reviewed your query and here is my answer.In such a patient,  there needs some tests to find out whats causing him nasal bleeding. Cough can be explained by nosebleed. Does he bleed from any other place or is there any rash or petechae on his body? Is there any bleeding disorder in your family? How about his platelet counts? If there is no to all these questions, does he had of habit of pricking his nose or putting his fingers in nose frequently? As this has increased in frequency,  so you need to consult your doctor.  Till that, keep applying vaseline to his nose at least twice a day, keep him away from heat and dry environment and restrain him from putting fingers in his nose. If there is a bleed, then apply pressure on nose, keep his head tilted forward and if available put ice packs or pour water over his head.Hope i answered your question.

When the surgeon came out of surgery he was so concerned with how her tonsils literally fell apart because they were so rotted. - 3 years they replaced her tubes again because the previous ones fell in to the back of her ear drum so they had to surgically remove.

I have reviewed your daughter's history and here is my advice.  Unfortunately middle ear infections are common in children.  Some, like Grace, have many in the early years of their lives and undergo surgery for tube placement, drum reconstruction, and adenoid removal.  There are some diseases called immunodeficiency disorders that predispose people to infections because their immune system is weak.  One of these diseases may cause a person to have frequent skin infections while another makes the patient suffer with many respiratory infections.   Her history of abnormal tonsils, frequent middle ear infections(she is fortunate that her hearing is intact), abscessed teeth, and MRSA(where on her body did she have this infection?) makes me suspicious about an immunodeficiency. I believe you should make an appointment for her to be seen by a pediatric allergist/immunologist or pediatric immunologist.  These specialists are likely to be found at a university medical center.  Be sure to take her medical records with you. Final advice: she should avoid persons who smoke as this predisposes to ear infections and make sure she gets a yearly flu shot.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastro-colic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting. You need not worry.

Easy bruising can be due to Vitamin K deficiency, a reduced number of platelets in blood stream, a different type of hemoglobin than usual in the red blood cells in the blood stream, absence of clotting factors(proteins) in the blood stream, different malignancies, medicines.    You should know more about your son's condition than just his medications.  For instance, eye problems are especially associated with one type of JRA.   From what you have shared, yes, I feel you ought to get a second opinion from a pediatric rheumatologist, please.  He/she will provide you with more information about JRA and inform you if your child needs to be seen by a blood specialist(pediatric hematologist).  Kindly make an appointment as soon as possible.  Hope I have answered your query.  If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help.

Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor\\".  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  I think this preschooler is fortunate to have a caring grandmother.  I have concern about her diagnosis.  Although you have told only a small amount about her behavior, crying and throwing objects are not typical of ADHD.    Your granddaughter may be having temper tantrums instead.  If she does, it is very important that you don't teach her that her behavior can be controlled by force.    A clinical psychologist can teach you how to change her behavior in a parent or grandparent coaching program as well as confirm that she is having temper tantrums.  Hope I have answered your query.  If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help.  Arnold Zedd, MD, FAAP"},{"Patient":"My 2 year old got a circumcision when he was born, but I dont think the doc took enough foreskin. He is compiling of penis pain with every diaper change. The foreskin never fully receded to make the mushroom cap penis tip either. Does he need to have a surgery to correct this?","Doctor":"Hello.  Welcome to 'Ask A Doctor'.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.   From what you have described, there is a good possibility that his initial circumcision will need to be revised.  To get the best opinion I highly recommend that you take him to a pediatric urologist.  If you reside in a small community that does not have a pediatric urologist, it will be well worth a drive to a community that does.  Hope I have answered your query.

And now we brought Powergyl to give him, please suggest quantity of medicine and how frequently should I provide him. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello.  Welcome to \\"Ask A Doctor'.  I have read your query and here is my advice.  The fish he ate would not be the cause of his diarrhea unless it was under-cooked.  Did any other family member eat the fish?  Do they have loose motions?  Has he been in contact with any other person with diarrhea?  Does he attend daycare?  If your child is otherwise acting normally, has no fever, eating and drinking, and loose motions do not contain blood, then he most likelyhas a viral intestinal infection.  This usually goes away without treatment within 2-3 days.  The maker of Powergyl Suspension says it is for treatment of many infections: stomach, intestinal, ulcers, eye&ear, as well as other infections in body.  It contains two different antibiotics.  Please be aware that antibiotics are a common cause of loose motions.  Their side effects include:-blurred vision-nausea-abdominal pain-chills-itching-vomiting  A website, NOT the maker of this medicine, says it can be used 2-3times a day.  The possible harm from this medicine clearly outweighs any benefit.Do not give this to your child.  If he develops dry skin, dry mouth and lips, no tears, reduced urine orthe loose motions continue for greater than 4-5days, let him be seen by his pediatrician.  Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would like to know: -how long has she been ill? '-has she lost any weight? -does she take any medicines? -does your daughter vomit at other times? During the night awakening her from sleep? Early morning? -headaches or change in vision? -any family history of vomiting or abdominal pain? -what does \\"Fri k\\"(at the end of description of daughter's problem) mean? If she vomits directly after eating and vomitus contains undigested food, the cause could be from the esophagus.  Should the vomitus contain food and begin several minutes after eating or later, the source is likely in the stomach.  Pain that worsens with food can suggest one cause while pain relieved by food might mean another. The pain's location is also significant-around the navel, lower belly, upper right side.

I have read your query and here is my advice. I am sorry that both of you are having these issues with your adolescent son. First, let me say a pinworm can migrate from the perianal area to the urethra(tube in center of penis that drains urine from bladder to outside the body) and cause irritation or infection. Please tell me what you mean in your question, \\"spend a week and hospice\\" and \\"this test go away.\\" As I don't know where you are, I hope this is appropriate. I am in USA and, of course, it is summer here.  Try making personal hygiene a play activity.  Have all the family members who will participate put on their bathing suits, go outside into the yard, and spray (gently) one another with water.  Try doing this as often as once a day, if possible. Initially,use no soap.  If your son tolerates this, then after several days, add a body cleanser or children's shampoo. Put it on your skin and underarms first, then hand him the bottle and encourage him to do the same. Some of the suds will probably get between his bathing suit and genital area.Who diagnosed your son with Asperger's.  Has he been evaluated by a mental health professional?  Is he being seen regularly by this professional?  Is he taking any medication? It is most important that his aggression be treated.  This will enable his psychiatrist(Ideally, he ought to be seen by an adolescent psychiatrist.) to more effectively treat his Asperger's and maybe remain in school longer.How long has he been going to school for just one hour four days a week? Is he in Special Education?  How is he doing academically? Maybe the psychiatrist can suggest a more appropriate school setting. The police have already been involved!  This is a critical situation!

I would like to know how many weeks was the pregnancy and what his birth weight and current weight are.  Has he been on Similac Neosure Preemie Formula since birth?  When did he start to become fussy?  Does he cry all the time?  In what position is he when fed?  Does he spit up or vomit?  If you hold him upright while feeding and for 20-30 minutes afterwards and he doesn't cry, then it is possible that he could have reflux of formula out of stomach and back up into esophagus.  Because premature infants weigh less than full-term babies, formulas for premature infants contain more calories per ounce than formulas given to full-term babies.

Do report these changes to your treating doctor, so that your child may be under proper medication. But, if you see symptoms like swollen glands, painful sores, difficulty in coordination while walking, dark urine, stomach pain, flu like symptoms or worsening seizures you need to meet your doctor in ER and get your son examined.

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As you described sweating it indicates heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the needs of body. Certainly time to do something. Every operative procedure has its risks involved. But if not treated risk of increasing current heart failure is more. Usually after procedure the symptoms resolve and growth of child improves. The heart comes to normal size in some weeks. So need to understand risks involved in treatment and leaving it alone. For more detailed counseling meet your cardiologist.

I took him to a Pediatrician and his diagnosis was of Pharyngitis. He prescribed him Amoxicillin (250 mg thrice daily), Asthalin Syrup (Salbutamol + Albuterol) four times a day and TusQ-DX Syrup (Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine + Dextromethorphan) three times a day. His condition did not improve so I took him to the same doctor again and he said my child is suffering from Allergic Bronchitis. So he replaced Amoxicillin with Cefixime (100mg, twice a day) and replaced TusQ-DX with Coffdryl (Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate) three times a day. He also asked to give him nebulization twice a day using mixture of saline water and Salbutamol. My child s condition improved a little bit but not to the doctor s satisfaction so he has now prescribed Wysolone (Prednisolone 10 mg) and asked us to give him three tablets per day for six days.

He recently started guanfacine 1mg amn (about a month), one half tab twice daily. he also takes melatonin to help him sleep, the melatonin occasionally stops being effective however this time around the doctor prescribed clonidine 0.1mg uni one half tab in evening with tenex to replace melatonin. ( that started 3 days ago) My understanding is it will reset his melatonin in his body so he can then again use melatonin to help him fall to sleep.... Unfortunately I was unaware he had started this med and I gave him his full dose of melatonin last night. I am unsure how he slept the 1st night but last night he awoke several times throughout the night screaming and crying, He does not communicate well because of the autism but when asked he indicated his tummy hurt. Tonight now aware of this new med I did not give him melatonin and again he awaoke even worse that last night. So out of character that I wondered if perhaps he was having a night terror, I could not tell if he was truly awake of not. I was very concerned that he was in some type of legitimate pain that he could not communicate to me. he has gone back to sleep now but his mother said she was told this is normal. It is his bodies way of dealing with resetting itself ...... His mother, We all do need help for him so he s well rested among other things but I am concerned.

I am looking for information on how to talk to my girls and tools I can teach my children to help them deal with this type of behaviour. What can you suggest? They might be with this little girl for the next 8 years of school and I want to prepare them appropriately.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I salute you for wanting your young daughters to understand about persons who are different than they are. Children with reactive associative disorder have markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating to others. Reactive associative disorder occurs when attachment between a young child(less than 5 years old) and her primary caregiver(usually mother) does not occur or is interrupted by grossly negligent care.  There is not the love, warmth, and understanding normally shown in a healthy parent-child relationship. These children are at higher risk for depression, aggressive behavior, learning difficulties, and behavior problems in school.  They have low self-esteem and cannot form meaningful relationships. They can have constant need for attention and nonstop chattering.  If their classmate is unwilling to interact with them, back off and don't force.  But keep trying regularly to help her. Creating a routine for a child with reactive associative disorder helps her feel safe and relaxed.  Avoid changes in routine which can be stressful. Most children with RAD do not like to be touched. Maybe she will accept a high-five or fist to fist motion. With treatment it is possible for children with RAD to learn to trust others and lead healthy, productive lives. With empathy from your children, maybe their new classmate can become their friend. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hello.

He is somewhat hyperactive and irritable, with a bit of a temper, but not dramatically so compared to other boys at that age. His current physician suspects a thyroid problem, but physically the boy has no signs of enlargement of the neck. The physician’s physical examination does not reveal obvious thyroid enlargement, but he has a high resting heart rate for a boy of that age. What tests might you suggest to further explore what might be wrong with him? If it is indeed a thyroid problem, what possible metabolic defects might lead to the observed presentation? If you ran tests and found that circulating thyroid hormone was higher than normal, what might this indicate? How could you treat this condition? What would happen if nothing is done for him","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Thyroid may or may not be increased in size in hyper or hypothyroidism. The symptoms you nicely described indicated indeed possibility of hyperthyroidism. If hyperthyroidism is found (high free T4 and free T3 and low or variable level of TSH depending on underlying cause) the cause is to be found out. Most commonly in adolescent age is occurs due to presence of thyroid stimulationg antibodies. Further anti TPO and anti Tg test will be needed to r/o Hashimoto. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid drugs primarily and if needed surgically. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  I assume that the initial testing for food allergies was a skin test, called the prick test.  Negative tests are accurate for excluding food allergy.However, positive tests can occur in patients without symptoms related to a particular food. The blood tests were most likely RAST testing.  Some allergists believe the RAST has no advantage over skin testing.  Not too long ago there was a study in the medical journal, Pediatrics,(journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics) which said that neither skin-prick tests nor RAST testing are diagnostic of food allergy.What this tells us is that these tests are not perfect to diagnose food allergy.

You describe your infant has having acute gastroenteritis(vomiting and diarrhea). This is most likely due to a virus. Does he attend daycare where he could have acquired the virus from the other children? The initial concern is he dehydrated? Signs of dehydration include: - Does not make tears when he cries - Dry lips, tongue, and mouth - When you gently pinch the skin over his abdomen, it feels doughy and takes 2-3 seconds to fall back into place -He wets his diaper with less frequency than when he is well Does he have a temperature greater than or equal to 101 degrees?  If he does not show signs of dehydration and does not have a high temperature, it is safe for you to keep him at home. I recommend that you give him nothing by mouth for the next 4-6 hours.  If he does not vomit during this period, then offer him a couple ounces of room temperature Pedialyte or apple or pear juice.  Cold fluids will cause his stomach to cramp. After another 2-4 hours, again if there is no vomiting, you can offer your son 3-4 ounces more of fluids. You may continue this protocol for another 1-2 times.  If at any time. After he retains fluids for the first time, he indicates he wants something to eat, then you may give him a small amount of anything he would like.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The most dreaded cause for pain in testis in an adolescent male is Torsion of testis, which means the testis rotates or twists on its own axis (like the pendulum inside the bell). It is at risk to lose its blood supply if such an unfortunate event occurs. And the golden period before it could be saved is just 6 hours. Means within six hours, surgery has to be done to correct the problem and save the testicle. Your grandson's pain is not typical of this dreaded problem. But there is a clinical variant called intermittent Torsion which can cause pain on and off. The examination done in the normal period is generally unremarkable. A doppler study of testis during such painful episode may help. Nevertheless, it's advisable to rush to a nearby hospital whenever he develops acute pain. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  First of all, let me say that many times constipation with the retention of stool took a while to develop in a young child. So please be patient; it's going to take some time to be corrected.  It is important that your daughter has maintained  normal appetite and growth.  She needs to have a current weight and height measured.   Have you been observing how much your daughter eats?  Because if she is really not taking in enough calories for growth and losing weight, then she does not have the most common cause of constipation at her age- functional constipation (in which the gastrointestinal anatomy is normal) and MUST have a medical evaluation to find the cause of her constipation so it can be properly treated.  I am not happy that I have to turn you away without an answer to your problem, but I want to give you the best advice that I can.

Does your toddler attend daycare where he might have gotten a germ from another child?  If he is an otherwise healthy child and has not been exposed to farm animals or contaminated water, then he probably has gastroenteritis due to a virus.  In a young child who has vomiting and diarrhea, the most important thing to do initially is make sure he does not become dehydrated.  I suggest that he not be given anything by mouth for the next 6-8hours.  If he hasn't vomited, offer 2-3 ounces of room temperature Pedialyte , apple juice, or pear juice.  After another 2-3 hours, if there is again no vomiting, offer the same amount of fluids.  Allow him to sleep.  When he awakens, if he wants to eat, let him select whatever he wishes to eat.  Usually the diarrhea runs its course in a couple of days.   Monitor for dehydration.  Signs include:-no tears-dry tongue and lips-gently pinch skin of belly, if it takes 2-3 seconds to fall back into place,- then it is doughy- a sign of dehydration-reduced urine output  Should your son not stop vomiting within the next 24 hours or should he show sign of dehydration, then you need to take him to primary care doctor or to emergency room.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In my opinion, only high fever does not suggest flu (H1N1 influenza). Oseltamivir is the drug for prophylaxis and treatment of H1N1 influenza. Oseltamivir should only be taken when you have - - Clinical features suggestive of H1N1 infection (high grade fever, rashes, sore throat) - history of contact with confirmed H1N1 case - when there is outbreak of H1N1  in your area. In my opinion, Oseltamivir should not be given to your child (with only fever). It is advisable to consult your doctor  and  have detailed check up of your child. Hope I have answered your query.

When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out.

Change the steroid to a topical steroid(lotion or cream preparation) and stop giving steroid by mouth. There are newer, non-steroid topical medications to treat inflamed skin. They are tacrolimus and pimecrolimus (these are prescription only). They should be used only on active areas of inflammation and not to use long-term. Hope I have answered your query.

However, speech/ language appear WNL, as do gross and fine motor skills. No overt vision or hearing impairment. Social skills appear age appropriate. She likes both active and still tasks. NKA, no known health concerns. Could you suggest where to start? I think perhaps a developmental pediatrician would be best ? Thank you for your assistance. Rebecca","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. By what you say she is just having temper tantrums and as you said developmental pediatrician would be the best. Tantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable; or because they can't get something (for example, an object or a parent) to do what they want. Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time. Tantrums are common during the second year of life, a time when language skills are starting to develop. Because toddlers can't yet say what they want, feel, or need, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease. This is what you can do to avoid or prevent tantrums - 1. Give plenty of positive attention 2. Try to give toddlers some control over little things 3. Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach 4. Distract your child 5. Help kids learn new skills and succeed 6. Consider the request carefully, when your child wants something 7.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  There is more than one cause of bacterial meningitis.  The routine well-child vaccines that he should have received by four years of age will protect him against some of them.  If he is an otherwise healthy child, there is another vaccine that he is too young to have been given.  It is called the meningococcal vaccine given in two doses- one at age 11-12yrs and the second half at 15-16yrs old.  Additionally, there are many viruses that can cause viral meningitis.

Infection of the epiglottis is life threatening.  The child refuses to lie down, drooling, may be coughing and having difficulty breathing.

I met a general physician and prescribed CYPON syrup.....In the reviews i see CYPON is for more allergic treatments....can u pl advise? Thnaks, Hari","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to \\"Ask A Doctor\\" service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The medicine in Cypon is an antihistamine and some antihistamines are  appetite stimulants. Cypon contains this kind of antihistamine.  You are correct that Cypon is more often for allergic conditions ; the Cypon antihistamine also treats people's allergies.  Side effects of appetite stimulants are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, blurred vision, fatigue, nervousness and dizziness and they should be avoided if the patient has diabetes.    Unfortunately you have shared very little about your daughter's problem.But as I wish to help you and her, allow me to take you in a direction that  just might assist you. Anorexia nervosa is a common eating disorder that affects adolescent females.  Characteristics are the patient sees herself as being too fat even when she is underweight, refuses to keep a normal body weight, intense fear of becoming fat, excessive exercise, absence of three or more menstrual cycles without another cause and denies feeling hungry.  She may be socially withdrawn, irritable, depressed, have abdominal pain, and fatigue.This condition is most serious.  IF this is what she has, it can progress to need for hospitalization and even passing away.   She needs to have a medical evaluation in more than a superficial way.This to include a complete general physical examination because the reason for poor appetite could be something else.  Should the pediatrician who does the complete physical agree that an eating disorder is possible, than your daughter needs to be evaluated by a child and adolescent psychiatrist who is experienced in treating adolescents with eating disorders.   Please think about what I have typed.  Certainly discuss with your husband.  And select a physician(hopefully a pediatrician that both of you trust) who will agree to speak with you(even if he/she requires payment)alone about her situation.  Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  The one number that is not normal is in the differential comment.  It c 1,008cells/uL.  This is low for a 4year old.  A low neutrophil count is known as neutropenia.  Neutropenia plus periodic fevers is called cyclic neutropenia.  This condition has episodes(about every three weeks with each episode lasting about one week) of fever, enlarged lymph nodes(or \\"glands\\"), skininfections, muscle pains, or pneumonia.  The diagnosis is made by repeating the blood test that you placed in the User's Question three times a week for two months unless the neutropeniais confirmed sooner.

They sent me home saying probably the weather change. Today I told her to stick her tongue out so I could see how her throat looked. I was extremely panicked to see her epiglottis. Is this normal? Ive never seen it before , also I have 3 other children and Ive never seen anything like this appear out of no where. Im quite certain it wasnt there before as she has had a swallow study and camera run through her nose by an ENT and they didnt say anything about this. Only diagnosis she had at that time was underdeveloped rings which improved with age and silent reflux which also imporved. Is this normal and could this be the reason she wont eat ?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to \\"Ask A Doctor\\" service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Yes, her epiglottis has always been just below her throat and above her vocal cords in the same position as the epiglottis in your other children.  In my experience as a pediatrician when peering into the open mouth of a child, I have often seen their epiglottis.  For the most part these have been young, healthy children and I was looking into their mouth and throat as part the routine physical exam.  The children had opened their mouths very wide.  In each of these patients the epiglottis was normal. Has she ever refused to swallow before?  Does she have fast, labored breathing?  Is she able to swallow her saliva?  My suspicion as to why your infant won't swallow is that it is probably due to silent reflux.  A patient who has silent reflux has a backup of stomach acid into their throat, esophagus, and larynx.  Also, area below the vocal cords may be narrowed.  Somewhere in this part of her upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract there may be irritation or blockage.  If she is not eating, is she drinking?  It is vital that she not become dehydrated.  I urge you to take her back to the ENT doctor as soon as possible.  Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.  Tremors are non-intentional rhythmic movements of a body part(s). No diagnostic test confirms the condition.  The diagnosis of a tremor is based on the doctor's examination of the child's movements. There is a hereditary form of tremor in which several family members are affected; there is another form in which only one family member has tremor. Tremors can happen after injury to brain, low blood sugar, and hyperthyroidism. Tremors can increase when the child has anxietyor fatigue. Since there are other neurologic conditions that resemble tremors, I suggest your grandchild be seen by a pediatric neurologist to verify that she does have a tremor, what type it is, prognosis, and does it requiretreatment.

I want to ask can I give mextra syrup along with nebuliser. Also how can i prevent her from getting cough and cold so frequent. It’s like after every 15 days she is sick with same cough n cold. Is it because of pollution or poor immunity.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Anti histaminics like Maxtra can be combined with bronchodilators like Levolin. They help the child symptomatically. The cause for common cold as you know is self limiting viral infections. Bronchodilators are useful if the child develops a sensitive respiratory tract that causes spasm of the airways during the infection or sometimes after the infection. As these viruses spread through air they are extremely contagious and the only way of prevention is following the general hygiene measures like hand washing, controlled coughing and sneezing, avoiding over crowded places, safe handling of kids with common cold, watching for danger signs and early consultation of pediatrician in case of any doubts.

How serious is this?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Liver injuries in children are usually graded by the depth of the injury in imaging investigations. But the decision to operate is always based on the stability of the child and not on the grade of injury. Stability in this context means maintenance of blood pressure, while closely observing for signs of any ongoing bleeding from the liver injury inside the abdomen. Children who cross the initial critical stage usually recover fast and are typically discharged after a period of observation. Activity restriction for a grade 4 injury is usually between six to 10 weeks. Hope your grand kid makes speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"Hi, my son (8 yrs) was trying to surprise his dad when he got home from work by hiding in our bed.

I assume that after 10-15 minutes the medicine is no longer in contact with nerve endings (pain) inside the ear. There is a tube-like connection between the inside of the ear and the back of the throat. When you put the drops into your son's ear, some of the liquid enters the tube and gets into the throat.

Is there anyone out there who can give me more explanation, tnx in advance","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Complications of the circumcision. Of these, one is called fistula of the urethra. The urethra is the small tube that carries the urine from the bladder down through the penis to the end of the penis where the urine comes out. If, during the circumcision, a cut is made from the outside skin of the penis into the urethra, then a fistula is made. As urine comes down the urethra, it can go out through the fistula. This is only one possibility. There may be no cut in the penis. Also, if his urine volume is small there may be a blockage inside. Because I cannot see your son, my assistance to you is limited. Your newborn may have something serious in the bottom of his urinary tract. It is most important to have him seen by a pediatric urologist as soon as you can. If you can't locate one in the community, they can be found at a university medical hospital.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Here are few suggestions for you 1. First and foremost thing is to check whether baby is taking feeds well or not. If baby is takings feeds normally than its reassuring. 2. Check baby's activity. If baby looks normal as he/she was previously and not very irritable. Probably things are fine. Head of the baby is very soft and with mild pressure nothing should happen (Remember the baby came out of birth canal after sustaining great pressure, still remains fine) So, nothing to worry. A small piece of advice: Never turn your back on babies side. Never let the baby in prone position. While sleeping baby should be towards your face. Vaccinate your baby at right time. Enjoy parenthood. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi, I realised today that we have a spot of black mould on the wall near the window in the bedroom where we and our 4 week old baby sleep.

Should I be concerned for her or our health?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. It has been tested in research that exposure of smell of  bleach may lead to many respiratory illness in children. However, it hold true for frequent exposures. It doesn't matter in 1-2 bleaches. So, its perfectly fine and you need not to worry. However, for future I suggests sticking to soap and warm water as opposed to bleach, as it may often do the trick just as well. For scrubbing floors or sinks, use baking soda to really get the gritty dirt out of the cracks. And vinegar mixed with water is a good glass cleaner. Hope it answers your question. Good luck.

Put 1-2 drops of saline solution(for example, over-the-counter NaSal Nose Drops) into each nostril to stimulate him to sneeze and cough and blow the nasal mucus to the front of his nose where you can wipe it off.

Today is the first day he hasn’t been. But he’s breathing fast is that normal?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The RSV virus occurs is winter and spring most commonly in the first year of life.  It cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia, symptoms can include fever, breathing rapidly with the skin between his ribs caving in as he breathes and skin between chest and belly caving in with respirations, cough, wheezing. The normal respiratory rate of awake, well infant between 2 and 12 months of age is 40-45 breaths per minute.  Sometimes infants with bronchiolitis can have a respiratory rate over 60.  If you grandson is breathing hard like this, then he is working to breathe.  Fever also causes an infant to breathe rapidly.  You can see why he has no appetite- he is too busy breathing.  Still, it is very important to offer him liquids.  If he will drink only a small amount of milk, apple juice, or pear juice, then offer what he will take frequently, for example, every five minutes.  Give acetaminophen for fever and to make him feel more comfortable every four to six hours. Since there is no medication to treat this virus, your(and your children's) job is to watch that he does not use more and more effort to breathe, his fever is being treated,  he is able to take enough liquids to continue wetting his diaper and keep his mouth moist, he doesn't become blue or stop breathing. This is an infection his body has to fight and overcome.  It might take a week or so to see improvement in breathing.

She was very hot when she woke up initially but has cooled down again since she got sick and has fallen back asleep now.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. When a child's stomach is upset, they usually vomit and have no or a poor appetite with or without a fever.  If it is a mild illness, it usually lasts about 2-4 days. The first thing to do is to see that vomiting has stopped.  I suggest you give her nothing by mouth for another 6-8 hours after her last episode of vomiting. If she hasn't vomited during that time, offer her 2-3 ounces of apple juice, pear juice, or Pedialyte. Again, if no vomiting for next 2 hours, offer another 2-3 ounces of same fluids.  It is important to keep her hydrated, so you should monitor her fluid intake. Usually this is enough time to let her stomach settle down. At this point, offer either fluids or solids.  If she desires food, then allow  her to eat whatever she wants. Because of the history you provide, I suggest keeping her home until she has had no vomiting for at least 24 hours.  The fluids that she drinks should be at room temperature because cold drinks can make the stomach cramp up.  2-3 ounces of the same fluids. Hope I have answered your query.

Thanks a lot!","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your daughter is going by the book as far as amount of sleep at night plus 2 to 4 hours of nap time. A healthy infant ought to be able to self-soothe as she goes from awake to sleep onset and following normal awakenings through the night. Sleep onset associations are those conditions present at the time that she falls asleep and include being rocked, held, bottle fed or breast fed.  These conditions may be required again during normal night-time arousal. Babies who soothe themselves back to sleep have brief arousals rather than prolonged nightwakings.  To self-soothe, the infant is put to bed drowsy but still awake. You should help your daughter develop appropriate sleep onset associations that are readily available during the night without the need for parental intervention( falling asleep independently in crib, thumb sucking, use of transitional object). Transitional objects can be a pacifier, blanket, or mother's well-worn, knotted T-shirt with her scant. The same object should be used during the night and naptime.  TV is not a transitional object.

In this case, maybe there is inflammation in the ear or in the right side of his scalp.  If your son does not have fever and the lymph node is not getting larger nor is it tender to touch, then it will be fine to just keep an eye on it.

There are so many complaints that Alexis's illness is complex medical condition.  I am assuming that musculoskeletal, cardiac, lung, endocrine, and anemia have been ruled out.    I would like to know whether she has had a tick bite.  Does she worry a lot?  Has she missed any time from school in the past few months?   I wish to give you information about a condition known as Somatic Symptom Disorder(SSD).  It causes one or more bodily symptoms, including pain, nausea, dizziness, fainting, and abdominal pain.  The symptoms may or may not have a physical cause. For the patient, they cause excessive levels of distress.  The distress from pain or other problems are real, whether or not a physical explanation can be found.  The distress from symptoms significantly affects daily functioning.  Doctors need to perform many tests to rule out other possible causes before making the diagnosis of SSD.  Some doctors feel that while the tests are being obtained the child ought to be evaluated simultaneously for SSD.  In SSD the brain-body message system is not functioning properly: you may have such a strong emotion, e.g. anger. that your brain is overwhelmed and it sends signals so that you experience the emotion in your body as abdominal pain rather than as a feeling in your mind.  As time goes by and if there is no diagnosis, you might consider asking if a developmental and behavioral pediatrician would be a good choice for children with complicated medical problems.

Here are some:- passive smoking of tobacco or cannabis-postnasal discharge from a cold; no cough when up and about, but coughs continually when he lies down-enlarged adenoids and nasal infection; if a child has a postnasal obstruction and a postnasal discharge, with nasal speech and recurrent middle ear infections, the diagnosis could possibly be enlarged adenoids-cystic fibrosis is accompanied by cough and pneumonia, failure to thrive, and loose, greasy stools-acid reflux-a foreign body(such as a peanut) in the lung   I am not sure what you mean by \\"irregular\\" bowel movements, but if your son received an antibiotic each time he was diagnosed with ear infection, then this could cause vomiting and diarrhea.  Urine can have several different kinds of odors.  It would be best to take a fresh specimen to his doctor to examine.  In an otherwise healthy infant an enlarged abdomen probably is a sign of a large amount of gas in his intestinal tract which will be expelled  on it's own.  I hope this has been helpful.

His penis and everything around it looks absolutely normal and there is no redness.

Could he have put something into his urethra(this is the tube-like structure that takes urine from the bladder to the tip of the penis)?   When urethral obstruction is a possibility, it is a good idea to observe your child's urine stream. Thrush would be cheesy white on his penis and readily apparent.

It hasn t stop her from doing any physical activity she still attends tumbling class, and play normally. She has said a few time it hurts to go to the bathroom (bowel movement). She also fever blister on lips and in mouth. This morning she threw up several times and started to wet the bed last night.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Does your daughter have a fever?  Has she ever had blisters like these before?  Has she been exposed to anyone with fever blisters?  Since these might be contagious, avoid kissing and sharing drinks and cutlery.  Please see that she drinks adequate amounts of fluids and takes acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain.  Blisters persist for about a week.  I wonder if it hurts her to have a bowel movement because she is impacted.  Children who don't have a BM regularly can have accumulation of large amounts of fecal matter in the rectum and colon and this part of the intestines can become distended.  This may be giving her the abdominal pain.  You may wish to take a look at the toilet bowl before she flushes to see how large the stool is.  Children who become impacted can pass stool so large it can block the toilet.  See if the bed wetting stops.  Fecal impaction(and we don't know she has it) can be associated with wetting bed.

If you see no vaginal discharge and no foreign body(like a piece of toilet paper), then there is a possibility she has a urinary tract infection.  Does she have a fever? Has she ever had a urinary tract infection before?  I suggest that if she has to pee during the night, you take her clothes off and place her into a tub of warm water(only, no soap or bubble bath) and encourage her to pee.  If she continues to cry, then you must take her to the doctor's office in the morning.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are presenting multiple symptoms that your daughter has: eye pain, head pain, musculoskeletal pain, nasal congestion, and vomiting. Multi-systems are involved and it seems like she has a flu-like illness. She also has disordered sleeping. A child her age should get 10-11 hours of sleep a night and easily awaken in the morning. She ought to have a nighttime routine: a warm bath or shower at night, followed by about half an hour of reading a book for pleasure in bed, no screens in bedroom (cell phone, iPad, computer, TV), no loud noises outside of her bedroom that she can hear. A child her age should get 10-11 hours of sleep per 24 hours. This doesn't have to be all at one time. For example, she could sleep for 9 hours through the night and have a one hour nap just as she arrives home from school in the afternoon. It will be a good idea if you and your daughter together set her bedtime and be insistent that she get up in AM with enough time to get ready for school and eat a GOOD breakfast. For the flu-like illness she can take Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen for pain or fever and plenty of fluids so she doesn't become dehydrated and having plenty of fluid in her body will help decrease her muscle pain. I hope this helps and she gets well soon. Please return when more questions arise."},{"Patient":"My grandson is 8.

A possibility for nighttime vomiting in children is termed \\"winter vomiting\\" disease. Several different kinds of viruses can cause this illness. Winter is not the only season in which it occurs. The only symptom is vomiting, nearly always during the night. Diarrhea is most unusual. There is no fever.  The vomiting may recur. It is of short duration.

From among all of the physical findings and lab data, I am going to highlight several of them: - mouth ulcer -protein in her urine -leukocytes less than 4L -ANA is present These findings together suggest the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, additional evaluation must be done before the diagnosis is certain. In lupus another cell type in the blood (platelets) is often low. This cell type is not listed among the blood reports. However, if her platelets are low, this could explain her nose bleeds. Platelets are necessary to stop bleeding in the body. Lupus is a very serious illness.

However, if your indigestion symptoms become worse, you should consult a doctor. Here are some helpful tips to alleviate indigestion:Try not to chew with your mouth open, talk while chewing, or eat too fast. This causes you to swallow too much air, which can aggravate indigestion.Drink fluids after rather than during meals.Avoid late-night eating.Try to relax after meals.Avoid spicy foods.Stop smoking.Avoid alcoholic beverages.If indigestion is not relieved after making these changes, your doctor may prescribe medications to alleviate your symptoms.Regards,Dr.Sharmila"},{"Patient":"Please help me!

After 2-3 hours awaken her (if she is not already awake) and see if she is interested in drinking a some(2-3 oz) of Pedialyte or soda. First, let these liquids warm up to room temperature because sometimes cold drinks can bring on stomach cramps. Then let her get back into bed for another couple of hours and repeat the same process. You can do this for 6-8 hours.  If there has been no vomiting ask her if she would like something to eat.  If she does, allow her to select what she wants.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I believe the test is called visual acuity. It measures the clarity of a patient's vision.  Your granddaughter would not be able to do this eye test. It is performed by having the patient sit a certain  distance from an eye chart that is on the wall.  While covering one eye at a time, the child reads from left to right all of the letters or symbols on one line.  Then reads all of the letters or symbols on the line below the top line.  The letters and symbols on the second line are smaller than those on the top line.  Continuing down the chart until the child can no longer read the letters or symbols on a line. On the left side of each line is the child's visual acuity indicated by two numbers: 20/20 is normal, 20/30, 20/40, etc. A visual acuity of 20/50 means that the child's vision(in one eye) from 20 foot away from an object is as clear as a child with normal vision seeing the same object from 50 feet away. The results of a visual acuity test has two results, one for each eye. For example, a patient having  results of a visual acuity test of 20/20(right eye) and 20/20(left eye) has normal vision in both eyes. This test requires cooperation from the patient.

He used to sleep 10-12 hours every nigt.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The metopic suture is one of four sutures on the infant's skull. The sutures ought to remain open until 2-3 years of age. There is no relationship that I am aware of between these sutures and sleep problems. At your son's age, separation anxiety can result in increased bedtime resistance and problematic night wakings. All infants and children normally arouse briefly 4-6 times through the night. Babies who soothe themselves back to sleep have brief arousals rather than prolonged night wakings.  The ability to self-soothe is associated with being put to bed while drowsy but still awake and without sleep onset associations (being rocked, held, bottle fed or breast fed) that are not available during the night. During nighttime wakings, infants can alert parents by crying. Persistent difficulty in self-soothing is associated with frequent night wakings. Transitional objects (pacifier, blanket, mother's well-worn knotted T-shirt with her scent) are important during infancy. Baby should be weaned from middle-of-the-night feedings and should not be put to sleep with a bottle. 25% to 50% of infants the age of your son have night wakings.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Polymorphous Light Eruption(also known as, \\"sun poisoning\\") findings are: small bumps or blisters, hives, and dry, inflamed skin looking like eczema.  It involves the cheeks and ears, neck, sun-exposed areas of hands and arms.  It is usually itchy.  The rash of this condition appears 1-2 days after sun exposure and lasts for 1-2 weeks.  Most common in spring and early summer.  You can protect his skin with broad-spectrum sunscreen( with good UV-A protection), photoprotective clothing such a broad brim hat, long sleeve shirts and long pants, and avoid much midday sun exposure. If this is what he has and scratching is bothersome, hydrocortisone 1% cream(available over-the-counter) may give relief. Another possible cause for your son's symptoms could be Erythema Infectiosum.  With this viral infection there are bright red patches on the cheeks.  This rash can be preceded 1-2 weeks by fever, muscle aches, sore throat, chills. 1-4 days following the appearance of the facial rash. The rash spreads to trunk and extremities.

I am puzzled as to why your daughter is being given Godex capsules if she has tuberculosis.  Godex is to treat a fatty liver, muscle cramps, and a fish tapeworm intestinal infection, among other conditions.  But not for tuberculosis.  Side effects of Godex include:-feeling of pins and needles in the body_ sleepiness-diarrhea-face swelling-heart failure  Her SGOT level is very close to normal range and is not anything to be concerned about.  It may even be due to a lab error.  An SGOT reading in the hundreds would be something to be concerned about.  Yes, it is possible to cure your daughter and not have drug-induced hepatitis.  This side effect does not happen often.  If your child is not taking pyridoxine as part of her anti-TB therapy, you may want to ask if she should be taking it.

Will this be safe to give her with the previous medication, over 3 hours later?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The Robitussin contains an over-the-counter cough suppressant(dextromethorphan) and an antihistamine(chlorpheniramine).  Virtussin AC contains a prescription cough suppressant(codeine) and an expectorant(guafinesin).  The antihistamine is useful for allergic illnesses, such as hay fever.  The expectorant is supposed to help the patient expel mucus from lungs and throat.  Neither one of these ingredients is for cough.  For many years I have been reading about cough suppressants(both over-the-counter and narcotic).  The information has stated that these medicines are not very effective for cough.  If you feel that you must give her one of these meds, then I suggest the Virtussin AC because it may have a better chance of helping her.

Without seeing a picture to learn more specifically where the lump is, its size, and what the overlying skin looks like, my reply to you is limited.  The lump on her face(?) or under her jaw(?) might be a lymph node, tumor, or mumps(if she is not up-to-date on her immunizations and has been exposed to someone who has mumps).

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Vaginal discharge is a common complaint in young girls before puberty.  Causes include foreign body in vagina, for example toilet paper; obesity; sexually transmitted infections, such as child abuse.  These causes, among others, MUST be eliminated by her health care provider.  AFTER this is done, she can be treated with warm baths 1-2 times a day with a mild soap like, Dove or Basis; careful drying between legs in front and applying small amount of baby powder(no talc); frequently change white, cotton underpants to absorb discharge; wipe front to back after bowel movements; no bubble baths or other irritants.

However, he has had bright green sometimes so hard that he will scream when he passes stool since the begining. He is on toddler formula and I have been feeding him whole milk yogurt lately.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Some children, usually older than your infant, can have a plug of stool in their rectum with liquidy stool leaking down from above and around the hard stool.  So this appears like constipation and diarrhea. Diets that predispose to constipation are high in sugar, pasta, milk and cheese and low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Good parenting may allow for elimination of some items and introduction of others. Prune juice and pear, peach, and apricot nectar are effective. Papaya, cantaloupe, and grapes are high in fiber. Keep introducing new vegetable options. Often child will welcome 1-2 vegetables; parent must be persistent. Try to add whole grain breads and brown rice. If you feel you must give some medicine for constipation, a small dose(a teaspoon once a day) of Milk of Magnesia is safe. Constipation that is resistant to medical therapy should not be ignored. There can be anatomical problems with intestines, for example. If your son's constipation does not resolve, he must be seen by his primary care physician. I hope this information is helpful.

The odor of stool (poop) is due to the bacteria that are normally in everyone's intestines. Occasionally the types of these bacteria change which causes a different or stronger odor. The inside lining of the intestines normally produce mucus which keeps the lining from drying out. The usual color of intestinal mucus is clear or white. It becomes significant when it is red.

He is feeding normally. Does not have fever. Does not cough. Just seems more cranky than usual and wakes up more often. Should I be worried? Thank you Best Marie","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. When people become hoarse, it means that they have laryngitis. This is inflammation of the larynx, the part of the upper airway that contains the vocal cords. The larynx is in back or the throat. I am unaware of any association between vaccinations and hoarseness. If he has no fever, no cough, and is not breathing faster than normally or breathing using extra effort (muscles of neck would bulge out, skin between ribs would cave in). I believe he will be alright in several days. I hope this helps you. Please return f we can help you in the future."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is paul, and my daughter had her adenoids taken out when she was 4 and ever since then shes had nose bleeds quite severe ones and she is now 9 years old. Me and my wife have seen doctors about this but they seem not to be concerned can you shedd some answers?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The most common cause of nosebleeds in children comes from the area about a half inch to one inch within the nose on the septum (the barrier that divides the nostrils) above the nasal floor. Here, on both sides of the septum, are tiny blood vessels that can easily rupture with nose picking,  when the inside of the nose is dry, or nose is blown too hard. Other reasons include: -high blood pressure -hay fever -foreign object (e.g. piece of toy, nut) Does your daughter bleed from any other site? Is she of normal weight? Does she have good appetite? Is there a family history of bleeding disorders? You might wish to have her seen by a pediatric ENT specialist for a second opinion. I hope I have been able to help you. Please return if you have additional questions."},{"Patient":"My daughter who is 6 just had her tonsils and adenoids removed on Wednesday the 14th of March so today is day 3 of post op.

Is it safe to give her benadryl or some form of cold medicine to help break it up or dry it up?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Unfortunately, cold medications have side effects.  Furthermore, Benadryl is an antihistamine and is good for hay fever and itchy rashes. It is possible that your child has a lot of mucus because her throat still hurts and it is difficult for her to swallow  the secretions from her mouth. I suggest throat lozenges, ice cream, popsicles, jello, cold drinks and Acetaminophen for pain. I hope this helps you and that your daughter will feel better quickly.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like Cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given, that too only if fever is more than 100 F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For cold you can use Cetirizine.

An active is a well kid even if she/he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone. 3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day. 4. This age rather than the quantity of the food, I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it. 5.

Email: YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given that too only if fever is more than 100 F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Mefenamic acid, which is a NSAID.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Why do you feel they need  a supplement?  Won't a regular, age-appropriate diet with whole cow's milk allow them to grow normally?  The manufacturer made Ensure first.  Then they made Pediasure so that there would be a formula specifically for young children. I trust the manufacturer(Abbott Labs) to put the proper amount of all the ingredients into their products. Hope I have answered your query.

The doctors said it was probably due to the umbillical cord wrapped around her ankel while I was still pregnant with her. I was also told it could just be fatty deposits in her foot. Regardless, I was reassured the swelling would go away once she started to walk. My daughter is almost 15 months and has been walking for about 4 months and running for one of those months. The swelling is still the same, no worse, no better. Any idea what this could be?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You have waited long enough. It is important to find out what is causing the swelling. Methods to learn this are imaging studies(ultrasound, MRI, CT), excision (where all of the tissue is removed), or biopsy. Talk this over with your daughter's pediatrician. My opinion is that a pediatric radiologist and a pediatric surgeon ought to be involved. I hope this helps points you in the correct direction. Hope I have answered your query.

This has been occurring since Sunday and while the number of times she has had to use the bathroom has decreased, the stools are nonetheless very soft. there are no other symptoms as she is not complaining of any stomach pain, and does not have a fever or other symptoms. Should i take her to a doctor or just keep my eye on it?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. It will be safe to continue watching her.  Uncomplicated diarrhea usually lasts no longer than the better part of a week.  Her body needs the nourishment it gets from food in order to repair the injured intestinal lining.  By all means have her eat and drink anything she wishes. When the intestines are upset, it changes the bacteria pattern in the intestines and that can change the odor of the stool. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"My three year old son has been vomiting on and off for a week, usually after he eats. Today he vomited and it looked like he brought up the fluid he drank 4 hours earlier. I took him to urgent care a few days ago and they dismissed it as a stomach bug. I doubt that diagnosis.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. There are many causes of vomiting-some serious and others not so serious. Is he taking any medications? Many can cause vomiting. A stomach bug is one that is not so serious because its duration is relatively brief with abdominal pain and vomiting resolved after several days.  And child is back to his regular diet and activity. If this symptom continues and causes weight loss, fever, lethargy, blood in vomitus, then the cause is serious and the reason for the vomiting must be determined. For the present, the most important treatment concern is to make sure he does not become dehydrated. Be sure to offer 2-3oz of lukewarm fluids frequently (every 2 hrs). Should he throw up again, offer the fluids again. You may begin solids when he states he is hungry or it has been 6-8hours since last time of vomiting. I hope this helps your son and he is well soon.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You give a familiar history.  Your daughter is by all means not alone.  The most frequent cause is attendance at daycare.  Does she attend daycare? If you go into a typical daycare center, you will find many, if not most, of the toddlers have some sort of viral illness.  That could be a cold, throat infection, pneumonia, or diarrhea. The children are in close contact with one another which makes it easy for them to be exposed to the other viruses being carried by their classmates. Being so young they haven't been in contact with these germs previously, so they are susceptible to coming down with illnesses caused by these germs.  Now take a look into a class of sixth graders and you will find less sickness.  Because these children have previously come in contact with many of the viruses that are causing the daycare students to come down with so many illnesses. The sixth graders have developed immunity to those viruses whereas the toddlers have not. One positive result of this situation is that as she gets older, she will get fewer of these infections. In the USA it is now springtime with fewer viral illnesses.  I hope I have been able to help you and your daughter. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I am in agreement with you.  Infection with influenza virus can cause fever, cough, runny nose, ear infection, pneumonia, and muscle aches and pains. However, influenza does not cause bruising nor prolonged clotting times. Has the bruising spread?  Is there more evidence of bleeding- from gums, blood in vomit, urine, stool, coughing up blood?  Do her cuts take a long time to stop bleeding? Remember if a child less than nine yrs. old is getting the flu vaccine for the first time then she needs two flu vaccines during that flu season.

He is a little bit cranky too. He is more on formula now than breasfeed. He gets 26ounces a day of good start(nestle) and breastfed at night. I am worried that he might have viral infection. Please help. Thanks a lot.","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcaremagic.  I am a pediatrician and am happy to help.  Healthy breast-fed infants the age of your son pass between one and eight bowel movements per day with an average of two to four. They may have a stool after each feeding.  The stools of breast-fed babies are pasty, mushy, and light yellow.  Babies fed cow milk based formulas have one to four putty-like, firm, pale yellow stools a day.  A viral gastrointestinal infection causes an infant to run a fever, vomit, have diarrhea, and a poor appetite. In any young infant who is having diarrhea with or without vomiting it is important to make sure they do not become dehydrated. Signs of dehydration include: no tears, dry lips and mouth, wetting fewer diapers that usual.  For dehydration in an infant, ORS or Pedialyte are good choices.I hope this information is helpful to you.

Natural methods are the best to relieve constipation.2. Constipation is a risk factor for UTI3. Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4. Minimum 3-4 cups of fruits and vegetables to be consumed per day5.
