For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Are vitamin A and D supplements safe to take with liver disease? What are the highest doses that are safe to take? I have fatty liver but I do not know if it is a simple fatty liver or has progressed to NASH and fibrosis. I am a 33-year-old female. I smoke and have a history of acid reflux, low heart rates, fat indigestion, and fatty liver. Lab tests showed vitamin A 0.9 umol/L and vitamin D 37 nmol/L. Previously, I had an abdominal ultrasound and it showed liver 14.6 cm in length which gives rise to a moderately coarse dense echo pattern consistent with fatty infiltration. ALT level was 58 U/L. I am currently on N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Your vitamin A level is marginal rather than low. Less than 0.7 or 0.5 is considered low and up to 1.05 is considered marginal. So, you will probably need supplements at a very low dose. Total intake of up to 10,000 units daily is unlikely to cause any harmful effects. So, supplements of 7500 units or even 10,000 units per day for a month or two would be enough for you. I guess you do not have any symptoms of vitamin D deficiency like xerophthalmia or visual difficulties where one would need higher doses. Also, for vitamin D, supplements like Calcirol sachet are recommended in dosing of 60,000 units once a week for eight weeks with milk, and following which you may have it once a month for the next six months. Both these are unlikely to interfere with liver issues considering fatty liver and high ALT level. You are unlikely to have progressed to the severe liver disease within such a short period and without symptoms. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have fever, headache, and cold from yesterday night. I took Paracetamol. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

So, we get into an intercourse without it. Basically, I never came inside her but I wanted to get educated about the facts like how to avoid pregnancy if I came inside her? I mean what should be our first step? Even if I pull out, is there any chances that she will get pregnant? Which condom is a perfect fit for starters like us? Is there any natural ways too to make sure no sperm left inside?","Doctor":"Hello. I shall answer your query in the order that you have asked. If you have had unprotected sex and have come inside her, and she is in her unsafe period, then the next best step to avoid pregnancy would be for her to opt for an emergency contraceptive pill like an I-pill or an Unwanted 72 pill within 72 hours of intercourse to avoid unplanned pregnancy. You have to understand that even pre-cum, which is ejaculated before the actual ejaculation occurs also contains live active motile sperms, which can also get her pregnant even if you follow the withdrawal technique during intercourse. So chances shall remain unless you ensure pre-cum control as well. The condom size is mentioned on the pack and one can decide that based on his penile length and thickness at full erection. There are standard size condoms available but that is completely user's preference. Natural ways like washing with water immediately or wiping with tissues do not help much, but if you can opt for a spermicidal vaginal cream before initiating intercourse mixed with a vaginal lubricant like KY jelly, then chances of pregnancy can be substantially decreased even with an unprotected intercourse episode. But you cannot ensure even after cleaning post ejaculation that the vaginal cavity has been cleaned off of all sperms completely."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 39 years old.

It started with chest pains, and I ended up having an episode of NSVT last year. I am now on Bisoprolol and Amlodipine. The cardiologist thinks my condition is coronary artery spasm and just an ectopic focus causing the NSVT. I have had a normal CT angiogram with no luminal narrowing and no signs of any blockages or atherosclerotic changes, and a negative stress echo. I have had a normal echo after the NSVT with everything normal and a cardiac MRI. The MRI showed a very mild dilation of left and right ventricle (the cardiologist looked up studies and said mine is not dilated and it falls within the normal range for my age). I had a normal echo just taken yesterday, which showed no dilation ventricle with normal wall thickness, size, and normal function with 66 % EF. The only finding at all on the echo was a mild tri-leaflet aortic valve, normal cusp excursion, and no regurgitation. I also noticed that every time I am stressed or anxious, my T waves in leads III and AVF on ECG flip. As my other echo did not mention this sclerosis of the aortic valve, has this always been here and because of my NSVT does this put me at risk of an SCD? Also, is it likely for me to have blockages in my arteries now even after a clear CT angiogram less than a year ago? Since the one episode of NSVT, it has not happened again although I have had on Holter, premature atrial, junctional ectopics, and ventricular trigeminy, all of which are very infrequent.

Others could be thyroid disorder, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency and diabetes. If all the work up are negative; it could be problems related to inner ear like benign positional vertigo or Meniere's disease. You should be investigated for secondary causes of hypertension. Remember the BP goal has been changed to more than 140/90 mmHg if you have no other medical conditions other than hypertension. Consult your PCP (primary care physician) or endocrinologist for secondary hypertension. If all investigations and BP are fine then consult an ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I am sexually active and I have been using commercial sex workers for the past few years. However, from last year, I started myself getting tested regularly for different STD infections etc. and all my reports have come negative. I have got HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B, syphilis (VDRL) and HSV 1 and 2 tests done. The point of attention is the recent test result that I just got today.

I have tried all creams like itch guard, ring guard etc. but I get relief only by applying Betadine ointment on it two times a day.

I do not know any good infertility center and specialized doctor. I want a biological child only. Please suggest what to do. How can I come to know whether it is obstructive or non-obstructive? Please reply. He has hard pimples on his testicle. Are these the reason of blockage?","Doctor":"Hi. Is there any report of your husband? Smoking, cocaine and other recreational drugs and few other medicines like anti-cancerous can affect male fertility. It is better to quit all recreational drugs. If he has been treated for any disease better to have full assessment and treatment. Drugs that he has been on should be discussed in detail in view of infertility. Have healthy lifestyle with nutritious balanced diet, exercise yoga, and other recreational activities. Non-obstructive azoospermia is no sperm in semen due to abnormal production of sperm. The reason for this is hormonal imbalance, testicular failure or varicocele and dilated vein in testicles (varicose veins), genetic abnormalities, cryptorchidism (presence of small testicles), etc. The treatment could be testicular sperm extraction with ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection). In obstructive azoospermia, reasons could be due to obstructed epididymis or congenital absence of vas deferens as in cystic fibrosis but normal healthy sperm production is there. So sperm retrieval is advised for ICSI. Better to contact infertility centers. As detailed examination and history are needed for treatment and then for conception.

My doctor currently only tests my TSH and treats me with Levothyroxine. I feel extreme fatigue after a year of this treatment, even with my TSH in the normal range. My doctor says free T4 and reverse T3 are not important labs to run. I am wondering if I should see an endocrinologist or just continue the treatment I am on. My TSH started at 9.8 last year, got down to 0.08. I feel great when it was that low. Mow my TSH is 3.8 and I feel extreme fatigue. I am taking 112 mcg Levothyroxine daily. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Good day and thanks for your query. Some people treated for hypothyroidism may still experience symptoms even if blood tests show that their thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are well within the normal range. The reasons for this are complex, but the bottom line is that having a normal TSH value does not necessarily mean that all of your symptoms will go away. Evidence suggests that situations like this are not as uncommon as one may think. Even when placed on Levothyroxine, the drug considered the gold standard of hypothyroid treatment, many people fail to reap the physical benefits of treatment. So, first, you can lower down your TSH target if you are still having symptoms. For that, we can increase your medication. If still symptomatic, the next choice is to change the brand of Thyroxine, and if still not feeling well, then think to go to T3 supplement rather than T4, that is Thyroxine. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant?

He admits to a variety of drugs including cocaine, meth, heroin, LSD in the past year. His ex-mother in law says he currently uses cocaine and meth. He denies current drug use beyond pot. He says he has not done cocaine for a few months. He swears he is only currently using pot occasionally now and no other drugs. I realize he may be lying. In the last month, he has had several extended blackouts where he was fully functioning, walking around town, having conversations with people, damaging property, etc. Sometimes friends cannot wake him, and they think he is having a seizure. He does not remember drinking any alcohol on that day. In fact, he has no memory of that day, until waking up at home. Everyone told him about the events the next day. He has no memory of these events. Some are as short as an hour. Some are as long as 48 hours or more. I live 6,000 miles away from him and flew in this week to see him. I only have a few days with him to try to convince him to see a doctor, and I am trying to see if this is just drug use, him lying, being in denial or if there is a severe neurological condition that is not being treated because everyone is assuming he is on drugs. He has a history of serious sleepwalking when he was a child. He would rush out of his room, frantically searching for something but unable to describe it. He would carry on whole conversations, very agitated, would go outside, walk around the house and come to the back door crying and try to get in but be unable to turn the knob. It was like a walking nightmare or dream. We would get him back to bed and back to sleep. The next day he would have no memory of it. This current behavior sounds similar to me but on a much more extreme level. His sister had night terrors similar to this when she was a child. I, as their biological father, have a history of talking in my sleep, and some sleepwalking when I was a child but never this extreme. So, there seems to be some family history as a possible explanation outside of drug use being the probable cause. He sleeps very little. His current girlfriend says he is extremely sleep deprived. He lived with me until a few months ago and was extremely sleep deprived then. I realize you cannot give a definitive answer without personal examination and tests and such. What I am looking for right now is the answer to these three questions. Can cocaine and meth use actually result in these kinds of fully functional blackouts? Can just marijuana, (without any other drugs) or just alcohol or just marijuana and alcohol, combined with sleep deprivation and extreme stress cause these kinds of blackouts? Are there any other possible explanations for this kind of blackouts that are not drug related, for example, sleep deprivation and stress, a tumor, or other neurological or medical conditions? What might some of those possibilities be? Thank you for your help. I am distraught and confused.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern.

Often, it is mucus loose motion and high headache. Also, I get vomit. What is my problem? What treatment should I take for this?","Doctor":"Hello. Revert back with the answers to the above questions to an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

CT scan showed extensive atherosclerosis of the aorta. Probable high-grade stenosis of the right common iliac artery and the bilateral common femoral artery. She also has kidney disease in the left kidney and extreme fatigue for two years. Would she be a candidate for a stent or some other procedure to unblock the artery? And could this condition be causing her fatigue? None of her doctors can figure out the reason for fatigue. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. This is a non-contrast CT (computed tomography) so it is not accurate in estimating the extent of stenosis. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  She will need a contrast CT angiography of abdominal vessels. However, the common iliac artery and femoral arteries are usually amenable to stenting, unless CT angiography shows diffuse disease (whole of the artery is involved with no normal segment) where stenting would be difficult. However, a disease involving these arteries is unlikely to cause generalized fatigue, but it can cause pain or weakness in the lower limbs while walking. Regarding the cause for fatigue, I guess the common causes like low hemoglobin, BP issues, any medications, deranged kidney function, low Vitamin D, deranged blood sugar are ruled out. One important cause that should be ruled out in her is the cardiac cause, because her CT scan shows mild fluid in bilateral lungs which may be related to heart and also with such extensive aortic disease, cardiac arteries are also expected to be involved. Cardiac disease may cause fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion. So, she should undergo ECG (electrocardiography), echo, and also CT angiography of heart vessels, if possible along with CT angiography of abdominal vessels. Also, some routine tests like hemogram, LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test), vitamin D, thyroid profile, sugar, lipid profile, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) should also be performed if not done recently. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am observing obsession since last two to three years. I discussed my symptoms with a doctor at icliniq and he told me it is due to OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder). Firstly, I have this problem if a topic or matter emotionally bothers me. I keep calling my mother frequently on phone and start talking for long duration. I cannot be without calling as we both stay in different state. If I do not get a chance to call my mother then I call to any of my friend and talk about the same topic. When a topic or thought rotates in my head my focus tends to go there only so current work gets disturbed. I do will start cooking and then forget and go to other room to start another work. Even though in office I always works good, recently observing that my focus is diverting from my work to other work where my mind tends to stay. Because of this, my current task is getting affected. Secondly, I am very absent minded at home. In office also I sometimes forget to attend daily meetings where all project teams come and give updates regarding their progress of tasks. I also forget sometimes to check fingerprint in office which is for security purpose. I have stopped taking care of myself. My life is not routine oriented at all. I am poor in time management also.

I read your query with keen interest and agree with your doctor who suggested OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) for current symptoms. In addition, it appears to me that there is secondary depression. So, your diagnosis for current condition can be called OCD with secondary depression.

I think cold is not related to tonsilitis because a virus or bacteria cannot live in cold or hot. Why is there still a misconception in that? Some doctors say you can eat and some say you cannot. What is the illusion?","Doctor":"Hi. If you are having a susceptibility for throat infections you need to understand why it is happening. Having cold drinks or fluids bring down the body's immunity by shade and that is why it can attract a viral or bacterial infection. It is not about whether the bacteria can survive in cold or not, but it is about whether your body's immune system is able to fight the infection to neutralize it before it spreads. Viral particles and bacteria are all there in the air that we breathe and usually the body fights back to protect from getting invaded by these organisms. Everyone has one particular level of immunity, some have a weak immune system while some have very strong immunity and can still bear eating junk food and drinking cold drinks all day and still not get an infection. It all depends from person to person. If your body is sensitive to cold things or anything for that matter, it is better to avoid such items to prevent you from acquiring an infection and taking unnecessary antibiotics and medications.

Is this correct? In two situations like condom coming out or breaking, but the sex act being stopped immediately, what would be the chance of my contracting HIV or any other STD? What other immediate preventive measure should I take if the condom breaks or comes out other than stopping the act? Should I take Truvada immediately? If yes, for how many days should I take it to become effective? Does it become effective from day one? Can one take it few days before sexual intercourse and stop it in between and again restart it? Do I need to do any blood test for HIV or other STDs in case the condom breaks or slips out? If so, what are the blood tests that I need to do and with how many days gap? Is there any STD one can get from skin to skin contact without genital contact. Is there any STD one can get from accidental genital contact and what preventive measures should be taken if this happens? Can one get an STD from kissing? Only once in my life, around two to three years back, I had intercourse without a condom. I had myself tested for HIV six months later and it turned out to be negative. I have not had any symptoms of any STDs, but should I still get myself tested for any STDs and if so, which test should I do? Which condom size should I use? My penis is 7 inches in length and 7.5 inches in girth. Do I use XL or XXL? I do not find any condom which supports 7.5 inch girth. What should I do in this case? It seems that if the partner is HIV+ then it would be a statistically low probability that with one sex act with protection? Would it not be better to take Truvada regularly to be on the safer side? What are the side effects of taking Truvada regularly even if one is not at high risk? Should I use any lubricant with the condom? Should I get a hepatitis B shot? I am not sure whether I have had the shot earlier.","Doctor":"Hi. An unsafe sex increases the chance of contracting STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) as well as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). As you mentioned that the status of your partners are mostly not known, so this puts you in risk of contracting STD or HIV if you get involved in unsafe sexual practices with such partners. In case of slippage of condoms or breakage of condoms, puts you at risk, which cannot be neglected while having sexual intercourse. First and foremost important thing to do is, to stop the act and wash your genitals with mild soap under running water. Avoid applying any cream or lubricant that can cause irritation to genital skin. Besides this avoid promiscuous behavior. There is no need to take Truvada (Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate) until and unless you know the HIV status of the partner with whom you have had unprotected sex. Viral infections such as genital warts and herpes can be contracted by even skin to skin contact. For accidental genital contact, firstly get the STD profile done, and then if required start the treatment for the respective STD that is detected on testing. In your case you should use XL size condoms (extra large), which can be procured from a medical store. Having an unprotected sexual intercourse with a partner who is HIV+ then there is always a risk of contracting HIV, you cannot neglect it or can take chance of not contracting HIV by having sex only for once with such person. If you are not sure about vaccination and as you are involved in unhealthy sexual practices then you should get your hepatitis B done.

I did have occasional (what I called) tension headaches, mild pains behind one eye that would last a few hours, and that is about it. Last year, I gave birth to my first child, by C-section. 2 to 3 days after the spinal anesthesia, I developed positional headaches that were incredibly intense. I was told they were related to the anesthesia. I could not sit or stand up, and the pain was the worst thing imaginable. I would actually cry on the toilet when I needed to go. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was an 11. When I lay down, it got better, a 2 to 3 out of 10. The pains went away after 6 to 7 days, and I got back normal. However, during these seven days, I did experience once a scintillating scotoma, which was almost identical to the auras that precede migraines. A lot of blurry shining lights that gradually grew larger and became a sparkling fortification spectrum in a C-shape, which grew even larger until it left the vision field towards the left side. Then I had no problems whatsoever for the next six months or so, until one and a half months ago, when I started having the aura again, and it happened six times so far. I have been very overworked and overtired when they started, with the baby starting solids and not sleeping well. It has been so far five times on the left side of the vision and once on the right side (although the same day I had it on the right side, a few hours later it also happened on the left side, the same day). The transition of the scintillating scotoma from a dot to a large C leaving my field of vision lasts about 30 minutes, and it is every time the same. I do not have any other symptoms, although I had mild nausea a couple of times during the aura. The headaches that follow are mild. Like a stronger pressure in the back of the head, on the opposite side of the scotoma. So, it has been mostly on the right side. A couple of hours after the aura, I can always feel a sharper pain on the right side, inside my head, towards the back of the head (occipitally), usually when I move, bend over, cough, strain, etc. It is every time on the same side in the same spot. This pain disappears after a day or so. But for the last two weeks or so, I have been left with a slightly painful pressure in my head that is pretty constant daily. It sometimes goes away especially when I am relaxed, but it comes back when I am more tense and active. It feels a lot like a tension-type headache. There is also a sensation of a 'full head' and a bit of lightheadedness like I am not focusing my eyes well (but not actually losing any balance or visual acuity). There is no particular pain when moving, coughing, bending over, etc. like I have during a migraine. But I do feel more pressure in the back of my head on the right, not sure if it is psychological, or it is really something there. I should also mention that I did not take any medication for the migraines, and once tried Ibuprofen for a tension headache, but it did not really work. Sometimes, a glass of wine works better actually. My brother started having the same aura (he described it to me in detail, and it is the same thing I have) when he was 35, which was five years ago. His headaches are mild to moderate, but they are behind his eye and not at the back of the head like mine. He also does not have the head pressure every day like I started to have, and his migraines alternate sides, not like mine which are pretty much on the right side of the head (left vision field). I am scheduled for an MRI next week, so I will find out more soon. But I wanted to hear your opinion since I am so very scared that I have a tumor in there, something really bad. I very much want to see my baby grow up and be there for him. I am super worried, and I just had another aura yesterday evening, and now I get the sharp pain in my right occipital area when bending over. Do my symptoms really seem like migraines or maybe something worse? I have read that I am a bit too old to start having migraines (31) and that the pain should be more intense and not always on the same side (which is indicative of brain tumor?) and that they should be on the front of my head not at the back of my head. Is that true?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. I hope this answers you. Feel free to contact me back if you have more questions or doubts. Thanks and regards.

The first episode was in 2010 and it lasted for three-four months before I was taken to a psychiatrist. I had been thinking that people are tracking me through email, internet. My mobile phone is tapped and all that. I did not get any auditory or visual hallucinations. I was prescribed Risperidone 2 mg and I took it for about 10 months before I discontinued it following a medical practitioner's advice. But the disease relapsed after 10 months of discontinuing the medication. This time with in one month of the start of the disease I was taken to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me Amisulpride 400 mg and another medication which I do not remember the name. This time also there were only delusions and no hallucinations. I was not able to tolerate the side effects of the medication and I decided to stop the medication after one month of using it. Within one month I was able to come out of the diseased state and stopped the medication by myself not taking advice from doctor. After three months of stopping the medication, the disease relapsed again a bit more severely this time but again only delusions and no hallucinations. My doctor told the relapse is because I stopped the medication abruptly. And presently I am under treatment of the same doctor and am on Aripiprazole 20 mg and Amisulpride 200 mg. His plan is to reduce and stop amisulpride slowly and continue aripiprazole for some more time. Totally I should be having the medication for 1 to 1 and half years. I am tolerating this medication better than Risperidone but still would like to find out if there are any alternatives.The Psychosis has responded well to the medication. And I am totally symptom free for the past six or more months. These are the questions I have? I read on internet there is a possibility of withdrawal Psychosis when antipsychotics are discontinued (attributed to increased number and sensitivity of dopamine receptors). Was it that what I got 10 months after discontinuation of the medication? Are there further chances of getting such withdrawal Psychosis, if I continue antipsychotics for a period of one and a half years? How much reliable is homeopathy in treating this?","Doctor":"Hi. Consult a psychiatrist online for further folow up -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I read your query and understand your concerns about the effect of Viagra (Sildenafil) on sperm or its quality. I like to inform you that the formation of sperm is an independent process from erection. You will be surprised to know that the sperms that will be released in the next few sessions may have completed their manufacturing weeks back, if not the months. In other words, sperm formation takes around two and a half months and has no casual relationship with the erection or mechanism of erection, which is affected by Viagra. On the other hand, Viagra acts on certain receptors on the blood vessels and remains effective for a few hours (4-6 hours). I mean to say that as per the available literature, no harm is made to sperms or sperm quality by Viagra even on the frequent use.

I had an MRI two months later due to severe pain. The MRI report presented inflammation and edema of the back muscles, inflammation of nerve roots, compression of nerve roots at L4-L5, suspicion for radiculitis/arachnoiditis and low-lying conus at L3-L4 with tethered cord and thickened filum. Following the report, I was treated with Dexamethasone for a tapering 10-day course. During the last eight months, I have had many symptoms including severe back pain with a constant heart rate of 130 and up varying blood pressure. The results change constantly from 100/40 to 200/140 inflammation and wounds on my back with a weakness of the bladder and bowel issues. I had an EMG that showed acute neurogenic lesion annular distribution at L4-5 and L5-S1. I also had an echocardiogram that stated: Rest HR to be 130, in effort - 3:36 HR 90% effort level - 5.3. I am scheduled for a cardio examination next week. My question is whether these symptoms can be related to the low-lying conus with a tethered cord? Before the surgery, I only had a CT so I do not know if the tethered cord was there or not? Can it be that the inflation and edema caused the tethered cord issues and symptoms? Can it just go away on its own? I would appreciate any ideas and recommendations that you might have on this issue or any other finding that you come up with. Please help. I have attached the reports for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The tethered cord is a result of fibrosis and inflammation. Your symptoms of back pain and weakened bowel and bladder movements could be explained with the tethered cord.  The changes in heart rate could be related to a cardiac disorder or inflammation, but they are not related to the spinal cord damage in this region. Painkillers and steroids can lead to high blood pressure and changes in the heart rate. The pain can also activate the sympathetic nervous system leading to such changes in the heart rhythm. Coming to this point, I would recommend continuing physiotherapy. An antidepressant or Pregabalin would help as a long-term therapy for the pain.

This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I could send pictures of what hair I want. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Given your natural type of hair described and what you would like it to look, there are some things you can consider. Wash your hair with shampoos that are intended to reduce frizz and will say so on the bottle. Also, use a conditioner that is intended to reduce frizz. There are hair styling products for thick wavy hair that also reduce frizz and will say so on the product description. A more permanent solution would involve using either a blow dryer with a stunning attachment that will temporarily straighten your hair and give it a silkier appearance. Be sure you use a product intended to minimize heat damage to the hair that you apply to the hair before you blow-dry. If these measures are not satisfactory to you then you may wish to consider applying a chemical relaxer to your hair that will make it straighter and smoother but you will have to redo the roots about every two to three months to maintain the look. If you decide to chemically straighten your hair, you should only wash it once a week to maintain a smooth frizz-free appearance. Chemically straightened hair requires a little more care and a little more attention to keeping it well-conditioned for maximum results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a back pain.

As you said it is your first time having intercourse, you observed bleeding and then after an emergency pill, you had vomiting and then fever and chill. After the first time of penetrative vaginal sex, there Is hymen rupture that causes bleeding after sex. That could be a bit different in amount from person to person. After first sex, you may have some symptoms. Those can be exaggerated by hormonal emergency pills and differ from person to person.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

I have seen that higher Lithium concentration can cause serious damage to the kidney due to dehydration and also to the metabolism. During fasting and with keto diet the body needs a lot of potassium, but the cells get lithium instead. What is your opinion about that? Is dry fasting, keto diet, and lithium intake at the same time harmful? I take normal Lithium carbonate 650-1250 mg a day.","Doctor":"Hi. See, Lithium can be harmful if hydration is not well maintained. In such cases, we recommend to increase the amount of fluid. That is to consume a good quantity of fluid in the morning before your fast starts and to drink fluids once you open your fast in the evening, and continue till the next morning. Take Lithium tablets along with two glasses of water each time. Do not go for the Keto diet. You should take a proper balanced diet. Avoid taking a high protein diet. So usually in auspicious month, the fasting duration is for 12 hours. In the remaining 12 hours, keep on taking fluids to compensate.

Testicular pain can be secondary to the inflammation of testis epididymis or both it can be associated with a hernia which not necessarily appears to you if it is small. It can as well be due to hydrocele (fluid collection around the testis) moreover varicocele (dilated veins around the testis). Testicular tumor can also cause pain testicular hematoma blood collection beside the testis or epididymal cyst, referred pain from lower ureteric stone lastly idiopathic. The accuracy of diagnosis depends on history and examination ultrasound of scrotum and ultrasound KUB (to role out any abnormality in your urinary system). Moreover urine tests to rule out urine infection. From your presentation, I doubt varicocele or hernia but cannot exclude other causes. Regarding your back pain it might be a referred type of pain from testis so I hope treating the testis pain relief it. You will need an ultrasound of your scrotum and urine analysis post ejaculation urine for culture. Then to follow up with results. At the moment for the pain, you are advised to take Naproxen sodium 500 mg twice daily for 30 days. Do not worry about it. I hope I can find the cause and give you the proper treatment after investigations further. You can follow up with me at your convenience. Scrotal support, wearing fit underwear will reduce your discomfort. I hope this helps. Ultrasound scrotum. Ultrasound KUB (kidney, ureter, and bladder). Urine analysis.

Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

When I was 33 weeks pregnant, suddenly one day my amniotic fluid started leaking. We rushed to the hospital, and I lost my baby. During pregnancy, my doctor conducted all the tests. My diabetes was negative, and my BP levels were also normal till the day. What could the reason for the amniotic fluid leak before my labor time?","Doctor":"Hi. Let me just reassure you that it was an accident, which will not repeat. The possible causes of the sudden leak of fluid or PPROM (preterm premature rupture of membrane) are as follows: If any infection enters the vagina, the source could be sexual (if you had sex around that time). It also could be a respiratory infection (if you had a running nose or a cough that time and if after clearing your nose, you had used the washroom and washed your genitals with the same hand, the infection would have transmitted to the vagina). It can also be a urinary tract infection (infection can move from urinary bladder to cervix) or gastroenteritis. All these infections can affect the strength of the membrane and can give way any day. The next possibilities are any congenital abnormalities in the uterus and fibroids in the uterus. When you have reached 33 weeks, the cause of death would be the inability to breathe by the baby. The lung is like a sponge, with lots of air spaces. There is a material called surfactant which keeps the lungs open for air to enter. It is like the glove powder which prevents the sticking of the glove to each other. The fluid has the surfactant. If the fluid leaks out early, the surfactant coat will not reach the lungs. During your next pregnancy, you need to take a few precautionary measures. For further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 22 years old. My problem is that I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for the past one year. Without knowing it, I consulted a cardiologist for chest pain and anxiety. They prescribed me Pexep-CR 25, Lonazep 0.25 and Betacap. I took those medicines regularly for 1.5 years and I felt good. When I stopped the medicines, I felt chest pain and anxiety. Again, I am feeling depressed and I think that I will die because of heart attack. Again, I consulted the cardiologist and started taking the medicines regularly. After 3 hours of medicine, I feel a burning sensation, sleepy and body pain. I had a habit of masturbation before depression and I used to masturbate regularly to get rid of nightfall. Is it safe to take Bupropion?","Doctor":"Hi. It seems that you had a relapse of anxiety symptoms after the first time you stopped your medications. Relapses are more severe. They need a higher dose and a much longer duration for recovery. Hence, in your case, you need to either increase the dose or you can add or replace the current treatment with a longer acting drug for round the clock effect. Keeping in view your sexual habits, it is preferable for you to start with Desvenlafaxine 50 mg, which will help in reducing anxiety symptoms and will not affect your sexual functioning as well. Bupropion is a good drug with minimum sexual side effects; however, it is not as effective as Desvenlafaxine or Pexep (Paroxetine) in controlling anxiety symptoms. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

But, both of us have some discomfort during sex, and ejaculation occurs outside the vagina. Nowadays I ejaculate very fast after getting excited, and my wife does not know much about sex. My wife is very sensitive when I touch her vagina, and her muscles are also very tight, and she is having PCOD problem, and she is under treatment. So, we get intimate only twice or thrice a month. As a result, my masturbation has become even more regular. Also, we tried penetration a lot of times, but the moment I come close to her, I lose my erection.

I am having a pain in my stomach like periods. My period is expected to be in the mid of the month, and my average length is 31 days. I am not pregnant because he did not discharge inside me. Is I-pill safe? When should I expect my periods?","Doctor":"Hi. I-Pill is a high dose of Progesterone hormone. It is the same hormone which is produced in the body in the second half of the period after ovulation. This pill will suddenly increase the thickness of the inner lining of the uterus, making it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy to implant. As it is a single dose, it has no strength to stand on, so it falls off, and you will get periods or bleeding of increased thickness within seven to ten days of taking the I-pill. This bleeding will be thick, fleshy pieces, dark red or brown, with slight lower abdominal pain until there is a reduction in bleeding. You have taken I-pill very close to the date of ovulation. As he did not ejaculate inside you, the chances of pregnancy are low. But the I-pill will disturb your hormonal balance, which causes the thick white discharge, and this thickness is coming out, which cause the pain. I-pill is very effective.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm?

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density.

My tooth is still sensitive to pressure while chewing and the gums between tooth 14 and 13 continues to be painful while flossing. Sometimes, the gums between those two teeth will bleed slightly while flossing. I also have occasional gum inflammation on the side that is towards the inside of my mouth. There are no open contacts visible on the crown and the dentist has taken x-rays to make sure that there is no cement stuck in the gums. The pain went away once after he did some scaling and cleaning, but returned in a few days. Could the current pain be caused by food getting stuck? I am keeping the tooth very clean with daily brushing and flossing. Occasionally, I will brush the tooth with some Listerine to keep it infection free. I am wondering whether the crown fitted badly. I am currently taking Cefadroxil. Thanks for any advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and understand it. X-ray of the root canal treated tooth.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have a business of my own. I have undergone angioplasty before 20 years and open heart surgery six years before. But, I am an active person with slim body. My height is 165 cm and weight is 60 kg. My waist is 31 inches. I have been on medication since my open heart surgery and I was prescribed Olmezest 20, Ecosprin AV 75/20 and Concor 2.5. I am not taking any medicine for the last six months, because I thought that they are affecting my sexual power. But, I find no improvement after stopping the tablets. My problem is that I am not able to hold myself and enjoy sexual pleasure. Sometimes, I do not get an erection at all and I just ejaculate in a few seconds. I think that I need some medical advice as I still want to enjoy sexual pleasure. I have never tried Viagra. Please advise what I should do and whom I should consult ?","Doctor":"Hello. Decrease or loss of ability to erect or maintain erection hard is impotence. 20% to 25% of men usually suffer this by the age 65. As females have menopause, men have andropause and it may lead to loss of libido, decreased erection and so on. This usually happens due to heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and drugs like anti-hypertensives and anti-diabetics. Particularly in heart disease due to atherosclerosis or thickening of blood vessels in the penis will lead to decreased blood flow and thus less effective erection. Ejaculation prior to complete erection is what is known as premature ejaculation. On the whole, as I have told, treating sexual problems needs detailed understanding of the mechanism and the cause. The reason can be any of the following. You should continue your medication as these agents are cardioprotective and prevent further attacks. Blood thinners are very important to maintain good blood supply to your heart and Concor (Bisoprolol) to maintain your blood pressure. I would advise you to get your cardiac testing done like ECG (electrocardiogram), echocardiogram, Stress echo or TMT (treadmill test) and restart your medication. Also, get Doppler of the penis and testosterone level check. As I have already told, your heart disease and hypertension itself may cause impotence. Talk to your cardiologist about your cardiac health as well as the use of Tablet Cialis or Tadalafil or Sildenafil. Good to hear that you are physically fit. Physical fitness is very important for heart as well as for sexual fitness. I would advise you to practice yoga. You may also try vacuum devices. Please do not be anxious. Take care of your health. Do not ever stop medication without your doctor's advise. If your problem would have been due to medicines it would have been gone after stopping drug consumption.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception.

Ventricular fibrillation, the commonest cause is coronary artery disease. The other causes are dilated cardiomyopathy or low heart function. What is his ejection fraction? Low ejection fraction due to any reason like coronary artery disease or others can lead to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. He should undergo angiography, and echocardiogram, if he has not already. His electrolyte levels should also be checked as it is a very important precipitator for ventricular fibrillation. In treatment, he should receive Cordarone (Amiodarone), and multiple other medicines depending upon the echocardiogram and angiography reports.

He is a 29 year old male, whose height is approximately 6 feet, and he weighs 150 kg. Over the last two years, my fiance had lost around 40 kg using the Banting diet, common in our country. It is based on the principles of no carbohydrates, starches or sugars and higher protein, but does allow the odd cheat meal. Since then, in the last eight months, he has had two attempts at quitting smoking and was put on Pendine 5 and Zartan CO for high blood pressure. He has a family history of hypertension. As a result, he has gained weight at quite a quick pace despite sticking to his Banting diet. The meal sizes have not changed, and he has an active lifestyle. We hike or do vigorous walks of 5 to 8 km on most days. At this stage, he has almost gained the full 40 kg back in less than a year, which seems very excessive and way above normal for quitting smoking. I was wondering if perhaps he has some thyroid issues, as his mother has hypothyroidism. Or could it be a side effect of the medication? We need some advice. We are at a loss at what to do. I would like to add that he struggled with weight issues since childhood. Also, we are currently not in his country, so visiting a doctor may be difficult.","Doctor":"Hello. Keep up the diet and exercise. Do not get disheartened. The tests should shed some light on the cause of the excessive weight gain.

I was on medication for four years and I stopped the medication when there had been no flare-ups or any syndrome for a while. Three months back, I had a flare up for the first time in three years. The symptoms were low fever, joint pain, and headaches. One night I had a seizure due to the flare up and low blood pressure. The doctor put me back on all the medications plus Keppra. My first question is how long should I keep taking Keppra? When I checked with my neurologist, he said it is supposed to be a lifelong treatment even though the seizure only happened once. All other doctors said it was associated with the lupus flare. I know Keppra can cause side effects so I am wondering if it is really necessary to take this drug for life when I had the seizure only once and it was due to lupus. If the dosage can be reduced (or eventually eliminated), at what pace should I do that? I am currently taking 500 mg twice a day.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that this is the lowest therapeutic dose of Keppra. So the dose cannot be reduced further. Regarding the period of treatment, I would explain that it is necessary to take Keppra (Levetiracetam) at least three years after the last seizure. After this period of time, we can try to reduce the dose very gradually. If seizures reoccur, treatment should be continued with this dose for another three years and so on. We cannot predict if you will be on this medication for your entire life. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is 56 years old.

He had to have a stent put in his heart and will be medicated for the rest of his life. He has been told that it is vital he eats low fat and low cholesterol diet. I cook for him and I am worried whether I feed him the wrong things. I know that meat is not good for the heart, so we limit it and always go for lean cuts, but I am confused about the difference between animal-based saturated fats and plant-based saturated fats. For example, everyone raves about the health benefits of coconut oil and coconut milk, but both are extremely high in saturated fat. I googled this and find reports stating that it is a different kind of saturated fat and does not affect the heart badly, but I do not know if this is true. For someone like my husband, is all saturated fat bad? Also, is chicken really healthier meat than beef? It seems to have a high cholesterol content so I do not know if he should be eating it. Any advice would be much appreciated. He is currently Rosuvastatin, Bystolic, and Aspirin.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern on the high-fat diet and follow the mentioned points below. Just to make it easy, we need some fat which is good and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) like almonds and walnuts are good as these are rich in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. Similarly, the fat we have in coconut oil is different. The fat in the chicken can be removed by removing the skin, where as beef has inbuilt fat which cannot be removed easily hence we suggest to include fish and chicken avoiding beef. Considering fat, we miss out on other nutrients too, so it is advised to reduce the oil intake like healthy individuals can take half a liter of oil per month if you are two your cooking should be within 1 liter of oil only. Coconut oil is having saturated fat but it burns easily in high humidity areas. If we live in high humidity area it is better to include coconut oil to protect our joints and skin. If we leave apart from high humidity area it is better to use refined oil."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Please note that the following medications are not available in my country Valdoxan, Edronax, Desyrel, Pristiq and Viibryd.","Doctor":"Hi. Paroxetine acts on multiple receptors, and it is known for its withdrawal effects of weight gain due to its antihistaminic and anticholinergic action. SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can cause significant sexual dysfunction. Usually, Bupropion along with SSRI is prescribed to reduce its sexual side effect. In your case, you are using Sertraline with Bupropion, and you are reporting no improvement in weight gain or sexual function, it is not that common to gain weight with Sertraline, but it can happen. Buproprion traditionally is an activating drug, and it is useful for reducing weight and improving sexual functions. I suggest you try taking Escitalopram 10 mg and Buspirone 15 mg (7.5 mg twice daily). Escitalopram is a classic SSRI, which has a minimal side effect of weight gain and sexual dysfunction. I know you do not want to take multiple medicines, but it is a much better approach to handling your illness. I would suggest you start this combination of drugs immediately after consulting your specialist, as some people are more sensitive to the adverse effects of the drug, so we may have to explore multiple options before we find the right combination for you.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She prefers the right breast than the left and cries to latch on the left. So I started to pump and bottle feed from left and direct feed from the right. I pump three to four times a day and make around 100 ml from the left. My breasts are lopsided and the right side is full most of the time while the left side feels very soft. This week all of a sudden my little one prefers bottle than my breasts so I wanted to wean of bottle feeding the pumped milk. She now sucks like around 30 minutes a day from the left and rest from the right. I do not want to pump or express again from the left to increase the supply. My question is, how can I balance feeding from both breasts without pumping? My little one does not like spoon feeding the expressed breast milk. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. It is normal for a baby that he or she chooses any one side of the breast on its own. But if you feel that your breast lopsided then you need to take some tricks. Start to feed your baby from the small one. Let him suck more and more from the small one. After some days, it will become large and engorge. But do not avoid to breastfed from the larger one too. When the large one fills please feed your baby from this side or express milk by using hand. You can use a breast pump to express milk from the larger breast. But if you do not want to use pump, use your hands. You do not need to feed him with this expressed milk. Do continue breastfeeding a few days from small one more and more. After some days both will become balanced. One thing do not practice your baby bottle feeding. Then he won't breastfeed again."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a rash on my back, neck and chest for over a month. I visited my physician and she thought it could be a fungal infection.

The doctors did not inform us it will be a forceps delivery till last minute. Now, the baby is normal. But, my wife is facing urine inconsistency issues. Before and during pregnancy other than her sinusitis everything was normal. Initially as per the advice of urogynaecologist she had medication to check the progress. Later she was referred to an urologist and she was given Urivoid medicine. We have told the doctor that she is not able to take all antibiotics. Still she was insisted to take Urivoid (half in the morning and half at night) and after that she had suffered with all side effects like vomiting, drowsiness and fever. They had done urodynamics, uroflowmetry, abdominal scan, x-ray, etc., but unable to figure out the cause of the issue. Later on we went to a well-known hospital for sudden chill and fever. After a week of observation she got discharged. Senior general physician had recommended us to check the issue with their doctors (gynaecologist and urologist) and they have suggested to undergo one observation test where in they will pass a liquid by giving anesthesia to her in an operation theater and observe her for an hour how the urine is passing through her body and is there any leak in her urinary system or not. Doctor advised us to come after 1-2 months once she becomes fit and normal. My doubts are can I go ahead and perform this test? Will this test will be really beneficial? Will it help to figure out the actual issue? Do we have any other method of evaluation or test to figure out the issue? I heard that there will be complication if a baby is born with forceps delivery. Can you please guide and help me on how to identify the future risk and how to overcome this.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your query. I totally understand the problem. It is not a very frequent but a well known complication of forceps. I am really sorry to know your wife is suffering from urinary incontinence. I know it is an agonizing problem. Urinary incontinence is of three types. From your history I have not been able to make out exactly which type of problem she has. Does she leak urine continuously? Or not able to hold urine while coughing or laughing? The type of her problem will give me an idea as to the exact cause of her problem. Also, I would like to inform you that decision of forceps delivery is usually made at the very end only. There is no way to predict exactly when and which patient will need it. So, do not think your doctor could have prevented this complication. It is a sorry event but there was no way of knowing that this is going to happen. The medicine Urivoid (Bethanechol chloride) is a good medicine to treat the condition your wife has. Also the tests advised are a good way to detect the site of obstruction or leakage in the urinary system. This test will differentiate if there is any abnormal communication in the urinary system also known as fistula in medical terms. This is what I was referring to as the different types of incontinence. A fistula will show as a continuous and slow leakage of urine. Whereas episodic incontinence like while coughing or lifting heavy weights will show as abnormal uroflow studies which you say are normal. Only in the second type of problem the Urivoid will work.

You have not mentioned your previous medical, obstetrics, gynecological, and drug history here. As per your history, you have pain in the vagina and frequent urination since today morning. You have a history of vaginitis and urinary tract infection years back. I really do not know if have u been treated for any disease like diabetes, hypertension or any other like thyroid.

How to get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hi. We normally do not get chickenpox on more than one occasion. This is because, we develop a strong immune response to the virus and our body fights it before the infection takes hold. However, of course it is possible. If you did not develop a strong initial immune response or if there is an abnormality with your immune system then it can develop multiple times. The virus can also remain dormant within your nerve cells and trigger again in the form of shingles later in life. Chickenpox needs to run its course. It remains incredibly contagious for the initial 10 to 21 days and whilst the vesicles (lumps and bumps) are weeping and oozing. The vesicles only appear quite some time after initial infection of chickenpox. As a result, by the time the vesicles have scabbed over and are dry, they no longer pose a risk of cross infection to other people. Full blood count.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

If histamine level is normal in my body, I can experience calmness and happiness. But if histamine levels are increased due to allergy, I feel some kind of discomfort. So to avoid discomfort asking medicine to reduce histamine levels.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concerns. Having allergy can cause a lot of discomfort in life, affect the quality of life, and result in anxiety and depression eventually. But, you need not worry. We have solutions for allergy.

I went to urgent care, and they did a quick strep test, which came back as positive. I also had a little bit of a stuffy nose, and mainly the right ear felt full or plugged. I went home with antibiotics, and after like four days, it seemed to be subsiding. Then on about the eighth day of the pills, it started to come back. By the time the antibiotics were gone, it was back. I went to urgent care, and again they did an actual culture that you grow in a dish. It was negative for strep, so they said it was a virus. My throat was still red, and the ear was congested. Then I waited. It would seem to get better and then would come back. Every time it came back, it hurt worse. It might be gone for a day or two or twelve hours. I started having a tickle in my throats and a cough. About eight days ago, it came back in a big way. I never ran a fever at all, which makes it seem weird. A few of the glands on my neck seem larger. There is phlegm coming from somewhere, and I cannot tell if it is from the sinuses or not. I always have to clear my throat. There is now some sinus involvement, as my cheekbones are aching. My voice feels scratchy. It does not hurt more to speak or eat, but it is annoying to do both, as it all feels tired and raw. I hate to make a big deal out of nothing, but looking things up online is telling me it could be bad. Can you give me any insight?","Doctor":"Hi.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Every night i take cetirizine because it works everytime i take it the cough stop. But im scared that it might be worst. What should i do?","Doctor":"You are probably having what we call as an allergic pharyngitis, avoid spicy oily and junk food altogether for a few days. Yes dust can be one reason why your nose/throat might be creating a lot of phelgm, sometimes even dust at home(as in when u vaccum or mop the floor or look into old stuff having dust ) can lead to such issues. Besides, even the slightest of acidity can be one hidden cause. In allergic pharyngitis you won't have many tel a tale signs except of mucus irritating your throat. Advice 1.Have simple food with least spices 2.Avoid dust at all costs, wear an n95 mask, cuz that's the only thing effective against dust 3. Consider salt water gargles (one glass of boiled warm water with 2 tsps of salt, dissolve and gargle 4. Keep sipping on warm water 5. Long term use of levocetrizine is not recommended 6.

SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction) is a good technique with good results. I did in many patients and the result was very nice.

Schizophrenia is a chronic neuropsychiatric illness with changes in behavior, thought, perception and a lot of other psychiatric symptoms. Sulpitac (Amisulpride), Nexipride (Levosulpiride) and Arpizol (Aripiprazole) are antipsychotic drugs and help to treat psychotic symptoms. If you are symptom free with Arpizol for the last few years, then in my opinion you can consider reducing the dose of the drug. There is no use of continuing Pacitane (Trihexyphenidyl) with Arpizol because the drug at this dose does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms. Consult your specialist doctor and ask for re-evaluation and get your dose reduced.

My latest echo reported mild concentric LVH, moderate diastolic dysfunction with increased LVEDP, dilated LA, sclerosed aortic valve and mild PAH (PASP=40mmHg). I have enclosed the above reports for your reference. Are my symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue due to diastolic dysfunction? Or due to my sleep apnea? I am not able to use CPAP due to body jerks and discomfort with CPAP. Is this diastolic dysfunction serious? Will it lead to heart failure? My BP is usually 140-150/80 mmHg. Is there a chance for minor blocks in arteries having become bigger? What course of action should I follow now?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and keen observation. Yes, diastolic dysfunction can cause heart failure. But, we need to find out the reason here. Sleep apnea is one additive factor and need to treat it. Also, you need to control your hypertension more. Reduction of weight along with medication will help to decrease diastolic dysfunction and mostly your symptoms.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Pain is only mild but it extends up to the neck area. Sometimes if she has severe pain, she vomits.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that this kind of headache could be a migraine. I recommend starting Verapamil 40 mg three times daily and Amitriptyline 25 mg half a tablet before sleep. A brain CT (computed tomography) scan would help exclude any other brain lesions, but considering the COVID situation, I would not recommend going to an ER. Besides the situation is not an urgency, considering the fact that she suffered from headaches like this before. For rapid pain relief, I would recommend taking Ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily coupled with Acetaminophen.

I had gone through your question. For further queries consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am considering pursuing a second opinion about some palpable lymph nodes that have been present in my neck for approximately six months now. There is a total of eight of them, present on both sides of the neck. These are all cervical lymph nodes, with the exception of one, which is submental. I have seen my physician about this, and subsequently an ENT. I have had ultrasounds of the nodes done on two separate occasions over a period of two months, as well as two CBCs to check for anything in the blood. Thus far, everything has come back normal. The first report reads: palpable foci correspond to normal-appearing lymph nodes. The second report reads: Palpable areas of concern all correspond to benign-appearing lymph nodes. No pathologically enlarged nodes are seen. None of the lymph nodes are larger than 0.7 cm. So, technically they are not enlarged, and bloodwork is normal. Therefore, my doctors have told me I do not need to worry about anything like lymphoma for now, and that a biopsy is not necessary. However, my concerns are that, even though the lymph nodes have not changed much over the last six months, none of the nodes have gone away at all. And, I have received no explanation for the cause of the palpable nodes. Secondly, I have been using Humira to treat my Crohn's disease, which I am aware carries an increased risk for lymphoma. I have not had any other significant symptoms like fever, weight loss, or night sweats.Therefore, my question is, should I push harder to get a biopsy of the most prominent lymph node to rule out lymphoma for sure? And, should I seek a second opinion about all of this? I just cannot put my mind at ease, and I feel as though my concerns are being dismissed after the examinations, ultrasounds, and blood tests. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello.

My weight is 60 kg and height is 5'8\\". I grown up with great responsibility of family, but never fulfilled it up to the mark besides living my life in fear from society. I managed good academics and some standard over time. But, I have also developed very poor social skill, dependency to some extent and fear while facing anything new. I do not want to move from a situation where I have fixed myself. Three years before I had a breakup and also was idle without job. This had caused me severe stress and crying episode about which I did not share with any one. I got job, but did not feel happy about it. The emptiness and worry followed me. I got into another relationship which was lovely. I got involved in alcohol drinking and smoking. I faced a time where job stress killed me every day and I detached myself from everyone, felt emotionless even with my family, drowsiness and no sense of reality. I became so casual that only thing I wanted is nothing should worry me. If anything worried me I tried to solve it immediately with a step which might be job threatening. I lived without any pleasure, confidence, goal and routine. I did live my life, but never felt any connection as I have become a robot. Forgetfulness, short term memory loss and no attention or interest at all. Today I have improved myself and do not drink regularly; I do exercises, do talk with family and some friends, watch television and got a better job. But still, I am not happy.

However, vomiting issue is resolved, but still, she is passing loose stool. She is on Ondem thrice daily 2 ml, half an hour before meal (today the course will end), Zinconia 5 ml once daily for five days, Decolic INF drops three times daily for three days (today Decolic course will end), Enterogermina twice daily for seven days, Arbivit Forte 5 ml daily (this is her regular medicine and not a part of the prescribed medications by the doctor for loose motion) and Peditrol ORS throughout the day (one liter). We are diluting five sachets of Peditrol ORS in one liter of water, consumed by her each day. She is accepting all forms of liquid as well. The doctor has advised for stool RE/CS/OBT and reducing substance. She also has lactose intolerance so we do not give her any milk products, only lactose-free substitutes like Isomil and Nestum and right now the doctor has said not to give breastmilk as well. The doctor gave SOS medicine as Bacigyl-N but looking at her report she is dead against to start the antibiotic. The issue is she is not improving in her stool and already four days have passed. She is average active (normally she is very hyper) and accepting food as well (in smaller proportion). I just weighed her, and she has lost 350 gm of weight. She is our first baby hence we are very tensed. Please advice best possible ways to make her fit.","Doctor":"Hi. Going through the history, it suggests that the child is in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Medicines are rightly prescribed. I would suggest no need for vomiting medicine now, as vomiting has stopped. Withhold Arbivit Forte (Cholecalciferol) till loose motions subside. The stool report does not warrant to start on antibiotics as it is near normal report except for reducing substance (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As most of the AGE is viral, where there is no role of antibiotics. Secondly, antibiotics can itself aggravate loose motion (antibiotic-associated diarrhea). The best thing is the child is accepting food/meal, which is a good sign.Though in small quantity, which shall improve over a period. Do not be in a hurry to look for quick results as the body takes its own time to recover. Make sure the child is passing adequate urine, and the tongue is moist, keep giving fluids and ORS (oral rehydration solution) as adviced by the doctors. AGE usually takes 7 to 10 days to recover. So, do not get tense. You can continue Zinconia (Zinc acetate) total for 14 days, Enterogermina and ORS medicine. You can add Enuff sachet (Racecadotril 10mg) half sachet twice a day for five days. I believe she will improve as she is on right medications and taking the meal. So relax. Meanwhile, no cold drinks/water, give lots of lukewarm water/homemade soups.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

Kindly confirm whether your blood pressure is raised during winter by repeated BP recordings. Before BP recording you should not take any hit beverage, smoking and be calm.

The above measures can decrease BP by at least 10 mmHg. We can try the non-pharmacological management for two to three weeks. If the pressure did not come down, then we need to start medication.

The bleeding due to menses on 21st January after ipill confirmatively rules out pregnancy which could have occurred due to sex on 13th January. The repeat sexual intercourse held on 25th January (she was in her safe period and hence pregnancy is unlikely) and then 10th February (this time she was in her fertile period) might result in pregnancy. But you have had protected sexual intercourse. Chances of pregnancy are minimal and the spotting is unlikely to be an implantation bleed. The spotting is more likely to be a breakthrough bleeding which is possibly due to the side effects of ipill which is known to cause irregularity in menses for the next 2 cycles. However, the best way to confirm or negate pregnancy would be to opt for a serum beta hCG test.

For that reason, I keep getting this burning itching sensation again and again if I stop taking the medicines and on the other hand, I do not want to run myself on medication for months and years. I researched a bit online and surprisingly, found out that allopathy has no perfect cure for it but homeopathy does. That is the reason I wanted to try homeopathy treatment this time. Here are my following questions: I read that homeopathy treatment takes a while to cure. So, can I use these Bepozic (antihistamine) tablets twice a day, so that I do not have to worry about itching? Is it safe to use homeopathy medicines with other generic medicines like Paracetamol, Cetirizine, Benadryl, etc.? I just want to be sure if I can take them along with homeopathy medicines, just in case I encounter any of those in the near future? How long does this treatment take to cure, from your past experiences or consultations?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), your thyroid profile is normal, and serum triglycerides level is a little bit high. For urticaria, in homeopathy, we have best remedies. So, you need not worry about your problem. Your blood reports are not related to your problem. While using homeopathy, you need not use antihistamine medicines. Homeopathy can solve your problem. Homeopathy is the best and no side effects. And along with allopathic medicines you can use homeopathic medicines. Due to urticaria, the eruptions like hives occur. The range of size from a few millimeters to several inches in diameter. It is caused by allergic reaction. You may have acute urticaria. Before getting this problem, have you used any medicines for other problem? Some foods also cause urticaria. Some bacteria like streptococcus and Helicobacter pylori also cause urticaria. Symptoms of urticaria are intense itching, burning, and sense of heat. According to your symptoms, the homeopathic drug ARS ALB 200 is the best remedy. I suggest 10 pills once for three days only.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

Your diet? Nutritional deficiencies? Autoimmune disorders and blood disorders (rare)? Your water intake per day? Generally, oral ulcers tend to heal by themselves within 7-10 days. If there is pain or discomfort hampering routine activities like chewing or talking, a topical formulation like an antiseptic coupled with an analgesic gel can be applied to the ulcer directly for symptomatic relief. Also, a nutritional supplement rich in B-complex vitamins is prescribed to promote healing. I hope this helps. Trauma due to lip biting, or during brushing. Nutritional deficiencies.

I am also taking phytonutrients like Quercetin, Saw Palmetto, Cranberry extract, D-Mannose, Prostaquil, Swedish Pollen Flower Extract, etc. I have also done acupuncture without success. My urologist did an X-ray of the urethra and says that there is a mild bladder neck obstruction and a mildly enlarged prostate because of which I am not able to pass urine fully. My urine flow is also weak (peak flow of 17 ml) and it takes some time for urination to begin. I have a history of chronic testicular pain in the left testis for the last ten years and burning sensation at the tip of the penis (since five years). It was suspected as TB of epididymitis and I was given anti-TB drugs for nine months. But, there was only a mild improvement in pain. I consulted two other urologists and they told me that I do not have TB but chronic non-bacterial prostatitis for which there is no effective treatment in allopathy. I am taking painkillers like Tapentadol along with Duzela for the last five years from a pain specialist. There is an improvement in pain on taking these medicines. I have Grade 2 varicocele in left testicle and the pain is confined to the epididymis and spermatic cord. The pain gets worse after exertion. I also take Daflon on and off.

I would like to look at Ayurveda for a few more years because the narrowing of the urethra/bladder neck is mild and the prostate enlargement has been reduced after taking ayurvedic medicines.

I am having Tramadol and Paracetamol for pain relief but they are not helping much. Could you tell me the underlying cause? Will I require a walking aid?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to icliniq.com. As you must be aware by now, sciatica is a term used when a person experiences radiating leg pain due to some pressure on the nerves. Assessment will include intensity of back pain, intensity of leg pain, the distance you walk without any requirement of analgesic and detailed neurological examination including assessment of motor power, sensory evaluation and evaluation of deep tendon reflexes. This will then be followed by dynamic x-ray and MRI scan of lumbar spine if required. Depending upon the correlation of clinical examination and investigation results, management can then be formulated. If you have localized back pain with some radiculopathy symptoms with no other neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesias, etc., then you can start with following recommendations for initial period of two to three weeks. We will observe your response to this conservative management protocol for next two to three weeks. If you are not feeling better, then we might have to get some investigations like dynamic x-rays of lower back and few blood tests for evaluation. Enclose your previous investigation and doctor's prescription. I can see them and advise you accordingly. Disc prolapse. X-ray LS (lumbosacral) spine - AP (anteroposterior) and lateral (flexion and extension) views. Avoid lifting heavyweight and acute forward bending in mornings.

The doctor advised me to get OCT and CCT. With the test reports he said that I have glaucoma. He advised me to take an eye drop named Lumigan one drop daily at night in both eyes. I am not satisfied with his opinion and so went to another doctor. He said no glaucoma and advised to take vitamin tablet daily. After a week consulted another doctor and he said that the OCT report is normal and no need to take any eye drop. After a week I went to a famous eye hospital and consulted there. Again took an OCT and reported to have glaucoma and advised to take Brimosun 0.15% drops twice daily with a gap of 12 hours. A month later went to another hospital and the doctor said he is in confused state and asked me to check my eye regularly and take OCT for every six months. Then two months later I visited a glaucoma expert and he examined my eye deeply and done another OCT. After all tests he said I am a glaucoma suspect patient and advised to take eye drop Timolast 0.5% or Timolet od every morning one drop in both eyes. My eye pressure is always between 20 and 24 in both eyes. My first and second time CCT reports are 502-503 and 533-534 respectively. My OCT reports showed 10% area in red figure and balance in green figure in the left eye and 10% area in yellow and balance in green in the right eye. Is it necessary to take glaucoma drop? If yes, which one to take from the above? Is Timolet a highly concentrated one in comparison of Brimosun 0.15%? My mother suffered with glaucoma. I am taking Thyronorm 75 daily. Please advise me in detail. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all please relax. There is nothing to worry. All the doctors are correct. Now let me explain you. Glaucoma is a very slowly progressive disease. You are glaucoma suspect means you are at risk of glaucoma or have many predisposing factors for glaucoma, but there is no conclusive evidence to diagnose glaucoma. Predisposing factors present in you are as follows: All these factors make you susceptible for glaucoma, but it is not conclusive. You should not worry about glaucoma or loss of eye sight. Having said that you can use Timolast eye drop (Timolol) or Timolet eye drop twice a day, there is no harm in using this eye drop. Some doctors give Lumigan (Bimatoprost) and some give Brimosun (Brimonidine). There is no harm in using any of these eye drops, but please use only one of these.

The most common areas are in my upper legs and skin where my pubic hair lies. I hope you can help me out in explaining why this happens to me. I have this for almost two years now. I was given antibiotics once in the past.","Doctor":"Hi. Recurrent folliculitis occurs in people who has deficiency to fight staphylococcus aureus bacteria. These are small boils which occur repeatedly at multiple sites of the body. Antibiotic heals them but they again appear after a few weeks or days. It can develop any time during life and may vanish within a short period. Repeated antibiotic courses has to be done but precautions which I am writing down if taken properly mitigate this problem. First thing is you have to take an antibiotic course for the presenting complaint. Take Amoxiclav 625 mg (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) thrice daily for five days and Mupirocin ointment twice daily. This has to be continued for a longer period of up to 1 month. Apply it inside the nostril, in the axilla, in the pubic area, in umbilicus daily twice. Use antibacterial soap like Cetrilak (Cetrimide). Do not touch the parts of the body repeatedly like scratching, as it also transmits this bacteria. In some people, if Amoxiclav does not work we give other antibiotics but you have to try this first. Review after four weeks."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife has completed 39 weeks of pregnancy. We got an ultrasound yesterday, and the report is completely normal. But her labor pain is not getting induced, so the doctor is suggesting cesarean, as the baby's weight is 3.65 kg. My wife would like to have a normal delivery by inducing pain artificially. Our first baby was normally delivered six years ago, by inducing pain artificially when he was 3.33 kg. My wife is 35 years old, and I am attaching the latest ultrasound reports. Is there any harm to the baby during normal delivery in our case? Is there any chance of the head or shoulder getting stuck? Is the baby's weight more than normal? What is the possibility of normal delivery after inducing pain? Thanks and regards.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and it is normal. No, delivery is risk-free, normal or caesarean. If her BP (blood pressure) and blood sugar are normal, then there is no contraindication to normal delivery. Regarding the chances of the head getting stuck, it can be assessed only at the onset of labor by internal physical examination of her pelvis and relative size to head of the baby. A baby of this size may be delivered vaginally, but many parameters should be optimum. She had normal delivery six years back, she is 35 now, her pelvic bones and muscles may have become less stretchable, and she may not get good enough contractions, and the labor may become prolonged in that case the baby in the womb may get less oxygen. These are possibilities that may or may not happen, if she goes into labor, she and the baby has to be carefully monitored, and if the things do not go wrong, then she may deliver normally. Until the outcome, no prediction can be made with surety.

I have been going at it probably twice a day lately. I am just a little concerned that it may be herpes. But I have not been sexually active for a very long time. Also, I have had two negative herpes blood test 28 weeks post exposure and again 70 weeks post exposure from my last sexual encounter and both negative. I did test positive for HSV1 though. I usually get between one to three outbreaks annually on my top and bottom lip. Anyway, I have noticed irritation in that area in the past when I masturbate so I am not sure if it is just a minor chaffing or friction burn or possibly herpes. I am currently being treated for genital warts that my last girlfriend left me with almost 17 months ago. So I am very conscious of any changes below the belt. I did not happen to notice any blistering but the area looks shiny and a little wet. I am not experiencing any pain either.","Doctor":"Hi. I have been through your case in detail. Well in short as you know there are two possibilities:  1. Friction erosion. 2. It could be herpes infection. Herpes 2 usually on genitalia and herpes 1 on lips. As now there is no limitation in having herpes 1 on genitalia due to common oral sex. So in my opinion, you may have it as blistering is not the only presentation, superficial erosions also represent herpes. So it is always better to keep pathology of herpes in mind rather rely only on the frictional blister. For management, do the following: All treatment for seven days. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 46-year-old male. I have recurring HSV-1 around the base (and inside) the nose. I have an outbreak now and my last outbreak was about 52 days ago. In childhood, I began with blisters on the lips; in the past five to 10 years, it seems it has migrated to the nose. Also, in the past, I could take Acyclovir or Valacyclovir successfully for treatment. And for a period of some years, I was able to take 500 mg Valacyclovir daily as a prophylaxis. But now those drugs (and also Famciclovir, which I have tried recently) each cause dose-dependent unpleasant side effects of CNS stimulation and muscle tension. So, my upcoming question is regarding treatment strategy and options. My inclination when outbreaks recur is to take Famciclovir at a low dose (250 mg initially and 125 mg every 12 hours for three days). It is not clear how much this may actually help, but it is what I feel comfortable presently doing and the side effects are at least tolerable at this dose. I would not want to take it daily at this dose though. There tends to be a crash after finishing it from the drop/lapse in stimulation. With this background, on to my questions: Does the frequency of outbreaks increase the likelihood of spreading the virus to new locations? Again, I am seeing a frequency of about every two months. I am particularly concerned about ocular herpes. What I am driving at is, can I feel safe in avoiding taking a daily, preventive dosing of an antiviral? And when I get an outbreak, do I need to treat it at a high dose of antiviral (or treat it at all, really) to prevent the spread to new outbreak sites (such as to the eye, or even other parts of the face)? I worry that I need to try to endure the side effects of the antivirals in order to prevent the virus from spreading to new locations (again, such as the eye). Perhaps you can help assuage me of this fear. My current medications are Synthroid 75 mcg daily, Lansoprazole 30 mg daily AM, Omeprazole 40 mg daily PM and Prozac 35 mg daily.","Doctor":"Hello.

It is elevating the right kidney and indenting the right psoas muscle; however, the fat planes appear well preserved. Above findings indicate a benign process more likely than a malignant one.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

He has been taking his medicines since then. But his cough still remains the same. Are there any suggested medicines or easy home remedies to follow?","Doctor":"Hi. It seems your grandfather is having a cough for three weeks. Cough in adults are classified as acute, subacute, or chronic based on the duration. Acute cough lasts up to three weeks, subacute cough lasts three to eight weeks, and chronic cough lasts longer than eight weeks. Subacute cough often has a post-infectious origin and will typically resolve without treatment. It is usually secondary to asthma or bacterial sinusitis. Reassurance is a good approach in otherwise healthy patients. Oral or inhaled corticosteroids, Ipratropium, or cough suppressants may be prescribed to help with sleep. The viral infection or bacterial infection mostly produce a fever and cough with expectoration. These symptoms you did not mention, I assume they are absent. Post viral cough can be last up to six weeks. I would like to ask about red flags symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and hemoptysis. If they are present you need further evaluation on an urgent basis. Other common causes of chronic cough (usually more than eight weeks) are allergic. Most often, chronic cough is due to postnasal drainage, asthma, and/or gastroesophageal disease. Some drugs such as ACE inhibitor (a type of anti-hypertensive medication) also results in chronic cough. Stopping such medication helps. Other remedies are steam inhalation alone or with menthol. Cough drops or lozenges soothe an irritated throat. Saltwater gargle. Honey is also helpful.

You can learn to control PE by doing this exercise - Pull your muscles at the end of urination for few seconds then release, repeat this several times daily. Another method is stop-start technique: When you feel that you are going to ejaculate, stop the sexual stimulation and divert your mind, the penis will relax. After sometime start the stimulation again and repeat the procedure. Over few months you will gradually increase your ejaculation time.

The neurologist did not run any scientific test and determined I likely crushed my peroneal nerve and said to return in four to six weeks for physical therapy. About two weeks later, while lying in bed on my side, I noticed my arm tingle a bit and when I got up to shake it out the tingling eventually subsided. But, I have experienced weakness in that arm. Last night while sitting upright on my bed, my left leg began to experience a similar sensation. The limbs are still functional and the tingling does not persist, but it feels weak.

The next important point which you have told is the mode of onset and the tingling eventually subsided. The following parameters can be found out only by a clinical examination and they are most important to fix the diagnosis. In the same way, need to get at least two investigations, nerve conduction studies and MRI spine. It can be either a peripheral vascular disease leading to low perfusion or a peripheral neuropathy.

There are two schools of thought regarding the risk of infection in total knee/hip replacement after local steroid injections. As the causes of infection are multifactorial, results favoring both schools of thought are seen. Since you are only undergoing arthroscopy or hernia repair, the duration of surgery, soft tissue handling, the absence of prosthesis all favor very low risk of infection. You can continue turmeric, multivitamin, and fish oil until the day before your surgery.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

It is about the size of a 5 cent Australian piece, and I can feel it under my skin almost as if the skin moves over the top of it. So, I do not think it is a dermatological thing. I have little spots around my pubic area but I think that is because of the hairs. This feels like something different. It does not look inflamed from the outside, and it is not sore to touch (just a bit tender). It feels like it rolls underneath my skin but stays in the same spot obviously.","Doctor":"Hi. If I am not wrong 5 cents Australian piece is around 2 cm in size. As you have described, it is a lymph node in your inguinal region. The human body has about 600 lymph nodes. Their role is to clean antigens from the extracellular fluid. It helps in fighting inflammation and infection. Lymphadenopathy (LAP) is the term to describe the conditions in which lymph nodes become abnormal in size, consistency, and number. A normal-sized lymph node is usually less than 1 cm in diameter. An inguinal lymph node size up to 1.5 cm should be considered normal. Lymphadenopathy can be called generalized when it affects two or more parts of the body. Enlarged lymph nodes associated with significant fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss (more than 10% in less than six months) are considered as red flags. It required an urgent evaluation for lymphoma. Those are not present in your case. Pain and tenderness on a lymph node is a non-specific finding. It is typically due to minor infection. Other causes of the inguinal lymph node are benign reactive lymphadenopathy, sexually transmitted disease, cellulitis or local infection, etc. Benign reactive inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen in patients who walk barefooted outdoors. If it is tender you can take Paracetamol. Keep watch. Avoid walking barefoot. Keep hygiene of your private parts. If it persists and associated pain or fever or other site engaged lymph nodes, you will need an evaluation. I hope this helps. Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a male, 24 years old. I have recently developed with nodular acne on my left cheek and visited a dermatologist. The doctor has prescribed the following for 15 days for pimples: Rejuglow face wash gel. Nilac ointment (twice daily). Minoz 50 tablet (once daily). He has asked me to come after 15 days for prescription of scars; once pimples are eliminated. Are the prescription mentioned above effective? How many days and what ointment/face wash gel/home remedy is effective in reducing the scar faster? (he has told it takes 3 months) Give a second opinion.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to us. Acne treatment depends upon the type of acne lesions. From the treatment provided it seems, you are having pustular (pus filled) or papular (red raised bumps) lesions. In case of nodular acne, lesions are large nodules. For nodular acne we usually prescribe oral isotretinoin in dose of 20 mg to 40 mg daily depending on severity. If there are just one or two nodules then we can also treat the same by intralesional steroid and antibiotic injections. In papular or pustular acne, I prefer tablet doxycycline 100mg twice in a day or minocycline 100mg daily (minoz once daily) along with topical adapalene clindamycin gel like deriva CMS or epiduo gel, once in a night application. Usually lesions subside by two weeks to a month. In case of nodular acne treatment, it needs to be continued for a month or may be more as it is a severe acne variant. For marks and scars, one may use topical creams like glycolic acid, azelaic acid, kojic acid, tretinoin cream etc. One may also take sessions of chemical peels or microdermabrasion. The treatment advised and time required for response depends upon the severity of scar. For further clarification, kindly send us the pictures of the acne lesions and ask a dermatologist or an acne specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 33 year old unmarried male, and I have a back stiffness problem for more than three years. Everyone gives the says that my posture is not proper while walking. Two years back when I consulted a doctor, he suspected ankylosing spondylitis, but HLA-B27 was negative. After seeing the x-ray, the doctor told that there are some fusions between the bones. He recommended few vitamin tablets for few months, and he asked to do exercise.

From your history, I could understand that you are suffering from uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for one month.

There are various causes for tinnitus and the most common among them are a sensorineural hearing loss, Eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, ossicular discontinuity where ear bones become dislodged from their joints, chronic middle ear infection etc. But, the most common cause for ringing sound in the ear is a sensorineural hearing loss, probably age-related. Even unrecognizable minimal sensorineural hearing loss can cause disturbing tinnitus.  Usually, fungal or bacterial infection of the external ear will not cause tinnitus. It is unlikely that it is bacterial or fungal. Infection of the ear canal is causing the ringing sound in the ear. There may be a small perforation of your eardrum or there may be a collection of fluid in your middle ear which can cause the ringing sensation in the ear. There can also be ear blockage. In that case, your symptoms should resolve with antibiotics within a few weeks. You should undergo pure tone audiogram to assess your hearing threshold. If there is a significant change in higher frequency hearing then that is the cause for your tinnitus. If your symptoms persist then hearing aids or tinnitus maskers will help you to overcome your problems. There are other treatment modalities such as a tinnitus retraining therapy which can be helpful in some patients You should consider visiting an audiologist also after consultation with your doctor.

Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hi.I have some more queries about your complaints. As male urethra is S shaped some urine gets trapped and milking often clears the trapped urine at the end of urination. The complaints you have quoted may fit into one of the below. BPH usually occurs after 50 years, which is not in your case as you are having these for the last 20 years. Recurrent UTI is a consideration which can be ruled out by CUE (cumulative urinary excretion). For strictures and diverticulum you need catheterization to rule out or radiographic evaluation of urethra with contrast like retrograde cystourethrogram and ultrasound. I would advise you to avoid dairy. 1. CUE. 2. Ultrasonography of abdomen with focus on prostate and post volume.

I want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case history and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. The normal CBC (complete blood count) and no raise in white blood cell count says that it is not an appendix pain. So, relax and do not worry much. 2. Pain in this area can be due to the urinary tract infection and that is very common in this age group. 3. Other reasons may be stomach or small intestine ulcers and increased acidity in the stomach but it does not seem to in consistent with your history. Also liver or gallbladder involvement can cause such pain. Complete abdominal ultrasound including kidney, ureter and bladder. 1. You can take tablet Phenazopyridine for pain. I usually prescribe it for only two days. 2. You just keep taking Nitrofurantoin as prescribed. 3. Add cranberry juice which will help you a lot. 4. You should not poke the area and feel relaxed. 5.

Eventually, she will need to look at my cervix to make sure what strain it is. The information she gave me was very bland. All she told me was that if I have sex just use a condom, which I always do. But I wanted to know, what can I do physically and sexually with what I have?","Doctor":"Hello. May I know what was the abnormality detected on your pap smear? As per your gynecologist, if you have got HPV (human papillomavirus) infection (high-risk HPV strains), that is responsible for the development of cervical cancer, you need to be further evaluated. So your gynecologist would be having a look at your cervix through a magnified camera that can pick up certain changes on the cervix, and can hint on the development of any precancerous changes. If present it can be tackled at an early stage before actual cancer sets it. So cervical cancer screening methods can detect changes almost five years before the actual development of cancer, so it is advisable you get regular pap smears as advised by your gynecologist and be under her follow. It would have been helpful if you could share the reports of pap smear and HPV testing with me so that I could guide you better. The reason your gynecologist asked to use condoms is that HPV infection is usually acquired through sexual contact. So to prevent repeated infection and also to prevent other sexually transmitted infections, which can further aid in acquiring HPV infection can be prevented by using condoms regularly. Regular pap and HPV testing. Avoid smoking and multiple sexual partners."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He told me to get HSV-1 and HSV-2 tests, which came back negative. However, I have read that this test may have been done too soon and my body might not have enough antibodies to detect the disease. Is this correct? If you have blisters from herpes, would not your body immediately have antibodies building up to fight the virus causing this, enough to register on the blood work?

How long is it present? If it is antrochoanal polyp, as CT suggests (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it needs surgery. AC polyp does not reduce with medicines. More important reason to get surgery is that in above 40 years age with nasal polyp is a risk. Biopsy has to be taken to rule out malignancy when it is only on one side. Risk of surgery depends on general condition and surgery when done endoscopically does not cause much risk. BP, diabetes and other underlying systemic diseases are risk factors.

Her last month period date (LMP) is 13/06/2015 and she had natural conception. This is her first pregnancy and she was operated for left ovarian dermoid cyst and left ovary was removed in the February 2013. As per the blood test report done on 3/08/15, her homocysteine level is 14.86 umol/L. She is taking the following tablets as of now: Tablet MCBM 69 1-0-1 from 3/8/15 till date. Tablet Duphaston 10 mg 1-0-1 from 3/8/15 till date. Thyronorm 50 mcg 1-0-0 (before food) from 7/8/15 till date. Also she was advised to take one Ecosprin tablet 75 mg (0-0-1) after food to avoid blood clotting and miscarriage, during our visit to the doctor on 18/8/15. Please advise on the below aspect: Is the value of Homocysteine (14.86) too high to take Ecosprin tablet now in the first trimester of pregnancy? Is MCBM 69 tablet sufficient enough to take care of Homocysteine level?","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concerns. MCBM 69 is the tablet used to aid in production of blood products and also to prevent any suspected neural tube defect in baby. It contains multivitamins, for example: Mecobalamin, Pyridoxine and Folic acid. This will help your wife to improve her hemoglobin levels. Ecosprin is pregnancy category C and D and usually dangerous to prescribe in last three months of pregnancy and lactation, as it may be a danger to the developing baby then. We may still prescribe it in first three months of pregnancy, if the benefits overweigh the risks. Homocysteine levels are not so correlated to prescribe Ecosprin tablet. Consult back the prescribing physician for time period for which he prescribed it for your wife and exact indication why he had prescribed it. Homocysteine levels test is also advised in cases of homocystinuria. Homocysteine levels also rise in cases of decreased estrogen levels. And your wife has got her one ovary removed, so she has low estrogen and high homocysteine levels may be due to that. 14.86 is not very high levels of homocysteine, but you have to keep a check and do serial tests to keep an eye if the levels are going up or low.

After that it worsened with liquid form and seems like diarrhea. Also stomach feels little bloated, slightly diffused pain, some slight rumbling inside and frequent urge to use toilet. What tablet should I take? Am I allergic to curd?

I have been fine healthwise. All of a sudden this morning I woke up with severe throat pain. I am Type A Streptococcus. When I had Streptococcus infection, my lymph nodes never hurt too much and they were never too swollen or hurt by touch. This time, it hurts to put any amount of pressure on my throat, even to move my neck. I cannot even swallow my own saliva unless I force it. I have no appetite either. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. The condition you have is URTI (upper respiratory tract infection) with odynophagia (pain on swallow). It includes GAS (group A Streptococcus) causing tonsillitis and tonsillopharyngitis. It is an infectious disease and usually a childhood disease. Recurrent streptococcal infections are usually of concern and lead to many suppurative and non- suppurative complications. You need to probe and ascertain the probable source of infection. It is a communicable illness and can spread through salivary droplets. I would hence recommend you to refrain from any intimate relationship and maintain good oral hygiene. Throat swab and culture or RADT (rapid antigen detection test). 1. Tonsillitis. 2. Tonsillopharyngitis. 3. Quinsy (peritonsillar abscess). 4. Viral pharyngitis. 5. Coryza (rhinitis). URTI and GAS tonsillopharyngitis. 1. After investigation, I suggest you to take Z-pak (Azithromycin). 2. If it is not responsive as in your previous history then you may have tablet Amoxicillin 500 mg thrice daily for 10 days. 3. If you are allergic to Penicillin then tablet Clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 10 days. 4. Tablet PCM 500 mg (Paracetamol) if any fever. 1. Spread by droplets of saliva.

Can you prescribe me homeopathic medicines which can effectively treat the plaque and atherosclerosis? I would prefer preparations from established medical companies.

It causes fatty plaque formation in the coronary artery leading to narrowing of the artery. It is also called as cardiac calcium scoring. For men, CCS has 15-year mortality ranging from 3.5% for CCS of 0 and 18% for a CCS more than and equal to 400 (P<0.001). There is a cumulative 15-year mortality rate among women and men with low-intermediate Framingham risk scores based on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores.

I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel syndrome last year but the pain started before that. At that time my hand only hurt when it was bent to a certain position, and it hurts when I am on my fours or when push-up position. It did not hurt when my hand was squeezed or doing hand exercises. The doctor prescribed me with Etoricoxib (Arcoxia) 60 m which I took twice a day for a week and told me not to move my right hand. I tried not to use it as much as possible but since it was school time, it required me to use my hand. After the medication was over, I was not able to come back to the hospital (even though I was told to if the pain did not go away) and talk to my doctor about the condition of my hand. Now, my hand, specifically the palm of the thumb, started to hurt even if it was not bent or I am in a push-up position. It is more painful when it is squeezed. Our place is quarantined and I am sure getting appointments will be hard during this time, so I am trying to relieve the pain at home. But still, I want to have some instructions from the professional. I have 10 Arcoxia pills here at home, should I take it to relieve the pain? Should I follow the initial instructions of my doctor and take it twice every day or just take it whenever I feel pain? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello.

Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. You have broken the blister with the pin and I would recommend you not to do that in the future as it is a non-sterile method of doing so and can cause infections in that area. Having said that, I would like to ask you, is there redness around that area? Is there any discharge coming out from the wound? If yes, then you need to start some antibiotics and also take care of the wound. Make sure you clean it everyday and dress it up well. As foot is the dependent part of the body and all your body weight is on it so even a small blister will be painful during walking, standing, etc., for a few days until the blister heals. Blister. Foot blister- local trauma. Tablet Paracetamol one tablet twice daily, Betadine ointment for local application, tablet Augmentin 625 (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) twice daily for five days.

Usually eating probiotics like yogurt will help with the diarrhea."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

From what you have described, you have tinnitus that gets exacerbated on looking at the computer screen. There is no established connection between looking at a bright object and worsening of tinnitus, though there may be isolated reports. Tinnitus is usually caused due to an inner ear problem.

I have been married for six years. I have two children. I had yellowish like liquid discharge from my penis a year ago with burning while urinating. I consulted a urologist and he prescribed me Norflox 400 mg for one week and after which it went away. This month, I had pain in my scrotum in the right spermatic cord region above the testicle. My urologist told me to have sonography. My sonography report concluded \\"diffuse thickening at the right spermatic cord region.\\" Otherwise, the report is normal. The doctor prescribed me Cefixime 100 mg and an anti-inflammatory tablet for 10 days. My pain decreased about 60%. A week ago, I had masturbation and I had pain at the same place in the scrotum. I had taken a urine culture test and I have attached the report. My question is do I have sexually transmitted diseases or urinary tract infection? Can I please know what to do? What medicines should I take for a permanent cure?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your symptoms. You seem to be suffering from an infection in your spermatic cord that is the cause of your scrotal pain. This is treated with antibiotics but the duration of treatment is usually for two weeks or more. The pain you have on masturbation is due to the inflammation of the spermatic cord through which the sperms come out into the urethra. I would suggest you keep your scrotum elevated with a tight underwear for pain relief. It would also be necessary to make sure that the infection has been cleared by testing both urine and semen for infection as your symptoms are not resolved.

First, let me start by saying I do have an HIV phobia. However, below will give you a better idea of my story. Two months back, I had unprotected oral sex with a guy that lasted for about two minutes. He then penetrated me unprotected for about a minute in which I made him put on a condom. After we were done, he cleaned himself up and penetrated me again for about three minutes. Ten days later, I noticed I had a sore throat and dry cough with a very low temperature and immediately scheduled a visit with my doctor as I was really nervous. I had a slight fever and asked my doctor to perform an STD test. When I got my results back I tested HSV 2 positive. I thought I was fine as far as those results were concerned. However, I read that there was a window period that I needed to test. As time went on I started to have a very upset stomach, gassy, bloated and diarrhea. I am also lactose intolerant. So, I suspected that it was from that. It went away but today I have it again, however, I am taking Penicillin and I heard that this was one of the symptoms. I have a dry mouth which I also heard could be from the Penicillin as well. My period for this month is noticeably lighter than normal which I am freaking out about. I never got a rash or anything or that I noticed. About a week ago, my husband started having diarrhea with an upset stomach and I noticed a rash on his knee which looks more like a bruise than a rash. It was red and purple with no bumps and very small but had no other symptoms. I also noticed that I had a small lymph node in the neck (which is the reason I am on the Clindamycin). I got nervous and decided to go back to the doctor so that she could test me for HIV again and the results were still negative. The lymph node has gotten smaller and stopped hurting, however, I do not see a stone or anything in my mouth that looks like a stone. Now my mouth is really dry not producing any saliva. This is my biggest concern. I also developed thrush. I have stopped taking any medicines so that I can see which medicine it is. Can you please give me some insight?","Doctor":"Hi. A fourth generation HIV duo test is considered reliable and conclusive if it is still negative after six weeks. Most STD (sexually transmitted diseases) specialists consider this six weeks gap as the upper limit of the window period for an HIV duo test result to be considered final. Since your exposure was two months back and your last HIV duo test was almost eight weeks after exposure, your test result is reliable and conclusive. You do not need to worry about HIV from that particular episode. For more information consult a HIV AIDS specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 30 year old male.

He was diagnosed bipolar disorder at the age of 7. After trying several medications Depakote was the one that worked best. My ex-husband got custody of him 4 years ago and pulled him off from his medication. Last month my son threatened suicide and was hospitalized and placed on Zoloft. I recently spoke with my son's counselor and she said that Zoloft is used to treat depression and that he should be on a secondary medication for bipolar. His past medicines are Intuniv and Depakote and his current medicines are Zoloft and Vyvanse. I have tried speaking with my son's therapist. However, my ex-husband has told her not to speak to me regarding my son's treatment. I have noticed in conversations as well as visits with my son that he sometimes seems more depressed and agitated even threatening to run away from home. Is Zoloft used to treat bipolar without any secondary medication? Is it safe for a 13 year old?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I want to inform you that Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) and Intuniv (Guanfacine) tablets are indicated for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Depakote (Valproic acid) is an antiepileptic and mood stabilizer. It is useful for bipolar disorder. If your child is diagnosed with bipolar, then he should receive Depakote or other mood stabilizer. Zoloft (Sertraline) is an antidepressant and by this chance of switch to mania is there. So, in bipolar patients if depressive symptoms are prominent, then antidepressant can be given only under the cover of mood stabilizer. Antidepressant should not be used for long term in bipolar patients. Once depressive symptoms get resolve, patient should maintain only on mood stabilizer. Antidepressant should get taper off gradually. For further information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 34 years old. My weight is 84 kg. I am married for four years.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I guess you have not passed any tissue or mass like structures out of the vagina. So we cannot be sure about the complete termination of pregnancy. Presence of just bleeding does not ensure the complete termination. So our priority is to confirm it.  Now it is a time for you to get yourself examined by a gynecologist, an ultrasound of the pelvis to look for complete or incomplete termination. Ultrasound will confirm the status of pregnancy. However, it is not recommended to have excess doses of Misoprostol now. Also, although the risk of infection is not high, keep watch for fever and if developed then have antibiotics started immediately.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Clove oil basically is used to numb the tooth pain but it can lead to irritation around your gums since it is very strong.

For healing of the ulcer, you can start with Chlorhexidine gluconate based mouthwash at least twice a day for a week which will lead to the healing.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Your symptoms suggest a condition called tinnitus. Tinnitus is defined as an auditory perception of internal origins such as a buzzing, ringing, or whistling tone and can be perceived as either pulsatile or non-pulsatile. It can have a significant influence on well-being and performance in daily activities. Your symptoms suggest it is pulsatile in nature. Identification of the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus is important for adequate treatment and for prognosis estimation. It can be due to cold and inner ear infection as you also have painful lymph nodes. But you did not mention a fever. If it is infection antibiotics dose will be helpful. Complete and detailed history is essential, which includes possible accompanying complaints like vertigo, hearing loss, ear discharge, and earache. We are worried about an underlying vascular etiology that can be suspected when pulsatile tinnitus is influenced by vascular compression or when a vascular bruit is heard by auscultation. In general, head and neck MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computed tomography) provide complementary diagnostic imaging information. I suggest you consult an ENT specialist."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I have been on Rogaine for 6 years and now on Proscar for 10 days. I had used it before, but went off.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is intermittent, associated with nausea stomach upset, some times vomiting and dizziness. Aggravated by noisy surroundings and lack of sleep. Some time s there are triggers such as lack of sleep, strong smells, hunger. You also must know about red flags or warning symptoms such as severe unilateral headache, Fever, a new type of headache, blurring of vision or weakness.

In fact, you need to decrease the dose of Glycomet GP 2 (Glimipiride and Metformin) to Glycomet GP 1. Major problem is that you have accelerated bloodstream pressure. Instead of Tricinod (Telmisartan, Clinidipine, Chlorthalidone), better would be taking tablet Telvas 3D (Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide) once a day and if needed, add Prazopress XL (Prazosin) 5 mg at bedtime that will bring down your blood pressure.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a very rare cause of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and usually, the counts are not very low as in your case. Since your vitamin B12 levels are towards the lower range of normal and bordering on deficiency, you can take vitamin B12 supplements. If your platelet count does not improve, you need to get a proper hematologic assessment done to determine the cause. Your serum ferritin levels are very low and your hemoglobin is also low.

There was a CRL measurement of 26.96 mm. I had sex on the last day of my periods and then again after 11 days. And, my LMP and ultrasound calculation show two days difference. So, can I tell that I pregnant on the second event? My periods are irregular. The previous month, I also had endometriosis surgery. I have heard that endometriosis surgery can cause high fertility and regular ovulation. Since my LMP and ultrasound are close enough, is it safe to say ovulation was normal at least for that month?","Doctor":"Hi. Your estimation is correct. There is the least possibility of conceiving on the last day of the period. You must have conceived around the second event. Now, LMP (last menstrual period) and ultrasound time cannot match exactly. Although in your case, it is almost the same. Do not confuse about two days difference. Ultrasound calculates the period of gestation according to some measurements as you have seen CRL (crown-rump length) at different periods and separate parameters for calculating the time of gestation. Now, LMP also cannot tell you exactly the day of ovulation until unless ovulation study was done and you have seen the size of the follicle and then its rupture to release the egg. Usually, early scan done at six weeks or so is the best predictor of your dates. But, now also, everything is fine, and you can monitor growth in further scans.

If your cardiovascular status that is heart and lung functions are fine, then you can go for laparoscopic surgery. That is cosmetically better and less invasive.

Also there was no bleeding in my hand. But there is some redness there. So guide me that it is still necessary to have ARV. Also before 5months ago i was vaccinated with arv when there is scratch of dog then .","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to icliniq. Although unvaccinated animals are more likely to transmit rabies, vaccinated animals can also do so if the vaccination of the biting animal was ineffective for any reason. A history of rabies vaccination in an animal is not always a guarantee that the biting animal is not rabid. Animal vaccine failures may occur because of improper administration or poor quality of the vaccine, poor health status of the animal, and the fact that one vaccine dose does not always provide long-lasting protection against rabies infection in dogs/cats. The scratch on your skin comes under category II for post exposure prophylaxis for which anti rabies vaccine is indicated . And although you have taken the vaccine 5 months before and your dog is also vaccinated there are very minimal chances of you or your dog having rabies but there is a very miniscule chance. But according to the guidelines you should get vaccinated again. Make sure to clean the area of scratch properly and thoroughly with soap and water. Observe your pet for the next 10 days and see if it’s health deteriorates which if does would be a strong indication to get vaccinated. Dog bite Anti rabies vaccines Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water Follow up after 10 days"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Post spinal headache: avoid using pillows, more liquids, and coffee will help. Some antiemetics can be added on. This is commonly seen in the first week after surgery. If you had a bad infected appendix, post-operative infected collections are common and this can cause your symptoms. But this will also cause fever and abdominal pain. Sometimes postoperative medications can cause small stomach ulcers and can cause these symptoms. You need to see your doctor and ask for antacids. Overall, if you are not having fever, loose stools, severe abdominal pain and vomiting and headache is not continuous, then nothing much to worry about.

I went through your query. I am really sorry to know your niece is suffering from stomach and irregular cycles. I understand it can be a very annoying problem. By the ultrasound report that you have given here, it seems your niece has PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). It usually presents with irregular cycles and excessive weight problems. Other problems which also may be seen are acne, pimples, dark pigmentation on certain areas like neck and in between fingers, excessive hair on face, chin and other body parts, etc. To confirm her diagnosis you get a serum LH (luteinizing hormone) or FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) done. If ratio is of nearly 2:1 or greater it confirms that she has PCOS. PCOS is a very common but complex hormonal problem. She would really need to work hard to lose weight. As weight loss itself would help her achieve normal regular menstruation. Also I suggest you get a thyroid function test done because PCOS is also many times associated with thyroid problems. For the issue of painful and irregular cycles, it would be a good idea to put her on regular low dose hormone pills for three months and watch her response. It should help her out.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Due to lockdown, I am unable to consult the dentist. Can you please tell me any tablet that I can use in the meantime.","Doctor":"Hello. Sorry for the pain you are bearing because of the prevailing situation. As you have already mentioned there is a cavity and when it reaches up to the pulp there develops an irreversible stage which generally is more painful during night time as we sleep. I think your tooth has reached the stage of irreversible pulpitis and a root canal treatment is now must in order to save the remaining tooth. So go for it as soon as the situation in your area gets better. For now, take Amoxicillin clavulanate 500 mg (thrice daily) for five days, Paracetamol 500 mg to thrice daily SOS. Do not take Paracetamol when there is no pain but do complete the Amoxicillin course. Additionally, you can take any one for gastritis if you have a tendency to develop gastritis with antibiotics. You can take PAN-D (Pantoprazole) or Omez (Omeprazole). Take them on empty stomach. Do salt water rinse regularly. You can apply clove oil at the site, it is a good anti-inflammatory. Maintain good oral hygiene regularly, but for sure get it treated. Avoid eating from the affected side until it gets treated or even if you eat make sure nothing gets lodged in that tooth. Do mouth rinses with plain water regularly so that there is no food stuck. Drink plenty of water. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 51-year-old female. I got sick about a month ago and I went to urgent care. My left kidney was swollen and I had an infection. I have a 2-cm kidney stone and they put a stent in. I do not want to have surgery. I am scared that the use of natural remedies can hurt the stent or move the stone to block where I go to pee. I had a CAT scan at urgent care. Will they use local anesthesia for this instead of general or something else? Can the kidney stones come out from behind? I have diabetes. Can lemons and olive oil help treat this? Currently, I am on Metformin, Aspirin, Simvastatin, and Lisinopril.","Doctor":"Hello. A 2-cm kidney stone is a fairly large one and it will definitely require surgery. I cannot recommend using any natural remedies for a stone of this size though they will not affect the stent. The stone, however, can move to cause obstruction again, but this is unlikely if the stent remains in position. The surgery has to be done under general anesthesia. The procedure used varies based on the location of the stone and your treating urologist. I would have to have a look at the CT (computed tomography) scan images before I can make a plan. I would recommend you to go ahead with the surgery as that gives you the best chance of getting your stone removed.

Otherwise, it will be followed by severe hair fall. Your vitamin D is low but you are already on medication. Hemoglobin is also very low.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm?

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

While there I needed to schedule a Remicade infusion and the doctor there said she heard crackles in my lungs and sent me for an immediate chest x-ray, high-resolution CT scan and a multitude of labs. To my surprise, I was diagnosed with RA, not PSA as my rheumatologist had diagnosed me before itself. Anyway, the radiology results state honeycomb lung damage amongst other ominous findings. At my follow up I was told I have RA-ILD. I am now back to my place and have no symptoms to alert me of any lung problems. I followed up with my PCP last week and she did not hear crackles in my lungs. My peak flow rate is 400 and my O2 sat is 100% at rest and 98% with fast walking. I will send my radiology report and lab results. My question is, can the latent TB lung scaring be misdiagnosed as RA-ILD or IPF? I would appreciate your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from chronic bronchitis with rheumatoid arthritis with recently diagnosed with RA related interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. You had a history of PTB and taking anti-tubercular drugs. You are concerned about your recent diagnosis based on HRCT chest whether it is RA-ILD/IPF or latent TB related complications for your past sufferings and now you feel a lot better. Your HRCT of chest reveals (attachment removed to protect patient identity), interstitial fibrosis characterized by peripheral traction bronchiectasis, irregular reticulation in all lobes, microtubules with calcification in mid and lower lungs, lower lobe predominant microcystic changes without significant ground glass opacifications, hilar calcified lymph nodes consistent with chronic granulomatous disease, and bronchial wall thickening bilaterally. Similar type of radiological findings can be found in post TB fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which includes two key components chronic bronchitis and emphysema, RA-ILD or IPF, etc. You may not tell your doctor about your previous history of Latent TB. For that reason his diagnosis was RA-ILD or IPF as you are suffering from RA. So he was not wrong as your radiological reports suggest the above mentioned differential diagnosis. Again, on high altitude, your doctor found crackles as you are suffering from COPD and it may be associated with infections that time and now it not heard as your infection was subsided."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have stomach pain below the breast on the left side with difficulty in depositing waste.

Because of it, you have stomach pain below the breast on the left side with difficulty in depositing waste. When there is constipation, the waste does not get clear entirely from the bowel. This results in bowel enlargement which puts pressure on the diaphragm on the left side causing pain. Once you treat constipation, you will have no pain.

Bifasicular block is commonly RBBB (right bundle branch block) with left or right axis deviation. I need to explain to you that patients with this block are safe to undergo anesthesia.

If LBBB (left bundle branch block) is associated with the bifascicular block, only then the risk increases, which is complete heart block which needs a pacemaker.

I had tablets for 15 days and then checked my BP and found it normal. So, I stopped using those tablets. While taking those tablets I felt like losing balance while walking. Over few months frequently I have been feeling burning eyes, intense heart beat and blood gets pumped with more pressure into head and body. I have some burning sensation in the bottom of the foot too. Due to this tension, I am unable to get a sound sleep. I have consulted two doctors. They said my BP is normal and sometimes higher at 130/90. How should I proceed now?","Doctor":"Hi. I have worked through your query and understand your health issues. I assure you not to worry as you have consulted the appropriate expert physician who will take care all of your medical concerns. Your blood pressure (BP) was high in the first place and they started you on medicines for high BP. I like to add that this is still not normal for your age and it will definitely go high in the years to come. My advice to my patient at this young age is based primarily on the lifestyle changes and modification of habits based on the clinical scenario they have. I will put you on diet and exercise plan and a mild antihypertensive, if needed. We will slowly shift from medicine to lifestyle change only and your health will be under control forever regarding this issue. You need medicine, but if I put you simply on medicine and that is too in such a young age, you have to take the medicine life-long. What I expect from patients like you is a complete history.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I do not know what it is, and I am terrified. I get cysts on my bikini line quite often, but they always go away. It does not look like a cyst, and it just appeared like one or two days ago. Sometimes, it hurts to walk. I was on my period last week, so I wear different type of underwear and maybe that was too tighten on my bikini area. Also, I have been lying down on my side for an extended period of time due to social distancing. The lump is not really feeling over the area, just raised and flat. I have not had this issue before. The cyst only started to hurt when the side of my underwear pressed against it hard. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read through your problem thoroughly and seen the pictures too (attachment removed to protect patient identity). To me, it looks like an inflammatory boil with some induration (thickening of the underlying skin) due to some skin infections. It is mostly a folliculitis, hair follicle infection in the skin. It will mostly go away in two to three days. You can take some analgesics for pain relief and use some antibiotic cream for local application to prevent it from getting infected. Just keep the area aerated and change your undergarments frequently. Avoid shaving the bikini like till it heals, or else it may get infected. 1) Tablet Combiflam (Paracetamol + Ibuprofen) SOS after food for pain relief (if too painful). 2) Sitz bath (a small tub of lukewarm water with some Betadine solution or a spoon of salt) three to four times a day for pain relief. 3) Clean the genital area gently after using the restroom and apply the antibiotic cream to the affected area only (Clindamycin gel or Soframycin cream-Framycetin). Change undergarments frequently. If the lesion becomes like a collection of pus, as of now does not seem to have formed pus, you can take oral antibiotics."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 23 year old male.

Last year I was given Mefenamic acid by my doctor to take for the pain and nausea. But, the medicine is not helping me, I still have pain and vomiting. Is there anything else I can take for this?","Doctor":"Hi. Dysmenorrhea is not a diagnosis, it is only a symptom. Let me put few possible causes and their evaluation and treatment forward. At this young age, the most common cause is spasmodic dysmenorrhea. The cervix is tight and the blood when trying to make its way during periods, will stretch the canal and cause pain. Pain is only during periods, on day 1 and 2. After that, the main bleeding is over, and pain disappears. If the amount of bleeding is more than normal, you can get a scan to rule out any masses or adhesions. The pain can be controlled by taking birth control pills for six months or more. It will stop ovulation, reduce the amount of blood loss and has no side effects, and it can be taken for any number of years. If you are sexually active, then it can be infection around the uterus know as PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex, so both you and your partner have to be treated at the same time, or else you will get infected again. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain during sex. Before treatment, confirm that you are not pregnant. I suggest you try taking the following. Do treat it, as delay may send the infection inwards and may affect both of you. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Another possibility is endometriosis, every month the blood flows out, but a small fraction also flows into the abdomen through the tubes. This can settle around the uterus and cause adhesions onto the surrounding muscles, ligaments, and bones. This causes throbbing lower abdomen pain before periods, which gradually increases and stays even after periods are over. Sex is very painful. A scan can be done and the restricted mobility of uterus can be seen. This can be solved by reducing flow or stopping periods with hormone pills. Get an ultrasound scan of the pelvis, to rule out any uterine polyp or fibroids. There may be nothing but pain only, gradually increasing every month. Hope I have clarified your doubts, do write back. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am a 33 year old unmarried, healthy male. I have a steady girlfriend with whom I have sex regularly, as well as casual one night stands with other girls. I always practise safe sex, i.e, a) always use a condom b) never have uncovered oral sex (c) never have anal sex (d) always keep my penis covered with my undergarments till I put on the condom (e) always ensure that I pull out with one hand on the condom so that it does not slip out. I wanted to know what else can I do to prevent myself from any STD. 1. What are the chances of kissing my partner causing STD and should I avoid this? 2. I heard that a person can get herpes just through skin contact. Is this true and if so, what precautions can be taken for this? 3. Is there any vaccine I should take for herpes, hepatitis A and hepatitis B? 4. I do not use a lubricant, but use lubricated condoms. Is this the correct thing to do? 5. Can I try anal sex with my girlfriend. Is it safe? 6. Is it better to wash the penis immediately after intercourse to reduce the risk of STDs or should I just wipe the penis with a dry cloth after taking out the condom?","Doctor":"Hi. I appreciate that you are very much conscious and alert while having sex and take all preventive measures. 1. Kissing can spread some diseases only if the other partner is infected .These diseases spread through saliva . There are so many diseases which spread through kissing like mononucleosis, certain kind of viral infections and sore throat and some other. I guess you are much concerned about STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases). HIV is present in saliva but till now no HIV case had been reported through kissing. But hepatitis B cases are reported and well documented and hepatitis A & C as well, so here I will advise you not to kiss women about whom you are not aware of their health status. 2. Herpes viruses are of many types and can spread through skin contact also. Here I think you are concerned with genital herpes virus which causes STD. This usually spreads via sexual intercourse but can also spread through body fluids like blood, saliva, oral sex (without a condom) if your partner is infected. 3. No, there is no vaccine available for herpes. But you must get hepatitis B vaccination done as it is a fatal disease. 4. If you are using lubricated condoms then no need to use a lubricant unless your partner is not comfortable without a lubricant. 5. Anal sex is usually not advisable as it can cause intense pain and injury inside your partner's anus and not safe for her. But if you insist and want to do, then apply a lubricating gel and can do at your own risk. 6. Washing genital organs after having sex is advisable.

Because of dandruff, I keep on itching my scalp.

I used these products for a period of three months. Initially, I was very happy with its response.  As my hair seemed perfect I quit the product for six months. Once I quit the product, again I had hair fall. Now, since one month I am using Minoxidil and have same feeling that once I stop this product again I will have same problem. Now, I would like to know, is it fine to use Betamethasone dipropionate and Zinc sulphate lotion for some time to regain the lost hair and then continue with Minoxidil? Can I start using Minoxidil continuously? Please suggest me, if any other alternative is present. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to icliniq.com. I have read your query in detail and understood your concern. As far as Betamethasone dipropionate and Zinc sulphate lotion is concerned, it is mainly given for dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis and hair fall due to it. It has no effect on androgenetic hair loss. Since, you had dandruff this lotion would have helped to reduce hair fall because of it. Minoxidil is approved for androgenetic alopecia. It should be used in 5% concentration. During the initial part of therapy with Minoxidil, patients might interpret increased hair shedding. But it is temporary and it is due to new hair growth that pushes telogen hair (shedding of hair during the resting phase of hair follicle) out of hair follicle. In addition to Minoxidil I would also suggest you to take a tablet of Finasteride 1 mg once daily.

I understand your condition. You say you are having bloodstained stools and there is no swelling in the anal region which is a good sign.

I also guess that you are having a fissure in the anal region i.e. a tear at the anal verge. And since it is painful and recent, it is of acute nature. I suggest you consume a high fiber diet. Regarding treatment, you have to sit in a tub filled warm water twice daily for five to ten minutes for ten days. It is advisable to put in 5-10 ml of Betadine solution, but if you are not able to go out due to lockdown you can use it as plain warm water. This process is called as sitz bath. If you can get to a pharmacy get an ointment Lidocaine 5%. Apply it thrice a day at the anal verge better to apply before and after defecation.

An open wound or raw area is a potential focus for acquiring viral infections like HIV when contacted with an infected partner. However, once the wound heals, the risk falls back to that of normal skin as elsewhere. The risk for HIV in your case would be high only if you participate in intercourse when your genital herpes has not yet healed completely. It is advisable to abstain from all sexual activities for up to two weeks after an episode of herpes so that the infection resolves completely.

At that time, my pupil got enlarged and dilated. Can it get treated now?","Doctor":"Hi. After blunt trauma, pupil constrictor muscles may be damaged and that causes permanently dilated pupil called traumatic mydriasis. This just causes mild blurring or photophobia in bright light due to large aperture. But, in case of trauma, there are more important things to see that can cause decreased vision like cornea, lens, retina etc. Is everything fine in your case? Can you see normal in that eye? If everything is alright, then we can discuss about treatment options. Treatment Options: I would recommend you to visit your ophthalmologist (eye doctor). He will do a complete eye examination and give the best option accordingly. For further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My wife is 47 years old. Suddenly in sleep, she felt palpitations two to three days back and we went to the hospital and found ECG normal. Echo test is normal, Trop I test is normal but TMT is positive. The doctor advised to go for angiography but another doctor says that before angiography we should go for stress echo test. Please advise what has to be done first.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, let me know if she has any risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, deranged lipid profile or family history of heart disease. Usually, what we do, since angiography is an invasive test, we make sure that the patient needs it or not. So initially, subjects the patients to minor tests like TMT (treadmill test) or stress echo or stress thallium. If either of the tests is abnormal then it is better to subject to the patient to angiography. Now, in our case, since her TMT is positive, it is better to subject her for angiography. There is no harm in having stress echo, but suppose it is positive then certainly she will need angiography. But if it is negative then we can again land up in a dilemma of which test to be relied upon. Then she will need some more tests like stress or CT coronary angiography to prove TMT was negative. So it is better to get an angiography done and clear all our doubts. There is sufficient evidence of abnormalities and angiography is a gold standard test. Also, discuss how strongly was TMT positive. If it is strongly positive then nothing to think and go ahead with angiography and if it is mild positive then you may think of stress echo. So overall, it is better to undergo angiography and no harm in stress echo if your doctor insists.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Try to control your sugar servings in the meal. Your vitamin B12 is in a lower range, so add fish, egg, milk and fortified products for it. You can also start a supplement after discussing with your physician. Your vitamin D level is slightly low. So spend some time in sunlight in the morning. Add fortified cereals, orange juice, soy milk, dairy products, egg yolks in your diet. There are mild changes in lipid profile and blood urea. But it is not of concern now. Now, coming to your current query about improper erection. The leading cause is the age. Just like females, men also face the problem of male menopause where every year some amount of testosterone falls. However, it is the rate of falling which may vary from person to person. Also, health conditions like high BP (blood pressure), increased blood glucose level, nutritional deficiency, lifestyle also play a role in decreasing erection.

I have seen your CT scans (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As of now, you are not having any symptoms and CT (computed tomography) scans reveal no mass as well. So you are not having cancer as per the history. The risk cannot be predicted when the person smokes because genetic and environmental factors also play role in cancer development. Regular screening will be beneficial. Try to stop smoking firmly. Smoking has multiple adverse effects on body and cancer as well.

I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex on the 11th and the guy did not ejaculate. I was worried since it was the 20th day of my menstrual cycle and I have an average of a 32-day cycle. So, I took an I-pill within seven hours. My last period was on the 23rd of last month and the next period is due on the 24th of this month. I track my period using an app and it said that I have medium chances of pregnancy. It has been 10 days since I have taken the I-pill. I am worried that there is no bleeding yet. I took a pregnancy test and it came negative. Can you explain why my bleeding may not have started yet?","Doctor":"Hello. Ideally, the withdrawal bleeding following an I-pill should start in the next five to seven days but it can be delayed often due to increased stress on one hand and the other reason is I-pill failure and pregnancy. So, the best would be to get a serum beta hCG test done now. If the hCG levels are less than 5 mIU then you are surely not pregnant and can wait safely for a few more days to allow your withdrawal bleed to start. Regards.

My parents' heights are about 5'5\\" and 5'0\\" and my sister is 5'1\\". I had my knee's and hand's X-ray and both of them are fused. Since then I have grown only an inch or two. I was 5'1\\" back then now I am like 5'3\\" or 5'4\\" in morning. I have been taking Vitamin D supplements along with Vitamin A, Zinc, and Magnesium. Doing yoga on regular basis and body weight exercises like push-ups, chin-ups, pull-ups, and dips. I have been sprinting and skipping rope and my diet is full of protein (junk food only on Sunday). I do not know how I stunted my growth. Maybe late night cravings with junk food and also bad sleeping habits might have contributed to my short stature. I have heard men do not stop growing until the age of 21 or 25. When I compare my legs to my friends we have the same length, maybe an inch or two difference but they are like 5'10\\" or 5'11\\". I have hairs on my legs from a year an a half. I have little facial hair (not too much). My genitals are not fully grown but I have pubic hairs. I want to be at least 5'7\\" or 5'8\\". Since taking HGH will not affect my legs (growth plates ossified) but will it affect my spine? I feel like my torso is very short compared to my dad too. If I can get prescription for HGH, will taking it lengthen my spine or harden the long bones which will result in growth (2-3 inches)? I have been looking for answers online but I found none relating to spine growth from HGH. As far as I have seen in gigantism most of their height comes from their torso. If I take HGH will my spine grow like theirs too? Since I am only 16 and not fully matured. I do not want to do the leg lengthening surgery (will affect my athletic performance) and also I forgot to mention I have never got a growth spurt in my life. All my height growth has been gradual. When I looked at my friends after a long summer they shot up to 4 to 5 inches. Whereas I stayed the same. Please tell me if I can do anything regarding my height.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you would like to grow taller. Well, your predicted height according to your parents' height is expected to be 5'5\\". Even if your X-ray shows that your bones have fused it is still possible for you to grow naturally taller until 21 years of age. Human growth hormone does not work unless a person is actually deficient in it. And, no you cannot have a targeted growth by taking it. You might cause more harm to your self than good. Your habits are good but you need to start doing more of cardiovascular exercises like cycling and playing sports like basketball which involves jumping and stretching more. Every single person is different as to when they can achieve a growth spurt. Of prime importance is proper sleep as natural secretion of growth hormone occurs at night time.So, be positive and keep up the good work.

I have been taking this for the past 2 years. Is there any side effect in taking this choornam?","Doctor":"Hi. I appreciate your regularity in taking Nilavarai choornam regularly. You need to have a break in between in taking this choornam. If you continuously take, it may alter (destroy) the intestinal beneficial bacteria, which are essential for producing some vitamins and help in local intestinal immunity. This 'purgative abuse' may also injure your intestinal villi, which will lead to malabsorption and improper digestion. The anthroquinone present in the senna plant (nilavarai) can cause black pigmentation in intestine or other mucosal parts. It also can cause inflammation in the colon.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

Peripheral neuropathy, probably due to diabetes or due to Sodium oxybate (Xyrem) or compression of nerves in the spinal column. The diagnosis can be fixed by clinical examination of motor, power and sensory system and reflexes followed by nerve conduction study. This will tell whether the problem is in the nerves of your legs and feet or whether the problem is in the spinal cord. You may also need to do a glucose tolerance test to rule out diabetes. Even though, Oxybate can cause peripheral neuropathy, diabetes is a more common cause.

I had an ultrasound at 20 weeks, and everything was normal.

So, my doctor sent me for an ultrasound at the thirtieth week. The scan showed severe oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction. My due date was brought forward by a month. On the twenty-fifth week, the baby's weight was 603 g. I have tried rehydration and bed rest. Can you offer more help?","Doctor":"Hi. Let me put forth few facts about pregnancy and baby growth. The growth of the baby is progressive, but if it stops at some stage, that amount of growth cannot be regained. Some reason has been missed by the doctor during the pregnancy monitoring. There could be many causes like uncontrolled diabetes, severe thyrotoxicosis, inadequate food intake or severe vomiting, or a condition called APLA (antiphospholipid antibodies) syndrome (here the baby is rejected by mother's body gradually, as it is a foreign body). So blood flow gradually reduces, as the blood flow to baby's kidney reduces, baby's urine output reduces and thus oligohydramnios becomes severe. In the same way, the baby has to be monitored with scans every week or more often depending on the scan report, fluid level, and doppler scan changes. We cannot take the baby out very early because it will die of immaturity. We can give the mother Steroid prophylaxis at around 28 weeks, to improve baby's lung maturity and to prevent hemorrhage in the baby. Once any of the findings are abnormal, the baby has to be immediately delivered. All we can do is wait and monitor. At least in the next pregnancy, such problems should be anticipated.

My problem first started before seven years. I showed this case to some ENT doctors. Finally, my condition is declared as SNHL. However, let me express the actual descriptions or symptoms of my problem here now so that I can get possible help and advice from experts here. There is always a loud sound mixed with ringing in the ears. The pitch of sound does not remain the same. Sometimes, increases (high pitch) or decreases (low pitch). However, it is continuous and that continuous sound hinders me from understanding the speech. Consonants become blurred to me due to such irritating sounding or ringing. I cannot distinguish sounds regularly. It is irritating and disturbing. The right ear is more affected and the problem is increasing gradually. I had observed one fact that on inserting drips through my veins in hand (when I was hospitalized) that continuous sounding had stopped for a while and so I felt normal. What inference can be made from the incident? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be suffering from sensorineural hearing loss and associated tinnitus. Whereas the SNHL is permanent, if it were addressed itself initially, then it could have been reversed. Now, the issue seems to be of tinnitus that is bothering you the most. For the management of tinnitus, we have some medicines. These treatment options are worth considering. Many patients have obtained variable results and improvements using these measures. A 100% improvement is hard to achieve, though, but reasonable development giving significant relief from tinnitus can be achieved.

My last period started 40 days back and lasted for five days. I missed my next period which was supposed to be a month later.

About 2 months ago, I started to lose my voice. Otherwise, I felt fine. I do not have a history of losing my voice, so I assumed I must have picked up a virus. My voice slowly continued to become audibly worse, but still no cold or sore throat. Then about 3 weeks ago, my voice became so hoarse that I had to take a leave of absence from my job because no one was able to understand me anymore; I was audible, but so hoarse and able to speak only at quiet volumes. Now, at this time I started having a hard time in eating. It feels like food is getting stuck in my esophagus and for some reason I cannot breathe. I am drinking water to move the food down. I stopped eating solid food last week due to these choking episodes. If I try to speak now, I get ever so slightly short of breath. I also was developing these noises when I breath in deeply. I thought it as asthma, but I do not have wheezing. And when I got into a situation yesterday, I felt like I was having an attack of some sort that loud sounded and felt like croup. I could barely breath when I inhale and I made a really strange and loud croup noise. It settled out eventually. I think it is probably time to see an ENT to know what is going on. I do not really want to go to the ER because I am not aware if they have an ENT there who they could consult to see what is wrong. Plus, I really do not know what all this could be? And maybe it is not serious and it is just a bad virus too. I am trying to decide if my problem can wait for an ENT visit with a doctor when one becomes available in about two weeks. Should I go to an urgent care or ER? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hello.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

So, currently, the various possibilities are gastritis, reflux disease, anxiety and asthma. In management part, you avoid spicy and fatty foods, smoking and alcohol if any. Also, maintain regular sleep habits and do regular exercises. Have some walk after meals instead of taking rest immediately. I suggest you acid suppressant like tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Do some relaxation techniques like yoga and deep breathing. I guess your hemoglobin was normal. Try using the inhaler if it gives relief and then it points towards asthma. Have you undergone pulmonary function test recently?

I can understand you completely... first of all make it clear that gas from vagina is ( queefing / vaginal fart) NOT a pathology!!!! it's because the roomy vagina holds air and during the rigorous act of coitus or ant bit strenuous work or excersises it passes out with a sound just similar to fart ( as it's from a hollow organ) as u had mentioned it's not associated with smell it's unlikely to be a fistula.....( rectovaginal fistula) .So just relax!!! nothing can be done to prevent it!! may be some positional changes.. avoid more of butt up in air positions both during work, excersises n sex... if you just understand that it's normal u would laugh it out!!!! regards & best wishes....hope you find it useful!! physiological, due to roomy vagina vaginal fart reassurance revert back, if any queries.."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old. For the past three months, I have mild hair fall. I lose around 2 to 10 hair after every shower. I have never had hair fall in the past. I also did a background check with my family history; none had any baldness even in the 70s. I fear this would be the result of masturbation habit, which could have boosted DHT. So far I have lost about five percent of my hair. Though there are no visible bald spots, I can say my density has reduced a lot. I also have a flaky scalp, 1 to 2 cm sized flakes and that would cause snowfall like scenario. When I touch my hair, my scalp is shedding like a tree in fall. Would that be the reason for my hair fall or the DHT? I have been using Noskurf lotion and Aminexil shampoo from the past 15 days, which reduced the flaking a bit. It is like my head is flakes-free for a couple of days and again it reappears. But it did nothing to stop my hair fall. I saw that most of the hair that fall are either too thin and smudged irregularly or are tiny new hair. I also feel pain and heat over the scalp which is succeeded by the localized hair loss after a couple of days. Since I joined MBBS course, I am not on a proper diet. Could this hair loss be due to biotin?","Doctor":"Hello. Flaky scalp not responding to Noskurf (combination of Climbazole, Piroctone Olamine, Aminodermine, and almond oil) lotion may be scalp psoriasis and need steroid plus Salicylic acid 6 % combination lotion. The pain is due to hair root inflammation, which is commonly seen in male pattern baldness. I would suggest you get the following test done. If DHT is high, then we have a specific treatment for that. Both psoriasis and hair fall may increase due to stress. It is good that you are taking preventive steps.

You do not need to give antibiotic for this; but you have given Augmentin. Anyways that is not the issue right now. 2) Now your baby had loose stool with mucous and pain in abdomen. It indicates infective diarrhea (Not diarrhea due to Augmentin -- that would be painless and no mucous).

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Please answer the following questions: Femme-Tab ED 20/100 is Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel containing contraceptive and having few side effects and contraindications as well. Most of the side effects appear but severity and presentation differ person to person. Irregular vaginal bleeding is the side effect of OCP (oral contraceptives) but duration and pattern differ person to person like few get affected after years of use and few respond immediately. I do not know how long you have been on this. Could have chances of stroke, high BP (blood pressure), cardiovascular accidents like VTE (venous thromboembolism), breast cancer, endometrial cancer (post endometrial hyperplasia). Femme-Tab ED 20/100 contraindicated in SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), migraine with aura, etc. Few drugs like antiepileptic and few antidepressants also reduce the efficacy of contraceptives. Bleeding could be a side effect of hormonal contraceptive and its interactions to disturb cycle. To reduce or stop bleeding you can have Ponstan (Mefenamic acid) for three days eight hourly and Tranexamic acid 500 mg eight hourly for three days. You can change contraceptives to reduce its long-term effects after discussion. Start iron supplements to reduce the risk of anemia. If bleeding does not stop even after above treatment better to have detailed check up with a gynecologist. Any local cause of polyps, trauma, endometrial hyperplasia (need the endometrial biopsy to exclude pathology), adenomyomas, fibroid uterus (although you have done the scan, blood, and smear and all normal). Is thyroid function test done? If not better to have along with serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) level (blood pregnancy test) to be on safe side.

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

One of the lesions looks like milia, obstruction of sweat duct, which is very close differential of molluscum contagiosum (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

She is not growing even a single cm from 1 year. I am too scared about her future. She is only 150 cm now. Many advised her to do skipping, swimming, cycling, etc. Though she is doing skipping, it does not help much. I just need some scientific help. Please help me out. I am scared of her growth.","Doctor":"Hi. Good day. Thanks for your query. I am afraid that I do not have good news for you. In your sister's age, it is not possible to increase height of about 2 or 3 inches with any medications. The growth plates in the bones close after 13 - 15 years of age in females and no increase in height possible. Growth plates are the areas of new bone growth in children and teens. They are made up of cartilage cartilage, a rubbery, and flexible material. For instance, the nose is made of cartilage. As kids grow, the growth plates harden into solid bone. A growth plate that has completely hardened into solid bone is a closed growth plate. After a growth plate closes, the bones are no longer growing. Growth plates usually close near the end of puberty. For girls, this usually is when they are around 13 - 15 years old and for boys, it is when they are about 15 - 17 years old. What is the height of your father and mother? Your sister may have an average height of both of them. Another option is limb lengthening surgery.

It is not necessary that there should be withdrawal bleeding after taking Unwanted 72 (Levonorgestrel). They are high dose hormonal pills which may cause delayed periods too.

After four months of love life, I got pregnant. Since that day my mother-in-law changed her behavior with me as well as due to family members instruction my husband started giving space to me. He started watching porn clips at the night time. I almost felt like suffocation to spend my whole day in all household work and the rest of my time in temple with my mother-in-law as per her wish. One day in frustration he told me that he is neither interested in me nor my baby. His words hurt me a lot. But, still I tried to convince myself. But within a few days, when his mother told me that I have to get up early in the morning at 5 to wash the clothes; I did not cooperate. Then, my husband told me that I have to find the solution and they were unable to cope with me. I felt like no one is thinking about my pregnancy as well as my health. So, I decided to go to my parent’s home and left my husband without any information.When I reached my home, I realized that my mother is unwell. Within just two or three days when we visited a doctor we came to know that it was cancer. I was unable to discuss my feelings with her. Meanwhile my husband and mother-in-law tried a lot for my come back. But, I never gave response to them, not even a phone call. After one month, we met a cancer specialist and he told us he could only pray about results as it was third stage. We were in huge tension. My husband came there and told me to come back. However, the next day after a long phone conversation he said either come back or give divorce. This hurt me a lot as I was 5 months pregnant. Then, till my delivery no one from my husband’s family contacted me. I gave birth to a baby boy, but due to some complications doctor made it a Cesarean operation. Immediately they shifted my baby to NICU. I was not able to breastfeed him, but sent my milk to him for five days. On the seventh day he got serious as he had suffocation problem and done ECG. Then I informed the issue to my husband, but unfortunately we lost our baby the same day. Since that day he messaged me to come back, but I was not in a state to reply. Nearly after seven months, I met and got to know he too frustrated, weak and thought he is also suffering from emotional turmoil. Since that day I am trying to convince him for reunion, but he is denying.Then we met in court for mutual divorce. As he did not clarify the reason for divorce we were advised to meet counselor. Counselor said we have only communication problem and suffering from baby’s thoughts. Due to my mom’s health, I did not meet him again. Sadly, I lost my mom before six months. Now, I came to know that my mother-in-law too passed away before five months. Now, his father asked me for divorce as he wishes to see his son’s second marriage, but my husband denied this. I want to continue this relationship as I love my husband. He always submits me the same answer that whenever he sees me he remembers all the painful memories and so he is unable to live with me. Recently, he said that he does not wish to have our baby back and do not want any relationship with me. Since that day I am suffering a lot through emotional turmoil. I am missing my baby, my mother and my husband. It is very hard for me to handle my mood swing. I never had any quarrel with my in-laws or with husband. Though I am facing this situation and it hurts. Today, I am suffering so much and I had some milk like nipple discharge. Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. I am really sorry for what happened in your life. I sympathize with you. But at the same time, I also feel you do not want my sympathies.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She has some pain near her eye like a headache, but there is no numbness or vomiting scenario. Now, her vision is at CF. We had our first visit before 10 days. The doctor did not find anything except the pressure is 29 and he suggested Tobramycin and Dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension for every six hours for a week. In the follow-up visit, the doctor found that her vision came down than earlier and the pressure raised to 40. He suggested an emergency MRI scan of the head, and it was normal. Then he suggested Travatan and Combigan and no cause identified. All these reports shared with our primary care doctor, and he advised to make another visit to the eye doctor and a neurologist checkup. As per his suggestion, we had another follow-up visit, and nothing found abnormal. They wanted to wait for a neurologist check, and until then my wife was asked to continue Travatan and Combigan. The report says everything is normal, but nothing is improved on her vision side. Can you please suggest us what we should do now?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Please do not worry. In my opinion, there are two issues. It can be a POAG, primary open angle glaucoma and the treatment is antiglaucoma medicine. If the pressure is normal and optic disc is normal, then glaucoma is under control, and it is not the cause of low vision. There is a very low vision in the left eye with RAPD (relative afferent pupillary defect) in left eye along and temporal pallor of the optic disc. It is suggestive of optic disc pathology and most likely optic neuritis (retrobulbar neuritis). The treatment plan is as follows. MRI with contrast is the ideal investigation to look for demyelinating lesions in the brain as well as on optic nerve. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, we start high dose Methylprednisolone intravenously. Here, the prognosis is good, but some patients do not improve.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. I also saw the picture attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is definitely not because of teeth grinding because the features of the tooth say it all. This could be something called as Hutchinson's incisors with the clear crescent shape of the teeth. There is a high possibility of his back teeth (molars) having a similar shape. If that is so, please check with a general physician if the child has any other abnormalities in the internal organs including rhinitis and rashes. Because Hutchinson's incisors is a sign of congenital syphilis (birth defect). Mostly, in syphilitic infections, permanent teeth will be affected. But here, considering your son's age it is the milk teeth that are affected. Hence, it could be as simple as enamel deficiencies which were already diagnosed.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

I only received unprotected oral sex for roughly two minutes around 46 days ago from a commercial sex worker. I did not have any intercourse. I do not know her HIV status. I had an episode of diarrhea immediately after within the next five days and it resolved after taking Levofloxacin and Lomotil (which I guess was food poisoning as it occurred the very next day). I tested for all STI’s (chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis, and HIV) in 14 days after exposure and all came back as negative. It is an early test for HIV. I traveled abroad for vacation in the meantime and I took Azithromycin 500 g for three days as I had throat ache and mild fever in 20 days after my potential low-risk exposure. I developed a sore on my upper gum and it has been there for 16 days. It is painless now. Also applied Orasore ointment. Recently after 40 days after exposure, I developed small red bumps only in my hand and behind the ear with a sore throat and mild fever. The doctor has prescribed me Amoxicillin antibiotic for five days and Vizylac once for five days. My throat is feeling better now. My questions are:  Am I at risk of HIV? Are these recurring mild fever and sore throat acute HIV symptoms? Is the sore in my mouth a concern? As I have had an eye transplant and my immune system is weak would I have contracted HIV from my exposure?","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. Unprotected insertive oral sex with an HIV positive woman has a negligible/non-existent risk of transmission of HIV for the male partner unless she had oral sores or blood mixed saliva or bleeding gums which might increase the risk. You have had two episodes of a sore throat after this sexual encounter which can be because of seasonal flu and change in weather. I have a few questions.  The sore on your gum could be more of a dental problem rather than an STD. I suggest you take oral Metronidazole 400 mg, thrice daily in addition to the Amoxicillin that you are already taking. Also apply Metrogyl DG gel (Metronidazole), twice daily. Regards. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi, What happens to the dust that enters the eye?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I request you to kindly advice what would be the best possible treatment in this scenario.","Doctor":"Hello. As seen in your reports, your father had stomach cancer, which is stage III. He will definitely need further treatment to avoid recurrence of the tumor. Usually, treatment should be started within 6 to 8 weeks. He has two options: Only chemotherapy or Chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Before that, I would advise you for CT scan and tumor markers like CEA and CA 19.9 to look for any evidence of residual disease at four weeks after surgery as residual disease after surgery will be taken as high risk. If you are able to get a PET CT then it is better. There are certain poor markers in his tumor (attachment removed to protect patient identity) like signet ring histology, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, node positivity, and a bit close margin. These all factors make him a high risk for recurrence. Though there is no definite advantage of chemo and radio vs chemo only, those who are at high risk for recurrence benefit from chemo and radio. So in his case, I would opt for chemo and radiotherapy. But before going ahead with this, I will definitely need to assess the patient's general condition and how he is taking his nutrition. Whether he is fit to receive this treatment. Otherwise, I would opt for chemotherapy only. Therefore, I would advise you to take further treatment at the center which has both facilities.  Depending on what type of chemo regime is followed the duration of treatment will be around six months. On an average, around 50 % patient with stage III stomach cancer will be alive at the end for three years if they receive adequate treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 38 year old female.

Do I need to take any further checkup for the heart? I was advised for Holter monitoring, which is yet to be done. I am waiting for your reply. Many thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I have noted all your details. Your symptoms can be most likely because of congestive cardiac failure. Cardiac failure is not an indicative of a defect in the heart, but it is a situation when the heart pumps weaker than what is deemed as natural. Therefore, the blood flows at a slower rate to the heart and the body that in turn increases pressure in the heart. In an attempt to hold more blood, the heart stretches the chambers. Though this strenuous effort may keep the blood moving, it would gradually and inevitably weary the heart with all the effort. Subsequently, the kidney responds by retaining more salt and fluid in the body. These fluids may accumulate in different parts of the body, mainly in the legs, feet, ankles leading to congestion in the body. This condition in medical terminology is referred to as congestive heart failure. The most common cause of CHF at the age of 70 is coronary artery disease. I would suggest you some of the baseline tests of cardiology to rule out any element of coronary artery disease apart from 2D echocardiography. Stress test as any ischemia to cardiac muscles will be reflected in the stress test. Along with 2D echo, they have a sensitivity rate of more than 85% to rule out coronary artery disease. Other tests advised are as follows: As per your query, the medicines you are on have nothing to do with your symptoms.

I had induced abortion with Misoprostol two weeks back and there is no complication since. I have had a CBC done almost every week from the starting of my pregnancy and they were all absolutely normal. A month back I had normal complete blood count with WBC 7.5 and neutrophils 5.2. After abortion, I had some trouble with being quite tired and sleepy, hence I have repeated the CBC yesterday. Everything came out the same except for the WBC which is now 4.7 and the neutrophils are 2.28. I have been very stressed out with the abortion experience and I am very much disturbed, depressed, tired and sleepy both during and after the procedure. The OB/GYN did not seem concerned, but I was surprised by the drop. I am worried that this drop in neutrophils might be something more worrisome like leukemia. I do not have any fever, flu or cold for many months. I took Propylthiouracil for a few months recently but stopped right before the abortion. I had a urine culture yesterday which is also clear. I have no other symptoms but some pain in the lower abdomen which the doctor said was normal after the abortion. I had a similar neutrophil count three years ago. At that time it was 2.15, so it is not unheard for me. But I am more concerned about the quick drop. Is it something I should be worried about?

Continue with regular schedule. Relaxation. For further information consult a hematologist online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 35 weeks pregnant. By last week my stretch marks were started to itch. So, my OG advised applying Calamine lotion (which does not contain antihistamine). It seemed to soothe the itching, but slowly the itching started spreading to my upper arms and thighs. Then she prescribed Avil tablet for two days and told to apply Caladryl lotion (which contains antihistamine) only on the itchy areas of my arms and thighs. It seemed to relieve the itch temporarily only. Once the effect of the lotion and tablet is off, I became itchy again. Finally, the OG prescribed Udihep 150 mg to be taken twice daily in the morning and night, suspecting it to be obstetric cholestasis. She also advised to take Avil tablet at night and to apply Calamine and Caladryl to soothe the itchy areas. I am on this regimen for the past four days, and the itch seems to have subsided a bit, but not completely. I am also taking calcium supplements (Ostonate 250 mg twice a day), Astymin forte (vitamin supplement once a day), Fol 123 (at night) and Iron supplements (Orofer XT 100 mg two tablets at night). I have been on increased Iron supplements from the last four weeks because my hemoglobin dropped to 9 last month. Now it has improved to 10.5, but my doctor told to continue taking the prescribed two Iron supplements as only one month is left for delivery. My concern is will there be an interaction between the Udihep and the supplements I am taking? Or is there a possible chance that increased iron intake during the last month would have caused an additional stress on my liver leading to cholestasis? Kindly advise. I am attaching my hemoglobin blood test and urine routine reports.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Let me start by putting you at ease by saying that you are normal and your doctor has been doing a great job. As you are near delivery, the skin stretches to its maximum and the tissue under the skin will start giving way. You will have stretch marks, but they will be further increasing, getting pinkish or redness. This itch will subside only after delivery when the stretch of the baby is relieved. Another possibility is due to obstetric cholestasis. But this has been ruled out by the blood tests, so just relax and the danger has been eliminated. This cholestasis is due to the effect of progesterone hormone on the liver, leading to high levels of the liver byproducts. To relieve itching the medications are right, and they do not have any significant interaction. You can further reduce the itching by applying some local irritants like balms or onions juice. These will cause burning sensation, which will mask the itching. About iron and hemoglobin, during the second trimester, every lady's hemoglobin will drop a bit as this is the time baby's blood volume suddenly expands. So, all iron and vitamins will be taken from your body. By last trimester the hemoglobin will improve on its own, as baby's blood is already ready. These iron tablets will be absorbed from intestine and excess will not be taken in at all. As a result, your stools will be blacker. To improve your hemoglobin, health and baby's health in the last trimester, have a lot of water, proteins, vitamins and sugar. These will also give you the energy needed for delivery. The right amount of sugar (unless you already have diabetes) will make baby chubbier and healthier. Somehow hold that itching till the 37th week, then delivery is the solution. There is no other solution.

I am applying Minoxidil 5% since 10 years and from 2005 for every single day. My concern is I was diagnosed for Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), an autoimmune disorder and have been under immunosuppressive drug Cyclosporine 300mg/day for 2 years, since February 2013. Surprisingly, the Cyclosporine has helped controlling further thinning. But now I would like to take at least 0.25mg of Finasteride per day (1/4 of 1mg tablet) for improvement on already thinned areas. When I discussed with my dermatologist whether I could take the  0.25mg Finasteride while I am on 150mg Cyclosporine twice a day, she told that I can take it and there will not be any problem if I take lower dosage of 0.25mg Finateride.Brief note on my PRCA disease history: Actually I was first diagnosed with PRCA in January 2008 with hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL. I was put forth on one and a half years of immunosuppression - Cyclosporine tablets 150mg twice a day till September 2009. When my hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL in September 2009 I was advised by my hematologist to stop the Cyclosporine intake. So, from September 2009 till December 2012 I was doing good with my hemoglobin level 12 g/dL without any immunosuppressants. Suddenly after December 2012 the \\"relapse\\" of PRCA occurred and as of now I have been advised to be on some amount of immunosuppression dosage with the Cyclosporine throughout life to prevent the relapse again. Right now my hemoglobin level is 12 g/dL. I have attached my latest Complete Blood Count (CBC) report. Cyclosporine intake has been reduced to 100mg twice a day at present.  So, I am just continuing to apply the 5% Minoxidil right from 2004 till date without fail. And during the period between September 2009 to December 2012 while I was doing good without any immunosuppressive Cyclosporine medication, I took Finasteride 1mg for a period of 5 months under supervision of my dermotologist. I did not have any sexual side effects except for my semen become more liquid, but my hair thinning improved a lot. Even I had a good amount of new hair growing out on the hairlines, temple and on the vertex. But I stopped Finasteride with fear of possibly having side effects after a long term usage. Could you please advise whether it is safe to start taking 0.25mg of Finasteride now. As I am on immunosuppressant Cyclosporine and have to continue at least minimal dosage throughout life, will 0.25mg of Finasteride have interactions with Cyclosporine or any other adverse effects? Also I had discussion with one of my dermatologists. He advised that I can safely take Finasteride 1mg and Minoxidil-Finasteride are US FDA approved for androgenic alopecia. He also clarified that there is no interaction between Cyclosporine or Finasteride. And when I asked him about Saw Palmetto instead of Finasteride, he replied that though they are claimed to block DHT, there are no clinically proven results.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As I was washing my face a few days ago, I accidentally got some tap water up my nose. Vaguely aware that there might be concerns about the Naegleria fowleri ameba down here, I panicked and then took some bottled mineral water and tried to rinse my nose with it, thinking that that might be more thoroughly purified and wash away anything from the tap water. However, the bottled water ended up going much further up my nose, and it felt the way it used to feel when getting water up my nose in a swimming pool as a kid. That happened a few days ago. I am worried whether either of these water sources (tap and/or bottled water) could have contained the ameba. I have been having some issues with mucus dripping from the back of my nose into my throat, occasionally mild pressure when I swallow, and for the past couple of days I have had a vague headache all day, but nothing intensely painful (it seems to have diminished somewhat today, though perhaps not fully gone away). I am not sure if I should go to an ER for evaluation, or if I should just wait and see if any more characteristic symptoms develop. I have not observed any changes in smelling ability, nor any neck pain; just a mild, vague headache. I know that if one gets the Naegleria fowleri infection time is of the essence, but I do not want to go spend a lot of money and time at the ER just to have them say that they do not see anything yet and to come back if anything changes. Is there a test they could do at this point to determine if an ameba is present, or is that only practicable if an infection reaches a more serious stage? Should I go to an emergency room now or just wait and see what happens?","Doctor":"Hello.  Firstly, do not worry at all. Please let me know exactly how many days have passed after the exposure.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I had a mild sore throat, blocked and runny nose, headache, cough and tiredness. This morning, I woke up with chest pain on the left-hand side and it lasted for about 15 minutes. It was muscular type cramp-like pain. It has not reoccurred. Although nasal congestion has eased, still feeling weak and have a chesty cough.

Revert after five days to a general practitioner online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 38 year old male. For the past few years, I have been dealing with diarrhea and I am just simply tired of it. Thankfully, I work from home and I do not have to leave the house in the morning hours. I have always been a healthy person and non-smoker. But, I have an average of two drinks a day which I am sure does not help. Otherwise, I eat quite well. I used to eat very little in restaurants and no junk food at all. I thought it was only related to stress, but I have been able to shed a lot of that. This year I am pretty much stress free, but the IBS remains. I usually used to go toilet twice per morning, once right after coffee and again about a couple hours later after breakfast. Both the times, my stool is quite soft or liquid with little solids. It is obvious that the things are going through me really fast as I can often see greens from salad in the toilet. I self-diagnosed that I was lactose intolerant a couple years ago and stay away from all dairy. However, it seems that all natural cheeses are fine, but if anything processed, then my body rejects it violently in the smallest amount. Could I have any other food allergy that my body is rejecting? I went to a doctor locally and explained the issue. He prescribed me medicine to take. I want a cure and not a treatment. I would have expected he would ask me more questions and maybe a blood test, but nothing. So, I never took the medicines. I went to another doctor after and had a blood test and found out that I had H.pylori infection. Only after taking Mastic gum, I was cured and tests after a few months showed that I killed it. So, it is not that anymore unless I got it again. I want this to be cured as if I live with this for years, it could be doing my body serious damage in other ways. If everything is moving too fast through my intestines, they will not be able to absorb the nutrients my body needs to stay healthy. I would hate that I am ignoring this could create a bigger problem down the line. It is like driving a car with only three cylinders running. It can run, but something bad will happen eventually. Really hope you can help. I am so tired of the western paradigm of medicine. As a young, healthy person who grew up on an organic farm and raised all our own food (meat and veggies), I do not think this is an acceptable way to live or to be on medicines for the rest of my life. I am fine getting blood tests, but there are so many. I would like to know which one to take in order to determine the cause. Thanks in advance for your consideration.","Doctor":"Hi.

During that time, I had a jaw expander for my upper teeth as they were too crowded. I was wondering if my dentist is giving me false information because she is scared as she will ruin my teeth. From my picture the lip piercing side is my left side and the front of my teeth, the tooth that is on the right of my bunny tooth is a few mm behind the rest of my teeth. I recently consulted a specialist because the bunny tooth next to that tooth was losing the root and was hurting. They said we needed to stop my brace pressure as soon as possible. So, I asked my dentist if she could fix the tooth that is slightly behind the bunny tooth and the one beside it. After being persistent, she tweaked it a little to help it. Now the real issue I am having is, in image 2100 which is the image on the side showing my lip piercing, it shows that my teeth are good. However the image 2101, which is the side image without my lip piercing, my upper teeth and lower teeth are touching tip to tip. I also noticed that these particular teeth are slanted inwards towards my tongue rather than being straight like the rest of my teeth. The dentist told me that my teeth have worn from all the grinding that I do. However, when I check face front you can clearly see that the upper teeth are slanting inwards and I do remember when doing elastics, it was pulling them down from a lot of pressure. I believe this is a cross bite. The dentist would not admit it and saying there is nothing to be fixed. I have checked past photos before I had braces and from close inspection the cross bite area was never like that, in fact the upper teeth overlapped the bottom teeth and was fine in that area. I am wondering whether my dentist is correct that my teeth are fine and that it cannot be fixed? I am pretty sure if she put a button behind the tooth and then I did elastics, it not be fixed and brought forward and overlap the bottom teeth. My current medication is Doxycycline.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

If you want to remove it for cosmetic purpose, then you need to undergo circumcision, but it is not advisable.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

They are not bumps but just spots. They do not itch or smell. They are only just visible. After applying a cream such as Beclomin for prolonged periods, it goes away but once I stop, it starts to appear again.","Doctor":"Hi. This seems to be related to some atypical skin lesions that respond well to Beclomin (Beclomethasone and Miconazole nitrate) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These can or cannot be sexually transmitted disease-related symptoms. It depends on proper evaluation and testing to rule out the real cause. In differential diagnosis, lichen sclerosis can be on top. In this disease, we see patchy white lesions on male genitalia. Skin diseases like lichen planus and psoriasis can be other differentials. The best next step is to consult a dermatologist in-person to get yourself tested thoroughly. The dermatologist would rule out all possible causes including fungal infections and aforementioned possibilities. Once diagnosed properly, it can be managed accordingly.

Let us assume that you are normal.  In a regular 30 day cycle, women normally ovulate around 14th day in the middle of the cycle. When there is an irregular cycle, then there may or may not be an ovulation. If ovulation is occurring, then there is a chance of pregnancy. But, most of the time there is either no ovulation or there is bad quality ovulation happening in an irregular cycle. So, pregnancy fails to occur.

Her photophobia has reduced now and she is attracted by lights, reflective surfaces, hanging toys in the baby gym, musical toys, etc. Her other milestones are normal except reaching for toys which she does occasionally. Her eye movements seem to be coordinated, at times shake while trying to fix.At 14 weeks of age, EUA was done after which doctors advised to wait for further corneal clearance as she does not require any surgical intervention for glaucoma right now and procedures like PKP has guarded prognosis till two years of age.

With your descriptions, it seems that you are having a mole with secondary infections. If you can send pictures of this, then it will be better for me to suggest diagnosis, treatment and alleviate your anxiety. Mole, so called melanocytic nevus, if you frequently touch your mole it may get infected. They are considered benign melanomas and nothing actively needs to be done for them. If the mole shows sudden changes, such as increase in size, differential pigmentation, bleeding, irregular borders, etc., then you may go for a skin biopsy. But, in your case, it initially requires oral antibiotics like tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days and topical cream Fusidic acid local application twice daily for five days. Once infection gets controlled, then you can go for removal. For removal, you may choose any one of the treatment options. Shave excision under local anesthesia by a dermatologist, TCA (trichloroacetic acid) cautery, radiofrequency cautery or laser treatment. Frequent touch of mole with finger. Mole excision biopsy to rule out any malignant changes. 1. Infected melanocytic nevus. 2. Melanoma. Infected melanocytic nevus.

There is an abscess and my dentist is always fully booked. Can you help me?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query. For an abscessed tooth, you have two options. One is endodontic treatment, and the other is the removal of the tooth involved in the abscess formation. Now, the treatment plan depends on the condition of the tooth crown. If the crown is in a good condition then you will be treated through a root canal treatment and if the crown portion is decayed or damaged grossly then you will undergo extraction of the same. Before visiting the dentist, you need to take an antibiotic prophylaxis for three days: This drug regimen will decrease the formation of the abscess and will relieve you of the pain. It is necessary before the treatment. Take this medication only if you are not allergic to any of these and only if you are physically fit and not going through any condition like pregnancy, etc. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine with their consent.

For the past few days, I have been having swollen lymph nodes all over my neck, a severe sore throat and tonsils which I assumed was just tonsilitis as I have had it before. However, I have been experiencing constant headaches, sore muscles, backache, and pain in my tail bone as well but, that might just be from falling over. I was looking at the back of my throat in a mirror and noticed something that I had not seen before right behind my tongue. I had no idea what it was and neither did my mom. So, I searched online and found it was an epiglottis. But, I had never seen it before when looking in my throat which happens quite a bit because I always have sore throats. Is it normal for it to be so visible, yellowish and red-veined? I am attaching a few pictures. Do I have tonsillitis or something more serious? I have been trying to organize a doctor's appointment but have not been able to get one. Please answer.","Doctor":"Hello. From the photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems that you have severe pharyngitis with tonsillitis and epiglottitis. It could be a viral or bacterial epiglottitis. This usually resolves with antibiotics, but could also become very severe. You need to undergo some tests like CBC (complete blood count), and throat swab culture sensitivity. You need not worry unless there is breathlessness or stridor. I suggest you start Amoxicillin and Clavulanate 625 mg twice a day, along with tablet Aceclofenac, Serratiopeptidase, and Paracetamol twice a day along with Pantoprazole 40 mg on an empty stomach. Take all the above for five days, till you get an appointment with an ENT specialist.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

It is not possible to say which medicine is better without personally seeing the patient, but I think Amitriptyline will make a better option. At the same time, I am of the opinion that a single medicine for vertigo should be tried first before trying multiple medications. As I can see in your description, you are taking both Cinnarizine (Stugeron) and Betahistine. In my opinion, removing Stugeron should help you in decreasing the dizziness. I hope this answers you.

It is only normal stool in most cases. Initially, this incident used to happen on daily basis especially during the office hours. Now, it is happening at the rate of one to two times per week.

According to the history and information given by you, my answers are as follows: It does not look like you have a gastrointestinal disorder. But, better is to get an ultrasonography of your abdomen and rule it out. In cervical spine you have only a small disc. So, it is just the start of arthritis and it does not cause gas problems. Intestinal gas does not hit the brain. If the bowel is not passed for so many days then there is a chance of infection and patient can die. But, two to three days does not matter. You have only early cervical spondylosis and it seems that you have vertigo. So, you need to be treated for vertigo. Also, you will need core, shoulder and neck strengthening exercises to support your head. So that you will not get vertigo due to cervical spine problems.

I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes. I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now.

The common causes of recurrence are: I will suggest you to apply Clotrimazole cream available as candid cream twice a day on the lesion. Take your AF-Kit (combination of Fluconazole 150 mg, Azithromycin 1 g and Ornidazole 750 mg) also. In case of severe itching, take some antihistamine once a day. Keep the area dry and clean, wear loose fitting cotton undergarments, do not use perfumed soap, eat healthy and balanced diet and drink lots of water.

It first began after unprotected oral and vaginal sex with a one night stand three years ago. About two weeks after the original encounter, I began experiencing a burning sensation while urinating along with itching of the penis glans, red swollen meatus and discharge. Believing it was chlamydia, I immediately went in for a full panel STD test. However, the results came back negative. Baffled, I began applying Neosporin to the infected area hoping for the best. While the symptoms remained the same, about two weeks after having the STD test I contracted strep throat and was given the antibiotic Azithromycin. Not only did this clear up the strep but also stopped the itching, burning and discharge. However, my meatus remained red and swollen. I went to my local clinic and the nurse who examined me said everything looked fine. Relieved, I went about my normal life until later noticing a small white spot on my penis glans. The spot was not irritating or painful. It was not raised at all just discolored. About two weeks later another similar spot appeared. I tried to just not think about it and hoped my symptoms would go away on its own. However, they did not go away and pretty soon I noticed that the entire underside of the head of my penis had turned a pale grayish color. I then went and saw urologist who ran multiple urinalyses and did blood work. All test came back negative and he told me I was fine and to just stop thinking about it. I tried my best. Now that brings me here, three years down the road from when the symptoms first arose. My meatus is still red and puffy and my glans still the same sickly gray color. There is no pain or irritation that still persists, but the red meatus and discolored glans are ruining my confidence. I have had sex with another partner about two years ago and after three weeks of the encounter she was treated for UTI. What could this possibly be with all the tests coming back negative?","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed all the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can appreciate slight color change of the glans. It can be pre-vitiligo, but it is too early to be absolutely sure. I would recommend you to keep a watch on it whether the color changes to more white or it spreads further. Presently, I do not think it needs any treatment, but you keep it under observation. As far as meatus is concerned, it is slightly red. Since, there are no symptoms and all your tests are negative, you do not have to worry. You do not have to be anxious as it is not looking like any sexually transmitted disease. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The onset of eosinophilia and dust allergy has become more frequent since I moved to Bangalore (5-6 years). Sometimes I suffer wheezing, running nose and watery eyes. Since, last two years, I have become prone to sinusitis also. When I was first treated for eosinophilia, I was prescribed Serobid 50mg (1 rotacap) and Beclate (2 rotacaps) 100mg along with Alerid 5mg twice a day for the first one month and there after Serobid 50mg (1 rotacap) and Beclate 100mg (1 rotacap) along with Alerid 5mg twice a day for another two months. After that if I have an occasional onset of allergies, I would take the prescription (Serobid 50mg (1 rotacap) and Beclate 100mg (1 rotacap) along with Alerid 10mg once a day) and allergies would subside in a week or so. However, for the last 5-6 years, I had to take Serobid 50mg (1 rotacap) and Beclate 100mg (1 rotacap) once a day during night for a period of 3-4 months (mostly in winter season) to avoid wheezing and would take Alerid 10 mg if there are any allergy symptoms (occasionally). Since  4 months I have been taking Glemont-F as an alternative for the rotacaps (Serobid 50 mg and Beclate 100mg) and Alerid tablets, as Glemont-F is working fine to keep both wheezing and dust allergies down. Glemont-F was prescribed by an ENT specialist when I consulted him for sinusitis. I had used homeopathy medicines and they worked fine. However, it is very time consuming and have to use them 3 times a day 30 minutes before food. So, I discontinued them and started using Glemont-F as an alternative prescribed by an ENT. My questions are: 1) Is Glemont-F safe as I have been taking it for a period of 4-5 months continuously? 2) Since Serobid 50 mg and Beclate 100mg are very old (since I am using it for the last 18years during winters to avoid wheezing), are there any current generation alternatives for the rotacaps? I also was told that rotacaps cause weight gain and bone density loss? 3) Is there any permanent solution for wheezing and dust allergies? Please help me find the solutions for the above questions.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to say that bronchial asthma or allergic bronchitis is just controllable and not completely curable. Following are the answers for your questions: 1. You should avoid Glemont-F. Reserve it only for acute exacerbations. Try to control your problem with inhalers only. 2. Yes, new generation inhalers or rotacaps are Formoterol and Budesonide. You can switch to them. Long term use of inhaled steroids can cause weight gain and calcium deficiency. You can take Calcium and Vitamin D supplements along. 3. No, there is no permanent solution. You just need to avoid dust. 4. You can try homeopathy medicines if you are getting relief. But make sure you take them from a proper homeopathic physician. A lot many people add steroids.

Then, I went to my primary physician for another urine test, which came out as negative. Later, I felt some cramping on and off all day on my left side. The cramps were similar to premenstrual cramps along with sore nipples, increased saliva, and sense of taste, absent-mindedness, forgetfulness, very noticeable fatigue, occasional backache and headache, indigestion, burps and frequent urination. I was anxious and read about ectopic pregnancies and decided to test that night. It was a darker line than the previous tests and the result was pretty fast. When I tested the next morning, it was even darker and the result came very quickly. Then, two digital tests a couple of days after being positive. What can be the reason for my pain? Can it occur from a corpus luteum cyst and pregnancy? Is it safe to say that I am pregnant because of the tests becoming darker? Or were they possibly all false positives? I feel like the cramps are a bit more spaced out and less frequent now. Also, there has been no bleeding. I have my first OB/GYN appointment scheduled 15 days from now, but I am hoping for a little insight. I am currently on Vitex capsules 400 mg, GNC prenatal vitamins and Fish oil pills.

From your history, it looks like a blunt injury with a hematoma at the site of injury. I suggest getting an X-ray of the elbow to rule out a fresh fracture. If there is no fracture, then use an arm pouch and keep the elbow at 90 degrees flexion in the arm pouch for three weeks. I also suggest taking Chymoral forte (Chymotrypsin and Trypsin - enzymes to breakdown hematoma and swelling) and analgesics like Tramadol-Paracetamol combination for acute pain.

About three weeks ago, I started a new job. As one of the requirements of the job is to get a medical test done, I failed in it as my heart rate was 140 bpm at rest.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production. I do not have to explain you much about thalassemia as your doctor might have told you the details and consequences about it. Few symptoms and complications that you need to be aware of due to thalassemia are as follows: Major complications that you need to consider is iron overload, which could either be due to recurrent blood transfusion or due to excess cell break down. Comming to the weakness, it is generally due to low hemoglobin. Symptoms of anemia can result in feeling tired and pale skin. A decrease in the hemoglobin level was mainly due to blood transfusion. The patient can be on iron supplements, and it requires about two months on an average to improve hemoglobin level. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron and releases it when the body needs it. It usually lives in the body’s cells, with very little circulating in the blood.

My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Can the above pain be due to ovulation?","Doctor":"Hi. The best way to check for an ovulation pain or mittelschmerz is to check for LH (luteinizing hormone) surge with an ovulation kit. If the test is positive, then you are likely to ovulate or have ovulated already. The pain can also be due to submucosal fibroid. I suggest you use tablet Meftal Spas 500 mg (combination of Dicycloverine and Mefenamic acid) twice a day for pain relief.

I continued using it because I thought my allergy is persistent. Recently, I realized that my problem is not an allergy but addiction to nasal spray. My symptoms are severe nasal congestion which requires using nasal spray four to five times. I have no typical symptoms of an allergy, like a runny nose, watery eyes, or irritation. Above all, I become very upset and anxious if I do not use the nasal spray. I tried to stop the usage of nasal spray, and somewhat successful. But at times my congestion is severe and it seriously affects my activities including sleeping. It would be great if you can suggest some alternative for nasal decongestants. I am a 29 year old male, who is under treatment for mild hyperuricemia.","Doctor":"Hello. You suffer from a condition called as rhinitis medicamentosa. As you have rightly understood, it is due to the prolonged uninhibited use of nasal decongestants. Repeated use of the same causes decongestion temporarily followed by rebound congestion inside the nose. The action of these decongestants is by vasodilation, which lasts for a short duration, followed by reflex constriction of vessels which causes congestion again. This problem causes nose block. It is totally different from an allergy, which has specific symptoms as rightly pointed out by you. You should avoid all decongestants like Xylometazoline, Oxymetazoline, and Ephedrine drops. Do not worry about steroid side effects as the intranasal preparation does not get absorbed into the blood stream. It acts locally on the nasal mucosa which is exhibiting the rebound congestion and rhinitis medicamentosa problem. Do read the leaflet of the spray very carefully and then start using it. Do not inhale deeply after spraying as the spray then gets deposited in the throat, remember it has to act on the nasal mucosa and not anywhere other than that. These medicines will not affect the hyperuricemia problem or interact with the medicines you are taking for that. You may avoid decongestant tablets like Phenylephrine during these medicines. However, if you feel the need for those, you may let me know, and I can assess. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start using the medicines after their consent. I would also suggest you avoid exposing yourself to dust, spicy foods, cold foods, and smoke. You may wear a mask while traveling or walking outside. You are advised to take plenty of green leafy vegetables and healthy nutritious diet to help with the healing process. Do revert if you need any further support.

Currently, my CA-125 in serum is 125.37 U/ml. The ultrasound scan revealed large multiloculated well-defined bilateral adnexal lesions with enhancing solid component. Lesions measured about 10.0 x 9.1x 10.1 cm on the right side and 5 x 4 x 5.2 cm on the left. There was thick enhancing septae noted within the lesion. Bilateral cystic lesions abutting the iliac vessels and the ureters noted. However, there is no direct evidence of any invasion. The right ureter is displaced posteromedially by a right adnexal lesion and left ureter is displaced posteriorly by the left adnexal lesion. The CT scan revealed bilateral multiloculated well-defined adnexal complex cyst with thick enhancing septae likely of an ovarian neoplasm. There was bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, likely due to the pressure effect by the adnexal cysts with no obvious infiltration of the ureteric wall. What shall I do at this moment? Is it an ovarian tumor or a relapse of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor? As CA-125 is very high, does it confirm that I have a cancer? Some doctors told me to operate the tumors and if after the operation malignancy is confirmed, and then they would take necessary steps. Should I take any additional precautions or test before the operation? I need your suggestion for a treatment plan and also about open cystectomy or Wertheim's operation. Also I wanted to know, whether my CA-125 will decrease after the removal of ovaries and uterus. I have attached the necessary documents for your reference. Currently, I am taking Megestone and Ferium XT daily.","Doctor":"Hi.  Based on your reports, there seem to be ovarian tumors on both sides. The type of tumor, either benign or malignant, can be revealed only after removal. It may be unrelated to your previous tumor. The value of CA-125 though raised does not indicate malignancy. It is marginally elevated and it is highly unlikely that you will have epithelial cancer of the ovaries at this age, for which it is an ideal marker. A Wertheim's hysterectomy is done for cervix cancer and you would not require it. For your age, if possible fertility preserving surgery is ideal. The best line of management would be to get a CT scan or an MRI to clearly define the type of ovarian tumor as there are suspicions of dermoid and chocolate cysts. After that, a fertility preserving surgery in the form of ovarian cystectomy preserving the ovary can be planned at least on one side. It is very likely that your cysts turn out benign. Kindly get evaluated and operated with a surgical oncologist as the management should be proper especially if you require a staging procedure in case the cyst is malignant.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

I had a swab test and blood work was done to rule out HSV. It came back negative. However, there is still a chance it could be HSV as it takes three to six months to show up in your blood. I am concerned. This is completely out of the normal for me. I do not smoke, drink moderately a few times a week, eat healthily and exercise. Any ideas? Would oral or genital herpes look like this in the mouth? Could it be mouth cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. Your concern may be oral lichen planus which is an autoimmune issue which is treatable. Or this can be aphthous stomatitis which are oral ulcers and they are also treatable. They flare due to low immunity of any reason, low iron in the blood, B12 deficiency, stress, overthinking, etc. Thirdly, it can be oral herpes which will have multiple ulcers rather than your presentation.

I have an younger brother. My parents have always been distant for as long as I remember and the beating, fighting and emotional abuse started around five years back. Now they started to fight with us too. My father always try to threaten us to do what he wants.  When I was very young, I had a passion for reading and I lost myself in books which made me absent minded to the world around me. As time passed on and a few horrific incidents in my life, I suppressed my memories even more and my emotions too. Now, I have emotions but I cannot recognize them or maybe I am confused with my emotions. I feel like there is something heavy in my heart. I do not know whether it is grief or depression. I became very suicidal and rushed to a doctor. He was not able to help me. My parents found out and I was punished. My father hit me and verbally abused me. I saw another doctor and she diagnosed me as having anxiety disorder and she gave me some medicines. I used them for about a week and felt better.

I do get sputum in the morning, which is slightly green in color. What medicine should I take?","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be suffering from an acute upper respiratory tract infection. Since the sputum is greenish colored, it is better you start on a course of antibiotics. In addition to the antibiotics you would most probably require anti-inflammatory drugs, mucolytics and antihistamines to remove the cough and for the stuffed nose. In my practice, off late due to the recent change in weather there has been an increase in such cases. However, I have found it prudent to put the patient on a symptomatic treatment for a few days and observe. If not feeling better after 3 days, then we institute an antibiotic. In your case, due to the greenish color that is suggestive of bacteria, I would recommend a course of Levofloxacin, Chymoral forte tablets for removing inflammation, Mucinac tablet (Acetylcystine) to help remove the sputum and nasal decongestant nose drops. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have Behcet’s disease, though mostly under control. I have had various tropical diseases. I also had hepatitis A at childhood, and TB meningitis. I also have scoliosis. I have been diagnosed BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma) half way down and in the middle of my back. It is about 2cm in diameter and raised about 1cm high. Having had many skin cancers removed previously I expected the same procedure i.e, administration of local anesthesia and excision. However, the general surgeon at the local hospital wants me to have general anesthesia for the surgical removal of BCC. I cannot understand the necessity for a general anesthesia for removal of a BCC (I have had many removed previously without any problem). As I have had adverse reactions to anesthesia before,I am very nervous about this. Once I had respiratory depression during moderate sedation. Of five previous surgeries, I have had blood transfusions with two. My recent blood work showed low PTT. Is it necessary that I should undergo surgery under general anesthesia?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. You should ask your surgeon the reason behind giving general anaesthesia in your case. Basal cell carcinoma is a locally invasive tumour with very rare chances of malignancy. The need for general anesthesia can arise when on clinical examination it was found that the tumour also involves underlying subcutaneous tissue, nerves and surrounding structures. In such cases we cannot rely upon the local anesthesia as we may have to extend the surgery. During surgery we have to remove one extra centimetre of the healthy margin to prevent recurrence of the tumour.  This margin will be sent for histopathological examination later, to determine whether margins are free from tumour. If margins are involved resurgery has to be done. The size of your tumour is 2cm and may be your surgeon on examination found it to be a deep tumour. Hence to prevent resurgery, he might have advised surgery under general anesthesia. As in case of local anesthesia, sometimes it is difficult to extend the surgery especially when underlying nerves are involved. Do not worry about the general anesthesia as there are few anesthetic compounds which do not cause respiratory depression. So, inform your surgeon regarding the previous respiratory depression and get treated accordingly.

On the day of D and C, I was so stressed out and masturbated after (twice without penetration). I got cramp in each orgasm but no bleeding. I had mild discomfort after. Did I hurt my healing? I have had minimal cramping and no bleeding since my D and C. The cramps are a little worse than period cramps. During periods, I usually get back cramps. With D and C, I have had lower back and lower abdominal cramping. There was no bleeding for the most part. I am so scared that I will not be able to have a baby or that I might have caused some scarring. They told me no sex meaning penetration. I did not and did not know if masturbation with no penetration was included in that. I am just scared this will lead to infertility. My doctor said the surgery went well with no issues, but I am so scared that I will not be able to have kids now.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? Just relax, you are absolutely fine. Let me give you few facts. Just look up the image of the uterus. D and C is done on the interior of the uterus. The contents of the uterus and inner lining of the uterus are scrapped out. Your no bleeding, only means that doctor has efficiently removed all contents and not left anything back. Had she left something back, you would have been having to spot and bleeding on and off, needing another D and C. Minimal bleeding or spotting is normal. So the doctor advised you not to have sex, as following the procedure the inner uterine lining is raw and exposure to semen, an infected fluid, can cause more pain and adhesions. Masturbation is fine. Cramps are expected as the uterus is trying to expel any tiny blood clots or leftovers, as occur during periods. This D and C, and masturbation are not going to affect your pregnancy chances. The only factor that will influence your fertility potential is your weight. Your expected body weight is 52 to 57 kg. More the weight more is the chances for no ovulation and irregular periods. Thereby lesser pregnancy chance. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries. All the best.

Using a night cream like ISIS Neotone night serum everyday at night for two to three months will help, but you need to be regular. For additional skin whitening, you require skin treatment like skin whitening chemical peels and laser sessions to be honest. Secondly, the problem of loss of hair in the beard area is a common thing that I see in my practice. This requires a close up examination. In all likelihood it would be alopecia areata. We need to give serial injections and also apply a tube by the name of Tacroz Forte 0.1% (Tacrolimus) at night and apply sunscreen during the day.

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is getting frequent almost after every 3 to 4 weeks. I recollect having collided with somebody about one and half years back, hurt on my right eye with somebody's elbow and had a swollen eye, very painful and under the eye, it is red and swollen. After about 4 to 5 days, it started healing, and gradually I forgot about it. Now with this frequent infection in the same eye after every 3 to 4 weeks which lasts 3 to 5 days, sometimes pus and little blood come out and sometimes it heals without any pus coming out. This time it started with an itch and has gradually swollen and is very itchy and painful and red and swollen inside and outside the eye.","Doctor":"Hello. This is unrelated to that trauma with the elbow. This is suggestive of lid infection. Try warm compresses, apply an antibiotic ointment like Neosporin H (Bacitracin Zinc and Hydrocortisone acetate) ointment twice daily along lid margins. Once this episode is over then we need to evaluate your lids and lashes carefully as sometimes meibomitis or blepharitis cause recurrent lid infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a mild pain at my right shoulder joint or below.

We are carrying out further tests including PET-CT scan, endoscopy, colonoscopy, CBC, and all the CA tests, but no primary cancer was found. Now, what will I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports of your mother-in-law (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like they have not yet completed the full work up. Biopsy from the abdominal wall nodule shows metastatic adenocarcinoma. So now, they must do upper GI endoscopy, gynecological per speculum examination, and ultrasound thyroid to find out any suspicious lesion. You have not attached the biopsy report. The biopsy specimen must be stained with immunohistochemical markers. There are different markers and each type of tumor has a specific marker. So, the positive-stained marker will identify the primary tumor in most of the cases. In case everything fails to find the primary tumor, the next step is to check the genomic profile to find the primary cancer.

I am 22 weeks and two days pregnant and was told at my last scan that the baby is about 10 days behind in size.

We are in two minds whether we should go for an amniocentesis or wait until the next scan which is in another 10 days.

It started a week ago when I was diagnosed with sore eyes. My physician told me to use Terramycin four to five times a day and on the sixth day, the swelling in my eyes got better. But once my eye was in a \\"usable\\" state, I could open it fully with no pain or itching. I noticed a sudden change in my vision. It is now blurred. I just got my new pair of glasses three weeks ago so I am surprised why my vision got worse immediately. Is this a temporary aftereffect of the sore eyes or am I facing an eye infection which involves permanently reducing vision? The symptoms I have been experiencing last week were as follows: Itchy eyes, swelling eyelids, I cannot open my eyes to its full extent, frequent pain in the eye, sometimes tear droplets rushing down my face, and when I wake up in the morning, it is like the liquid hardens and sticky things prevent my eye from opening but not that hard. Now, all the symptoms have gone except the sudden blurry vision. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. This blurred vision could be due to viral keratoconjunctivitis which means there is a possibility of involvement of cornea leading to blurred vision.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

I am 20 years old. Since then my teeth have been healthy but I have been suffering from an eating disorder for three years and I am still in recovery. Two months ago one of my top central incisors started feeling slightly wobbly and after looking at it in the mirror I noticed the gums had receded by 2 mm compared to the pictures I had from last year. I saw my dentist who told me everything was fine but since then my tooth has become even more wobbly and my other top central incisor has started to wobble too. I had a look at all of my teeth today and realized that all of the gums had receded by 2-3 mm. I brush my teeth with a soft toothbrush and floss twice a day, and I use mouthwash every two days. I am very scared that my teeth are going to fall out because I can feel the roots being unstable when I chew food and I cannot bite into a sandwich or any other harder texture without feeling discomfort. Due to COVID-19, I am unable to see a dentist right now unless it is an urgent case causing a lot of pain. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Nothing to panic as such. Your gums need complete scaling (cleaning) but due to COVID-19, you cannot have now. If the gums are swollen, you will definitely have a wobble feel. Do enforce brushing twice daily with normal paste and medium toothbrush. Use Betadine gargle thrice daily, Take tablet Oflox OZ 10 twice for five days and Becosules capsules once daily for five days. If you have an eating disorder you can try with probiotic sachets for five days preferably in the nights. Visit the dentist once the pandemic is over.

I am waiting on getting the ELISA antibody test for sparganosis, and have been having worsening headaches and moving/squirming sensations in my head?","Doctor":"Hello. Cerebral sparganosis is a rare parasitic infection due to a parasite named spirometra mansoni and when there is a parasitic infestation of the brain tissues.

My reports show the length of the uterus is 82 mm. Gravid uterus reveals one gestational sac with an embryo, CRL is 10 mm, which corresponds to the gestational age of seven weeks and six days in the fundal region of the uterine cavity. No cardiac pulsation could be recorded on M mode, the cervix is normal, uterus measures 9.4x6.9x6.8 cm. No adnexal mass lesion is seen. Both ovaries are normal in size and echotexture. Right ovary is 2.3x2.1 cm, and left ovary is 2.4x1.9 cm. No fluid is seen in the pouch of Douglas. What is the reason for a missed abortion? How long should I have to wait for the next pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry about the loss, but let me assure you one thing, you will surely get pregnant again. It is not just to console you, but if you got pregnant before, irrespective of the result, you will get pregnant again. Let me explain what and why is missed abortion. A healthy egg has to meet a healthy sperm at the right time, the life of an egg is 24 hours, so it has to meet sperm within that time. But after 24 hours, it forms embryo with few chromosome damage. This fertilized egg comes to the uterus, endometrium should have been properly ripened and nurtured by proper hormones on right time, only then the blood supply to the baby will be normal, and the hormonal milieu should be fine. The best part is, if you have a missed abortion, chances of a healthy pregnancy is 97 %. So, why worry about the 3 %? It is advisable to give a gap of three months. Suppose there are any unseen reasons, they will be gone by that time. After 3 to 4 months get, these tests done, to rule out other possible causes. All these problems can be tested before pregnancy, the last one to be tested once pregnant. How old are you? If you are below 35 years, nothing needs to be done. If you are above 35 years, get serum AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) done within first ten days of your period. This will tell how many eggs are left in the ovaries. As age advances, the healthy eggs get over, and only unhealthy eggs predominate, so that could be a reason for the genetic problem. But there is a solution for each and every problem that I mentioned. Hope I have clarified your doubt.

Generally, after insertion of an immediate denture, the patient feels numb and somewhat swollen from the local anesthetic and not really able to tell much about the comfort of the denture base and the fit of the denture teeth against the opposing jaw and teeth. Expect several appointments with the dentist during the healing period as the swelling goes down and the denture base settles. Your bite will change and need to be readjusted. The more teeth removed at the time the immediate denture is delivered, the longer it will take to heal and the more sore spots you will have. An immediate denture generally helps in the healing of extraction socket uneventfully. Generally, after extraction, some swelling do arise and because of that, you are not able to remove the denture. Just let me know if there any pain in the attempt to remove the denture or is it stuck as you are not able to remove it? If there is pain and if you feel redness and swelling in gums area, there are chances the area is a little infected.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Today I have taken Flexon-MR but it did not reduce the pain.","Doctor":"Hi.Actually, you are very young to have persistent back pain and this episode appears to be an acute exaggeration of this pain. Cause of back pain can be due to a muscle strain or a small herniation of an intervertebral disc followed by lifting heavy weight. If you have localized back pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesias, etc., then you can start with following recommendations initially for a period of two weeks. We will observe you for the next two to three weeks to see how you respond to this conservative management protocol. Normally, the pain in the back along with the muscle spasm will subside in next five to seven days if you take your medications and observe precautions as advised. If you are not feeling better, then we might have to get some investigations like dynamic x-ray of lower back and few blood tests for evaluation. Injury while attempting to lift a heavy weight. Nothing as of now. Avoid acute forward bending, lifting of any heavy weight, etc., till the time your pain subsides.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

They sent off my culture and it was negative for bacteria. Today, my throat is getting better. Later that day, I noticed a lump on the side of my neck. It is painless and moves slightly when I press on it. It is about the size of my pointer fingertip. Could this be from the virus?","Doctor":"Hello. I shall try to help you out on this one. The symptoms and signs which you have written are consistent with the diagnosis of acute tonsillitis. However, since tests for bacteria were negative, there is most probably a viral cause for the infection. Mono test is a test to detect infectious mononucleosis, another viral infection. Since mono test is negative, that may be ruled out. The lump in the neck you are talking about seems to be an enlarged lymph node. Tonsil infections are in many cases accompanied by enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. The lymph nodes most often getting enlarged in tonsillitis as they are situated just below the ear. Those may be movable and slightly tender to touch. If the neck lump persists or gets enlarged day by day or loses its mobility, an FNAC may be done to know the underlying cause. In most cases of uncomplicated tonsillitis, however, the swelling gradually reduces, and nothing further needs to be done. So, the possible causes are: But, the most likely cause is acute viral tonsillitis, that too resolving (as the throat is getting better). Be sure to take plenty of fluids. Paracetamol may help to take care of pain and/or fever. For the time being, sharing personal items with others may be avoided.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am in the process of looking for a new physician, but I live in a very remote area with a significant shortage of medical professionals, so I am in a lot of ways on my own here. My mother had her thyroid removed at 10, due to a goiter that was large enough to impede breathing and swallowing. My symptoms include extreme fatigue and insomnia. Now I sleep as much as 12 hours at night and still need an afternoon nap to be functional, and have cold intolerance, brain fog, very emotional, and change in my menstrual cycle (get periods every 2 to 3 weeks, with cramps). I also lost about 15 pounds within a month without a change in the diet. The weight loss has slowed since, but I am down around 22 lbs. At the initial visit, my doctor could determine that my thyroid was enlarged and asymmetric, and ordered an ultrasound and TSH. I never saw the values for the initial TSH test but was told it was within normal limits. The ultrasound showed both lobes to be significantly enlarged, with the left being half as big as the right. Both were full of nodules, but three stood out enough to warrant a biopsy, including one of 4.7 cm that contained a calcification. My biopsy is later this week. These results were enough to convince my doctor to run more blood tests. I picked up the reports from the lab today and discovered that she did a TSH, T3, T4, and TPO. I will attach the reports. TSH was 1.72 IU/mL, T3 was 118 ng/dL, T4 was 0.87 ng/dL, and TPO was 4 IU/mL. Should I request any other tests? Does being within range mean these values are all normal values? An internet search of ranges for each of these shows a disagreement on good and optimal values. Should I see an endocrinologist for further examination? My doctor had to be convinced by me to run these tests, and she is convinced that I am just depressed. I am on waitlists for every doctor in the county. I even tried a naturopath, who would be amenable to running more bloodwork. The nearest endocrinologist is about a four-hour drive, more when the roads are bad. So I am lost in the woods here, literally and figuratively. Any insight or direction is welcome. I am so tired of feeling awful.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks a lot for such a detailed history, it makes my job easier.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from IBS for past one month. I have been taking Sporlac tablet from last 10 days.

Should I take any medicines?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. If you are a perfectly healthy adult male, then there is no reason for your penis size to be small. Mostly all men go through this phase where they feel their penis size is smaller. This thought will hamper their sexual life. If on an erect state, your penis size is anywhere between 10 to 15 cm, then there is nothing to be worried about. You will have a great sex life in the future. Try to get rid of this anxiety as soon as possible. Also, I advise a very healthy diet with lots of vegetables and protein. Work out regularly. There is no recommended treatment for increasing the size of the penis.

I am taking HCG 5000 and HMG 150 injection twice a week. My sperm production has started from azoospermia. We have done IVF and it was successful. My doctor asked to take testosterone injection, but if I take this my sperm production will be stopped. I want to know how to keep sperm production active. Please let me know the available option to maintain the sperm. I heard about Clomiphene citrate 50 mg or Enclomiphene citrate 25 mg treatment. Please help me with that.","Doctor":"Hi. HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) and HMG (human menopausal gonadotropin) are excellent choices to ensure a good sperm production, which is needed for fertility that you have achieved. However, this treatment combination rarely leads to normal testosterone levels, which is needed for good muscle mass and general well being. Testosterone injections will be ideal for the same, cheaper and easier to take. Yes, it will reduce your sperm count, which is reversible once it is stopped. Hence, unless you want to have a second child soon, there is no rationale to continue the difficult regimen of HCG and HMG injections. You can conveniently switch to testosterone injection now. Then a few years later, we can stop the testosterone injection and go back to HMG with HCG if you plan a second child. Clomiphene citrate will not help in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

There is staining area of about six inches on each side which is fading. However, on the top and bottom edges of the stained area is a blue bruise which is as painful as if the injection were done a week ago. The bruises are painful to touch and ache without touch and hurt when I sit. I have asked three doctors and have been told they have no idea. The bruises are not getting any better and I was wondering why they are there and is it something that needs further investigation. I have no health issues other than managed hypertension.","Doctor":"Hello. The staining is due to the iron itself which leaked into the skin while it was being injected. The technique of giving the iron injections was not correct since neither discoloration nor bruising should have occurred. Nothing can be done to resolve this but they are usually seen to go away on their own. The complete resolution takes time, sometimes up to few years. Regular massage has been shown to hasten recovery in few cases. You could try hot fomentation to get some relief from the pain.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This level 2 anomaly scan is absolutely normal for the foetus pertaining to its growth and absence of any congenital anomalies.  The concern regarding the low lying placenta at 18-19 weeks of gestation is not alarming as by 32 -36 weeks the placenta tends to go up once the lower segment formation takes place over uterus. Low lying or placenta previa shall be considered then at 32-36 weeks if the distance is less than 25 mm from internal os. High resistance flow in left uterine artery alone indicates a possible compression or hindrance in blood supply. There may be a subserosal fibroid or enlarged ovary probably which can cause external compression , but it is unlikely to affect the baby's growth as the other arterial flow is normal.

I did not have any problems during my TMT. I went to a doctor to understand the implications.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After 13 days of starting the pill, had safe sex with a condom, but we doubt that it broke. To be safe, I took two dosages of Unwanted 72 the next day and stopped regular birth control. After eight days, I got bleeding, and it lasted for five days (same number of days as my regular period after stopping pills every month). What was that bleeding? Was that my normal bleeding or withdrawal? I am confused as this was near to expected period. Then, I did HPT, and it came to be negative. What are my chances of pregnancy? Does this bleeding confirm that I am not pregnant? Somebody suggested that I can start my regular birth control pills and I started. After 10 days, I got my full abdomen ultrasound done. It indicates that no focal lesion was seen and endometrial thickness is 4 mm. Uterus size is 88 mm - 43 mm - 42 mm. Do the thickness and report confirm that I am not pregnant? What is the normal thickness at this stage if I am pregnant? Also, the doctor suggested me to stop birth control pill until I get my regular period. Is that correct? When should I expect my next period? As I had regular birth control pill for 10 days, will it affect my next period?","Doctor":"Hello. What you experienced was a withdrawal bleed following Unwanted 72 (emergency contraceptive pill), which occurs in 7 to 10 days post emergency pill intake. So, it is normal. There is no pregnancy at all, as is confirmed in the ultrasound pelvis with ET being 4 mm. ET would have been more than 16 mm with decidual reaction if you had been pregnant.

I had my period on 21st and had unprotected sex 12 days later. The next day I took an I-pill. Then, I have had unprotected sex three to four times in the last four days. What are the chances of me getting pregnant? What can I do to prevent pregnancy now? Should I take another I-pill or some other I-pill? I understand that I should be more careful about this from now on.","Doctor":"Hi. If you have regular monthly menses, then mostly you will not have any problem. The second thing is that after four days you cannot do much more. If you have intercourse three to four times in the last four days, then you should have taken precautions or tablets before and not after four days. Now, you have to wait for your period to come. One positive thing is that, if you have regular monthly period, then your expected period is around the next two days. The last 10 days before menses are coming in safe period and you do not have chance of pregnancy if you have unprotected sex during this time. You can go to the doctor and ask for copper-T as emergency contraception today only. It can be placed up to five days after sex. It inhibits implantation of pregnancy. Also, there is no study if you take I-pill for two times in one cycle will be effective or not. So, it is not that easy and also, it can disturb your cycle for at least one or two cycles. Either go for the copper-T or wait for your period for more than four to five days. If you did not get period, then do a urine pregnancy test. If that is negative, then wait for sometime. If that is positive, then you will need early termination. Have protected sex and stay safe. I-pill is emergency contraception and it is not like you can take whenever you like.

I have been working out a lot last week and possibly thought it could be a muscle bruise.

Below is my query and your answer - I am a male of 48 years of age. I have a lean build and do regular exercise. Since childhood, I had a tendency for heart palpitations and premature beats. After a few tests, anxiety was found to be the main cause.  You had said that most probably these premature complexes are originating from ventricles which are leading to the symptoms. These are usually benign and not life threatening. The only concern remains is that of coronary artery disease, which is also less likely as these are occurring from a long time and you are not having any other symptoms. Lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, smoking, caffeinated beverages are known triggering factors for these due to sympathetic overactivity. You should also get thyroid test done. I think, just be on a safer side, you should get one treadmill test done to rule out coronary artery disease and echo should be repeated. Afterwards, I met a cardiologist and got an ECG and echo tests done. The tests were normal. The cardiologist said that there is no need for TMT test since I do running and other exercises daily and there is no known risk factor for CAD. But the VPCs continued for a month.Then, I realized that I was taking a weight gainer supplement from the last one year which contained creatinine. Two months back, I was not doing any exercise due to a small fracture in my elbow but continued to take this supplement. The doctor advised me to stop the supplement immediately since this could be the cause of missed beats. Then I read in the internet and found out that there have been cases of irregular heart beats due to creatinine supplementation. I stopped taking the supplement although it was from a reputed firm and did not contain any steroids. The missed beats reduced after stopping the supplement and from the last two months, it has come to a normal level of one or two in a day. But somehow my mind started getting preoccupied with the thoughts of heart disease and I started reading about it from the internet and even textbooks.I have been thin and slim since my childhood, have been quite active physically, no family history of heart disease, no diabetes, no hypertension, non-smoker, rarely eat fried foods. My lipid profile is normal with HDL being about 55 whenever tested, CRP is around 0.5. But in spite of this, I was not able to free my mind from worries of CAD. A month back, I did quite a lot of pushups after a gap of four to five months. After three to four days, I started having pain in my chest here and there mostly at rest. After a week I got an ECG done which was normal. The pain subsided slowly but whenever I did some exercise which put a strain on the chest muscle I started having pain and with pain, more worries.Then I met a psychiatrist. He said that I have got into an obsessive loop, which is part of health anxiety disorder which is causing these psychosomatic symptoms of chest pain. He advised me to take some antidepressants for three months, do Yoga and meditation and take some sessions of cognitive behavior therapy. I am reluctant to take antidepressants but have already started doing some meditation and Yoga. He also prescribed Alprazolam .25 mg on SOS basis. Now the pain is subsiding slowly and obsessive thoughts are also reducing. I have stopped doing any exercise that would put a strain on the chest. I do not know how long it will take to resume it. In a recent blood test, two months back my vitamin D3 was at 28. Could it be the cause of the chest pain? Secondly, I stopped the supplement but continued some strenuous exercises without taking a proper diet. Could it be the cause of it? Please guide me.

Migraine headaches occur usually on one side of head and have severe throbbing sensation associated. They can be accompanied with vomiting, photophobia (severe sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (fear of noise). You can see a physician who deals with migraine cases and even you can see a neurologist for the purpose. A neurological examination and fundus examination are must to rule out any other neurological problem. If required your doctor will also post you for CT scan and MRI brain. Treatment for migraine headache would be with the drugs like Flunarizine, Propranolol and Amitriptyline. In case of acute pain drugs like Sumatriptan and Ibuprofen helps to terminate the attack.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.
