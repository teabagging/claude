I have caugh cold , lack of patience, irriataion, weakness, Please suggest the medicine and treatment.","Doctor":"hi, although your TSH  level is quite elevated but T3 and T4 are within normal range and you dont need aye external administration of thyroxine now but  atleast once a year you should go for its follow up as increased TSH indicates that thyroid gland is not able to secrete enough T3 , T4 with normal TSH and that is why TSH secretion has been inreased to stimulate the gland further , so a follow up is required. are you using any hormonal pills , as they may cause weight gain. for your cough and cold you can take some anti histaminic like levocetrizine , you can take some inhalation if nasan congestion is also present like compound menthol inhalation, sensur ointment inhalation , nasivion nasal drop,you should also take some antibiotics like doxycycline or ampi-cloxacillin or roxithromycin , you should do gargle twice daily with glycoseptol or disprin soluble in water, you should take  salbutamol inhaler when required , it can be taken before exposure to cold, dust of exertion as prophylaxis.you should try to avoid exposure to cold and all those allergen which invoke bronchospasm in your case. you should ask your physician or physiotherapist to tell some respiratory exercises which are known to improve lung function.drink alot of water and also take vitamin b complex and micronutrients.consist a physician if symptom persists. wish you all the best."},{"Patient":"I have been having cramping pain in my lower stomach. Pain was 8-9 scale. I noticed a jelly like discharge on my pad this am (wear pads due to incontinence now for over a year with no luck stopping it) seeing a specialist for this. The discharge was somewhat clear. I went later and went to bathroom and noticed I had discharge when I wiped and it was in bottom area of vagina and was a little darker then am. I had noticed a couple of weeks ago two raised areas in that area almost soft like pushing on a balloon. I have had these knots come up in that area that are smaller but hard and my attempts to pop it took several days however it would eventuallyburst and it was like a discharge of yellow puss and blood. Sometimes this has happened before and it got as large as a pound of sausage log. The ones there in the past week have been like a soft area right under the skin by my vaginal area and leg. I have not ever had this balloon type cyst ever discharge as you could not get a hold of it to attempt to pop the area. I guess it is possible they would as they would go away. I realize these systems are probably not tied together but I don t know any other way of explaining it.","Doctor":"HI! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Although it requires a physical examination of your abdomen along with a gynaecological examination to reach at a most appropriate diagnosis, this seems to be a UTI (urinary tract infection) along with a pelvic inflammatory disease(PID).In addition, you might be harbouring some kind of inflammatory reaction to the skin around the genital area due to urinary incontinence resulting in the cyst like raised areas with intermittent purulent discharge.If I were your doctor, I would advise you to take more care of your pesonal hygiene which I am sure you must be doing, and advise you for a urine routine/microscopic/culture sensitivity test, a gram staining and culture sensitivity of the discharge around the genital area, and some basic blood tests like a CBC, blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, HbsAg, and a HIV test as a routine. Further selection of proper antibiotics for the detected infection if any would depend on the reports of investigations. However, if the pain in abdomen increases and persists, I would advise you to consult your gynaecologist/ER of the nearest hospital at the earliest.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Since when you have this pain? Do you run fever? Pain in stomach may be due to 3 most common causes, first is gastritis which will give you pain and nausea vomiting, for which you will need to take medication for decreasing stomach acidity and stopping nsaids drugs if you are taking. You may also need to do ALT test to rule out acute hepatitis, whose management is also supportive to have bed rest and take pain killers. The third one is pancreatitis in which pain is radiating to the back and is severe pain which may require hospital admission but this seems least likely in your case. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Imran Zeb"},{"Patient":"I have an ache on the left side of my abdomen almost reaching around to my back, it is also making me feel a bit sick.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a urine routine/microscopic/culture sensitivity test to rule out a UTI and treat it if positive, and this might relieve you of your abdominal pain. In addition, I would also advise you for a CBC, a clotting profile, a LFT, a serum amylase and lipase and an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any pathology of the pancreas and the biliary system. An ECG would be optional depending on the result of the clinical assessment of your abdomen and chest. Till the reports of clinical assessment and the related investigation are co-related to arrive at a diagnosis, I would advise you for an anti spasmodic drug along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Could it be a delayed reaction to the anesthetic?","Doctor":"Hi, It could be related to the drugs he is using after he had surgery like some anti biotics, pain drugs etc. local reaction can also be due to allergy to suture material.  lastly, a late allergic reaction due to anesthetic drug he received would involve whole body and not hands, but still can not be ruled out.All the best,and have a fast recovery."},{"Patient":"My best friend had an instant peanut allergy reaction on Monday.

As you have gone through every possible testing and her cough showed no response to even steroids, the possibilities like chronic aspiration and GERD  should be considered - Deglution fluoroscopy and esophageal manometry would help.  2.A repeat CT thorax and PET scan would also help to find out any occult node compressing remote areas of bronchi, causing cough. 3. Mild pleurisy which is easily missed by conventional imaging can also be made out by these and hopefully throw some light into the diagnosis.4.

Levocetirizine 5mg twice a day 2.   Montelukast 10mg twice a day 3.   Azelastin nasal spray/drops thrice a day. If there is a transient flare up of allergic symptoms despite being on the above-mentioned drugs, a 2-4 weeks of a steroid, such as, Fluticasone nasal spray may be added.

You need to meet a physician/surgeon and get evaluated. Get an ultrasound abdomen and pelvis to look for gall bladder stones which may be the reason behind upper abdominal pain on the right side. If any other mechanical cause will be visualized in ultrasound. 2. The reason behind bright red blood in stools may be due to straining while passing stools, hard stools or constipation. These result in hemorrhoids or fissure in any which is a very painful condition. Meet the doctor and decide further as your blood test shows high leukocyte count, check for liver function test to look into alkaline phosphatase which helps in knowing the biliary disease.

Sadly to say, however, every antihistamine on the planet causes dry mouth (or makes it worse if you already have dry mouth).Overall, I would advise that the benefits of antihistamines in your situation outweighs the disadvantages. You can always use lozenges, drink plenty of water, or suck on ice chips to help with the dry mouth.You should not hesitate to go to the A & E if your symptoms should worsen.

I ve come to a dead end with my doctor and would really appreciate some help. Let me give you some background: I am asthmatic, but please don t let that occupy your thoughts too much. In 2006 I had Pneumonia and was admitted to Leeds GI for a week. In 2008 I seperated from my wife and moved into a small flat. I wasn t aware for 12 months that there was a wall of mould behind the chest of draws! I had and continue to have a Chest Infection every 2 months since! My main symptoms are the obvious taste and colour of the infection when it comes up. Also a tightness of my chest, making breathing hard, and leading to coughing and choking, now until dizzy, getting a buzzing sentation and disorientation. My doctor goes in circles unsure what the problem is and why the reoccurance of the chest infections. I have had chest xrays (usually by the time they are booked, the infection is gone and xray clear), and have seen a specialist who jumped to the same conclusion of mismanaging my inhalers. This is not the case. The nurse is happy with my meds and how I use them, and how I up the dosage when I have a chest infection. But because the doctor is at a loss, I only get amoxicillen and steroids (the latter are bad for me long term). All I do is go in circles, The chest infections take two courses of antibiotics, and still they do not make me completely better. The infections remain underlying, and the next cold I catch ultimately turns into the next chest infection. This has been my life for over 6 years now, and only since the initial Phenmonia. As a child I had a very weak chest. My mother would walk me to nursery only for me to get there and need to go home as my chest was so tight. I grew out of this with the help of inhalers, and my asthma wasn t much of a problem growing up. These chest infections have only become so frequent since the Phemonia in 2006. I am now at a stage where I feel desperate for someone with fresh eyes and an open mind to look into this, and not just make the wrong assumptions that I don t eat well enough, or know how to take my inhalers... I am 33 (DOB 25/07/80) and know in my heart that if this is allowed to continue without adequate treatment, I face an early death when my chest is older and even weaker. I don t think I can add much more; only that I do take my inhalers correctly, and to make you aware that ALWAYS when I have a chest infection and my chest is tight and breathing difficult, the inhalers DO NOT relieve my chest in any way, but it does feel like it is Asthma - but clearly it isn t. Also when I take a test and breathe into the measure thing to see my lung capacity, it is always remarkably high, which also throws the doctor. With a chest infection I will still score 600 plus. Your help is desperately appreciated.

Apparently, you did not have an allergic reaction in the throat as you can eat, drink and breathe easily. It is therefore, merely an unfounded misapprehension causing acute anxiety. So, just relax.

The headaches can be explained. You can ask your wife to compromise, make a smoke free zone. Or use of mouth freshners after smoking. Avoidance of tobacco from an unknown person is difficult. From a close relative or partner i don't think that should be a problem to the extent to consider a room change. Take simple acetaminophen for the headaches at night.Hope it helps"},{"Patient":"two weeks before my wife went to Chicago to attend a 3 month nclex coaching class and since reached there she feels a shortness of breath every now and then. she doubts probably it happens because of the severe cold weather out there. when she was in texas she never had such problems. so appreciate your help find a solution for this problem. there is OTC inhaler available to help breath well while having such difficulties?","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to either Bronchial asthma or Allergic tracheo-bronchitis.Examination of the throat using a laryngoscope and X ray of the chest will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis.Management includes:1.

If you have not been hospitalised in the past after eating salmon, it is unlikely to cause a severe reaction.

The commonest source would be either a urinary or chest infection. I suggest you take paracetamol for your headache and drink plenty of water. Rest if possible. If you develop any symptoms suggestive of either urinary or chest infection, such as pain on passing urine, loin pain or a cough with sputum, then see you doctor for a possible course of antibiotics. Alternatively, this may be a viral infection which will settle without antibiotics. I wish you a speedy recovery. Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB FRCA"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 54 Year old woman .

This could be a benign nodule or a malignancy (if the radiologist was highly suspicious for a malignancy, then it'd have probably been mentioned to you).

Formoterol- a long acting bronchodilator.Since the medications are administered through inhalation, there is minimal risk of systemic side effects.Long term side effects may include symptoms like Palpitations, fluctuations in blood sugar or lipid profile, hoarseness of voice, oral thrush, etc.If you experience any of the above mentioned side effects, kindly seek medical attention.Alternately you can also use:1. MDI Seroflo 2 puffs twice a day.2. MDI Asthalin 2 puffs during acute episodes.Wishing you a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Recently, I was on the antibiotic, Bactrim, for upper respiratory infection.

Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma.3. Antihistamine preparations like Allegra & Cough expectorant syrup for symptomatic relief.4. A course of antibiotics may be taken to manage secondary bacterial attack.5. Maintain adequate hydration & take a healthy balance diet.6.

Being stressed out/anxious of exams and other college-related stuff would also affect him negatively leading to such problems. I suggest to be close to him and support him, letting him know that you are proud of him whatever results he gets in the exams. If you cannot be close to him, you can ask to get helped by his friends or by medical team (psyco-therapy).

The last immunologist said it was caused by the Copaxone I was on.  Copaxone is an immuno-modifier for MS.  I developed a hypersensitive immune system.   I quit taking Copaxone when I had the complete area I injected into which turned into one solid massive wheal.   This was about 8 years ago.  The fallout was that I had become intolerant to eggs, milk, cheese, tomatoes, oranges, chocolate, seafood.  I was not allergic to any of these foods prior to the Copaxone rejection.   It was supposed to subside.   I also have atypical MS which actually does gets worse from reacting to viruses, such as flu.  After someone had the flu in October 2013, I  instead of getting the flu, I developed chronic urticaria and at times angioedema.   It has become chronic, though not as bad as it was in October - end of November, 2013.  I live in the greater Vancouver area of British Columbia and would dearly love to know if there are any immunologists out there that have experience with this and if there is any immune therapy to settle my system.  I am currently taking Ranitidine as an H2 antihistime and apo-hydroxizine almost daily, depending on when if flairs up.  (usually first thing in the morning then again late at night.).  Hoping there is something out there.   I have MS but cannot tolerate immune-modifying drugs.   I had PLEX as a child when I had nearly died from Henoch Schonlein Purpura and hemocytopenia purpura (age 8 - vomited blood, etc until I was only 20 lbs and was hospitalized at the time).  This probably was the immune modifying setup for developing MS later in life.  I have three questions: 1. Is there a really good immunologist in the vancouver area - even Washington Area? 2. Is there anywhere I can get a PLEX (plasmapheresis) treatment to calm down my system (even privately out of Province)?.   3.  Is it wise for me to take Tecfidera (fumaric acid) if my immune system is already so disturbed from the copaxone.   (I was at emerge 3x in Oct-Nov).   had a benedryl shot at one time.  Was given a prescription for an epipen on another visit.  It is pretty miserable to live with.   thanks for any advice, sincerely, jl","Doctor":"HIThank for asking HCMStop taking the Ranitidine this is known drug that could cause the urticarial rash, instead you can  take \\"Omeprazole 40 mg once in day\\" second increase the dose of hydroxyzine 20 mg three times in day will give good result, Idiopathic skin rash goes on its own later or sooner and you wont be able to notice it, hope this information helps you, have nice day."},{"Patient":"I have a question about nasal congestion - I sneeze all of the time and my nose runs a lot and my nose itches a lot.

Cough is worse in the cold but also seems gerd related.  I'm a mess.

Lifestyle modification- like weight reduction, sleeping on the left side, or with upper body raised.2. Dietary modification- avoid consuming irritating substances such as acidic & rich foods, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.3. Medical management- Proton pump inhibitors like Omeprazole, Pantoprazole,etc. (which prevent acid formation in stomach)4.

I have went for allergy tests for them previous (in the Summer of 2013, see below), but we did not find anything, except an allergy to cats (I do not have cats, and take allergy medication around cats). Since then I have had at least 3 eye reactions (not to cats) but from something unknown that I suspect to be an allergy. 1st reaction - Summer 2013 - symptoms started in the grocery store (went for allergy test after this occurrence - only allergy shown was to cats) 2nd reaction - November 6, 2013 - symptoms started while shopping on Robson Street in Vancouver, Canada (where I live) 3rd reaction - January 4, 2013 - symptoms came during the night and were continuing in the morning. This is the typical reaction: - My eyes both swell, the skin surrounding my eyes swell very large, to the point where they almost cover my eye. If I take an allergy pill it helps somewhat, but does not reduce or stop the swelling altogether. The cause of the swelling is unknown, and has happened both during the day while out shopping (twice), and at home at night (once, the last time). I do not get any nasal reaction, just the reaction in the eyes. Once the swelling goes down (in 3-4 days), I get a rash around my eyes that stays for about 1-2 weeks. I also get some bumps and slight swelling. My eyes also swell more at night during the reaction. The cause of the swelling and rash is unknown at this point. I did not change anything in my makeup or skin care routine during either of these occasions. My food intake is generally healthy, and I cannot think of anything I had out of the ordinary during these occasions. I ve also gotten a forehead rash and a rash under my nose this time (which did not happen last time). It is itchy, red and swollen, and also gets more swollen at night. Yesterday I had blurred vision following a massage. I was laying face down on a massage table for one hour today, and my eyes were more swollen following the massage. I also experienced blurred, distorted vision that last approximately 2 hours after where I felt a bit dissy and off”. They swelled again overnight and the rash also got worse once the swelling went down. It was worse than morning than most, although the first few days of the reaction looked similar to this.

I used it twice a day for a week and then daily for almost a month. And then I had been using it on alternate days for more than a year untill I realised it had some strong steroids. As Ileft using it, the skin beacme red and itchy and flaky too. Anything that I used lead to itching.Then I consulted a homeopathic docctor who suggested aggravating all the allergy and then healing it. As he gave medicines to aggravate it, the face skin turned as if it was burnt. The face gave a burning sensation for four full days; then the skin dried and peeled off. He asked me to just apply coconut oil all over the face.A month went by and things did n't improve. There were a lot of scars /black spots and pimples on my face. I visited another skin specialist and she said it is because I left applying flutave altogether which has some strong steroids. So she said we should slightly switchover to some milder steroids. She suggested using glycerine and rose water for moisturizing skin and using HHzole for a week, then Desowen (Galderma India) for another week and then Clearz Ultra Gel. Now she has asked using Desowen on alternative days and then twice a week. It has been a week that I am using clearzultra gel daily. The skin has started clearing but I am afraid of any further steroids.I want to get rid of any harmful medicines and creams and switch to a usual helathy skin care regime.

If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a stool test for ova and cyst, and a urine routine, microscopic (and a culture sensitivity test if need be) test to rule out a UTI and treat it if positive. In case of a female patient, I would inquire about history of any missed period, and go for an  ultra-sound to rule out an ectopic pregnancy (specially in those who are sexually active) which could give rise to your other symptoms along with the pain on the right lower abdomen. If all these are negative, I would give a serious thinking to the appendix as the culprit, and re assess you clinically followed by a diagnostic laparoscopy if thought necessary. Till then I would prescribe you with an anti spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I discussed the allergy and SVT with my doctor before reading the insert. Now I am having second thoughts about this product.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understand your concern.You can take Suprep.There is much confusion regarding allergy to sulfa-containing drugs, Sulfa, Sulfites, Sulfates and Sulfur.Sulfa allergies are common from medications. Originally the name is from a class of drugs known as sulfonamides but these do differ from medications/foods which contain added sulfites or sulfates.Therefore a patient which is affected by sulfa allergies usually is not affected by the added sulfur-containing drugs, foods or additives or sulfate containing products like ferrous sulfate, magnesium sulfate etc.To date there is no known difficulties any patients seem to show to this group of compounds so a sulfa allergy or a sulfite sensitivity patient should have no problems with magnesium sulfate.However one trial of the drug or skin allergen test can help in establishing the allergic response.As they are the salts of potassium, Sodium and Magnesium and their ions may lead to electrolyte imbalance if you take excess than prescribed.Further it is better to check these electrolytes level and Electrocardiogram before using suprep as you have supra ventricular tachycardia.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I recently used a new body cream that was strawberry flavoured and scented.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understand your concern.We call this Phenomenon as Triple response of lewis.This is due to scratch on the skin.You had scratched the skin due to itching.In allergy, there is a increased release of a chemical called Histamine by Mast cells in our body.This histamine can cause itching and thus you had scratched the skin.This scratching lead to erythema ( redness) due to blood vessel dilation locally and increased permeability in blood vessels.These may look like red and pink dots.This is normal and it can disappear in 30 to 40 minutes, once the histamine is broken down into inactive chemicals.However in more than half of the peoples with high dose of allergens, this may persist and lead to late phase reaction up to 24 hours to 48 hours and then disappears.Thus nothing to worry about, you can wait up to 48 hours.Please take antihistamines like cetrizine and mast cell stabilizers like montelukast.This will help in further release of anti- histamines from mast cells.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"Last Sunday I had severe abdominal pain in the middle of the night and could not subside with any home medicine.

I do get relief by laying on the right side only","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare magic .Since your MRI scan has ruled out any gross CNS pathology , I am of the opinion that you might be suffering from Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo(BPPV ).Let me explain what that would mean ,The hallmark of BPPV is vertigo, i.e. an abnormal sensation of motion (usually spinning), that lasts for a few seconds or up to a minute.The symptoms are brought on by typical head movements, usually neck extension - such as with looking up at a high shelf or at the sky - or rotation to one side. The vertigo will commonly be felt when going to lie down in bed, or when rolling over to one side while in bed, and for this reason it is frequently first noticed at night or upon awakening.It spontaneously abates if the provocative position is maintained statically for a period of time (usually 30-60 seconds). For this reason, it should more accurately be called “positioning” vertigo, not “positional” vertigo, since it is movement into the position, not maintenance of the position, that provokes the symptoms.BPPV is thought to be caused by displacement of otoliths (mineral crystals) from the vestibule of the inner ear into the semicircular canals.You should see an ENT specialist who would perform simple clinical tests and manoeuvres to treat your condition .Cervical spondylosis can cause general dizziness rather than the 'spinning ' of vertigo .The allergies that you described do not have  a direct link with your vertigo .I hope that was helpful .Thanks ."},{"Patient":"daughter has what we think are sensitive nerve endings in her stomach.

I am certain that he will agree with me and prescribe the advised drugs in appropriate doses.If you find my response helpful and informative, do not forget an “excellent” (5-star rating)  to my answer, to ENCOURAGE ALL doctors- engaged in social service- to render sound advice to the FREE queries.

Not  smoking for the last 20 years, semi retire, 63 years old, walking four times a week, other ways healthy.","Doctor":"Hello, The symptoms described by you are typical of a condition called \\"post nasal drip\\". As the name suggests that there are certain secretions from the back of your nose that are trickling down into your throat provoking cough especially when you lie down or sit for long time. This is seen commonly individuals with nasal and respiratory allergies like you have described (sneezing and asthma like symptoms). Since the root cause of your cough is nasal secretion that should be the target of treatment. You could try the following: 1) Plain steam inhalation twice a day especially after you come back home from outside and also before going to bed. After taking steam for 10-15 mins clear your nose and hawk and cough out the phlegm in your throat. This will help preventing nasal allergies as well as night cough. Steaming can be continued indefinitely as it is a natural remedy. 2) Anti histaminics like cetrizine before bedtime will prevent nasal secretions and prevent sleep disturbances. 3) you could also try out steroid based nasal sprays containing fluticasone or mometasone. These are very effective in reducing nasal hypersensitivity to whatever induces you allergies, thus reducing sneezing,postnasal drip and cough. However these sprays need to used with caution keeping certain medical conditions in mind. Hence please consult a physician for the same. 4) please take precautionwhen going outside like using protective masks to prevent dust inhalation. As for the breathing difficulty you need to see a repiratory physician and do necessary tests to determine whether these asthamatic episodes are allergic or not and whether you require inhalers. Hope this helps.

A lot of sinus drainage, no fever but I never run fever if my temp gets to 98 then I feel feverish.","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query.Nasal allergy to mold and probably, several other allergens, is the root cause of your problems. You should take anti-allergic drugs regularly THROUGHOUT the year! Adding Montelukast + Levoceterizine + Azelastin nasal spray to your prescription will reduce you symptoms by around 90%!!The recent onset of productive cough, laryngitis, headache is due to acute Strep infection. A course of antibiotics + anti-inflammatory drug + frequent gargles with strong saline and, steam inhalation will improve your condition. Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me, order required tests, and- based on the reports-  will prescribe suitable/modified treatment as advised.If you find my response helpful and informative, do not forget an “excellent” (5-star rating)  to my answer, to ENCOURAGE ALL doctors- engaged in social service- to render sound advice to the FREE queries.

I've been advised to move south.Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM .I shall try to give general self help tips to the best of my knowledge and experience ,as you are already on medication for asthma .Asthma is an allergic condition which can be affected by stress, diet , exercise , lifestyle and atmospheric conditions .While there is not much you can do to change the atmospheric conditions ,still wearing masks and wearing appropriate clothing to keep you warm would help .There are certain blood tests (comprehensive allergy tests ) which can also help in finding out the specific allergens to which you are highly sensitive and thus help in managing the allergy betterYour diet can also play a significant role in aggravating asthma . Occasionally, people with asthma may have food-based allergic triggers and will need to avoid foods such as cows' milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, yeast products, nuts, and some food colorings and preservatives.So test and try each individual item for a week and see if it makes  a perceptible change .Including more ginger , garlic and green tea has been shown to help .Regular exercise like brisk walks or indoor exercises(when weather is not compatible ) which improve your heart rate and respiratory rate will alos contribute to better control of asthma episodes.Meditation and deep breathingexercises alos help in reducng stress induced asthma episodes .Avoid smoking ,passive and active both .I am a homoeopathic practitioner and I have seen good results with homoeopathic treatment in improving pulmonary function in acute asthma .So if you have a Homoeopath around your place ,you can give  homoeopathy a try besides the above tips ."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I have a rash on my neck, that is slowly getting worse.

I ve been on numorous antibiotics over the course of this happening 6 weeks ago. They did a ultra sound and said I had a cyst rupture a few weeks ago. I have another ultra sound n 2 weeks but the pain is just tolerable","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would advise  you for a urine routine/microscopic and culture sensitivity test before starting any antibiotic which could be changed later to the right one after the report of urine test was ready. With the proper antibiotic for 10-12 days the UTI should be relieved unless someone gets it repeatedly specially if sexually active. The persistent pain could also be due to the rupture of the cyst with spillage of fluid inside the pelvic cavity. At the same time one has to keep in mind appendix as an offending organ which could be missed and create problem. If no conclusion is reached for a persisting pain abdomen, then a diagnostic/therapeutic laparoscopy could be the solution.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Do you have any suggestions for me and if it were to be that I could have broken a rib what can be done for me? sorry the first page I clicked on said free.....","Doctor":"Hi,From history it seems that you might be having pleuritic pain due to infection in the lungs or there might be having muscle strain due to severe coughing.Having fracture of ribs due to severe coughing is less likely.Go for higher antibiotic medicine course after consulting your doctor.Meanwhile take some analgesic, muscle relaxant tablet for pain.Take some cough suppressant syrup as well.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"hi.. i had septorhinoplasty some time ago but still expeience breathing difficulty thru my left nostril. i can do heavy weights as a result of this. at night i need to sleep on my left side so that i can breath better.. the GP said it could be a result of underlying allergies before surgery that are causing a proplase?","Doctor":"1. new study suggests:      10% of Septo-Rhinoplasty patients have permanent decrease in nasal airflow after surgery which means it is very common to experience decreased breathing for the first 3-6 months after Septo-Rhinoplasty surgey. 2. After the internal swelling has decreased breathing will improve.Keep in mind that patients will recover at their own healing rates. Recovery will also depend on the extent of the surgery performed.However, your surgeon will recommend that you focus your attention on healing instead of doing other activities."},{"Patient":"I have apparently developed an allergy to something that has gradually been getting worse over the past several weeks.

I can t lean back against a chair or seat or my back goes itchy crazy. I gave tried wearing different types of fabric but that doesnt seem to matter either. Hydrocortisone cream provides some relief but not a lot. I have not changed my diet or had anything new that I can pinpoint.

But it can reduce the amount of blood loss during menstruation. That is why, it is also used to treat menorrhagia in which there is heavy menstrual bleeding.

Is it normal for asthmatics to have high red blood cell count because of the breathing ?","Doctor":"Hello dear,High red blood cell count in asthmatics can be explained by the following reason:1. In asthmatics, there is obstruction to the smaller airways of the respiratory tract.2. Due to this, there decreased availability of oxygen to the tissues.3. Depletion of Oxygen in quantity or molecular concentration results in a state of Hypoxia.4. This hypoxia is sensed by few specialized cells in the Kidney & they produce a hormone called Erythropoietin.5.

Depending on the clinical response, and immunological response, usually captured through immunoglobulin E levels, a decision is then made.

I have to take allergy medication and have a shower asap. If I don't change straight away it gets worst. what can be done so I can still enjoy the sea and swimming with my kids.Paul","Doctor":"Hi,I can understand your concern for itchy red skin with hive like spots after swimming.I can get from query that you are suffering from Aquagenic Urticaria or water induced hives. It is a common condition caused by bursting of allergy producing cells known as \\"mast cells\\" due to certain aggravating factors present in the environment.As the chemical inside them is released it produces a rash which you have mentioned. As you know very well the best part is staying away from aggravating factor. But other than this the long term effective treatment for this is by oral anti histamine like loratadine under medical advise. It is one of the drug which is not having any side effects and can be taken for long term usage. You can take loratadine daily or preferably few hours before swimming.Take care."},{"Patient":"My 6 year old son is having trouble swallowing his saliva.

Consult ENT doctor for examination, Nasal endoscopy is useful to check for sinus, once sinus problem is ruled out, other probable cause is vasomotor rhinitis, which is basically due to dilatation of blood vessel in nose causing symptoms.Saline nasal spray, decongestants are useful, If your symptoms are not controlled with these measures then corticosteroid nasal sprays, antihistamine nasal sprays  useful.Correction of any deviated septum, if present , is helpful in avoiding recurrence. If you are able to identify what causes your symptoms it may be possible to avoid these triggers, such as perfumes, secondhand smoke, dust, etc. Avoiding these triggers will reduce your symptoms and discomfort.You should also avoid overusing nasal decongestants.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Udiliv is a drug which is supposed to dissolve the gall stones. However, this is not a 100% cure for it. Even though the pancreatic enzymes have come out to be within the normal range or of decreasing level, there possibly is a suspicion of pancreatitis by your treating physician, and also to know the complete anatomy of biliary tree along with the pancreatic duct, an ERCP is advised. This would be a near confirmatory investigation to rule out the biliary tree and the pancreatic system as the cause of your abdominal pain. ERCP could also be of therapeutic nature if the sludge/calculi in any of the biliary tree is endoscopic-ally removed.

If I were your doctor, I would insist you for avoiding any alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do. Alcohol could cause a peptic ulcer disease, liver inflammation and the deadly pancreatitis apart from other systemic manifestations. I would also advise you for a CBC, a serum amylase and lipase, a liver function test, blood sugar, and an ultrasound/CT scan of the abdomen to know the status of intra abdominal organs specially the pancreas and biliary system including the gall bladder. Till then I would advise you with a proton pump inhibitor, and an anti spasmodic for a symptomatic relief during the pain. Further management would depend on the result of clinical assessment and related investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have been experiencing coughing, running nose, and difficulty breathing in the past 3-4 weeks. Yes, I'm still smoking. I have been taking my medication rescue breathing inhaler. What cause you suggest so those symptoms can go away?","Doctor":"Emphysema is an irreversible disease and is hard to manage. Asthma on the other hand is episodic and can be fairly managed with inhalers. Coexistence of the both is uncommon. In a smoker, cough and breathlessness almost always represent obstructive pulmonary disease, one of which is emphysema. Anyway, you should first stop smoking and start trying breathing exersice, which can help in emphysema. Avoiding allergens and cold exposure can limit asthmatic episodes, which can show reversibility with the inhalers you are on. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, im 32 years old guy.

Although it needs a physical examination of your abdomen with related investigations like a CBC and an ultrasound abdomen, with the history, it could be a simple abdominal muscle spasm due to the chronic cough of yours. However, I would also go for an X ray chest to rule out any chances of a pleurisy (inflammation of the covering lining of the lungs) due to a lung infection. In this case it should get alright with an anti inflammatory along with a proton pump inhibitor drug and the specific treatment targeted towards the original cause. If the pain and tenderness increases or persists, then I would advise you to take an opinion from a general surgeon in your area for further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.I hope your gynaecologist must have performed a P/V examination of yours to rule out a prolapse of post hysterectomy vaginal vault, which is not uncommon. This could also give rise to the dragging pressure sensation and non responsive discharge per vagina. Not infrequently post op adhesions of the remaining pelvic organs could also give rise to pressure symptoms in the lower abdomen.

I have tried levocetrizine and many more anti-histamine drugs without any long lasting remedy.

Basically what i mean is if you feel you need to  do two things:1-find the allergen(could be dust mites,pollen,aerosols such a deodorants room freshener etc,strong odors and so on)There are tests which can tell you which allergen you are allergic to but much simpler way is to maintain a log book for a month,and you can review the same to figure out.2-I see that you are diabetic,so by default diabetics are commonly more susceptible to respiratory viruses,these are self relapsing but then a episode can give u flu like symptoms too,so to maintain proper hygiene is ideal.I would recommend you to stay away from unhygienic water and places.All said and done,you are advised to prevent an episode by the above methods,and in case of a episode best combination would be montelukast and levocetrizine tablets twice daily if its bad(optimally once before bedtime) and with steam inhalation(should not be very hot as too hot can also cause irritation to the nasal mucosa)Last but not least,the diet-avoid poultry and stored yogurt.Every day morning have luke warm water with a half lemon and honey.

I am 29 y/o one positive pap for hpv 5 years ago, all negative since, every 6 months.  currently i do not have insurance and am a full time student and do not know what to do.","Doctor":"Hi dear,Most patients with ovarian cysts are asymptomatic but in some patients they can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bowel disturbance, frequent urination, indigestion etc depending upon the size of the cysts and the pressure that the cyst impose on the adjacent organ.Another chances for your problem is ovarian tortion and cyst rupture as you have cysts diagnosed.Tortion is the twisting of ovarian pedicil which cause to decrease or obstruct  the vascular supply to ovary and cause infarction. Cyst rupture is another condition: it is characterised by sudden sharp pelvic pain, usually specific to one side. Abdominal trauma and anti-coagulation medicine are the risk factors for this, so if you had history of abdominal trauma we can suspect this.All the above can be diagnosed using appropriate imaging studies. So if you have severe pain you can discuss with your doctor , from there you will be guided after a final diagnosis. You should continue the HPV monitoring as you are doing now.With thanks"},{"Patient":"hi I m in my early 50 s female and I m having outbreaks of swelling and itching on my body.

Is there something I can do for that, or do I just have to wait it out?","Doctor":"Unfortunately there is no medication to reduce the fluid and pressure behind your ears. Sometime with allergies you can get these problems. If you are having nose blocks very often you can try steroid Nasal spray (like Flixonase or Nasonex). For allergies it is best to use regular antihistamines. Best to avoid long term use of nasal decongestants as this can cause rebound swelling of the lining in your nose and worsen nose blocks.If you are getting frequent symptoms, use antihistamines only. Losartin can cause nasal congestion."},{"Patient":"hi dr santosh my name is elizabeth and i have a child who is 3years+ and she is having some seroius sickness which i am not sure about my child is sick right now and is wheezing alot and i took her to the doctor and was given Asthalin syrup i want to know if my child have asthma","Doctor":"Child of this age group can have wheezing when they get common cold or viral upper respiratory infections. If there is a history of allergies, eczema (dry skin) or previous episodes of wheezing, family history of asthma/allergy in 1st degree relation there is a chance then she may develop asthma. Child of 3 yrs have other reasons for wheezing, so we do not diagnose asthma unless if she meets the above criteria. If she develops wheezing, best way to treat is to use Asthalin as a Inhaler with a Spacer device and face mask (Zerostat+Mask). If she is having frequent episodes it is best to add a steroid based inhaler on daily basis (Becorite or Flohale 50).

No diarrhea but I do feel lighty feverish. I get light sharp pains in the upper right quadrant every once in a while and my chest feels tight and a light burning sensation. Does this warrant a trip to the ER?","Doctor":"Hi dear, It will be better to discuss with a gastroenterologist.Abdominal pain have different etiology. You have to give us some more details to differentiate them. Your pain is from upper mid section means it is related to lower esophagus,stomach,parts of small intestine,pancreas,transverse colon,abdominal aorta.Burning sensation indicates it has some relation to stomach and esophagus.Nausea and vomiting ; projectile vomiting from obstruction or toxicity. Others may be appendicitis, pancreatitis ,hepatitis.If you are vomiting soon after food intake it may be from gastric ulcer or upper gastro intestinal obstruction.You had just mentioned that you have no diarrhoea,but is there a satisfactory bowel? If not indicates chances of obstruction.Fever suggests infection. These all are the possibilities. Hence there are several factors to consider before final diagnosis I suggest to discuss with an gastroenterologist if symptoms persist. In my opinion your symptoms may be from gastric ulcer or appendicitis as it is epigastric, increase with eating or drinking, nausea, vomiting and small temperature.With thanks, take care"},{"Patient":"Hi my doctor did blood tests for allergies on my child and said her hemoglobin is high what does this really mean.He also said her food allergy test for milk, egg white, penuts, wheat and fish are moderate does this mean she can have these without a problem?","Doctor":"I exactly want to know the amount of hemoglobin and you no need to avoid that food  as it is very difficult to avoid this if previously exposed to that food. if she is having any reaction like rash ,wheezing after exposing to such food better avoid it as it will cause serious reactions sometime.can I know the age ,weight,height of your kid"},{"Patient":"sir iam suffering from nasal blockage persistent cough  running nose sneezing for last 4year  ihave taken pulmigen oral tab 10 tab ina month for 3 month and completed in SEP 13 but in mid nov 13 i am having above mention problem  again  what to do now","Doctor":"Hi,    It seems to me that you are suffering from allergic rhinitis.

This type of pain will worsen at the time of periods only and will subside with in maximum 3 days.If your nature of pain doesn't match with this you may have to do an abdominal ultrasound scan to find out what it is.For mittelshmerz you can have the following medicine,1.

On 11/13/13  I was prescribed amoxicillin 500mg 1every 12 hrs.,  benzonatate 100 mg 1 capsale every 8hrs as needed, and methylprenisolone 4mg dosepk.  My BP was 161/90 at the dr.s office that night after taking meds my BP went up to 161/101.  I contacted my dr who instructed me to go to ER.  I was given a intravenous steroid, 2 clonidine hcl 0.1 mg and a respitory treatment.  Coughing continued and I followed up with my dr. on 11/18/13.  She prescribed Flovent FHA 110mg 2 puffs twice daily,avelox 400mg daily.Upon taking the avelox I started experiencing pain, tightness of my chest, as well as extreme tiredness. I also was experiencing a burning in my chestthroat after taking clonidine as well as exhaustion. Today I called my dr. To inform her that I could not continue to take the avelox as I felt like I was going to have a heart attack and that I could only handle taking the clonidine once during the day only for reasons explained.  She now prescribed amlodipine 5mg and doxycycline 100mg.  The coughing continues, I was not told I have a virus, nor am I wheezing. It is a dry cough and it started in sept. I was treated with antibiotics and benzonanatate plus using pro-air hfa 90mcg1-2 puffs every 4 hrs as needed.  I began feeling better but cough would come back upon exertion or laughing. I started uncontrollable coughing again two woks ago but with all this med. I am not feeling like I am improving. Can you help to explain what I'm going through and what I can do to stop the coughing.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Health Care magic,Usually in Asthma , there is no need for Antibiotics ( Amoxycillin, Avelox,  Doxycycline) and Cough Suppressant ( Benzonatate). Methyl prednisolone, can be used for Asthma Exacernations, as an emergency treatment for Asthma. This prednisolone can cause Hypertension.  I do not know, why did your Doctor started Clonidine? If at all there was need for BP medicines,  Clonidine is not the preferred BP medicine for Asthma patients. Avelox can cause chest pain, gastritis, and exhaustion. I think that your continuous coughing is due to uncontrolled Asthma. Asthma does not cause only wheezing, dry cough is also one of the common symptoms of Asthma. Cough on exertion suggests that it is due to Asthma. According to your question, I feel that you are not getting 100 percent control of Asthma. You do not need any Antibiotics, Cough Syrup and Anti-hypertensive medicines. You need to get proper understanding of Asthma management, proper use of Relieving and Preventive Inhaler, avoid smoking, and other allergens.  This answer is not based on clinical examination, so please go and see your Doctor again, and try to understand what is his exact diagnosis, and what are your trigger factors, and how to get 100 % control of Asthma. If you are really a case of Asthma, you should have such a good management plan, that you should have never any such attack .Wish you good recovery.Dr H Hamdani"},{"Patient":"Hello...I have not been able to pinpoint the reason I break out into a lumpy rash on face, legs, arms.

When a patient is exposed to the allergy causing agent the first time, it usually doesnt cause a significant reaction.

They kept me overnight to observe and check blood and blood pressure.

Over the past couple of weeks I started to wheeze after taking my medication. I have asthma, and can't take NSAIDs because they give me asthma symptoms also. Percocet is now giving me the same asthma symptoms so I  need to come off of it ASAP. I am going to call my PM doctor tomorrow in the meantime I am taking Benadryl and mucinex with the Percocet to combat the asthma symptoms. Has anyone else ever been in this situation? If yes, what did your doctor do for you? I have a host of serious medical problems so I know I can't detox on my own. My addiction to Percocet is purely physical, I have no psychological attachment to the drug which hopefully will work in my favor. Do you think I will need to detox in a facility/hospital etc...? Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help.","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to Health care magic forum.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.As you have got almost all the tests done for your problem, I would advise you for the following few:1)In case you eat from outside, I feel that you may be sensitive/allergic to gluten, which is found in many fast foods containing wheat, pasta, etc. This is not easy to diagnose, and the best way is to exclude all kinds of fast food you consume in outside eating joints (if this is the case with you).It is best to have home cooked food with more of roughage or carry the same with you if you are busy. Gluten sensitivity can give rise to all the symptoms you have described. Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do.I suggest you to consult a gastro-enterologist along with a dietician on this aspect of the diagnosis, which possibly might not have been considered until now. The gastro-enterologist will be able to diagnose with few biochemical tests along with a possible repeat endoscopy with biopsy of the intestinal mucosal wall, while the dietician can guide you on your food that you can consume pleasantly. Also there is a need to exclude co-existing amoebiasis which is very common globally and treat it if positive by a stool test for ova and cyst.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

I have this allergy every year and it lasts several weeks.  Previous to that I had a cold.  Recently I had a CT scan to see if there were any blockages in my heart.  My heart is fine, no blockages.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Incisional hernias are more common in a vertical incision for a ceasserian section than in transverse incisions. Pain in the scar does not necessarily mean that you got an incisional hernia, but could be a pointer towards a increased intra abdominal pressure stretching the scar, which might in the long run result in a hernia. So if I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid any kind of work that increases the intra abdominal pressure, get your cough treated at the earliest, avoid constipation for similar reasons, and try to reduce weight (if overweight) by regular routine exercise. In addition, you might consider wearing an abdominal binder which would give some kind of support whenever you are upright, and would protect at the time of increasing intra abdominal pressure. To know precisely if you got a recurrent hernia or not, I would advise you to get it assessed clinically by your doctor.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef."},{"Patient":"Hi,my name is John, I'm 26. Ever since my childhood, I've had bloodshot eyes whenever I got a really bad cold, but the eye problem would only happen for an evening or two, when my cold culminated. It's been a while since that happened for the last time, probably a year or two. I've had a bit of running nose every now and then since, but nothing serious, not even irritating. Years ago, I was also tested for all kinds of allergies because of the eyes problem, but the tests were all negative and together with my doctor we came to a conclusion, that red eyes probably occur because of the shape of my sinuses, that causes pressure on some nerve or glands, when there's swelling... I must confess I wasn't very happy with that conclusion, because for me it meant that there's not much I can do about it.For the past weeks I've been feeling something like a mild sore throat. With the autumn coming I occasionally got runny nose and I thought it would become a cold, but nothing developed. Last week, my nose began to feel more stuffed and the red eyes problem occured in the worst way ever and for the longest period ever - today is the fifth day. Also my sinuses (forehead and cheek) feel stuffed. So I went to see a different doctor today (because I don't live in the same city anymore), she took a look (a brief one, I might say) into my mouth and nose and listened to my heartbeat on my back and diagnosed me with allergic rhinitis (to house dust). I told her that the symptoms aren't new and that I'd been tested before because of them, but she said that these tests are not exhaustive and conclusive and that it must be rhinitis. Other symptoms that might lead her to that conclusion were that there was very little mucus and it was only watery.She gave me some pills, a nasal spray and eyedrops. What concerns me is that the feeling in my face points towards sinuses, which I am obviously not treating now. Or is it possible that the rhinitis treatment will \\"free\\" the sinuses too? On a general note, I would prefer the doctor to explain what's going on with me a bit more thoroughly (like the lovely debates I have with my dentist, who explains me the conditions, materials, problems in treatment etc.). Thank you for your oppinion!","Doctor":"i think ure atopic which means u have allergy in genes thats why the symptoms are recurring again and again...testing negative for allergens does not necessarily exclude atopy...there are fleshy masses i our noses known in medical language as turbinates when ever we are exposed to cold or any allergin these fleshy mases swell up blocking our nose and at the same time blocking the drainage opening of our different sinuses and also drainage opening of nasolacrimal duct(through which the tears from our eyes empty into our nose) as a result tears cannot empty into the nose and u have watery eyes due to tear stasis....getting treatment for allegy like nasal decongestant tablets,sprays and steroid sprays would definatly empty ure sinsuses and relieve ure symptoms....u can also go for FESS(functional endoscopic sinus surgery if u have thickened mucosa of ure sinuses on MRI of ure paranasal sinuses..."},{"Patient":"Hello i am a 25 year old male and i am leaving for a vacation trip to Hawaii tomorrow.

Ple help as my daily life is now badly affected. Yes sleeping makes it worse. I do breathing exercises but it is not helping. Regards................MeenakshiThanks","Doctor":"Hello Meenakshi,Thanks for posting on HCM,Your symptoms are suggestive of an upper respiratory tract affection and I suspect either one of two most common conditions that cause these kind of symptoms i.e allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. How ever, both conditions require thorough medical evaluation (with ruling out of other conditions too) and both also require different treatments.A specialist doctor such as an ENT will be best suited to run a complete medical exams and therefore provide you with treatment.The management of allergic rhinitis consists of 3 major categories of treatment- environmental control measures and allergen avoidance- Pharmacological management- ImmunotherapyNow, these may seem to be big words, but be rest assured that you can handle the situation at your level. First of all, you will need to identify by yourself if they are any new elements in your life that might be provoking any allergies i.e identifying common allergens. Common allergens include pollens and outdoor molds, indoor allergens such as dust mites, animal allergens, cockroach etc. You will need to see if any are responsible, then you try avoiding them.Immunotherapy is only indicated in case medical therapy fails. There are a wide range of medications available with commonly used classes being antihistamines (1st and 2nd generations) such as cetirizine, loratadine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine etc, corticosteroids such as prednisone, and anticholinergics etc. Chronic sinusitis, on the other hand, requires in addition to some of the above treatments, antimicrobial therapy such as penicillin, cephalosporins, macrolides etc. Your doctor should be able to indicate the right treatment ones a conclusion as to the exact cause of your symptoms is derived.hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello,My son (male, age 7 years) is taking Beudecort 100 Rotacaps from the past two years for once a day. The moment he stops, within 2-3 days he starts wheezing and mild coughing. Is the use of this medicine(steroid) effect him in long run? what are the diagnosis which can be done, as his general physician says he has Childhood Asthma.","Doctor":"Hello,thanks for posting on HCM,I understand that this must be a very troubling situation for your. But what you need to understand is that the underlying causes of childhood asthma are not fully understood by the medical community. Developing an overly sensitive immune system generally plays a role. Some factors thought to be involved include:- Genetic inheritance- Certain childhood respiratory tract infection in early childhood- A child who is exposed to certain extreme environmental factors such as cigarette smoking.  Increased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to swell and produce mucus when exposed to certain triggers. Reaction to a trigger may be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the trigger. These triggers vary from child to child and can include:- Viral infections such as the common cold- Exposure to air pollutants, such as tobacco smoke- Allergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen or mold- Physical activity- Weather changes or cold airSometimes, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers. As child will get matured, his lungs will become much more mature and the frequency of crisis will be less but that does not mean that the asthma has been dissolved. You will need to know that asthma is a chronic condition and only requires child being on regular treatment. I do not think that being on low dose corticosteroid will not be of any harm to your child and other medications (such as bronchodilators) will be used instead to replace the steroid.

I seem to be salivating excessively and am continually swallowing . I have taken a Piriteze tablet about 1 hour ago, and have just taken a 2nd tablet. I suddenly decided it might be an allergy and am trying to diagnose what caused it. Although sometimes reacting to dust and obviously mould, I did pull leaves of a house plant called (I think) dragon tree. I thus consulted the internet and it appears that this plant can cause an allergic reaction . The plants leaves were dried up and all shrivelled. Would this still have been the cause of my reaction. Luckily the excess saliva is settling down and the need to swallow so frequently has too. Was it the plant do you think.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicAlmost anything can cause an allergic reaction. This is because persons react differently to plants, animals, environmental stimulants (eg dust, pollen, perfume odours), medications, food.What may provoke a reaction in one person may not do so in another.Allergic reactions can present in different ways, the most common ways are skin rash, swelling, post nasal drip of mucus, itching, difficulty breathing. In the case of foods some persons may have vomiting or diarrhoea, indigestion.Excess salivation is not a common presentation of allergies though everyone is different. If you are noting a decrease in symptoms with the use of the medication then it is possible that it was an allergic response.It would be difficult , however, to say what you are allergic to.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"i have sinus allergies year around, and recently been treated for silent reflux.

Deviated septum, hypertrophied turbinates, sinusoidal polyp & other findings as observed in CT scan are all related to each other.2.

But, unless the underlying cause is treated, symptoms will keep recurring.4. You might have to take medications life long for this & have to suffer their side effects, while the mucosal changes may aggravate further to cause irreparable damage.5.

Do u know a very good ENT / plastic Surgen in Las Vegas NV? and a very good asthma/Immunology so I can stop suffering.Thank you,Natasha","Doctor":"Hello Natasha, Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic. I am a Homoeopath and so I am giving you some different thoughts. Finally I will show to you a different path towards natural health. The way to health according to Homoeopathy is entirely different from that of conventional medicine. You have travelled a long way along the path of conventional medicine and still asking for help when you lose your way there. It is a pity to know that you have not understood that you have lost your way. This is not your fault; you have not come to know that there is another path to real cure. You have asthma, allergies, puffy face, sinus pain, headache, deviated septum etc.  Please think about the time when you had simple allergic rhinitis followed by asthma. It was a genetic and constitutional feature of your constitution. It was not cured. You took suppressive chemical drugs. Your doctor gave you drugs to suppress the cry of nature demanding cure, because your constitution is not healthy enough to manage by itself. Instead of getting a cure, your sneezing, running nose, wheezing , cough etc, simple symptoms to start with,  were suppressed to make you more sick. In the next stage you had sinus affections, headache, deviated septum etc. with  more serious symptoms. Then also you got nasal spray, antibiotics and steroids from the side of specialists of conventional medicine. Your condition went from bad to worse. Now you know that they have spoiled your nose and what you do not know is the puffy face is the complication of steroids or because the drugs have damaged your kidneys and you are going to be seriously sick if the same plan of treatment is continued . Now you are asking for other more expert specialists of the conventional medicine itself! Please understand that the whole problems are created by the defect of their approach and not of the individuals. Another ENT will give you stronger drugs. Plastic surgeon will repair your damaged nose, asthma specialist will give you more stronger spray or inhaler. None of these approaches is curative or natural. They all work against nature and make you more sick. There is another path to cure that is the path of Homoeopathy. In Homoeopathy there is no chemical drugs. Only dynamic potentized remedies are there. They are individualistic and the selection of your curative remedy is based on your genetics and constitution. They help the constitution to become stronger to fight the allergens without producing any worse situation than what you have. Therefore you are advised to approach an expert Homoeopathic physician with your detailed case history, past history, family history, life situations, your mental and physical make ups etc. Or you can approach me through the premium follow up question facility of Healthcare magic and I am prepared to help you to enjoy the real natural health from now onwards. With Best Wishes,Dr C. J. Varghese,Homoeopath,drcjvarghese@gmail.com."},{"Patient":"Two weeks ago, my 12 (5'7 and 140 lbs) year old daughter was diagnosed with Asthma and Pneumonia by an asthma specialist.  She tested at a 45% lung function.  Took Biaxin.  Switched to both Amox TR-K CLV 875-125 mg tab and Amoxicilin 500 mg tabs 5 days later because not improving.  Also, took Prednisone, and a few days later Singulair and Mucinex were added.  Dr. sent her to lab to draw blood. 4 days later (this past weekend), she develops the flu and is vomiting, headache, stomach ache. Went back to dr. today.  Lab results were fine.  No mono, but he said it's probably a virus that looks like Mono.  This was today.  Her lung function was at 68% and the dr. said her lungs sounded pretty good.  He said she may have acid reflux and added Pepcid AC to her medications and that her chest may hurt from the vomiting the day before. She is still extremely lethargic, suffering chest pain in the center of her chest, stomach pain, no appetite, headache at her temples, and she says it hurts to breath in and out.  I can barely get her to stay awake to eat a cracker and take her medicine.  Any help or advice?!  I have never seen her so extremely tired.  She says she not hungry and can't eat even a cracker.","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query.From the details provided, It appears to be either, involvement of the cavity wall around the lungs (following Pneumonia); or, spasm of the muscles between the ribs (secondary to flu). These conditions cause typical chest pain while breathing in and out.Further, you treating doctor is probably right in suspecting acid reflux (drug-induced). However, addition of prokinetic drug (to Pepcid AC), such as domperidone will relieve her of nausea, loss of appetite and central chest pain.You have not mentioned if your daughter ahs been having frequent attacks of flu-like symptoms in the past. If this is true, then her recently-diagnosed asthma is allergic in nature and will therefore benefit tremendously with regular anti-allergics (such as, Montelukast) plus anti-histaminics (such as Ceterizine). Headache is apparently due to acute sinusitis, as part of flu syndrome. Headache and chest pains will be relieved with a short course of NSAIDs (anti-inflammatory/pain killers) such as ibuprofen + paracetamol combination.The extreme tiredness is due to viral infection which usually saps the entire energy from the body. Please give her milk/soup with nutrients and protein-rich powder + glucose and plenty of fluids, so that she gets adequate calories and nutrition.Please do not worry ; she will improve very soon. You may consult her treating doctor and discuss the above-mentioned course of action with him, so that he prescribes the said medicines in appropriate doses.Dr. Rakesh Karanwal"},{"Patient":"I suffer from seasonal allergies,for years I used sinex nasal spray & my congestion would open up my nasal.
