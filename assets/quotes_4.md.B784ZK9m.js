Since g(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), g'(x) = xe^x - me^x + m + 1 geq 0 must hold true for all x in (2, +infty).Thus, we have:m leq frac{xe^x + 1}{e^x - 1} for all x in (2, +infty).Let's consider h(x) = frac{xe^x + 1}{e^x - 1}, quad text{for } x in (2, +infty).The derivative of h(x) ish'(x) = frac {e^{2x}-xe^x - 2e^x}{(e^x-1)^2} = frac {e^x(e^x - x - 2)}{(e^x-1)^2}.Define L(x) = e^x - x - 2 and find its derivative:L'(x) = e^x - 1 > 0, quad text{for all } x in (2, +infty),which implies that L(x) is strictly increasing on (2, +infty).

It cannot have more, because 0+1+2+3+4=10.Three-digit numbers:3=1+24=1+35=1+4=2+36=1+5=2+47=1+6=2+5=3+48=1+7=2+6=3+59=1+8=2+7=3+6=4+5This gives 16 possibilities. However, the order of the second and third digits can be arbitrary, so there are a total of 16 * 2 = 32 interesting three-digit numbers.For four-digit numbers, we have all 16 combinations as in the three-digit numbers because we can add the addend 0 (e.g., 6=0+2+4), and we have 7 additional possibilities:6=1+2+37=1+2+48=1+2+5=1+3+49=1+2+6=1+3+5=2+3+4This gives a total of 16+7=23 different sums. Each sum yields six interesting numbers because the digits (except the first) can be permuted. Therefore, the total number of interesting four-digit numbers is 23 cdot 6 = 138.For five-digit numbers, combinations without 0 are not possible, because 1+2+3+4>9.Thus, we have the same 7 possibilities as for four-digit numbers without zero, and in each possibility, we add 0 (e.g., 8=0+1+3+4).Each sum yields 24 interesting numbers because the last 4 digits can be arranged in 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1 = 24 ways.

Therefore, the equation of ellipse E is frac{{x}^{2}}{8}+ frac{{y}^{2}}{4}=1.(II) Assume there exists a circle centered at the origin such that any tangent line to this circle intersects with ellipse E at two points A,B, and OA perp OB. Let the equation of this tangent line be y=kx+m.Solving the system of equationsbegin{cases}y=kx+m frac{{x}^{2}}{8}+ frac{{y}^{2}}{4}=1end{cases}we obtain x^{2}+2(kx+m)^{2}=8, which simplifies to (1+2k^{2})x^{2}+4kmx+2m^{2}-8=0.For this quadratic equation to have real solutions, its discriminant must be non-negative: Delta = 16k^{2}m^{2}-4(1+2k^{2})(2m^{2}-8)=8(8k^{2}-m^{2}+4) > 0, which implies 8k^{2}-m^{2}+4 > 0.Denoting A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}), we havebegin{cases}x_{1}+x_{2}=- frac{4km}{1+2k^{2}} x_{1}x_{2}= frac{2m^{2}-8}{1+2k^{2}}end{cases}andy_{1}y_{2}=(kx_{1}+m)(kx_{2}+m)=k^{2}x_{1}x_{2}+km(x_{1}+x_{2})+m^{2}= frac{k^{2}(2m^{2}-8)}{1+2k^{2}}- frac{4k^{2}m^{2}}{1+2k^{2}}+m^{2}= frac{m^{2}-8k^{2}}{1+2k^{2}}.In order to have OA perp OB, we need x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=0, which leads to frac{2m^{2}-8}{1+2k^{2}}+ frac{m^{2}-8k^{2}}{1+2k^{2}}=0. This simplifies to 3m^{2}-8k^{2}-8=0, and thus k^{2}= frac{3m^{2}-8}{8} geq 0.Since 8k^{2}-m^{2}+4 > 0, we havebegin{cases}m^{2} > 2 3m^{2} geq 8end{cases}Consequently, m^{2} geq frac{8}{3}, which means m geq frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3} or m leq - frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}.Given that the line y=kx+m represents a tangent line to a circle centered at the origin, the radius of this circle would be r= frac{|m|}{ sqrt{1+k^{2}}}. Therefore,r^{2}= frac{m^{2}}{1+k^{2}}= frac{m^{2}}{1+ frac{3m^{2}-8}{8}}= frac{8}{3},and so r= frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}. Thus, the equation of the sought-after circle is x^{2}+y^{2}= frac{8}{3}. In this case, all tangent lines y=kx+m to the circle satisfy m geq frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3} or m leq - frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}.When the slope of the tangent line does not exist, the tangent lines are given by x= pm frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}, intersecting with the ellipse frac{x^{2}}{8}+ frac{y^{2}}{4}=1 at points left( frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}, pm frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}right) or left(- frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}, pm frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3}right), which still satisfy OA perp OB.In conclusion, there exists a circle centered at the origin with the equation boxed{x^{2}+y^{2}= frac{8}{3}}, such that any tangent line to this circle intersects with ellipse E at two points A,B, and OA perp OB."},{"problem":"4.

Black and white balls are arranged in a circle, with black balls being twice as many as white ones. It is known that among pairs of adjacent balls, there are three times as many monochromatic pairs as polychromatic ones. What is the smallest number of balls that could have been arranged? (B. Trushin)","solution":"Answer: 24. Solution: Since the number of black balls is twice the number of white balls, the total number of balls is divisible by three. Let's denote it by n. All the balls are divided into alternating groups of consecutive balls of the same color (a group can consist of just one ball). Since the colors of the groups alternate, the total number of groups is even. Let the number of groups of each color be k. Then the number of adjacent balls of different colors will be 2k, and the number of adjacent balls of the same color will be n-2k. From the condition of the problem, we get that n-2k = 3 cdot 2k. Therefore, n = 8k. Thus, the total number of balls is divisible by both three and eight. Hence, n is divisible by 24, and so n geq 24.

Let the sum of the terms that Benjamin omitted be denoted by x. Since 1+2+3+ldots+2012 = frac{2012 cdot 2013}{2} = 1006 cdot 2013, Benjamin's result is 1006 cdot 2013 - x. Therefore, there exists a non-negative integer m such that 1006 cdot 2013 - x = 2011 m. Since A = 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 2013 = frac{2013 cdot 2014}{2} = 2013 cdot 1007, Anika's result is N = 2013 cdot 1007 - x. Therefore, there exists a non-negative integer n such that 2013 cdot 1007 - x = 2014 n. If we express x from both equations and equate the results, we get 1006 cdot 2013 - 2011 m = 2013 cdot 1007 - 2014 n or 2014 n - 2011 m - 2013 = 0.

Solution","solution":": 2/3. Let O be the center of ABC. Let AO meet BC at D, let BO meet CA at E, and let CO meet AB at F. Given any point X inside ABC, it lies in one of the quadrilaterals AEOF, CDOE, BFOD. Without loss of generality, it lies in AEOF. Take the line through X parallel to BC. It meets AB in P and AC in Q. Then PQ is shorter than the parallel line MON with M on AB and N on AC, which has length 2/3. If we twist the segment PXQ so that it continues to pass through X, and P remains on AB and Q on AC, then its length will change continuously. Eventually, one end will reach a vertex, whilst the other will be on the opposite side and hence the length of the segment will be at least that of an altitude, which is greater than 2/3. So at some intermediate position its length will be 2/3. To show that no value smaller than 2/3 is possible, it is sufficient to show that any segment POQ with P and Q on the sides of the triangle has length at least 2/3. Take P on MB and Q on AN with P, O, Q collinear. Then PQ cos POM = MN - QN cospi/3 + PM cos pi/3.

Therefore, the correct arrangement should look like this: a group of knights, a liar, a group of knights, a liar, and so on (with at least two knights in each group). This means that in such an arrangement, there are at least twice as many knights as liars.In the reverse direction: if there are at least twice as many knights as liars, then we can make an arrangement of the form RRKRRK..., and place any remaining knights (if they exist) between any two knights.

Thus, it is sufficient to consider the first 10 natural numbers that can be expressed by f(x).Note that fleft(frac{1}{2}right)=10.

It is easy to see that the blue K_{5} with vertices left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}, B_{5}right} contains 10 blue triangles, any two of which share at least 1 vertex. There are no other blue triangles in the graph. Moreover, any red triangle in the graph must have one edge among the three segments left{A_{2} A_{3}, A_{3} A_{4}, A_{4} A_{2}right}. Therefore, any two red triangles also share at least 1 vertex. This shows that the smallest positive integer n geqslant 10.Next, we will prove that in a two-coloring of K_{10}, there always exist two monochromatic triangles that satisfy the requirements of the problem. Assume this conclusion is not true.(1) Since a monochromatic triangle must exist in a two-coloring of K_{6}, it certainly exists in K_{10}. Let triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} be a monochromatic triangle. Then, in the K_{7} with vertices left{A_{4}, A_{5}, cdots, A_{10}right}, there must be another monochromatic triangle, which we can assume to be triangle A_{4} A_{5} A_{6}. These two monochromatic triangles have no common vertices, so they must be one red and one blue. Assume triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} is red and triangle A_{4} A_{5} A_{6} is blue. Consider the 9 lines connecting the vertices of these two triangles. By the pigeonhole principle, at least 5 of these lines must be the same color, let's say blue. These 5 blue lines are drawn from A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, so at least one vertex must have two blue lines, say A_{1} A_{4}, A_{1} A_{5}. Thus, triangle A_{1} A_{4} A_{5} is a blue triangle, which shares exactly 1 vertex A_{1} with the red triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}. This means that, by the assumption of contradiction, the two-colored complete subgraph K_{5} with vertices left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}, B_{5}right} has no monochromatic triangles, so this K_{5} must be decomposed into one red and one blue cycle, each with exactly 5 edges. Consider the complete subgraph K_{6} with vertices left{A_{1}, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}, B_{5}right}. At this point, there must be two monochromatic triangles. Clearly, both share the vertex A_{1}.(2) Suppose these two monochromatic triangles are the same color, let's say blue, then they must share one edge. Let these two blue triangles be triangle A_{1} B_{1} B_{5} and triangle A_{1} B_{5} B_{4} (see figure). Consider the complete subgraph K_{5} with vertices left{B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}, A_{4}, A_{5}right}. By the assumption of contradiction, it has no monochromatic triangles, so it can also be decomposed into one red and one blue cycle, each with exactly 5 edges. Assume A_{4} B_{2}, A_{5} B_{4} are blue edges, then A_{4} B_{3}, A_{4} B_{4}, A_{5} B_{2}, A_{5} B_{3} are red edges. Similarly, the complete subgraph K_{5} with vertices left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, A_{4}, A_{5}right} can also be decomposed into one red and one blue cycle, each with exactly 5 edges. Therefore, vertex B_{3} must draw two red lines in this K_{5}. But it has already been proven that B_{3} B_{1}, B_{3} A_{4}, B_{3} A_{5} are all red edges, which is a contradiction.(3) From (2), we know that the two monochromatic triangles must be different colors. Assume triangle A_{1} B_{2} B_{3} is blue and triangle A_{1} B_{1} B_{4} is red. Consider the complete subgraph K_{5} with vertices left{A_{4}, A_{5}, B_{1}, B_{4}, B_{5}right}. By the assumption of contradiction, it has no monochromatic triangles, so it can be decomposed into one red and one blue cycle, each with exactly 5 edges. Assume A_{5} B_{1}, A_{4} B_{4} are blue edges and A_{4} B_{1}, A_{4} B_{5}, A_{5} B_{4}, A_{5} B_{5} are red edges (as shown in the figure). If A_{5} B_{2} is a red edge, then triangle A_{5} B_{2} B_{4} and triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} are two red triangles with no common vertices, which contradicts the assumption of contradiction, so A_{5} B_{2} is a blue edge. If A_{4} B_{3} is a red edge, then triangle A_{4} B_{3} B_{5} and triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} are two red triangles with no common vertices, which is a contradiction, so A_{4} B_{3} is a blue edge. At this point, triangle A_{4} B_{3} B_{4} and triangle A_{1} B_{2} A_{5} are two blue triangles with no common vertices, which contradicts the assumption of contradiction.In summary, we have proven that in a two-coloring of K_{10}, there always exist two monochromatic triangles that satisfy the requirements.

Therefore, the time that car B starts later than car A is the time that car B drives less than car A before 10:00. Thus, the problem can be solved by finding the time each car has driven before 10:00.(1) The speed of both cars is 55 kilometers/hour. Here, we can assume that the distance car B has driven by 10:00 is x kilometers, then the distance car A has driven is 5x kilometers. Therefore, the time car A has driven before 10:00 is frac{5x}{55} hours, and the time car B has driven is frac{x}{55} hours. Thus, the total time car A has driven is frac{5x}{55}+2 hours, and the total time car B has driven is frac{x}{55}+2 hours.(2) According to the principle that distance is directly proportional to time when speed is constant, since the distance car A has driven is 3 times the distance car B has driven, the time car A has driven is 3 times the time car B has driven. We can set up an equation to solve the problem.【Solution】Solution: Let the distance car B has driven by 10:00 be x kilometers, then the distance car A has driven is 5x kilometers. Therefore, the time car A has driven before 10:00 is frac{5x}{55} hours, and the time car B has driven is frac{x}{55} hours.

This pattern indicates that as the construction time increases, the cumulative progress also increases. Thus, option A is a correct observation based on the table.Option B: The daily increase in cumulative progress can be calculated by subtracting the progress of the previous day from the current day's progress. For example, on day 2, the progress is 60 meters, and on day 1, it is 30 meters. The increase is 60 - 30 = 30 meters. This pattern holds for every subsequent day, indicating that for each additional day of construction, the cumulative progress increases by 30 meters.

Let the vertices of the graph be A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n}, and let the degree of A_{i} be denoted by a_{i}.

According to the problem's condition, every element of mathcal{C}_{i} has a neighbor in mathcal{B}_{i}. Therefore, the sum of the degrees of the vertices in mathcal{B}_{i} is at least left|mathcal{B}_{i}right|+left|mathcal{C}_{i}right|=n-1. Summing these values from i=1 to n, we get at least n(n-1). In this sum, each vertex appears as many times as its degree, son^{2}-n=a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+ldots+a_{n}^{2} geq n(n-1)Since equality holds here, equality must hold in all estimates, meaning that every vertex in mathcal{C}_{i} has exactly one neighbor in mathcal{B}_{i}, and no two vertices in mathcal{B}_{i} are connected. This can also be stated as: no two neighbors of any vertex in the graph are connected. This implies that the graph does not contain a cycle of length 3. Therefore, it also cannot contain a cycle of length 4. If A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4} were the vertices of such a cycle in the order of their connections, then - since there is no cycle of length 3 - A_{3} in mathcal{C}_{1}, A_{2}, A_{4} in mathcal{B}_{1}, and A_{3} would have two neighbors in mathcal{B}_{1}: A_{2} and A_{4}, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the length of the shortest cycle is at least 5.

The equation of the median on side AB is x + 3y - 6 = 0. The midpoint of AB can be found by averaging the coordinates of A and B, which gives us the system of equations:   [   left{begin{array}{l}   a - b + 1 = 0    frac{a+2}{2} + 3left(frac{b-1}{2}right) - 6 = 0   end{array}right.   ]2.

Part 2: Find the equation of the line containing side BC of triangle triangle ABC.1. Since point A has coordinates (2, -1), let's find the symmetric point A'(x_0, y_0) with respect to the angle bisector x - y + 1 = 0. We have the system of equations:   [   left{begin{array}{l}   frac{2 + x_{0}}{2} - frac{-1 + y_{0}}{2} + 1 = 0    frac{y_{0} + 1}{x_{0} - 2} = -1   end{array}right.   ]2. Solving the system:   [   left{begin{array}{l}   x_{0} + 2 - y_{0} - 1 + 2 = 0 Rightarrow x_{0} - y_{0} + 3 = 0    y_{0} + 1 = -x_{0} + 2   end{array}right.   ]      From y_{0} + 1 = -x_{0} + 2, we get x_{0} = -y_{0} + 1. Substituting into the first equation gives:   [   -y_{0} + 1 - y_{0} + 3 = 0 Rightarrow -2y_{0} + 4 = 0 Rightarrow y_{0} = 2   ]      Substituting y_{0} = 2 back into x_{0} = -y_{0} + 1 gives x_{0} = -2.   Therefore, the symmetric point A' has coordinates boxed{(-2, 3)}.3. The slope of line BC can be found using the coordinates of B and A':   [   text{slope} = frac{frac{7}{2} - 3}{frac{5}{2} + 2} = frac{1}{9}   ]   4. The equation of line BC using point-slope form is:   [   y - frac{7}{2} = frac{1}{9}left(x - frac{5}{2}right)   ]      Multiplying both sides by 9 and simplifying we get:   [   9y - frac{63}{2} = x - frac{5}{2} Rightarrow x - 9y + frac{58}{2} = 0 Rightarrow x - 9y + 29 = 0   ]   Therefore, the equation of line BC is boxed{x - 9y + 29 = 0}."},{"problem":"We call an even positive integer n nice if the set {1,2, ldots, n} can be partitioned into frac{n}{2} two-element subsets, such that the sum of the elements in each subset is a power of 3. For example, 6 is nice, because the set {1,2,3,4,5,6} can be partitioned into subsets {1,2},{3,6},{4,5}. Find the number of nice positive integers which are smaller than 3^{2022}.","solution":"For a nice number n and a given partition of the set {1,2, ldots, n} into two-element subsets such that the sum of the elements in each subset is a power of 3, we say that a, b in{1,2, ldots, n} are paired if both of them belong to the same subset.Let x be a nice number and k be a (unique) non-negative integer such that 3^{k} leq x < 3^{k+1}. This implies that s > k. From these we conclude that s must be equal to k+1, so x + y = 3^{k+1}. The last equation, combined with x > y, implies that x > frac{3^{k+1}}{2}.Similarly as above, we can conclude that each number z from the closed interval left[3^{k+1} - x, xright] is paired with 3^{k+1} - z. Namely, for any such z, the larger of the numbers z and 3^{k+1} - z is greater than frac{3^{k+1}}{2} which is greater than 3^{k}, so the numbers z and 3^{k+1} - z must necessarily be in the same subset. In other words, each number from the interval left[3^{k+1} - x, xright] is paired with another number from this interval. Note that this implies that all numbers smaller than 3^{k+1} - x are paired among themselves, so the number 3^{k+1} - x - 1 is either nice or equals zero. Also, the number 3^{k} must be paired with 2 cdot 3^{k}, so x geq 2 cdot 3^{k}.Finally, we prove by induction that a_{n} = 2^{n} - 1, where a_{n} is the number of nice positive integers smaller than 3^{n}. For n = 1, the claim is obviously true, because 2 is the only nice positive integer smaller than 3. Now, assume that a_{n} = 2^{n} - 1 for some positive integer n. We will prove that a_{n+1} = 2^{n+1} - 1. To prove this, first observe that the number of nice positive integers between 2 cdot 3^{n} and 3^{n+1} is exactly a_{n+1} - a_{n}. Next, observe that 3^{n+1} - 1 is nice. For every nice number 2 cdot 3^{n} leq x < 3^{n+1} - 1, the number 3^{n+1} - x - 1 is also nice and is strictly smaller than 3^{n}. Also, for every positive integer y < 3^{n}, obviously there is a unique number x such that 2 cdot 3^{n} leq x < 3^{n+1} - 1 and 3^{n+1} - x - 1 = y. Thus,a_{n+1} - a_{n} = a_{n} + 1 Leftrightarrow a_{n+1} = 2a_{n} + 1 = 2(2^{n} - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 1completing the proof.In summary, there are 2^{2022} - 1 nice positive integers smaller than 3^{2022}."},{"problem":"Among the following groups of functions, which ones represent the same function for f(x) and g(x)?

Expression for (Phi(n)) and (Psi(n)):   [   Phi(n) = n prod_{i=1}^k left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right)   ]   [   Psi(n) = n prod_{i=1}^k left(1 + frac{1}{p_i}right)   ]6. Condition (Phi(n) mid n + Psi(n)):   This implies:   [   Phi(n) mid n + Psi(n) implies n prod_{i=1}^k left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right) mid n + n prod_{i=1}^k left(1 + frac{1}{p_i}right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   n prod_{i=1}^k left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right) mid n left(1 + prod_{i=1}^k left(1 + frac{1}{p_i}right)right)   ]   Dividing both sides by ( n ):   [   prod_{i=1}^k left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right) mid 1 + prod_{i=1}^k left(1 + frac{1}{p_i}right)   ]7. Simplifying the divisibility condition:   Let ( m ) be an integer such that:   [   m prod_{i=1}^k (p_i - 1) = prod_{i=1}^k p_i + prod_{i=1}^k (p_i + 1)   ]   This is equivalent to:   [   m prod_{i=1}^k (p_i - 1) = prod_{i=1}^k p_i + prod_{i=1}^k (p_i + 1)   ]8. Considering the parity of the terms:   If ( p_i neq 2 ) for all ( i ), then the left-hand side (LHS) is even, but the right-hand side (RHS) is odd, which is not possible. Therefore, we must have ( p_1 = 2 ).9. Divisibility by ( 2^{k-1} ):   Since ( 2^{k-1} ) divides both ( prod_{i=1}^k (p_i - 1) ) and ( prod_{i=1}^k (p_i + 1) ), it must also divide ( prod_{i=1}^k p_i ). This implies ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 ) because ( p_2, ldots, p_k ) are all odd.10. Case ( k = 1 ):    If ( k = 1 ), then ( n = 2^{n_1} ) and any such ( n ) satisfies the condition.11. Case ( k = 2 ):    If ( k = 2 ), then ( n = 2^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} ). By the condition:    [    m (p_2 - 1) = 2 p_2 + 3 (p_2 + 1)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    m = frac{5 p_2 + 3}{p_2 - 1} = 5 + frac{8}{p_2 - 1}    ]    This implies ( p_2 - 1 in {1, 2, 4, 8} ). Since ( p_2 ) is an odd prime, we get ( p_2 = 3 ) or ( p_2 = 5 ). Thus, ( n = 2^{n_1} 3^{n_2} ) or ( n = 2^{n_1} 5^{n_2} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ {1, 2^{n_1}, 2^{n_1}3^{n_2}, 2^{n_1}5^{n_2} : n_1, n_2 in mathbb{N}} } )."},{"problem":"101.

The number of divisors of 900 can be calculated using the formula for the number of divisors of a number ( n = p_1^{e_1} cdot p_2^{e_2} cdot ldots cdot p_k^{e_k} ), which is:   [   (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1)   ]   For 900, we have:   [   (2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 = 27   ]   So, 900 has 27 divisors.3. Each divisor ( d ) of 900 can be paired with ( frac{900}{d} ) to form a product that equals 900. For example, if ( d = 1 ), then ( frac{900}{d} = 900 ), and the pair is ( (1, 900) ).4. Since ( m cdot n ) and ( n cdot m ) are considered the same, we need to count each pair only once. We can do this by considering only pairs where ( m leq n ).5. To find the number of such pairs, we note that the total number of pairs (including ( m cdot m )) is half the number of divisors, plus one if there is a perfect square divisor. This is because each pair ( (m, n) ) where ( m neq n ) is counted twice in the list of divisors.6. We need to check if 900 has a perfect square divisor. The square root of 900 is 30, and since 30 is an integer, ( 30 cdot 30 = 900 ) is a valid pair.7. Therefore, we subtract 1 from the total number of divisors to account for the double-counting of the pair ( (30, 30) ):   [   27 - 1 = 26   ]8. We then divide by 2 to count each pair only once:   [   frac{26}{2} = 13   ]9.

King Consumerland not only wants to reduce the consumption of chips in his country but also increase the treasury's revenue. To avoid making a mistake in choosing the tax for chip producers, the king ordered his ministers to gather data on the market. The information they provided to the king is as follows:- Demand and supply can be represented by linear functions and are stable over time.- With a per-unit tax for producers at a rate of 4.5 monetary units per weight unit of chips, the treasury is replenished by tax revenues of 22.5 monetary units of Consumerland.- If the tax were doubled, the treasury's revenue from taxation would increase by 60%.- In the times when chip production was not taxed, the consumption of chips was 1.2 times higher than at a tax rate of 4.5 monetary units.- The residents of Consumerland have a positive demand for chips only at a price lower than 20 monetary units.Can the king, based on this information, set a tax that will maximize the treasury's revenue from taxing chip producers? If yes, how much will be collected by the treasury?#","solution":"# Solution and Evaluation Criteria:Let the inverse demand function for chips be: P^{D}(Q)=a-b Q, and the inverse supply function for chips: P^{S}(Q)=c+d Q.Since with a per-unit tax of 4.5 monetary units, the tax revenue amounted to 22.5 monetary units, in equilibrium, 22.5 / 4.5 = 5 weight units of chips were consumed in this case.

For this, we need to find the maximum of the function: T=t Q^{t}=t(a-c-t) /(b+d), which represents a downward-opening parabola in (Q,T) coordinates. The maximum of such a function will be achieved at Q^{t}=(a-c) / 2(b+d) with a tax of t=(a-c) / 2.

Claim: The solutions are ((m, n) = (3t - 2, 3)) for any positive integer (t). We will verify this claim and show that no other solutions exist.2. Verification for (n = 3):   - We need to check if (1 + m^{27} + m^{54}) is divisible by 3.   - Note that (m^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}) for any integer (m) not divisible by 3. This is because the only quadratic residues modulo 3 are 0 and 1.   - Therefore, (m^{27} equiv (m^2)^{13} cdot m equiv 1^{13} cdot m equiv m pmod{3}).   - Similarly, (m^{54} equiv (m^2)^{27} equiv 1^{27} equiv 1 pmod{3}).   - Thus, (1 + m^{27} + m^{54} equiv 1 + m + 1 equiv m + 2 pmod{3}).   - For (1 + m^{27} + m^{54}) to be divisible by 3, we need (m + 2 equiv 0 pmod{3}), which implies (m equiv -2 equiv 1 pmod{3}).3. General Case for (n geq 5):   - Let (p) be any prime divisor of (n). Since (n mid (1 + m^{3^n} + m^{2 cdot 3^n})), it follows that (p mid (m^{3^{n + 1}} - 1)), so (m^{3^{n + 1}} equiv 1 pmod{p}).   - Let (operatorname{ord}_m(p) = r). Then, (r mid 3^{n + 1}). Suppose that (r = 3^{n + 1}). By Fermat's Little Theorem, (m^{p - 1} equiv 1 pmod{p}). Then, (operatorname{ord}_m(p) = 3^{n + 1} mid (p - 1)). This implies that (p - 1 ge 3^{n + 1}), a contradiction as (p) is a divisor of (n).   - Thus, (r mid 3^n). Then, (m^{3^n} equiv 1 pmod{p}). Multiplying this for every prime factor of (n), we get that (m^{3^n} equiv 1 pmod{n}). Plugging this into the condition (n mid (1 + m^{3^n} + m^{2 cdot 3^n})), we get that (n mid 3), contradiction.4.

Now, we have:int_{-1}^{1}{cosleft(2x-frac{pi}{2}right)dx} = -int_{-1}^{1}{sin(2x),dx}.Since sin(2x) is an odd function, its definite integral over a symmetric interval [-1, 1] equals zero:-int_{-1}^{1}{sin(2x),dx} = 0.Step 3: Combine the resultsNow, we add the results of both integrals to obtain the final answer:int_{-1}^{1}{left[sqrt{1-{{x}^{2}}}+cosleft(2x-frac{pi}{2}right)right]dx} = frac{pi}{2} + 0 = boxed{frac{pi}{2}}."},{"problem":"Example 5 In the right triangle triangle ABC, angle ACB=90^{circ}, the incircle odot O of triangle ABC touches the sides BC, CA, and AB at points D, E, and F respectively.

PC, PB intersect odot O at points G, H respectively, and GH intersects PD at point R.By Conclusion 3(2), we can assume that AD, EH, FG are concurrent at point K.Since angle GPH = 90^{circ}, the center O lies on GH.Because angle OFG = angle OGF = angle HEF, OF is the tangent to the circumcircle of triangle KEF.Also, OF perp AF, so the circumcenter of triangle KEF lies on AF.Similarly, the circumcenter of triangle KEF lies on AE.Therefore, A is the circumcenter of triangle KEF.Thus, AK = AE, which meansangle AKE = angle AEH = angle EGH.Hence, E, G, R, K are concyclic.So, angle ORK = angle GEK = 90^{circ}, which implies GH perp PD.Therefore, point G is the midpoint of arc overparen{PED}, meaning DG bisects angle CDP.Let AE = x, AP = m, PD = n, CE = CD = y.Extend AD to point T such that DT = CD = y. Draw CQ perp AT at point Q.Then angle T = frac{1}{2} angle CDP = angle CPD.Thus, Q is the midpoint of PT.Therefore, PQ = frac{1}{2}(n + y), DQ = frac{1}{2}|n - y|.By the difference of squares theorem, we havebegin{array}{l}AC^{2} - CD^{2} = AQ^{2} - DQ^{2} Rightarrow (AC + CD)(AC - CD) quad = (AQ + DQ)(AQ - DQ) Rightarrow (x + 2y)x = (m + n)(m + y) Rightarrow x^{2} + 2xy = m(m + n) + y(m + n).end{array}By the secant-tangent theorem, we have x^{2} = m(m + n).Substituting this into the above equation, we getm + n = 2x = 2sqrt{m(m + n)}.Solving this, we get n = 3m, x = 2m.Thus, x + m = 3m = n.Therefore, AE + AP = PD.[Note] The condition “angle ACB = 90^{circ}” can be removed."},{"problem":"IMO 1977 Problem B3 The function f is defined on the set of positive integers and its values are positive integers.

But the set is bounded below by zero, so it must have a smallest member. Hence the unique smallest member is f(1). So S 1 is true. Suppose S n is true. Take m > n+1. Then m-1 > n, so by S n , f(m-1) > f(n). But S n also tells us that f(n) > f(n-1) > ... > f(1), so f(n) ≥ n - 1 + f(1) ≥ n. Hence f(m-1) ≥ n+1. So f(m-1) belongs to { n+1, n+2, n+3, .. }. But we are given that f(m) > f(f(m-1)), so f(m) is not the smallest element of { f(n+1), f(n+2), f(n+3), ... }. But there must be a smallest element, so f(n+1) must be the unique smallest member, which establishes S n+1 . So, S n is true for all n.

Since (a b c)_{z} is the number a z^{2}+b z+c, we need to determine when the equivalence generally holds: n mid c+3 b-4 a if and only if n mid a z^{2}+b z+c. Here, a, b, c are arbitrary digits in base z, i.e., numbers from the set {0,1, ldots, z-1}. Note that z-1 geq 4, since we assume that z geq 5.If we choose a=b=c=1, we get that n mid 0 if and only if n mid z^{2}+z+1. Since zero is divisible by any integer, it must be that n mid z^{2}+z+1. If we choose a=1, b=0 and c=4, we get that n mid 0 if and only if n mid z^{2}+4.

Define the cost and selling price: Let the cost of the zongzi be m. The selling price is then 25% higher than the cost, which can be represented as (1 + 25%)m = 1.25m.2. Introduce the discount rate: Let the discount rate be x. The selling price after applying the discount is then 1.25m(1 - x).3. Set up the inequality to avoid losses: To ensure that the merchant does not lose money, the selling price after the discount must be at least equal to the cost. This gives us the inequality 1.25m(1 - x) geqslant m.4. Solve the inequality for x:   - Start by simplifying the inequality: 1.25(1 - x) geqslant 1.   - This simplifies further to 1.25 - 1.25x geqslant 1.   - Subtracting 1.25 from both sides gives -1.25x geqslant -0.25.   - Dividing by -1.25 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign because we're dividing by a negative number) gives x leqslant 0.20.5.

Understanding the definition of singular numbers:   A number is singular if its prime factorization contains no even powers other than 0. This means that in the prime factorization of a singular number, each prime factor must appear to an odd power.2. Analyzing the problem:   We need to determine the maximum number of consecutive singular numbers. To do this, we need to consider the properties of numbers and their prime factorizations.3. Considering the properties of consecutive numbers:   Out of any eight consecutive positive integers, at least one of them is divisible by 4 but not by 8. This is because every fourth number is divisible by 4, and among any eight consecutive numbers, there will be at least one such number. 4. Checking the prime factorization of numbers divisible by 4 but not by 8:   If a number is divisible by 4 but not by 8, it can be written in the form (4k) where (k) is an odd number. The prime factorization of (4k) is (2^2 cdot k). Since (2^2) is an even power, such a number cannot be singular.5. Finding a sequence of consecutive singular numbers:   We need to find the longest sequence of consecutive numbers that do not include a number of the form (4k) where (k) is odd. 6. Example of a sequence of seven consecutive singular numbers:   Consider the sequence (37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43):   - (37) is prime.   - (38 = 2 cdot 19) (both primes to the power of 1).   - (39 = 3 cdot 13) (both primes to the power of 1).   - (40 = 2^3 cdot 5) (2 to the power of 3, which is odd, and 5 to the power of 1).   - (41) is prime.   - (42 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 7) (all primes to the power of 1).   - (43) is prime.   This sequence contains seven consecutive singular numbers.7. Verifying that eight consecutive singular numbers are not possible:   Since any sequence of eight consecutive numbers must include a number of the form (4k) where (k) is odd, and such a number is not singular, it is impossible to have eight consecutive singular numbers.Conclusion:The maximum number of consecutive singular numbers is 7.The final answer is (boxed{7})"},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, and it satisfies csin B = sqrt{3}bcos C, a^2 - c^2 = 2b^2.Ⅰ) Find the size of angle C;  Ⅱ) If the area of triangle ABC is 21sqrt{3}, find the value of b.","solution":"Solution:  Ⅰ) Since it is given and by the sine rule, we have sin Csin B= sqrt {3}sin Bcos C,  Since sin Bneq 0,  Therefore, tan C= sqrt {3},  Thus, C= dfrac {pi}{3}.

The directed edges form a union of disjoint cycles, implying ( 2 mid n ).4. Cycle Analysis:   - Consider the cycles that enter/exit a column. The number of rightward-pointing arrows in column ( c ) must equal the number of leftward-pointing arrows in column ( c+1 ).   - Condition 3 implies that the number of rightward arrows in each column (except the rightmost one) is the same, denoted as ( k ).

Understanding the problem: We need to find all pairs of positive integers ((m, n)) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of the first (n) positive integers is equal to (m!).2. Using Bertrand's Postulate (Chebyshev's Theorem): Bertrand's Postulate states that for any integer (n > 1), there is always at least one prime (p) such that (n < p < 2n). This implies that the largest prime (p) not greater than (n) is at least (0.5n).3. Analyzing the LCM and factorial:    - The LCM of the first (n) positive integers, ( text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n) ), is the smallest number that is divisible by each of the integers from 1 to (n).   - The factorial (m!) is the product of all positive integers up to (m).4. Prime factorization and valuation:   - For any prime (p), the (p)-adic valuation (v_p(k)) of an integer (k) is the highest power of (p) that divides (k).   - The (p)-adic valuation of (m!) is given by:     [     v_p(m!) = leftlfloor frac{m}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{p^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{p^3} rightrfloor + cdots     ]   - The (p)-adic valuation of (text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) is:     [     v_p(text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) = max(v_p(1), v_p(2), ldots, v_p(n))     ]5. Considering the power of 2:   - The (2)-adic valuation of (m!) is at least (frac{m}{2}) because:     [     v_2(m!) = leftlfloor frac{m}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{8} rightrfloor + cdots geq frac{m}{2}     ]   - The (2)-adic valuation of (text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) is (log_2(n)) because the highest power of 2 that divides any number up to (n) is (2^{lfloor log_2(n) rfloor}).6. Inequality analysis:   - We have:     [     v_2(m!) geq frac{m}{2} quad text{and} quad v_2(text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) = log_2(n)     ]   - Therefore:     [     log_2(n) geq frac{m}{2}     ]   - Since (m geq 0.5n), we get:     [     log_2(n) geq 0.25n     ]7. Solving the inequality:   - The inequality (log_2(n) geq 0.25n) implies that (n) must be relatively small. By solving this inequality, we find that (n leq 16).8. Checking values of (n) from 1 to 16:   - For each (n) from 1 to 16, we check if (text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n) = m!) for some (m).   - After checking, we find that the pairs ((m, n)) that satisfy the condition are:     [     (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)     ]The final answer is ( boxed{ (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) } )"},{"problem":"Xiaohua arrives at school at 7:20 AM, leaves for home at 11:45 AM, returns to school at 1:50 PM, and finally leaves school for home at 5:15 PM.

Statement A: overrightarrow{e}bot overrightarrow{{n_1}}Leftrightarrow l is parallel to alpha- If overrightarrow{e}bot overrightarrow{{n_1}}, this means that the direction vector of line l is perpendicular to the normal vector of plane alpha. Since the normal vector of a plane is perpendicular to any vector lying in the plane, and line l does not lie in plane alpha, it implies that line l must be parallel to plane alpha.

Assume there is a coloring that does not generate such a component. Consider the color which is used the most; assume it is color 1. The big graph has exactly (frac{n^2p(p-1)}{2}) edges.

Arranging the Second Set of Books: Now, we need to arrange the Chinese books in such a way that they are not adjacent to each other. To do this, we can place each Chinese book in the gaps between the math books or at the ends of the row. For the first Chinese book, there are 4 positions (before the first math book, between the first and second, between the second and third, and after the third math book). After placing the first Chinese book, we proceed to place the second and third, following the same principle. Since we are arranging 3 Chinese books in 3 specific positions (the gaps created by placing the first Chinese book), this can be done in {A}_{3}^{3} ways. Again, {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6.3. Combining the Arrangements: Since we can start with either the math books or the Chinese books, there are 2 choices for the first set of books to arrange. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is given by multiplying the number of ways to arrange each set of books and the choice of which set to start with. This gives us 2 times {A}_{3}^{3} times {A}_{3}^{3} = 2 times 6 times 6.4.

Then:   [   b^3 = (3k)^3 = 27k^3   ]   Substituting back, we get:   [   a = frac{27k^3}{3} = 9k^3   ]   Thus, ( a ) is divisible by ( 3 ).2. From the equation ( 5a = c^2 ), we can see that ( a = frac{c^2}{5} ). For ( a ) to be an integer, ( c^2 ) must be divisible by ( 5 ). Since ( c ) is a positive integer, ( c ) itself must be divisible by ( 5 ). Let ( c = 5m ) for some integer ( m ). Then:   [   c^2 = (5m)^2 = 25m^2   ]   Substituting back, we get:   [   a = frac{25m^2}{5} = 5m^2   ]   Thus, ( a ) is divisible by ( 5 ).Since ( a ) is divisible by both ( 3 ) and ( 5 ), we conclude that ( a ) is divisible by ( 15 ). Part 2: Prove that the prime factors of ( a ) are limited to ( 3 ) and ( 5 ).1. From the previous part, we have:   [   a = 9k^3 quad text{and} quad a = 5m^2   ]   Since ( a ) must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we equate the two expressions:   [   9k^3 = 5m^2   ]   This implies that ( a ) must be a common multiple of ( 9 ) and ( 5 ). The least common multiple of ( 9 ) and ( 5 ) is ( 45 ). Therefore, ( a ) must be of the form:   [   a = 45n   ]   for some integer ( n ).2. Since ( a ) is of the form ( 45n ), the prime factors of ( a ) are ( 3 ) and ( 5 ). Part 3: Find ( a ).1. From the equation ( 9k^3 = 5m^2 ), we need to find integers ( k ) and ( m ) such that this equation holds. We rewrite it as:   [   9k^3 = 5m^2   ]   This implies that ( k ) and ( m ) must be chosen such that both sides are equal. Since ( 9k^3 ) and ( 5m^2 ) must be equal, we need to find the smallest ( k ) and ( m ) that satisfy this condition.2. By trial and error or by solving the equation, we find that the smallest values that satisfy this condition are ( k = 5 ) and ( m = 3 ). Substituting these values back, we get:   [   a = 9k^3 = 9 cdot 5^3 = 9 cdot 125 = 1125   ]   [   a = 5m^2 = 5 cdot 3^2 = 5 cdot 9 = 45   ]Since both expressions must be equal, we find that the smallest value of ( a ) that satisfies both conditions is ( 1125 ).The final answer is ( boxed{1125} )."},{"problem":"Given that the sets A=mathbb{R} and B=mathbb{R}, if f: x rightarrow 2x-1 is a mapping from set A to B, then the element 3 in B corresponds to the element ______ in A.","solution":"To find the corresponding element in set A for the element 3 in set B, according to the given function f: x rightarrow 2x-1, we need to solve the equation for x:2x - 1 = 3Adding 1 to both sides of the equation gives:2x = 3 + 12x = 4Dividing both sides by 2 gives the solution for x:x = frac{4}{2}x = 2Thus, the element in A that corresponds to the element 3 in B is boxed{2}."},{"problem":"Problem 10.3.

We have thus shown that there is no solution in this case.Therefore, the only solutions to our system of equations arex_{1}=y_{1}=z_{1}=0, quad x_{2}=y_{2}=z_{2}=sqrt{2}, quad x_{3}=y_{3}=z_{3}=-sqrt{2}It is easy to verify that these three triples indeed satisfy the system of equations.II. solution: From the equation (x+y)(x y+2)=(y+z)(y z+2), after rearranging, we get(x-z)left(y^{2}+x y+y z+2right)=0Similarly, we get the equations(x-y)left(z^{2}+x z+y z+2right)=0(y-z)left(x^{2}+x y+x z+2right)=0If x, y, z were all different, then the expressions in the second parentheses on the left side of the equations would have to be zero, but then their sum would also be zero, whereas their sum is exactly (x+y+z)^{2}+6, which is certainly positive. Therefore, at least two of x, y, z must be equal. If, for example, x=y neq z, then the second parenthesis on the left side of (7) is zero, so0=x^{2}+x y+x z+2=2 x^{2}+x z+2On the other hand, the equation 4 x y z=(x+y)(x y+2) for x=y becomes 4 x^{2} z=2 xleft(x^{2}+2right), or2 xleft(x^{2}+2-2 x zright)=0As we saw in the first solution, if x=0, we get the solutionx_{1}=y_{1}=z_{1}=0If x neq 0, we get the system of equationsbegin{aligned}& 2 x^{2}+x z+2=0 & x^{2}-2 x z+2=0end{aligned}which, as we saw, has no solution in the real numbers.

Analyzing the functional equation:   The functional equation ( f(a + b) + f(a - b) equiv 2(f(a) + f(b)) pmod{p} ) suggests a linearity property. We can try to express ( f ) in terms of the components of ( a ).3.

Without loss of generality, assume c = frac{2ab}{a + b} and c = frac{a + b}{2}.3.

Let's calculate the opposite probability, that is, the probability that none of the three players get two aces. The latter case can only occur with the distribution 4, 0, 0 or 3,1,0.When one player gets four aces, the number of favorable cases is the same as the number of 4th class combinations that can be formed from the 20 non-ace cards, which is binom{20}{4}. Considering that any of the three players can get the four aces, the number of favorable cases is binom{3}{1}binom{20}{4}. The number of possible cases is binom{24}{8}, and thus the probability that one of the three players gets four aces isbegin{gathered}v_{4}=frac{binom{3}{1}binom{20}{4}}{binom{24}{8}}=frac{3 cdot 20 cdot 19 cdot 18 cdot 17 cdot 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 8}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 24 cdot 23 cdot 22 cdot 21 cdot 20 cdot 19 cdot 18 cdot 17}= frac{3 cdot 5}{23 cdot 11 cdot 3}=frac{15}{759}end{gathered}Similarly, the probability that one of the 3 players gets 3 aces isbegin{gathered}v_{3}=frac{binom{3}{1}binom{4}{3}binom{20}{5}}{binom{24}{8}}=frac{3 cdot 4 cdot 20 cdot 19 cdot 18 cdot 17 cdot 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 8}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 24 cdot 23 cdot 22 cdot 21 cdot 20 cdot 19 cdot 18 cdot 17}= =frac{2 cdot 16 cdot 6}{23 cdot 11 cdot 3}=frac{192}{759}end{gathered}Thus, the probability sought in the problem is1-left(v_{4}+v_{3}right)=1-frac{207}{759}=frac{552}{759}=frac{8}{11} approx 0.727Péter Kiss (Vak Bottyán g.

Therefore, every case where one player has exactly two aces is favorable.

Convert the given function into a simpler form:   Given f(x)=sqrt{3}sinfrac{ωx}{2}cdotcosfrac{ωx}{2}-cos^{2}frac{ωx}{2}, we can use trigonometric identities to simplify it. We know that sin 2theta = 2sinthetacostheta and cos^2theta = frac{1+cos 2theta}{2}. Applying these, we get:   [   f(x) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sinωx - frac{1}{2} = sinleft(ωx - frac{π}{6}right) - frac{1}{2}   ]2. Determine the relationship between ω and k:   Given that f(x) reaches its maximum at x = frac{4π}{3}, we set the inside of the sine function equal to a peak of sine, which is frac{π}{2} + 2kπ (where k is an integer), leading to:   [   frac{4π}{3}ω - frac{π}{6} = 2kπ + frac{π}{2}   ]   Simplifying this equation gives us:   [   frac{4}{3}ω = 2k + frac{2}{3}   ]3. Find the value of ω:   Given that the period T = frac{2π}{ω} must be greater than frac{4π}{3}, we find that 0 < ω < frac{3}{4}. With k being an integer, the only value that fits this condition for k=0 is ω = frac{1}{2}.4. Determine the monotonic interval for f(x):   For the function to be monotonic on (frac{17π}{3}, a), we consider the argument of the sine function, frac{1}{2}x - frac{π}{6}, which must be within a specific range to ensure monotonicity. This leads to:   [   frac{8π}{3} < frac{1}{2}x - frac{π}{6} < frac{1}{2}a - frac{π}{6}   ]   To maintain monotonicity, the upper bound of this range should not exceed the next critical point of sine, which is frac{7π}{2}.

The total points of Michael, Juan Pablo, and Kimi is 125.

Compared to the maximum possible 50 points, Michael lost 7 points. He could lose 2 points (by placing second) or 3 points (by placing third), so the only possibility is that he placed second twice and third once. Juan Pablo, who lost 8 points compared to the maximum possible, could have placed third twice and second once, or second four times. However, the latter possibility is excluded, since Michael has collected two second places, and no one else can have placed second more than three times. By elimination, Kimi must have placed second twice and third twice.SECOND SOLUTION.A simpler solution can be found by considering the remainder of the scores of the three competitors when divided by 3: the scores for first and third place have a remainder of 1, and the score for second place has a remainder of 2. Therefore, it can be seen quickly that:| placements | remainder of the score when divided by 3 || :--- | :--- || every time first or third | 1+1+1+1+1=5, remainder 2 || once second | 2+1+1+1+1=6, remainder 0 || twice second | 2+2+1+1+1=7, remainder 1 || three times second | 2+2+2+1+1=8, remainder 2 || four times second | 2+2+2+2+1=9, remainder 0 || five times second | 2+2+2+2+2=10, remainder 1 |Moreover, Michael's score has a remainder of 1, Juan Pablo's score has a remainder of 0, and Kimi's score has a remainder of 1.

By the end of the eighth day, each chess player has played 8 games, meaning they have not played one. The unplayed games divide the chess players into 5 non-intersecting pairs.

Therefore, n leq 5.We will show that by the end of the seventh day of the tournament, regardless of the schedule, there will always be five chess players who have already played all their scheduled games with each other, from which it follows that n=5. We will construct a chain of chess players: the first is any player, the second is the one who played the first on the eighth day, the third is the one who played the second on the ninth day, the fourth is the one who played the third on the eighth day, and so on. Since the number of chess players is finite, at some point in the chain, a repetition will occur for the first time. This cannot happen at any player except the first, otherwise, the repeated player would have played at least three games in two days. Therefore, the chain will form a cycle of even length, as the days of the games considered alternate when moving along it. If the constructed cycle includes all 10 chess players, we stop; if not, we choose any player not included in it and repeat the procedure for constructing the cycle. The new cycle will not intersect with the already constructed one.

We isolate in the left-hand side of the inequality all terms containing the variable x_{1}, obtaining x_{1}left(1-x_{2}-x_{7}right). For fixed other variables, this expression, and hence the entire left-hand side, reaches its maximum when x_{1}=1 if x_{2}+x_{7}<1 and when x_{1}=0 if x_{2}+x_{7} geq 1. Therefore, if we replace each variable, starting from x_{1} to x_{7}, with 1 or 0 according to the condition whether the sum of the neighboring variables is less than 1 or not less than 1, we will not decrease the value of the sum on the right-hand side of the inequality.

For ( K ) to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum must satisfy:   [   X - 3 + Y equiv 0 pmod{11}   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   X + Y - 3 equiv 0 pmod{11}   ]   or equivalently:   [   X + Y equiv 3 pmod{11}   ]4. We need to find a digit ( X ) such that there is no possible digit ( Y ) (where ( 0 leq Y leq 9 )) that satisfies the equation ( X + Y equiv 3 pmod{11} ).5. Let's test each possible value of ( X ) from 0 to 9:   - If ( X = 0 ), then ( Y equiv 3 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 3 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 1 ), then ( Y equiv 2 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 2 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 2 ), then ( Y equiv 1 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 1 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 3 ), then ( Y equiv 0 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 0 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 4 ), then ( Y equiv -1 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 10 ) (not a valid digit).   - If ( X = 5 ), then ( Y equiv -2 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 9 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 6 ), then ( Y equiv -3 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 8 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 7 ), then ( Y equiv -4 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 7 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 8 ), then ( Y equiv -5 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 6 ) (valid).   - If ( X = 9 ), then ( Y equiv -6 pmod{11} ) which gives ( Y = 5 ) (valid).6. From the above, we see that the only value of ( X ) for which there is no valid digit ( Y ) that satisfies the equation ( X + Y equiv 3 pmod{11} ) is ( X = 4 ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ X = 4 } )"},{"problem":"A car originally travels x km per day.

Define the problem and setup:   Let (ABCD) be a unit square with vertices (A(0,0)), (B(1,0)), (C(1,1)), and (D(0,1)). For any interior points (M) and (N) such that the line (MN) does not pass through any vertex of the square, we need to find the least number (k) such that the smallest area of the triangles formed by any three points from the set ({A, B, C, D, M, N}) is at most (k).2. Calculate the area of triangles formed by vertices of the square:   The area of the square (ABCD) is 1. The area of any triangle formed by the vertices of the square is at most (frac{1}{2}) since the largest triangle that can be formed within the square is half of the square.3. Consider the smallest possible triangle:   To find the smallest possible triangle, consider the triangles formed by one vertex of the square and two interior points (M) and (N). The area of such a triangle can be calculated using the determinant formula for the area of a triangle with vertices ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), and ((x_3, y_3)):   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right|   ]4. Evaluate the minimum area:   Since (M) and (N) are interior points, the smallest area triangle involving (M) and (N) and one of the vertices of the square will be less than or equal to the area of the smallest triangle formed by the vertices of the square. The smallest such triangle is formed by dividing the square into four equal triangles, each with area (frac{1}{8}).5. Verify the lower bound:   To verify that (frac{1}{8}) is indeed the smallest possible area, consider the points (M) and (N) placed such that they form the smallest possible triangles with the vertices of the square. For example, if (M) and (N) are placed at the midpoints of the sides of the square, the resulting triangles will have an area of (frac{1}{8}).6. Conclusion:   Therefore, the least number (k) such that (s(M, N) leq k) for all points (M) and (N) is (frac{1}{8}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{8}})."},{"problem":"6. Klárka had a three-digit number written on a piece of paper. When she correctly multiplied it by nine, she got a four-digit number that started with the same digit as the original number, the middle two digits were the same, and the last digit was the sum of the digits of the original number. What four-digit number could Klárka have gotten?","solution":"SOLUTION. Let us look for the original number x=100a+10b+c, whose digits are a, b, c. Let the digit that appears in the middle two places of the resulting product be denoted by d. From the problem statement, we have:9(100a+10b+c)=1000a+100d+10d+(a+b+c),where the expression in the last parentheses represents the digit identical to the last digit of the product 9c. This means that c cannot be geq 5: for such a c, the number 9c ends with a digit not exceeding 5, and since a neq 0, it follows that a+b+c > c geq 5.It is also clear that c neq 0 (otherwise, a=b=c=x=0 would hold). We will investigate the other possibilities by constructing the following table.| c | 9c | a+b+c | a+b || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 1 | 9 | 9 | 8 || 2 | 18 | 8 | 6 || 3 | 27 | 7 | 4 || 4 | 36 | 6 | 2 |Table 1Equation (1) can be rewritten as100(b-a-d)=10d+a+11b-8c.The value of the right-hand side is at least -72 and less than 200, since each of the numbers a, b, c, d is at most nine. Therefore, it is either b-a-d=0 or b-a-d=1.In the first case, substituting d=b-a into (2) and rearranging, we get 8c=3(7b-3a), from which we see that c is a multiple of three. From Table 1, it follows that c=3, a=4-b, which, upon substitution into the equation 8c=3(7b-3a), leads to the solution a=b=2, c=3. The original number is thus x=223 and its ninefold is 9x=2007.In the second case, substituting d=b-a-1 into (2), we find that 8c+110=3(7b-3a). The expression 8c+110 is therefore divisible by three, so the number c gives a remainder of 2 when divided by three. Substituting the only possible values c=2 and b=6-a into the last equation, we find that a=0, which contradicts the fact that the number x=100a+10b+c is a three-digit number.Conclusion: Klárka received the four-digit number 2007.Note. Table 1 offers a simpler but more numerically laborious method of direct substitution of all permissible values of the numbers a, b, c into equation (1). The number of all possible cases can be reduced to ten by estimating b geq a, which we can determine by a suitable rearrangement of relation (1), for example, into the form (2).

Prove that A = frac{1}{pi}cos^{-1}left(frac{x_1}{2}right).[i]Evan O' Dorney.[/i]","solution":"1. Substitution and Initial Setup:   Let us substitute ( x_n = 2 cos t_n ), where ( t_n in [0, pi] ). This substitution is valid because ( -2 < x_n < 2 ) implies ( -1 < cos t_n < 1 ).2. Recurrence Relation:   Given the recurrence relation ( x_{n+1} = x_n^2 - 2 ), we can express ( x_n ) in terms of ( t_n ):   [   x_{n+1} = 2 cos(2t_n)   ]   This follows from the double-angle formula for cosine: ( cos(2t) = 2cos^2(t) - 1 ).3. General Form:   By induction, we can show that:   [   x_n = 2 cos(2^{n-1} t_1)   ]   This is because ( x_1 = 2 cos t_1 ), and using the recurrence relation, ( x_2 = 2 cos(2 t_1) ), ( x_3 = 2 cos(4 t_1) ), and so on.4. Product of Terms:   Consider the product ( x_1 x_2 cdots x_n ):   [   x_1 x_2 cdots x_n = 2^n cos t_1 cos 2t_1 cos 4t_1 cdots cos 2^{n-1} t_1   ]   Using the product-to-sum identities, this product can be simplified to:   [   x_1 x_2 cdots x_n = frac{sin(2^n t_1)}{sin t_1}   ]5. Sign of the Product:   Since ( sin t_1 > 0 ) for ( t_1 in (0, pi) ), the sign of ( x_1 x_2 cdots x_n ) is determined by the sign of ( sin(2^n t_1) ). The sign of ( sin(2^n t_1) ) is:   [   (-1)^{leftlfloor frac{2^n t_1}{pi} rightrfloor}   ]6. Binary Representation:   Let ( s_1 = frac{t_1}{pi} ). Clearly, ( s_1 in (0, 1) ). Consider the binary representation of ( s_1 ):   [   s_1 = 0.a_1 a_2 a_3 ldots   ]   where ( a_i in {0, 1} ).7. Determining ( A ):   Notice that ( leftlfloor 2^n s_1 rightrfloor ) is odd if and only if ( a_n = 1 ). Therefore, the ( n )-th digit after the decimal point in the binary representation of ( A ) is ( 0 ) if ( x_1 x_2 cdots x_n ) is positive and ( 1 ) otherwise. Hence, ( A = s_1 ).8. Final Expression:   Since ( s_1 = frac{t_1}{pi} ) and ( t_1 = cos^{-1}left(frac{x_1}{2}right) ), we have:   [   A = frac{1}{pi} cos^{-1}left(frac{x_1}{2}right)   ](blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ A = frac{1}{pi} cos^{-1}left(frac{x_1}{2}right) } )"},{"problem":"Problem 9.1.

Calculate, in terms of n, the total number of tangency points (contacts) between the spheres in the pile.## Solution.## The problem in the plane.","solution":"Let's first analyze the problem in the plane. Let A_{n} be the number of contacts of n spheres arranged in a triangle with n spheres on each side (right figure). Note that the total number of spheres is, obviously, T_{n}=frac{n(n+1)}{2}.We can proceed by induction. If there are n=2 rows, the number of contacts is 3; that is, A_{2}=3. Observe that this coincides with the number of balls in the triangle of two rows.In a triangle of n-1 rows, there are A_{n-1} contacts. Obviously, in a triangle of n rows, there will be the contacts that were already in a triangle of n-1 rows, plus those that come from adding the last row, as indicated in the figure above. But it is clear that, by adding this last row, contacts of two types are produced:- The ones between the balls of the n-th row, which are n-1.- The ones between the balls of the n-th row and the previous one. They are 2(n-1).Thus, A_{n}=A_{n-1}+3(n-1), or, A_{n}-A_{n-1}=3(n-1). Summing up, we getA_{n}=3((n-1)+(n-2)+cdots+2+1)=3 frac{n(n-1)}{2}=3 T_{n-1}## The problem in three-dimensional space.Now we can analyze the case in space. Let C_{n} be the number of contacts of a tetrahedral pile of spheres with edges of n spheres. In the figure on the right, we have represented the spheres of the base in solid lines and those of the immediate upper floor in dashed lines, from a bird's-eye view. When we add the n-th floor, we add contacts of two types:- The ones of the floor itself - a plane triangle of n balls on a side.- The ones that come from contacts between the n-1-th floor and the n-th floor.The contacts of the first type are, as we have seen in the plane case, A_{n}=3 T_{n-1}.The number of contacts between one floor and the previous one is 3 T_{n-1}, since each ball of the n-1-th floor touches exactly three balls of the n-th floor. (See the figure.) In total, then, the number of contacts is C_{n}-C_{n-1}=A_{n}+3 T_{n-1}=3 n(n-1). If we sum up, we getC_{n}-C_{2}=3 n(n-1)+cdots+3 cdot 3(3-1)=3left(n^{2}+cdots+3^{2}right)-3(n+cdots+3)orC_{n}=3left(n^{2}+cdots+2^{2}+1^{2}right)-3(n+cdots+2+1)=3 frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}-3 frac{n(n+1)}{2}=n^{3}-n.Another approach. The recurrence C_{n}=C_{n-1}+3 n(n-1) can be solved by writing C_{n} as a cubic polynomial and calculating its coefficients from the recurrence and the initial condition C_{1}=0.If we put C_{n}=a n(n-1)(n-2)+b n(n-1)+c n+d, the recurrence condition gives a=1, b=3, c=0, and the condition C_{1}=0 gives d=0.

How many different arrangements are possible? (We do not consider two arrangements different if one can be transformed into the other by a symmetry of the cube - rotation, reflection in a plane or about the center, nor do we consider different two arrangements if one is obtained from the other by replacing each number with the number that is one greater, and 6 with 1.)","solution":"I. solution. Hold the cube so that one of its faces is vertically in front of us and label its top, front, bottom, left, back, and right faces as F, E, A, B, H, J respectively.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_da74a361244ecb581df3g-1.jpg?height=356&width=642&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=735)According to the rules, consecutive numbers must be written on adjacent faces; the third number can be placed on a face parallel to the one containing the first number, or on a face adjacent to the previous two numbers. We will look for arrangements where three consecutive numbers are placed in the first mentioned manner and separately for those where this does not occur. (We also consider 1 as the number following 6.)If there are three consecutive numbers on faces connected by parallel edges, then by adjusting the numbers by the same amount if necessary, we can achieve that these are 1, 2, 3, and by rotating the cube, we can place them on F, E, and A respectively - in the following, we will denote this as 1 rightarrow F, 2 rightarrow E, 3 rightarrow A.The number 4 cannot be written on H, because then the 5 and 6 would have to be placed on the non-adjacent B, J faces. The further options 4 rightarrow B and 4 rightarrow J are mirror images of each other with respect to the plane of symmetry parallel to B, J, so it is enough to examine, for example, the 4 rightarrow B option. In this case, the only remaining empty neighbor of B is H, so 5 rightarrow H, and the 6 can be written on the still empty J, because J is adjacent to the F containing the 1. Thus, we essentially have only one cube of the first type. Here, the numbers 1-6 are written on the faces F, E, A, B, H, J respectively.If it is not possible to place three consecutive numbers on faces connected by parallel edges, then by writing 1 and 2 on F and E respectively, 3 can be placed on B or J. The two possibilities are again mirror images of each other with respect to the plane of symmetry parallel to B and J, so it is enough to examine, for example, 3 rightarrow B. In this case, 4 rightarrow H is not allowed, so 4 must go to A; 5 rightarrow J is again not allowed, so 5 must go to H and 6 to J. This is a valid arrangement because the F containing the 1 is adjacent to both J and the H containing the 5, and J is adjacent to the E containing the 2. Thus, there is essentially only one arrangement of the second type, where the numbers 1-6 are placed on the faces F, E, B, A, H, J respectively.This way, we have found 2 solutions to the problem, and due to the distinguishing property used, they cannot be transformed into each other by any allowed transformation.II. solution. By traversing the faces of the cube in the order of the numbers written on them and repeating the traversal once from any face, we can reach the opposite face in 2, 3, or 4 steps - because after 1 step we are still on an adjacent face and after 5 steps we are back on the same face. From the opposite face, we can return to the starting face in 4, 3, or 2 steps, respectively, because from any face we return to the same face after 6 steps. Thus, the shorter distance between two parallel faces along the traversal can only be 2 or 3 steps.Characterize the valid arrangements of the problem as traversals by specifying the traversal distance between the 3 pairs of parallel faces of the cube. Then the following four distance triples can be considered:2,2,2 ; quad 2,2,3 ; quad 2,3,3 ; quad 3,3,3(The order within each number triple is irrelevant.)Let the 3 distances be denoted by t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, and let the numbers on the faces at distance t_{1} be a, b, on the faces at distance t_{2} be c, d, and on the faces at distance t_{3} be e, f. Then the differences b-a, d-c, f-e match t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, or differ from them by some multiple of 6. On the other hand, each of the numbers 1 to 6 appears exactly once among a, b, c, d, e, f. Thus, on the one hand,b-a+d-c+f-e=t_{1}+t_{2}+t_{3}+6 cdot kwhere k is some integer, and on the other hand,begin{aligned}& b-a+d-c+f-e=a+b+c+d+e+f-2(a+c+e)= & quad=1+2+3+4+5+6-2(a+c+e)=21-2(a+c+e)end{aligned}so the sum of the three differences is odd, and thus the sum of the three distances must also be odd. Therefore, the first and third options cannot occur.There is a traversal of the second type where the pair of faces at a distance of 3 units has 1 and 4 written on them - the possible pairings and differences of the remaining numbers are:the differences for the pairs 2,5 and 3,6 are: 3 and 3,the differences for the pairs 2,6 and 3,5 are: 4 and 2,the third pairing is valid. From this, we get 1 traversal, because after fixing 1 rightarrow F, 4 rightarrow A, the 2 can be brought to E by rotating the cube around its vertical axis if necessary, so 6 rightarrow H, and the two possible placements of the 3,5 pair on the B, J faces are mirror images of each other with respect to the plane of symmetry of the B, J face pair.There is also a traversal of the fourth type - essentially 1 - because the differences for the pairs 1,4; 2,5 and 3,6 are 3,3 and 3.It is clear from the construction that neither of these two solutions can be transformed into each other by symmetry or by shifting the numbers along the traversal path."},{"problem":"6.

Initial Observation:   We are given that ( f ) is an injective function from the set of positive integers to itself. We need to find all such functions satisfying the condition: If ( S ) is a finite set of positive integers such that ( sum_{s in S} frac{1}{s} ) is an integer, then ( sum_{s in S} frac{1}{f(s)} ) is also an integer.2. Base Case:   Clearly, ( f(1) = 1 ). This is because if ( S = {1} ), then ( sum_{s in S} frac{1}{s} = 1 ), which is an integer. Therefore, ( sum_{s in S} frac{1}{f(s)} = frac{1}{f(1)} ) must also be an integer, implying ( f(1) = 1 ).3. Analyzing the Harmonic Series:   Consider the harmonic series sums:   [   A = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{i(i+1)} + frac{1}{n} = 1   ]   and   [   B = sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{i(i+1)} + frac{1}{n+1} = 1   ]   for all ( n in {3, 4, ldots} ). The difference ( B - A ) is an integer.4. Injectivity and Inequality:   Since ( f ) is injective and ( f(1) = 1 ), we have ( f(n) geq 2 ) for all integers ( n > 1 ). Using this inequality:   [   0 + 0 - frac{1}{2} leq frac{1}{f(n(n+1))} + frac{1}{f(n+1)} - frac{1}{f(n)} < frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} + 0   ]   This implies:   [   frac{1}{f(n(n+1))} + frac{1}{f(n+1)} = frac{1}{f(n)}   ]   and ( f ) is increasing (for ( n > 2 )).5.

Determining ( f(2) ), ( f(3) ), and ( f(6) ):   Clearly, ( f(3) neq 6 ) (otherwise ( f(6) < f(3) )). If ( f(3) = 2 ), then:   [   frac{1}{f(2)} + frac{1}{f(6)} = frac{1}{2} Rightarrow frac{1}{f(4)} + frac{1}{f(12)} = frac{1}{2}   ]   This implies:   [   {f(4), f(12)} = {3, 6}   ]   which is a contradiction since ( f ) is injective.

For n=9k where k is a positive integer, we form an n times n table using k times k copies of (1). For each row and each column of the table of size n, since there are three I's, three M's and three O's for any nine consecutive entries, the numbers of I, M and O are equal. In addition, every diagonal of the large table whose number of entries is divisible by 3 intersects each copy of (1) at a diagonal with number of entries divisible by 3 (possibly zero). Therefore, every such diagonal also contains the same number of I, M and O.Next, consider any n times n table for which the requirements can be met. As the number of entries of each row should be a multiple of 3, we let n=3k where k is a positive integer. We divide the whole table into k times k copies of 3 times 3 blocks. We call the entry at the centre of such a 3 times 3 square a vital entry. We also call any row, column or diagonal that contains at least one vital entry a vital line. We compute the number of pairs (l, c) where l is a vital line and c is an entry belonging to l that contains the letter M. We let this number be N.On the one hand, since each vital line contains the same number of I, M and O, it is obvious that each vital row and each vital column contain k occurrences of M. For vital diagonals in either direction, we count there are exactly  1+2+cdots+(k-1)+k+(k-1)+cdots+2+1=k^{2} occurrences of M. Therefore, we have N=4k^{2}.On the other hand, there are 3k^{2} occurrences of M in the whole table. Note that each entry belongs to exactly 1 or 4 vital lines. Therefore, N must be congruent to 3k^{2} bmod 3.From the double counting, we get 4k^{2} equiv 3k^{2}(bmod 3), which forces k to be a multiple of 3.

Which is the maximum numbers which can be written on a list that had closed, if the list had at the beginning 10 numbers?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We start with a list of 10 distinct natural numbers. We can extend this list by adding the least common multiple (LCM) of any two numbers from the list, provided the LCM is not already in the list. The goal is to determine the maximum number of elements that can be in the list when no more LCMs can be added.2. Initial List and LCMs:   Let's denote the initial list of 10 distinct natural numbers as ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{10}} ). We can generate new elements by computing the LCM of any two elements from this list. 3. Induction and Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:   For any element ( x ) in the complete list, we can express ( x ) as the LCM of some subset of the initial 10 elements. This is because the LCM operation is associative and commutative, and every number in the list can be represented as the LCM of some combination of the initial numbers.4. Counting Non-void Subsets:   The number of non-void subsets of a set with 10 elements is ( 2^{10} - 1 ). This is because each element can either be included or not included in a subset, giving ( 2^{10} ) possible subsets, including the empty set. Subtracting the empty set gives ( 2^{10} - 1 ) non-void subsets.5. Choosing Coprime Elements:   To maximize the number of distinct LCMs, we choose the initial 10 numbers to be pairwise coprime. This ensures that the LCM of any subset of these numbers is distinct and not already in the list.6. Adding LCMs:   At each step ( i ) (where ( 1 le i le 10 )), we add to the list the LCMs of all subsets of size ( i ). The number of such subsets is ( binom{10}{i} ).7. Total Number of Elements:   After considering all subsets, the total number of elements in the list is:   [   sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{10}{i} = binom{10}{1} + binom{10}{2} + cdots + binom{10}{10}   ]   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:   [   sum_{i=0}^{10} binom{10}{i} = 2^{10}   ]   Subtracting the empty subset term (( binom{10}{0} = 1 )), we get:   [   sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{10}{i} = 2^{10} - 1   ]8. Conclusion:   Therefore, the maximum number of elements that can be in the list when it is closed is ( 2^{10} - 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^{10} - 1 = 1023 } )."},{"problem":"Ex. 44.

We can obtain this total by putting n=20 in the formula frac{1}{2} n(n+1). This gives frac{1}{2} times 20 times 21=210. Therefore the total of the numbers that Milly adds up is half of 210 , that is, 105 .

See Problem 10.1, belowMeтноd 2To find the smallest positive integer n such that the sum of the integers from 1 to n, inclusive, is 105 , we solve the equation frac{1}{2} n(n+1)=105.

This is because they correspond to the number of dots in a triangular array. For example, the figure on the right shows an array of dots corresponding to the sum 1+2+3+4+5+6.The notation T_{n} is often used for the n-th triangular number. That is,T_{n}=1+2+3+cdots+n .In the figure on the right we have put together two triangular arrays of dots corresponding to the sum 1+2+3+4+5+6. The two triangular arrays together form a rectangle with 6 rows and 7 columns. The rectangle therefore contains 6 times 7 dots. So the figure illustrates the fact that 2 T_{6}=6 times 7, and hence that T_{6}=frac{1}{2}(6 times 7).Generalize the above to give a proof of the formula T_{n}=frac{1}{2} n(n+1). for all positive integers n.10.4 We can express the sum of the first n positive integers more succinctly using the sigme notation. That is, we write sum_{k=1}^{n} k for the sum 1+2+3+cdots+n, and, more generally, sum_{k=1}^{n} s_{k} for the sum s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3}+cdots+s_{n}. We use this notation to give an algebraic proof of the formula for the triangular numbers.We begin with the observation that(k+1)^{2}-k^{2}=left(k^{2}+2 k+1right)-k^{2}=2 k+1 .Therefore summing for k going from 1 to n, we obtainbegin{aligned}sum_{k=1}^{n}left((k+1)^{2}-k^{2}right) & =sum_{k=1}^{n}(2 k+1) & =2 sum_{k=1}^{n} k+sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 .end{aligned}That is,sum_{k=1}^{n}left((k+1)^{2}-k^{2}right)=2 T_{n}+n .Show how the left hand side of the above equation simplifies. Then rearrange the equation to obtain the formula for T_{n}.10.5 The solution to Question 10 shows that the equation T_{m}=frac{1}{2} T_{n} has the positive integer solution m=14, n=20.Show that if m=a, n=b is a solution of the equation T_{m}=frac{1}{2} T_{n}, then so also is m=3 a+2 b+2 and n=4 a+3 b+3.Deduce that the equation T_{m}=frac{1}{2} T_{n}, has infinitely many positive integer solutions.

The three terms are:boxed{a_2 = 2^2 - (-1)^2, a_3 = 2^3 - (-1)^3, a_4 = 2^4 - (-1)^4}(2)For a_1, a_r, a_s to form an arithmetic sequence, the following must hold true:2(2^r - (-1)^r) = 3 + (2^s - (-1)^s)Which simplifies to:2^s - 2^{r+1} = (-1)^s - 2(-1)^r - 3Since r < s, we have 2^s - 2^{r+1} geq 0.But (-1)^s - 2(-1)^r - 3 leq 0.Hence, 2^s - 2^{r+1} = 0, which gives us s = r+1, and s must be an even number greater than or equal to 4.Thus, the relationship between r and s is:boxed{s = r + 1}(3)Since a_{n+1} - a_n = 2^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1} - 2^n + (-1)^n = 2^n + 2(-1)^n geq 0, the sequence is non-decreasing.Let's consider any four terms a_q, a_r, a_s, a_t where 1 leq q < r < s < t that form an arithmetic sequence. We would have a_{q} + a_{t} = a_{r} + a_{s}.Substituting, we get:2^q - (-1)^q + 2^t - (-1)^t = 2^r - (-1)^r + 2^s - (-1)^sThis leads to:2^q + 2^t - 2^r - 2^s = (-1)^q + (-1)^t - (-1)^r - (-1)^sThe left-hand side of the equation is greater than or equal to 2^2 + 2 = 6, while the right-hand side is at most 4.Therefore, the equation has no solutions, and we conclude that the sequence {a_n} does not contain any four terms forming an arithmetic sequence."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=3sin{x}cos{x}-sqrt{3}sin^2{x}, which of the following statements is correct?A: The minimum positive period of the function f(x) is pi.B: The graph of the function f(x) is symmetric about the point (-frac{pi}{12}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).C: The function |f(x)| is an even function.D: If the graph of the function f(x) is symmetric about the y-axis after shifting to the left by varphi units, then varphi can be frac{2pi}{3}.","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break down the transformation of the given function f(x) and evaluate each statement step by step.Given Function:f(x) = 3sin{x}cos{x} - sqrt{3}sin^2{x}Step 1: Simplify the FunctionWe can simplify f(x) using trigonometric identities:begin{align*}f(x) &= 3sin{x}cos{x} - sqrt{3}sin^2{x} &= frac{3}{2}sin{2x} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(1 - cos{2x}) &= frac{3}{2}sin{2x} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos{2x} &= sqrt{3}left(frac{1}{2}sin{2x} + frac{1}{2}cos{2x}right) - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} &= sqrt{3}sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}end{align*}Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement- A: The minimum positive period of f(x) is pi.The function sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) has a period of pi, which means the minimum positive period of f(x) is also pi.

We calculate the number of arrangements for each scenario, and the answer can be obtained by the principle of counting by category.Solution  Based on the problem, we discuss three scenarios:The first scenario is that only one of Xiao Ming's parents sits next to him, and the parents are not next to each other. First, choose one parent to sit next to Xiao Ming, which has C_2^1=2 possibilities. Consider Xiao Ming and the chosen parent as a whole, there are A_2^2=2 arrangements for their order. When the parents are not next to each other, we need to permute the grandparents and arrange the whole with the other parent in the seats, resulting in A_2^2 times A_3^2=12 arrangements.The second scenario is that only one of Xiao Ming's parents sits next to him, and the parents are next to each other. Consider the parents and Xiao Ming as a whole, with Xiao Ming at one end, which has two possibilities. Considering the order between the parents, there are two possibilities, so there are 2 times 2=4 arrangements within this whole. Permuting this whole with the grandparents results in A_3^3=6 arrangements.

From sin^2 B = 2sin A sin C and the Law of Sines, we have b^2 = 2ac.Since triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle and the apex angle is C, we have a = b, so b^2 = 4c^2.Applying the Law of Cosines, we get:cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = frac{2c^2 + 4c^2 - c^2}{2(2c^2)} = frac{5c^2}{4c^2} = frac{5}{4}.However, a cosine value cannot be greater than 1, hence there must be an error in the provided solution. Let's correct it as follows:From b^2 = 2ac and a = b, we can substitute and get b^2 = 2bc, which simplifies to b = 2c or a = 2c as it is an isosceles triangle. The correct application of the Law of Cosines gives us:cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = frac{4c^2 + 4c^2 - c^2}{2 cdot 2c cdot 2c} = frac{7c^2}{8c^2} = frac{7}{8}.Thus, boxed{cos C = frac{7}{8}}.2.

Substituting b^2 with 2ac, we get a^2 + c^2 = 2ac.This simplifies to (a - c)^2 = 0, which implies a = c.Knowing that |BC| = sqrt{2}, we can determine that c = a = sqrt{2}.Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is:S = frac{1}{2} times a times c = frac{1}{2} times sqrt{2} times sqrt{2} = frac{1}{2} times 2 = 1.So, boxed{S = 1}."},{"problem":"Calculate the following indefinite integrals.\\r\\r[1] int sin xsin 2x dx\\r\\r[2] int frac{e^{2x}}{e^x-1}dx\\r\\r[3] int frac{tan ^2 x}{cos ^2 x}dx\\r\\r[4] int frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{e^x-e^{-x}}dx\\r\\r[5] int frac{e^x}{e^x+1}dx","solution":" Problem 1: int sin x sin 2x , dx1.

By AM-GM inequality, for positive v, we have:[v + frac{1600}{v} geq 2sqrt{v cdot frac{1600}{v}} = 2sqrt{1600}][v + frac{1600}{v} geq 80]Thus, the minimum value of v + frac{1600}{v} + 3 is 83. The equality holds when v = frac{1600}{v}, which simplifies to v^2 = 1600 and hence v = 40 (since v > 0).So, at v = 40 km/h, the traffic flow is maximized, and the maximum traffic flow can be calculated as:[y_{max} = frac{920}{83}]Therefore, the traffic flow is maximized when v = 40 km/h, and the maximum traffic flow is boxed{frac{920}{83}} thousand vehicles per hour.(2) To determine the range of v for which the traffic flow exceeds 10 thousand vehicles per hour, we set up the inequality:[frac{920v}{{v}^{2} + 3v + 1600} > 10]Rearranging, we get:[920v > 10(v^{2} + 3v + 1600)][0 > 10v^{2} + 30v + 16000 - 920v][0 > v^{2} - 89v + 1600]This can be factored as:[0 > (v - 25)(v - 64)]Which indicates that the quadratic expression is negative between its roots.

Assume the form of ( P(x) ):   Suppose ( P ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ), i.e.,    [   P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0   ]   where ( a_i in mathbb{R} ) for all ( i ).2. Rational coefficients:   Since ( P(d) = r ) for all ( r in mathbb{Q} ) and some ( d in mathbb{Q} ), the coefficients ( a_i ) must be rational. If any ( a_i ) were irrational, then ( P(d) ) would not necessarily be rational for rational ( d ).3. Transformation invariance:   Notice that if ( P(x) ) satisfies the condition, then so does ( P(ax) + b ) for any ( a, b in mathbb{Q} ) with ( a neq 0 ). This is because if ( P(d) = r ), then ( P(ax) + b = r ) for some ( d in mathbb{Q} ).4. Simplification:   Without loss of generality, assume ( a_n ) is an integer and ( a_0 = 0 ). This simplifies the polynomial to:   [   P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x   ]5. Prime consideration:   Let ( q ) be a prime number such that ( gcd(q, a_n) = 1 ). To solve ( P(x) = q ), we need ( x = frac{y}{z} ) where ( y = 1 ) or ( y = q ) and ( z mid a_n ). Since ( z ) can be negative, we can always find a ( z ) such that ( z mid a_n ) and ( Pleft(frac{q}{z}right) = q ) holds for infinitely many ( q ).6. Infinitely many roots:   The equation ( P(x) - zx = 0 ) must have infinitely many roots, implying that ( P(x) = zx ) for some rational ( z ).7. General form:   By inverting the transformation ( P(ax) + b ), we conclude that ( P(x) = ax + b ) where ( a, b in mathbb{Q} ) and ( a neq 0 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ P(x) = ax + b } ) where ( a, b in mathbb{Q} ) and ( a neq 0 )."},{"problem":"1.

Suppose the die and all its copies are continually rolled, and let p be the probability that they will all eventually disappear. Find leftlfloor frac{10}{p} rightrfloor.","solution":"1. Let ( p ) be the probability that all the dice will eventually disappear. We need to find ( p ).2. Consider the outcomes when the die is rolled:   - With probability ( frac{1}{4} ), the die lands on 0 and disappears immediately.   - With probability ( frac{1}{4} ), the die lands on 1, and we are left with the same situation as before (one die).   - With probability ( frac{1}{4} ), the die lands on 2, and we now have 2 dice.   - With probability ( frac{1}{4} ), the die lands on 3, and we now have 3 dice.3. We can set up the following equation for ( p ):   [   p = frac{1}{4} cdot 1 + frac{1}{4} cdot p + frac{1}{4} cdot p^2 + frac{1}{4} cdot p^3   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   p = frac{1}{4} (1 + p + p^2 + p^3)   ]   Multiplying both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:   [   4p = 1 + p + p^2 + p^3   ]   Rearranging terms, we obtain:   [   p^3 + p^2 - 3p + 1 = 0   ]4. We need to solve the cubic equation ( p^3 + p^2 - 3p + 1 = 0 ). Notice that ( p = 1 ) is a root:   [   1^3 + 1^2 - 3 cdot 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 - 3 + 1 = 0   ]5. Since ( p = 1 ) is a root, we can factor the cubic polynomial as:   [   (p - 1)(p^2 + 2p - 1) = 0   ]6. We discard ( p = 1 ) because it does not make sense in the context of the problem (if ( p = 1 ), the dice would always disappear, which is not the case). We need to solve the quadratic equation ( p^2 + 2p - 1 = 0 ).7. Using the quadratic formula ( p = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) with ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = -1 ):   [   p = frac{-2 pm sqrt{2^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-1)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{8}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 pm sqrt{2}   ]8. Since ( p ) must be a probability (i.e., ( 0 leq p leq 1 )), we take the positive root:   [   p = sqrt{2} - 1   ]9.

(5) The obtuse angles have a size of 180^{circ}-36^{circ}=144^{circ}.Second method. Let alpha be the acute angle and beta be the obtuse angle. From the condition of the problem, we have that the obtuse angle is twice the sum of the acute angles, i.e., beta=2 cdot(alpha+alpha)=4 alpha or the obtuse angle is four times larger than the acute angle.

Generalize the problem to (a) red and (b) white buckets:   - We have (a) red buckets and (b) white buckets.   - In each move, we select one red bucket and one white bucket and add an equal amount of water to both.2. Analyze the condition for no empty buckets:   - After some number of moves, there should be no empty buckets. This means every red bucket and every white bucket must have been selected at least once.3. Analyze the condition for equal water in buckets selected together:   - For every pair of buckets that are selected together at least once, the amount of water in these buckets is the same. This implies that if two buckets (one red and one white) are selected together, they must have the same amount of water.4. Consider the graph representation:   - Represent the problem as a bipartite graph (K_{a, b}) where one set of vertices represents the red buckets and the other set represents the white buckets.   - An edge between a red bucket and a white bucket indicates that they have been selected together at least once.5. Connected subgraph analysis:   - If the subgraph of (K_{a, b}) formed by the buckets selected together is connected, then the total amount of water on each side (red and white) must be equal. This is because the water added to the red buckets must equal the water added to the white buckets.   - Therefore, (a = b) since the total amount of water on each side must be equal.6. Disconnected subgraph analysis:   - If the subgraph is not connected, we can split it into connected components. Each connected component must satisfy the condition that the total amount of water on each side is equal.   - This implies that within each connected component, the number of red buckets must equal the number of white buckets.7. Conclusion for the given problem:   - Given (a = 100) red buckets, for the subgraph to be connected, we must have (b = 100) white buckets.   - If the subgraph is disconnected, each connected component must have an equal number of red and white buckets. Since we have 100 red buckets, the only way to satisfy this condition is to have 100 white buckets.Therefore, the only possible value of (k) is 100.The final answer is (boxed{100})"},{"problem":"6.

Find the maximum possible value of [ sum_{1 leqslant r<s leqslant 2 n}(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} ]where ( -1 leqslant x_{i} leqslant 1 ) for all ( i=1,2, ldots, 2 n ).","solution":"Let Z be the expression to be maximized. Since this expression is linear in every variable x_{i} and -1 leqslant x_{i} leqslant 1, the maximum of Z will be achieved when x_{i}=-1 or 1. Therefore, it suffices to consider only the case when x_{i} in{-1,1} for all i=1,2, ldots, 2 n. For i=1,2, ldots, 2 n, we introduce auxiliary variables  y_{i}=sum_{r=1}^{i} x_{r}-sum_{r=i+1}^{2 n} x_{r} Taking squares of both sides, we have  begin{aligned} y_{i}^{2} & =sum_{r=1}^{2 n} x_{r}^{2}+sum_{r<s leqslant i} 2 x_{r} x_{s}+sum_{i<r<s} 2 x_{r} x_{s}-sum_{r leqslant i<s} 2 x_{r} x_{s}  & =2 n+sum_{r<s leqslant i} 2 x_{r} x_{s}+sum_{i<r<s} 2 x_{r} x_{s}-sum_{r leqslant i<s} 2 x_{r} x_{s}, end{aligned} where the last equality follows from the fact that x_{r} in{-1,1}. Notice that for every r<s, the coefficient of x_{r} x_{s} in (1) is 2 for each i=1, ldots, r-1, s, ldots, 2 n, and this coefficient is -2 for each i=r, ldots, s-1. This implies that the coefficient of x_{r} x_{s} in sum_{i=1}^{2 n} y_{i}^{2} is 2(2 n-s+r)-2(s-r)= 4(n-s+r). Therefore, summing (1) for i=1,2, ldots, 2 n yields  sum_{i=1}^{2 n} y_{i}^{2}=4 n^{2}+sum_{1 leqslant r<s leqslant 2 n} 4(n-s+r) x_{r} x_{s}=4 n^{2}-4 Z Hence, it suffices to find the minimum of the left-hand side. Since x_{r} in{-1,1}, we see that y_{i} is an even integer. In addition, y_{i}-y_{i-1}=2 x_{i}= pm 2, and so y_{i-1} and y_{i} are consecutive even integers for every i=2,3, ldots, 2 n. It follows that y_{i-1}^{2}+y_{i}^{2} geqslant 4, which implies  sum_{i=1}^{2 n} y_{i}^{2}=sum_{j=1}^{n}left(y_{2 j-1}^{2}+y_{2 j}^{2}right) geqslant 4 n Combining (2) and (3), we get  4 n leqslant sum_{i=1}^{2 n} y_{i}^{2}=4 n^{2}-4 Z Hence, Z leqslant n(n-1). If we set x_{i}=1 for odd indices i and x_{i}=-1 for even indices i, then we obtain equality in (3) (and thus in (4)). Therefore, the maximum possible value of Z is n(n-1), as desired. Comment 1. Z=n(n-1) can be achieved by several other examples. In particular, x_{i} needs not be pm 1. For instance, setting x_{i}=(-1)^{i} for all 2 leqslant i leqslant 2 n, we find that the coefficient of x_{1} in Z is 0. Therefore, x_{1} can be chosen arbitrarily in the interval [-1,1]. Nevertheless, if x_{i} in{-1,1} for all i=1,2, ldots, 2 n, then the equality Z=n(n-1) holds only when left(y_{1}, y_{2}, ldots, y_{2 n}right)=(0, pm 2,0, pm 2, ldots, 0, pm 2) or ( pm 2,0, pm 2,0, ldots, pm 2,0). In each case, we can reconstruct x_{i} accordingly. The sum sum_{i=1}^{2 n} x_{i} in the optimal cases needs not be 0, but it must equal 0 or pm 2.Comment 2. Several variations in setting up the auxiliary variables are possible. For instance, one may let x_{2 n+i}=-x_{i} and y_{i}^{prime}=x_{i}+x_{i+1}+cdots+x_{i+n-1} for any 1 leqslant i leqslant 2 n. Similarly to Solution 1, we obtain Y:=y_{1}^{prime 2}+y_{2}^{prime 2}+cdots+y_{2 n}^{prime 2}=2 n^{2}-2 Z. Then, it suffices to show that Y geqslant 2 n. If n is odd, then each y_{i}^{prime} is odd, and so y_{i}^{prime 2} geqslant 1. If n is even, then each y_{i}^{prime} is even. We can check that at least one of y_{i}^{prime}, y_{i+1}^{prime}, y_{n+i}^{prime}, and y_{n+i+1}^{prime} is nonzero, so that y_{i}^{prime 2}+y_{i+1}^{prime 2}+y_{n+i}^{prime 2}+y_{n+i+1}^{prime 2} geqslant 4; summing these up for i=1,3, ldots, n-1 yields Y geqslant 2 n."},{"problem":"7.

Understanding the Geometry:   - The river forms a right-angle bend, creating a square at the bend.   - The sides of the square are of length ( a ), which is the distance between the parallel banks of the river.2. Positioning the Boat:   - The boat must navigate through the bend without intersecting the banks.   - The longest possible boat will be the one that can be positioned diagonally across the square formed at the bend.3.

Each card has a nonnegative integer written on it, and any two cards show relatively prime numbers. Compute the smallest possible value of the sum of the numbers on Leonhard's cards.Note: Two integers are relatively prime if no positive integer other than 1 divides both numbers.[i]Proposed by ABCDE and Tristan Shin","solution":"1. Understanding the problem: We need to find the smallest possible sum of five nonnegative integers such that any two of them are relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.2. Considering the smallest nonnegative integers: The smallest nonnegative integer is 0. However, 0 is not relatively prime with any other number except 1. This is because the gcd of 0 and any number (a) is (a), and the only number (a) such that (gcd(0, a) = 1) is (a = 1).3. Using 0 and 1: If we use 0 as one of the numbers, the other four numbers must be 1 to ensure that all pairs are relatively prime. This is because (gcd(0, 1) = 1) and (gcd(1, 1) = 1).4. Summing the numbers: The sum of the numbers in this case is (0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4).5. Verification: We need to verify that this is indeed the smallest possible sum. If we try to use any other set of numbers, we must ensure that all pairs are relatively prime.

Notice that for each new current rectangle, both the width and the height are 1 cm larger than the previous one. Initially, when there was only one sheet of paper, the width of the large rectangle was 8 cm, and at the end, it was 80 cm. Thus, a total of (80-8): 1=72 sheets of paper were added. The height of the current rectangle also increased by 72 cdot 1 cm, initially it was 5, so x=5+72=77.Solution II. As in the first solution, let's look at the length and width of the current rectangles. Again, notice that for each new current rectangle, both the length and the width are 1 cm larger than the previous one. However, we will draw a different conclusion: specifically, the difference between the width and the height of the current rectangle is always the same! (Such a value that does not change during a certain process is called an invariant.)

What is the average value of the flux of the positive integers from 1 to 999, inclusive?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We need to calculate the average flux of the positive integers from 1 to 999.   - Flux is defined as the number of times the digits of a number change from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, ignoring consecutive equal digits.2. Analyzing Flux for Different Digit Lengths:   - For one-digit numbers (1 to 9), the flux is always 0.   - For two-digit numbers (10 to 99), the flux is also always 0 because there are only two digits, and they can either be increasing or decreasing but not both.   - For three-digit numbers (100 to 999), the flux can be either 0 or 1.3. Counting Flux for Three-Digit Numbers:   - To have a flux of 0 in a three-digit number, the digits must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.   - If there is no repetition, the number of strictly increasing sequences of three digits is given by binom{10}{3} (choosing 3 different digits out of 10 and arranging them in increasing order).   - Similarly, the number of strictly decreasing sequences of three digits is given by binom{9}{3} (choosing 3 different digits out of 9 and arranging them in decreasing order).4.

Calculating Combinations with Repetitions:   [   2binom{10}{2} = 2 times frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = 2 times frac{10 times 9}{2 times 1} = 90   ]   [   2binom{9}{2} = 2 times frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = 2 times frac{9 times 8}{2 times 1} = 72   ]7.

The man with the lamb was therefore somewhat shortchanged. To make up for it, the second man gave him his harmonica. How much is the harmonica worth?","solution":"Solution. The revenue from sales equals x^{2} dollars. If x were divisible by 6, then x^{2} would be divisible by 36, and consequently, by 12. Since this is not the case, x is not divisible by 6. In this case, x=12 k+r, where |r|=1,2,3,4 or 5. Accordingly,frac{x^{2}}{12}=frac{(12 k+r)^{2}}{12}=frac{144 k^{2}+24 k r+r^{2}}{12}=12 k^{2}+2 k r+frac{r^{2}}{12}Now, since both people have the same number of animals, the total number of animals is even, which means there is an odd number of sheep and one lamb. Therefore, the quotient of dividing the number x^{2} by 12, which equals the number of sheep bought for x^{2} dollars, must be an odd number. But 12 k^{2}+2 k r is an even number. Therefore, the number r^{2} / 12 must contribute an odd value to the quotient. This implies that r^{2} must exceed 12, leading to |r|=4 or 5. For |r|=5 we havefrac{r^{2}}{12}=frac{25}{12}=2+frac{1}{12}80giving an even number as the contribution to the quotient. Therefore, |r| must be 4 and r^{2}=16. Thus,frac{r^{2}}{12}=frac{16}{12}=1+frac{4}{12}and the remainder is 4 (not -4). Therefore, the lamb costs 4 dollars.

Analyze the connections:   - For every town in ( N(A) ), there must be a direct route to at least one town in ( R(A) ) to satisfy the condition that there is a common town connected to both.   - The total number of possible connections from towns in ( R(A) ) to towns in ( N(A) ) is ( k(k-1) ) because each of the ( k ) towns in ( R(A) ) can connect to ( k-1 ) other towns (excluding ( A )).4. Set up the inequality:   - The number of connections from ( R(A) ) to ( N(A) ) must be at least ( 24 - k ) to ensure that every town in ( N(A) ) is connected to at least one town in ( R(A) ).   - Therefore, we have the inequality:     [     k(k-1) geq 24 - k     ]5. Solve the inequality:   [   k(k-1) geq 24 - k   ]   [   k^2 - k geq 24 - k   ]   [   k^2 geq 24   ]   [   k geq sqrt{24}   ]   [   k geq 5   ]6. Check the smallest integer ( k ):   - Since ( k ) must be an integer, we check ( k = 5 ) and ( k = 6 ).7. Verify ( k = 5 ):   - If ( k = 5 ), then ( k(k-1) = 5 times 4 = 20 ).   - We need ( 20 geq 24 - 5 ), which simplifies to ( 20 geq 19 ), which is true.   - However, we need to ensure that the graph structure satisfies the condition for all pairs of towns.8. Verify ( k = 6 ):   - If ( k = 6 ), then ( k(k-1) = 6 times 5 = 30 ).   - We need ( 30 geq 24 - 6 ), which simplifies to ( 30 geq 18 ), which is true.   - Petersen's graph is a known graph that satisfies these conditions with ( k = 6 ).Therefore, the smallest ( k ) that satisfies the conditions is ( k = 6 ).The final answer is ( boxed{6} )."},{"problem":"9 cdot 24 For any varphi inleft(0, frac{pi}{2}right), we have(A) sin sin varphicos varphi>cos cos varphi.(C) sin cos varphi>cos varphi>operatorname{cossin} varphi.(D) sin cos varphi<cos varphi<operatorname{cossin} varphi.(China High School Mathematics League, 1982)","solution":"[Solution] In left(0, frac{pi}{2}right), sin x, cos x have the following properties:(1) sin x sin varphi, and from (2) we have cos varphi < cos sin varphi.Thus, sin cos varphi < cos varphi < cos sin varphi.Therefore, the answer is (D)."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function L(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),n(x,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),w(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",M,"See more"))],8,z)):v("",!0)])}const E=f(F,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-2facd42c"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/4.md","filePath":"quotes/4.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/4.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[_(E)]))}});export{O as __pageData,G as default};
