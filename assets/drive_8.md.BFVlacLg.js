Let the distance between the village and the city be S, the speed of the truck be x, and the speed of the car be y. The time until the first meeting is frac{S}{x+y}, so the distance from the village to the actual meeting point is frac{S x}{x+y}.In the first hypothetical scenario, the truck will travel 0.75 x kilometers in 45 minutes, meaning it will take another frac{S-0.75 x}{x+y} hours to reach the expected first meeting point, and the truck will travel another frac{(S-0.75 x) x}{x+y} kilometers.

First Equation from the Total Cost:   - We are told that the total cost of one bottle of each size is 96 cents.   - Let's denote the price of a medium bottle as m cents.   - Since we already have x for a small bottle and y for a large bottle, the total cost equation becomes:   x + m + y = 962. Second Equation from the Medium and Small Bottles Relationship:   - One medium bottle is 20 cents cheaper than two small bottles. This can be written as:   m = 2x - 203. Third Equation from the Large Bottle's Cost:   - One large bottle is 40 cents more expensive than one medium bottle and one small bottle combined. This gives us:   y = m + x + 404. Substituting m from the Second Equation into the First and Third Equations:   - Substituting m = 2x - 20 into the total cost equation, we get:   x + (2x - 20) + y = 96   Simplifying, we find:   3x + y = 116   However, we need to correct this based on the given total cost, which is 96 cents, not 116 cents. So, correctly, substituting m directly into the total cost equation without the incorrect manipulation should give us the correct system of equations directly related to the given and the correct total cost. The mistake in calculation led to an incorrect intermediate step. The correct approach is to focus on the relationships given directly:   - From the problem's description, we have:     - m = 2x - 20     - y = m + x + 40   - And the total cost directly leads us to consider how these relationships translate into a system of equations without the incorrect intermediate step that was initially introduced.5. Correctly Deriving the System of Equations:   - Given the correct understanding of the problem, we directly derive the system of equations based on the relationships and the total cost:     - The first relationship tells us about the cost difference between medium and small bottles.     - The second relationship tells us about the cost difference between the large bottle and the combination of a medium and a small bottle.     - The total cost gives us a direct equation involving all three sizes.   Therefore, considering the relationships correctly and the total cost, the system of equations that represents the situation accurately is:   left{begin{array}{l}{3x+y=96}{y-3x=2}end{array}right.However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the total cost used in the solution process and the final system of equations provided in the options. The correct approach is to align the equations with the given information about price relationships and the total cost accurately. The provided solution directly jumps to the system of equations without showing the detailed step of deriving them based on the total cost and the price relationships as described.

There is exactly one road connecting each pair of towns.

We claim that any configuration which does not have a town whose roads all lead into it or lead out of it does satisfy the given conditions. Now we show that a loop of 3 or more towns exist. Pick a town, then choose a neighboring town to travel to 5 times. Of these 6 towns visited, at least two of them must be the same; therefore there must exist a loop of 3 or more towns because a loop of 2 towns cannot exist. We want to show that the loop can be reached from any town, and any town can be reached from the loop.textbf{Case 1}. The loop has 5 towns.Clearly every town can be reached by going around the loop.textbf{Case 2}. The loop has 4 towns.The town not on the loop must have a road leading to it. This road comes from a town on the loop. Therefore this town can be reached from the loop. This town not on the loop must also have a road leading out of it. This road leads to a town on the loop. Therefore the loop can be reached from the town.textbf{Case 3}. The loop has 3 towns.There are two towns not on the loop; call them Town A and Town B. Without loss of generality assume A leads to B. Because a road must lead to A, the town where this road comes from must be on the loop. Therefore A and therefore B can be reached from the loop. Because a road must lead out of B, the town it leads to must be on the loop. Therefore the loop can be reached from B and also A.The number of good configurations is the total number of configurations minus the number of bad configurations. There are 2^{{5choose2}} total configurations. To find the number of bad configurations in which a town exists such that all roads lead to it, there are 5 ways to choose this town and 2^6 ways to assign the six other roads that do not connect to this town. The same logic is used to find the number of bad configurations in which a town exists such that all roads lead out of it. It might be tempting to conclude that there are 5 cdot 2^6+5 cdot 2^6 bad configurations, but the configurations in which there exists a town such that all roads lead to it and a town such that all roads lead out of it are overcounted. There are 5 ways to choose the town for which all roads lead to it, 4 ways to choose the town for which all roads lead out of it, and 2^3 ways to assign the remaining 3 roads not connected to either of these towns.

Let's assume the line equation is frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{a} = 1, which simplifies to x + y = a.  Since the line passes through the point (2, 5), plugging in these coordinates yields 2 + 5 = a, which leads to a = 7.  Therefore, the line equation in this scenario is x + y = 7.We can now express both scenarios with standard linear equations:For Scenario 1: Multiplying both sides of y = frac{5}{2}x by 2 gives us 2y = 5x, which can be rewritten as 5x - 2y = 0.  For Scenario 2: The equation x + y = 7 can be rewritten directly as x + y - 7 = 0.As such, the line equation can be either y = frac{5}{2}x or x + y = 7.

Several segments parallel to the sides are drawn inside it, such that no two segments lie on the same line and do not intersect at a point that is internal for both segments. It turns out that the segments divide the square into rectangles, and any vertical line intersecting the square and not containing segments of the partition intersects exactly k rectangles of the partition, while any horizontal line intersecting the square and not containing segments of the partition intersects exactly ell rectangles. What could be the number of rectangles in the partition?","solution":"Answer. k ell.First solution. Take a horizontal line h passing through the top side of the square, and move it downwards. Consider the moment when it passes through some segment I of the partition (by the condition, such a segment is unique at this moment; let a rectangles be adjacent to it from above and b from below). The number of rectangles intersected by h at this moment decreases by a and increases by b; since it should not change, we get that a=b.Now let's prove that the number of rectangles is k ell, by induction on k. If k=1, the statement is obvious. Suppose now k>1. Consider all the rectangles of the partition adjacent to the bottom side of the square; there are ell of them, because a horizontal line passing close enough to this side intersects exactly them. Divide them into groups of consecutive rectangles of equal height (see Fig. 6). The upper boundary of each such group is one segment.Consider one such group with the upper segment I. Note that the vertical segments bounding this group continue above I. Indeed, otherwise, say, the upper end of the left vertical segment J lies on I; then to the right of J there is one rectangle, and to the left - more than one (since J is a boundary for the group). This is impossible.Remove this group, and \\"extend\\" the rectangles lying above I to the bottom side of the square. Since the same number of rectangles are adjacent to I from above and below, any horizontal line will still intersect ell rectangles.Perform this operation with each group (see Fig. 7). We will remove exactly ell rectangles; meanwhile, each vertical line will intersect one rectangle less than before, that is, k-1 rectangles. By the induction hypothesis, the total number of rectangles will become (k-1) ell, which means that before the reconstruction it was (k-1) ell + ell = k ell, as required.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-4.jpg?height=183&width=315&top_left_y=840&top_left_x=236)Fig. 6![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-4.jpg?height=183&width=327&top_left_y=840&top_left_x=593)Fig. 7![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-4.jpg?height=196&width=324&top_left_y=838&top_left_x=949)Fig. 8Second solution. Consider any rectangle P of the partition and a vertical line v intersecting it (not containing a segment of the partition). Let v intersect i-1 rectangles of the partition lying above P; in this case, we say that P has a vertical number i on the line v. Similarly, define the horizontal number of the rectangle P on a horizontal line intersecting it.Consider any horizontal segment I of the partition and move the vertical line v intersecting I from left to right. Consider the moment when v contains some segment of the partition (lying above or below I). As shown at the beginning of the previous solution, the same number of rectangles are adjacent to this segment from both sides. Therefore, the vertical number of any rectangle P adjacent to I does not change at this moment; moreover, the numbers of adjacent rectangles on the same side of I are equal, and for those adjacent on different sides, it differs by 1. Thus, any rectangle P has the same number on all vertical lines containing it. Similar statements are true for horizontal numbers.Now fix a number i and consider all rectangles P_{1}, ldots, P_{x} having a vertical number i (let them be numbered according to the abscissas of their left boundaries from left to right). Move the vertical line v from the left side of the square to the right. At each moment (except those when it contains a segment of the partition), v intersects exactly one of the rectangles P_{s}; therefore, the right side of the next rectangle P_{s+1} lies on the same line as the left side of the previous rectangle P_{s} (see Fig. 8). Then these rectangles are adjacent to the same vertical segment of the partition from different sides, so the horizontal number of the rectangle P_{s+1} is 1 more than the horizontal number of P_{s}. It is clear, finally, that the horizontal numbers of the rectangles P_{1} and P_{x} are 1 and ell; therefore, x=ell.Thus, for each of the k vertical numbers, there are exactly ell rectangles with that number; therefore, the total number of rectangles is k ell.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8b5e293e563ce6c828ceg-5.jpg?height=216&width=474&top_left_y=1158&top_left_x=513)Fig. 9Remark.

Understanding the Problem:   We have 12 friends playing a tennis tournament where each player plays exactly one game with each of the other 11 players. The winner of each game gets 1 point, and the loser gets 0 points. We need to find the maximum possible value of the sum ( Sigma_3 = B_1^3 + B_2^3 + cdots + B_{12}^3 ), where ( B_i ) represents the points of the ( i )-th player.2. Total Points Calculation:   Each player plays 11 games, so there are a total of ( binom{12}{2} = 66 ) games. Since each game awards 1 point to the winner, the total number of points distributed among all players is 66. Therefore, we have:   [   B_1 + B_2 + cdots + B_{12} = 66   ]3. Maximizing the Sum of Cubes:   To maximize ( Sigma_3 = B_1^3 + B_2^3 + cdots + B_{12}^3 ), we should distribute the points as unevenly as possible. This is because the function ( f(x) = x^3 ) is convex, and by Jensen's inequality, the sum of cubes is maximized when the distribution of points is as extreme as possible.4. Optimal Distribution:   The most extreme distribution of points, given that the total sum is 66, is to have one player with 11 points, another with 10 points, another with 9 points, and so on down to one player with 0 points. This distribution is:   [   B_1 = 11, B_2 = 10, B_3 = 9, ldots, B_{12} = 0   ]5.

The distance |AB| is equal to 2a, where a is the semi-major axis of the ellipse. Therefore, we have 2a = 4.2. The relationship between the semi-major axis a, the semi-minor axis b, and the linear eccentricity c is given by a^2 = b^2 + c^2.3. The eccentricity e of the ellipse is defined as e = frac{c}{a}.Combining these facts, we have:[begin{align*}frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}cdotfrac{c}{a} &= 4, 2a &= 4.end{align*}]Solving these equations, we find:[begin{align*}a &= 2, a^2 &= 4, b^2 &= a^2 - c^2 = 4 - c^2.end{align*}]Given that frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}e = 4 and e = frac{c}{a}, we can solve for b^2 to find that b^2 = 1. Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse C is:[boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}.]Part (2): Finding the Maximum Area of triangle APMGiven points A(-2,0) and B(2,0) on the ellipse, let P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2) be points on the ellipse. The slopes of lines AP and QB are k_1 and k_2 respectively, with k_1 = 7k_2. The equations of lines AP and QB can be written as:[begin{align*}AP: x &= t_1y - 2, QB: x &= t_2y + 2.end{align*}]Substituting these into the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1 and solving for y_1 and y_2, we find:[begin{align*}y_1 &= frac{4t_1}{t_1^2 + 4}, y_2 &= -frac{4t_2}{t_2^2 + 4}.end{align*}]Given that k_1 = 7k_2, and knowing that k_{AP} = frac{1}{t_1} and k_{BQ} = frac{1}{t_2}, we find t_2 = 7t_1.To find the x-coordinate of point M where line PQ intersects the x-axis, we use the collinearity condition frac{x_1 - x_0}{y_1} = frac{x_2 - x_0}{y_2} and solve for x_0, obtaining:[x_0 = -frac{3}{2}.]Thus, point M is located at (-frac{3}{2}, 0).The area of triangle APM is given by frac{1}{2} times base times height = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times |y_1|.

This means that, for every ( x > 0 ), there exists a unique ( y > 0 ) such that[ frac{x}{y} + frac{y}{x} leqslant 2, ]namely ( y = x ). Let now ( f: mathbb{R}_{>0} rightarrow mathbb{R}_{>0} ) be a function that satisfies the condition of the problem statement.

If ( (x, y) ) is good, then ( x = y ). Proof. Assume that there exist positive real numbers ( x neq y ) such that ( (x, y) ) is good. The uniqueness assumption says that ( y ) is the unique positive real number such that ( (x, y) ) is good. In particular, ( (x, x) ) is not a good pair. This means that[ x f(x) + x f(x) > 2 ]and thus ( x f(x) > 1 ). Similarly, ( (y, x) ) is a good pair, so ( (y, y) ) is not a good pair, which implies ( y f(y) > 1 ).

Since the ratio of the number of quarters to the number of dimes to the number of nickels that she has is 9: 3: 1, then she must have 3 n dimes and 9 n quarters.This tells us that the total value of her coins in cents is (9 n times 25)+(3 n times 10)+(n times 5)=260 n.Since we know that the total value of her coins is 1820 cents, then 260 n=1820 or n=7.Therefore, she has 7 nickels, 21 dimes and 63 quarters, or 91 coins in total.ANSWER: (D)"},{"problem":"If x neq 0, frac x{2} = y^2 and frac{x}{4} = 4y, then x equalstextbf{(A)} 8qquad textbf{(B)} 16qquad textbf{(C)} 32qquad textbf{(D)} 64qquad textbf{(E)} 128","solution":"From frac{x}{4} = 4y, we get x=16y.

We can assume that a > b (if two adjacent sides were equal, the angle bisectors would intersect at a single point rather than forming a quadrilateral).We know that 2 alpha + 2 beta = 180^{circ}, because the sum of the adjacent angles in a parallelogram is 180^{circ}. In the triangle A E D,A E D varangle = 180^{circ} - (E A D varangle + E D A varangle) = 180^{circ} - (alpha + beta) = 90^{circ}Therefore, H E F varangle = A E D varangle = 90^{circ}. Similarly, we can show that all the angles of the quadrilateral EFGH are right angles, so the quadrilateral is a rectangle. E is the intersection of the angle bisectors from D and A, so it is equidistant from the lines C D, D A, and A B. Thus, E lies on the midline of the parallelogram parallel to A B and C D. Similarly, G also lies on this midline, so E G parallel C D; furthermore, F H parallel A D.Let M be the intersection of the angle bisector from A and the line C D. The triangle A M D is isosceles because the angle bisector from D is perpendicular to A M. Therefore, D M = b, and C M = C D - M D = a - b. Since E M parallel G C and E G parallel C M, the quadrilateral E G C M is a parallelogram, so E G = C M = a - b.

Number of Terms in the Sequence:   The number of terms ( k ) in the sequence can be found using:   [   a_k = a + (k-1)d implies 2008 = 2 + (k-1) cdot 2 implies 2008 = 2k implies k = 1004   ]Conclusion:The number of positive integers ( n ) such that ( 1 leq n leq 2008 ) and the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 4n}) can be divided into ( n ) disjoint 4-element subsets each containing its arithmetic mean is ( boxed{1004} )."},{"problem":"Four distinct integers a, b, c, d have a product abcd = 49.

The smallest such matrix is a ( 2 times 2 ) nilpotent matrix, for example:[ A_1 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1  0 & 0 end{pmatrix} ]Thus, ( n_1 = 2 ), and ( 2 = 2^1 ).Inductive Step:Assume that for some ( k geq 1 ), ( n_k geq 2^k ). We need to show that ( n_{k+1} geq 2^{k+1} ).Consider ( n_{k+1} times n_{k+1} ) matrices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{k+1} ) satisfying the conditions. Let ( V ) be an ( L )-vector space of dimension ( n_{k+1} ) on which the ( A_i ) act. The kernel of ( A_1 ), denoted ( ker(A_1) ), has dimension at least ( frac{n_{k+1}}{2} ) because ( A_1^2 = 0 ) implies that the range of ( A_1 ) is contained in ( ker(A_1) ).Since all ( A_i ) commute, ( ker(A_1) ) is invariant under all ( A_i ). Let ( V' = V / ker(A_1) ), which has dimension at most ( frac{n_{k+1}}{2} ). The matrices ( A_2, ldots, A_{k+1} ) act on ( V' ) and satisfy the same conditions. By the induction hypothesis, the dimension of ( V' ) must be at least ( 2^k ). Therefore:[ frac{n_{k+1}}{2} geq 2^k ][ n_{k+1} geq 2^{k+1} ]Thus, by induction, ( n_k geq 2^k ) for all ( k ). Step 2: Establishing the Upper Bound ( n_k leq 2^k )We need to construct ( n_k times n_k ) matrices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ) that satisfy the conditions with ( n_k = 2^k ).Consider the algebra ( mathcal{A} = L[x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k] / (x_1^2, x_2^2, ldots, x_k^2) ). This algebra has dimension ( 2^k ) over ( L ), with a basis consisting of all products of distinct ( x_i ) (including the empty product, which is the multiplicative unit).Define ( A_i ) to be the matrix representation of multiplication by ( x_i ) in ( mathcal{A} ). These matrices satisfy:1. ( A_i^2 = 0 ) because ( x_i^2 = 0 ) in ( mathcal{A} ).2. ( A_i A_j = A_j A_i ) because multiplication in ( mathcal{A} ) is commutative.3. ( A_1 A_2 ldots A_k neq 0 ) because the product ( x_1 x_2 ldots x_k ) is a non-zero element in ( mathcal{A} ).Thus, ( n_k = 2^k ) is achievable.

First, note that: a) in one question, without knowing the total number of males, we cannot figure out even two turtles; b) knowing the total number of males, we can figure out two, but not three turtles. Therefore, in the situation with four turtles and two questions, asking the first question about all turtles at once or about one turtle is meaningless. Since when asking about a group of three or two turtles, we can hear an answer of 1, such a question will also not lead to success.| Rating | Score | Content of the criterion || :---: | :---: | :--- || + | 20 | Complete solution || +/- | 14 | Correct answer, but not proven that it cannot be less || +/ 2 | 10 | Correct answer with minor flaws in the solution and not proven that it cannot be less || .- | 4 | Attempt to analyze cases with 2 and 3 questions, but made an incorrect conclusion that the minimum number is 4 || - | 0 | Solution is completely incorrect/only answer |"},{"problem":"15.

Solution. The problem can also be solved without equations. By the time the person reaches A from C, the train also reaches A. Thus, if the person runs towards B, in the time it takes for the train to reach A, he covers the same distance as the distance from C to A, which is one-third of the AB segment. Therefore, he has already covered two-thirds of the way to B, and only one-third remains. While covering this third, the train travels from A to B, covering the entire AB distance. Thus, the person's speed is one-third of the train's speed, which is 10 mathrm{~km} / hour.Remarks. 1. The solution does not provide the length of the considered segments. The only given relationship is sufficient to determine the unknown sought.2.

Identify the given information and properties:   - ABCD is an inscribed trapezoid with AB parallel CD.   - m(widehat{AOD}) = 60^circ.   - The altitude (height) of the trapezoid is 10.2. Use the property of inscribed trapezoids:   - Since ABCD is an inscribed trapezoid, the non-parallel sides AD and BC are equal, i.e., AD = BC.3. Analyze the given angle:   - The angle m(widehat{AOD}) = 60^circ is given. Since O is the center of the circle, widehat{AOD} is a central angle.   - This implies that the arc AD subtended by widehat{AOD} is 60^circ.4. Determine the lengths of the diagonals:   - Since ABCD is an inscribed trapezoid, the diagonals AC and BD are equal. Let AC = BD = d.5.

Determine the number of halfish subsets of the set M.(Josef Tkadlec)","solution":"SOLUTION. We will treat all numbers as residue classes modulo the prime number 43.First, we note that the sets mathrm{P} and mathrm{Q} form a disjoint partition of the set mathrm{M}. Let mathrm{P} be the half-set and let x in mathrm{P}, for which then 7 x in mathbf{Q}.We will show that 7^{2} x in mathrm{P}. If we assume the opposite, that 7^{2} x in mathrm{Q}, then there exists y in mathrm{P} such that 7^{2} x=7 y. According to the guiding problem mathrm{N} 2, such a y is uniquely determined, and thus it is 7 x. Since 7 x notin mathrm{P}, we get the required contradiction.Then, of course, 7^{3} x in mathrm{Q}, and by repeating the previous argument, we will show that 7^{4} x in mathrm{P}, and subsequently 7^{5} x in mathrm{Q}. In principle, we could continue this way further, however, 7^{6} x equiv 49^{3} x equiv 6^{3} x equiv x(bmod 43), thus closing the \\"cycle\\". The cyclic sextet (of different) numbers left(x, 7 x, 7^{2} x, 7^{3} x, 7^{4} x, 7^{5} xright) has the arrangement (mathrm{P}, mathrm{Q}, mathrm{P}, mathrm{Q}, mathrm{P}, mathrm{Q}).We will now divide the set mathrm{M} into seven such cyclic sextets asbegin{array}{ccc}(1,7,6,42,36,37), quad(2,14,12,41,29,31), & (3,21,18,40,22,25), (4,28,24,39,15,19), & (5,35,30,38,8,13), & (9,20,11,34,23,32),end{array}(10,27,17,33,16,26) text {. }Each of these sextets will have the arrangement either (P, Q, P, Q, P, Q) or (Q, P, Q, P, Q, P), and each such choice will determine the sets P and Q satisfying the conditions of the problem. The number of possibilities is thus 2^{7}=128.Note. In fact, it is not necessary to find seven cyclic sextets directly. It is enough to prove the existence of such a partition of the set mathrm{M}. This follows from two partial statements:(i) Every element of mathrm{M} is an element of some sextet.(ii) If two sextets have one element in common, then they have all elements in common.The validity of the first statement is immediate and for the proof of the second, it is enough to realize that according to the construction, the sextets are closed under multiplication by 7, and one common element thus \\"generates\\" the other five common elements by successive multiplication by seven.GUIDING AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:N1.

Given points are A(7,sqrt{3}) and B(1,sqrt{3}).- Step 1: The perpendicular bisector of line segment AB would pass through the midpoint of AB and be perpendicular to AB. Since A and B have the same y-coordinate, the perpendicular bisector is vertical and thus is of the form x = k. The midpoint of AB is left(frac{7+1}{2}, sqrt{3}right) = (4, sqrt{3}), so the perpendicular bisector is x=4.- Step 2: The line tangent to circle C at B and perpendicular to sqrt{3}x - y = 0 can be found using the slope. The slope of sqrt{3}x - y = 0 is sqrt{3}, so the slope of the perpendicular line is -frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. Using point-slope form, the equation of this line is x + sqrt{3}y - 4 = 0.- Step 3: Solving the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}x=4 x+sqrt{3}y-4=0end{array}right. gives us the center of the circle C(4,0).- Step 4: The radius r can be found by calculating the distance between C(4,0) and A(7,sqrt{3}), which is r = |AC| = sqrt{(7-4)^2 + (sqrt{3}-0)^2} = sqrt{9 + 3} = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}.- Step 5: Therefore, the standard equation of circle C is (x-4)^{2}+y^{2}=12.boxed{(x-4)^{2}+y^{2}=12} is the standard equation of circle C.# Part (2): Proving frac{{|PM|}}{{|PN|}} is a Constant Value- Step 1: From part (1), we have the equation of circle C as (x-4)^{2}+y^{2}=12, which can be rewritten as x^{2}+y^{2}-8x+4=0 or x^{2}+y^{2}=8x-4.- Step 2: For a point P(x,y) on circle C, the distance |PM| from P to M(-2,0) is |PM|=sqrt{(x+2)^{2}+y^{2}}=sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+4x+4}. Substituting x^{2}+y^{2}=8x-4 into this expression gives |PM|=sqrt{12x}.- Step 3: Similarly, the distance |PN| from P to N(2,0) is |PN|=sqrt{(x-2)^{2}+y^{2}}=sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+4}. Substituting x^{2}+y^{2}=8x-4 into this expression gives |PN|=sqrt{4x}.- Step 4: Therefore, the ratio frac{{|PM|}}{{|PN|}} = frac{{sqrt{12x}}}{{sqrt{4x}}} = sqrt{3}, which is a constant.boxed{frac{{|PM|}}{{|PN|}} = sqrt{3}} is a constant value, proving the statement."},{"problem":"3. odot O is tangent to the three sides of triangle A B C at points D, E, F.

Periodicity Analysis: The function f(x) has a period of pi, which means that the behavior of f(x) repeats every pi units. Therefore, it suffices to analyze the function within one period, specifically for x in [0, pi].2. Derivative Calculation: To understand how the function behaves within this interval, we calculate its derivative:   [   f'(x) = -2sin x cos x sin 2x + 2cos^2 x cos 2x = 2cos x cos 3x.   ]   This derivative helps us identify where the function's slope changes, indicating local maxima, minima, or points of inflection.3. Critical Points Identification: The derivative f'(x) = 2cos x cos 3x has three zeros within the interval [0, pi], which are x = frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{2}, frac{5pi}{6}. These points are where the function changes its monotonicity.4. Monotonicity and Function Values:   - On the interval (0, frac{pi}{6}), f(x) is monotonically increasing.   - On the interval (frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{6}), f(x) is monotonically decreasing.   - On the interval (frac{5pi}{6}, pi), f(x) is monotonically increasing again.   - Evaluating f(x) at critical points and endpoints, we get:     - f(0) = 0     - fleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = frac{3sqrt{3}}{8}     - fleft(frac{5pi}{6}right) = -frac{3sqrt{3}}{8}     - f(pi) = 05. Range Determination: Considering the values of f(x) at the critical points and the behavior of the function, we conclude that the range of f(x) is the interval from the minimum value -frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} to the maximum value frac{3sqrt{3}}{8}.Therefore, the range of the function f(x) = sin 2x cos^2 x is boxed{[-frac{3sqrt{3}}{8}, frac{3sqrt{3}}{8}]}."},{"problem":"Given in triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are respectively a, b, and c, and it satisfies 2acos A = ccdotcos B + bcdotcos C, and the radius of its circumcircle is R=2.(1) Find the size of angle A;  (2) If b^{2}+c^{2}=18, find the area of triangle ABC.","solution":"(The total score for this question is 12 points)Solution:  (1) Since 2acos A = ccos B + bcos C,  by the sine rule, we have 2sin Acdotcos A = sin Ccos B + sin Bcos C,  thus 2sin Acdotcos A = sin (B+C) = sin A,  and since 0 < A < pi, we can get sin A neq 0,  therefore 2cos A = 1, which gives cos A= dfrac {1}{2}.

What is the probability that the digit 5 appears among the first n digits of the selected number in its decimal form?","solution":"I. solution. Random selection is to be understood as follows: the probability that the selected number falls into any subinterval [a, b], [a, b), (a, b], or (a, b) of the [0 ; 1] interval is equal to the length |b-a| of the interval.If the first n digits of the selected number in its decimal form include the digit 5, then the selected number will be called a \\"good number\\". Let's try to form a picture of the distribution of good numbers. If a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} are digits different from 5 and k leqq n-1, then every number in the right-open interval left[0, a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{k} 5 ; 0, a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{k} 6right) is a good number.Conversely, every good number belongs to an interval of the type mentioned above, because taking the first 5 digit - let its position be m, and let the preceding decimal digits be a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{m-1}, then m leqq n and a_{i} neq 5 if i leq m-1, so the good number is in the following interval:left[0, a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{m-1} 5 ; quad 0,{ }_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{m-1} 6right)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_bd12e4241d2ffa78b744g-1.jpg?height=101&width=1027&top_left_y=741&top_left_x=538)Our diagram illustrates the intervals containing good numbers for n leqq 2.The intervals of form (1) are disjoint (no two have a common point), so the sought probability P is given by the sum of the lengths of such intervals. The length of (1) is 10^{-m}, and the number of such intervals is the number of ways to choose a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{m-1}, which is 9^{m-1}, and we need to sum the lengths 9^{m-1} cdot 10^{-m} for m=1,2, ldots, n.P=frac{1}{10}+frac{9}{10^{2}}+frac{9^{2}}{10^{3}}+ldots+frac{9^{n-1}}{10^{n}}=frac{1}{10}left{1+frac{9}{10}+left(frac{9}{10}right)^{2}+ldots+left(frac{9}{10}right)^{n-1}right}=1-left(frac{9}{10}right)^{n}From (1), it is clear that we thought of the finite form of the decimal representation of numbers. However, according to the interpretation given in the first paragraph, our result does not change if we think of the infinite form.Remarks. 1. The above solution used a section of the textbook marked as a \\"reading\\" section. 12. If n rightarrow infty, then P rightarrow 1, so the probability that the decimal representation of a number randomly selected from [0 ; 1] contains the digit 5: 1 (certain event). However, this was already implied by our interpretation.II. solution. We determine the probability of the complementary event to the one in question.Divide the [0 ; 1] interval into 10^{n} equal subintervals of length 10^{-n}, so the division points are those finite decimals that have at most n decimal places, that is, the 10^{-n} multiples of the integers 1,2, ldots, 10^{n}-1. Thus, every number in each subinterval is a \\"not good\\" number if and only if the left endpoint of the interval is not a good number.Among the left endpoints, those are not good numbers whose 10^{n}-fold does not contain the digit 5, that is, all their digits are from the set 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Their number is 9^{n}, so the total length of the not good intervals is left(frac{9}{10}right)^{n}.

In particular, it bisects the angle widehat{B A D} into two equal angles. We can deduce that widehat{B A C}=45^{circ}.Since A E=A B=1, triangle A B E is isosceles at A. We can then deduce that the angles widehat{B E A} and widehat{E B A} are equal. Since the sum of the angles in triangle A E B is 180^{circ}, it follows that180^{circ}=widehat{E A B}+widehat{A E B}+widehat{A B E}=45^{circ}+2 widehat{A E B}so that widehat{A E B}=frac{180^{circ}-45^{circ}}{2}=67.5^{circ}.We can then deduce that widehat{B E C}=180^{circ}-widehat{B E A}=112.5^{circ}.Alternative Solution n^{circ} 1 We propose a solution that involves the intermediate calculation of widehat{E B C}.In the same way as the previous solution, we show that widehat{A B E}=widehat{A E B}=67.5^{circ}.Since the angle widehat{A B C} is a right angle, we have widehat{E B C}=90^{circ}-widehat{A B E}=22.5^{circ}.

First, we show that there are at least 1250 irrational numbers in the table. Let there be x irrational and 50-x rational numbers along the left side of the table. Then, along the top side, there are 50-x irrational and x rational numbers. Since the sum of a rational and an irrational number is always irrational, there are at least x^2 + (50-x)^2 irrational numbers in the table.

Moreover, point M is the midpoint of AP (as the intersection of the diagonals of parallelogram ABPC). Therefore, lines MK and HK are the perpendicular bisectors of segments AP and PQ. Consequently, point K is the center of the circle Omega circumscribed around triangle APQ. Further, angle APQ = angle PAC = 30^circ, so the chord AQ of circle Omega equals the radius AK.

The center of circle M is at M(1, -2), and the radius is sqrt{15}.boxed{text{The standard equation is } (x-1)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}=15, text{ center } M(1, -2), text{ radius } sqrt{15}.}# Part 2: Finding the Value of CGiven that the line x+3y+C=0 intersects circle M at points A and B, and |AB|=2sqrt{5}, we use the formula for the distance from a point to a line to find C:1. The distance from the center M(1, -2) to the line x+3y+C=0 is given by the formula frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where (x_0, y_0) is the point and Ax + By + C = 0 is the line equation. Substituting A=1, B=3, x_0=1, and y_0=-2, we get frac{|1cdot1 + 3cdot(-2) + C|}{sqrt{1^2 + 3^2}}.2. The length of the chord AB is related to the radius and the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord by the formula |AB| = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}, where r is the radius and d is the distance from the center to the line. Given |AB|=2sqrt{5} and the radius r=sqrt{15}, we find the distance d as sqrt{15 - (frac{|AB|}{2})^2} = sqrt{15 - 5} = sqrt{10}.3. Equating the distance from step 1 to sqrt{10}, we get frac{|1 - 6 + C|}{sqrt{10}} = sqrt{10} implies |1 - 6 + C| = 10.4. Solving |1 - 6 + C| = 10 gives us two possible values for C: when 1 - 6 + C = 10, C = 15, and when 1 - 6 + C = -10, C = -5.boxed{C = 15 text{ or } -5}"},{"problem":"3.

Since P lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AB, we can find the coordinates of A and P. Then, using the midpoint formula, we can determine the coordinates of B. Lastly, we can find the equation of line PB using the point-slope form.1. Since |PA| = |PB|, point P lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AB.2. The equation of line PA is y = x + 1.3. Therefore, we find that A has coordinates (-1, 0).4. Substitute the x-coordinate of P (which is 2) into the equation y = x + 1 to find the y-coordinate, which is 3. So, P has coordinates (2, 3).5. Using the midpoint formula, we find that B has coordinates (5, 0).6. Now, we can determine the equation of line PB using the point-slope form: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m = frac{3 - 0}{2 - 5} = -1, and (x_1, y_1) are the coordinates of B, which is (5, 0).7.

What is the minimum number of pieces that will result?","solution":"The dissection is obviously carried out with planar cuts. Each tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and any two faces share an edge. Therefore, in the sought dissection, each of the 6 faces of the cube is divided into triangles, so at least 12 triangles are formed on the surface, and the cutting planes intersect the cube in triangles, or they dissect the intersections of each other into triangles. - On the other hand, a tetrahedron can be part of at most 3 faces of the cube, because among any 4 faces chosen from the cube's faces, there are 2 that are parallel, so the remaining face(s) are created by a cutting plane. Thus, the parts of the cube's faces will belong to at least (12: 3=) 4 tetrahedra.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4b0cc536ad3f13852decg-1.jpg?height=515&width=553&top_left_y=434&top_left_x=775)It is possible to provide a dissection where exactly 4 tetrahedra share the surface of the cube: we divide the 3 faces meeting at a selected vertex of the cube into two triangles each with the diagonals opposite to this vertex - on the 1st figure, the faces meeting at F are divided by the diagonals E B, B G, and G E - then we divide the third face adjacent to the selected vertex by the diagonals starting from the adjacent vertices, the B D, G D, and E D diagonals. Thus, no bisecting diagonal starts from the vertices A, C, and H in any of the faces they are adjacent to, and the diagonals connecting the endpoints of the 3 edges starting from these vertices in pairs lie in the same planes as E B, B G, and G E, so the 3 right-angled triangles meeting at the vertices F, A, C, and H are cut from the cube's surface by the planes E B G, E B D, B G D, and G E D, respectively, forming a tetrahedron with each, and together they indeed use the 12 triangles formed from the 6 cube faces.The 4 triangular faces of the tetrahedron cut from the cube form the complete surface of the B D E G tetrahedron inside the cube, so the cube is divided into 5 tetrahedra.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4b0cc536ad3f13852decg-1.jpg?height=510&width=483&top_left_y=1442&top_left_x=821)If we choose 1 triangle from each of the two adjacent, diagonally divided faces of the cube such that the bisecting diagonals do not start from the same endpoint of the common edge (2nd figure, E B F, and B C F), these two faces already mark 4 vertices of a tetrahedron, and the other two faces of this tetrahedron are inside the cube, so 3 tetrahedra are not enough to use the 10 right-angled triangular faces remaining on the cube's surface, so we do not get a dissection into fewer tetrahedra. (Proceeding similarly, we get 6 tetrahedra, with the A B C D E F half of the cube yielding E C B A and E C A D.)Péter Racskó (Budapest, Madách I. g. IV. o. t.) János Havas (Budapest, Berzsenyi D. g. II. o. t.)Remarks. 1. By considering the division of the cube's edges into the parts of the tetrahedra, we also obtain that the number of tetrahedra is at least 4.2. Many solutions contain the following line of thought. If we cut a tetrahedron from the cube, the number of vertices of the remaining solid can be at most 1 less, leaving 7 or more vertices. We need to cut off 1 tetrahedron at least 4 times to leave a 4-vertex solid, i.e., a tetrahedron, so the number of parts is at least 5. - The small flaw in this is that it is assumed without justification that during the dissection, there is always a part-tetrahedron that can be separated from the others by a single planar cut along one of its faces, although in the 2nd figure, every tetrahedron can be removed with only two cuts. (However, if we first cut the cube in half with the C D E F diagonal plane, neither of the resulting parts is a tetrahedron.)"},{"problem":"The coefficient of the x^3 term in the expansion of (2x+1)(x-1)^5 is ______ (answer with a number).","solution":"Since (2x+1)(x-1)^5 = (2x+1)(binom{5}{0}x^5 - binom{5}{1}x^4 + binom{5}{2}x^3 - binom{5}{3}x^2 + binom{5}{4}x - binom{5}{5}),  the coefficient of the x^3 term is 2(-binom{5}{3}) + binom{5}{2} = -10.

Let's express this in terms of cos B and cos A using the relation we obtained from the parallel vectors.Multiplying both sides by cos B and replacing a cos B with b cos A, we get sin A cos B = sin B cos A. Therefore, sin(A - B) = 0. Since -pi < A - B < pi, we conclude that A = B.Next, consider the magnitude of overrightarrow{p}, which is given by:|overrightarrow{p}|^2 = |overrightarrow{p}|^2 = (2sqrt{2}sinfrac{B+C}{2})^2 + (2sin A)^2 = 9.We can then write:8sin^2frac{B+C}{2} + 4sin^2 A = 9.But since A = B and A + B + C = pi, we can write C = pi - 2A, and hence B + C = pi - A. Therefore, sinfrac{B + C}{2} = sinfrac{pi - A}{2} = cos frac{A}{2}. Substituting this and simplifying, we obtain:8cos^2 frac{A}{2} + 4sin^2 A = 9.Longrightarrow 4(1 + cos A) + 4(1 - cos^2 A) = 9.Longrightarrow 4cos^2 A - 4cos A + 1 = 0.Longrightarrow (2cos A - 1)^2 = 0.Thus, cos A = frac{1}{2}.

Define the problem and notation:   We are given natural numbers ( n ) and ( k ).

Claim:   We claim that the smallest possible cardinality of ( A ) is ( binom{n}{n-k+1} ).3. Reasoning:   - For every element ( E ) in ( A ), ( E ) must appear in at least ( n-k+1 ) subsets ( A_i ) to ensure that it is included in the union of any ( k ) subsets.   - ( E ) must also appear in at most ( n-k+1 ) subsets to ensure that it is not always included in the union of any ( k-1 ) subsets.4. Verification using the Pigeonhole Principle:   - If the elements of ( A ) are distributed among the subsets such that no two elements always appear together, the Pigeonhole Principle implies that at least one element does not appear in the union of every ( k-1 ) subset.   - This condition is satisfied if and only if ( A ) has at least ( binom{n}{n-k+1} ) elements.5. Optimality:   - Arranging the elements of ( A ) such that no two elements always appear together is optimal. If two elements always appear together, it effectively reduces the cardinality of ( A ) because those two elements behave identically with respect to the subsets.6.

Help her by showing, with a drawing, how to do this reassembly.","solution":"Solutiona) The area of the sheet was equal to the sum of the areas of the nine squares, which is (in square centimeters):1^{2}+4^{2}+7^{2}+8^{2}+9^{2}+10^{2}+14^{2}+15^{2}+18^{2}=1056b) Let a and b be the dimensions of the sheet, where we assume a leq b. Since the area of a rectangle is the product of its dimensions, we have a b=1056. Moreover, since the measures of the sides of the squares into which the sheet was cut are integers, it follows that a and b must be integers. Finally, we observe that a and b must be greater than or equal to 18, as one of the squares into which the sheet was cut has a side with this measure. Since a and b are divisors of 1056, the prime factorization 1056=2^{5} times 3 times 11 shows that a and b are of the form 2^{x} times 3^{y} times 11^{z}, where x, y and z are integers such that 0 leq x leq 5,0 leq y leq 1 and 0 leq z leq 1. Remembering that a b=1056 and that a and b are greater than 18, we obtain the following possibilities:| mathbf{a} | mathbf{b} || :---: | :---: || 2 times 11=22 | 2^{4} times 3=48 || 2^{3} times 3=24 | 2^{2} times 11=44 || 2^{5}=32 | 3 times 11=33 |We now need to decide which of these possibilities can occur as the dimensions of the sheet. Since the largest square has a side of 18, which is less than 22, 24, and 32, we see that no square can touch both sides of length b of the sheet. This means that b can be expressed in two ways as a sum, in which the terms are the measures of the sides of the squares, such that:- there are no repeated terms in either of the two expressions and- there are no common terms in the two expressions.This argument shows that 2 b leq 1+4+7+8+9+10+14+15+18 or, in other words, 2 b leq 86. Therefore, b leq 43 and the only possibility is b=33. It follows that the dimensions of the sheet were a=32 and b=33.There are other ways to eliminate the pairs (22,48) and (24,44), using the argument above and showing, for example, that there are no two ways to write 22 and 24 as the sum of the sides of the squares with distinct terms and no common terms. This solution depends on the fact that, in any decomposition of a rectangle into squares, the sides of the squares are necessarily parallel to one of the sides of the rectangle. An intuitive argument to demonstrate this fact consists in selecting a vertex of the rectangle and observing that the square to which this vertex belongs has its sides supported on the sides of the rectangle. Any square that touches this first square (even at just one vertex) has its sides necessarily parallel to the sides of the rectangle, otherwise, we would have angles different from 90^{circ} or 180^{circ} in the decomposition, and these angles cannot be filled with squares.c) The only possibility (up to rotations and symmetries) is shown below:|  |  |  |  || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 14 | 18 |  |  || 10 | 4 |  |  ||  | 7 | 15 |  || 1 | 7 |  |  || 9 |  |  |  |"},{"problem":"Given f(x)=x^{2}-2x+a.

Base Case for (n=1):    - For (n=1), the chessboard is (3 times 3).    - We can place 4 rooks in the squares ((1,1)), ((1,2)), ((2,3)), and ((3,3)).    - This configuration ensures that each rook is attacked by at most one other rook.    - To see why 4 is the maximum, note that if any row or column has 2 rooks, it forbids 5 other squares, leaving only 2 free squares.2. Inductive Step for (n>1):    - Assume that for a (3(n-1) times 3(n-1)) chessboard, the maximum number of rooks that can be placed such that each rook is attacked by at most one rook is (4(n-1)).    - We need to show that for a (3n times 3n) chessboard, the maximum number of rooks is (4n).3. Constructing the Configuration:    - Use the configuration described in the base case on each (3 times 3) block along the diagonal of the (3n times 3n) chessboard.    - This gives us (n) blocks, each contributing 4 rooks, for a total of (4n) rooks.4. Upper Bound Argument:    - Consider a maximum configuration on a (3n times 3n) chessboard.    - Since (M_n geq 4n > 3n), there must be at least one row and one column with 2 rooks.    - By swapping rows and columns, we can arrange the board such that the first row and first column each contain 2 rooks.    - Place these rooks in positions ((1,1)), ((1,2)), ((2,3)), and ((3,3)).    - No other rooks can be in the first three rows or columns.    - The remaining (3(n-1) times 3(n-1)) sub-board must contain (M_n - 4) rooks.    - By the inductive hypothesis, (M_n - 4 leq M_{n-1}), so (M_n leq M_{n-1} + 4).5. Conclusion:    - Combining the lower bound (M_n geq 4n) and the upper bound (M_n leq M_{n-1} + 4), we get (M_n = 4n).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 4n } )."},{"problem":"30.4.

The same would happen on the river, as the current equally carries the motorboat and the ball. The motorboat will catch up with the ball at 9:30.If someone did not come up with the above simple reasoning, they could solve the problem using equations.At first glance, it seems that there is not enough data in the problem, as the boat's own speed, i.e., its speed on standing water, and the speed of the river current were not specified.Not being discouraged by this, let's denote by  x  the sought number of hours from 9 o'clock to the moment when the motorboat caught up with the ball. In addition to this, let's introduce the speed of the current  u  expressed in kilometers per hour and the speed  v  of the motorboat on standing water, also expressed in kilometers per hour. To set up the equation, we need to express the distance traveled by the ball and the distance traveled by the motorboat using these quantities.In  x  hours, the ball drifted with the river current  xu  kilometers.The motorboat first traveled for  frac{1}{4}  of an hour against the current, its speed was then  (v - u)  kilometers per hour, the distance traveled was thus  frac{1}{4}(v - u)  kilometers; in the remaining time  (x - frac{1}{4})  hours, the motorboat traveled with the current, so at a speed of  (u + v)  kilometers per hour and traveled  (x - frac{1}{4})(u + v)  kilometers, covering in the opposite direction first the distance  frac{1}{4}(v - u)  kilometers to the starting point, and then the distance  xu  kilometers traveled by the ball to the point where the motorboat caught up with the ball.ThereforeWhen we transform this equation by opening the parentheses and collecting the terms containing  x  on one side and the remaining terms on the other side, we get the equationSince the motorboat's own speed  v  is certainly not zero, we can divide both sides of the equation by  v , obtainingThus, the motorboat will catch up with the ball after  frac{1}{2}  of an hour from the moment of departure, i.e., at 9:30.It turned out that the unknown quantities  u  and  v  were needed only to set up the equation.

Period of |f(x)|:The period of f(x) can be determined by looking at the coefficient of x in the argument of the sine function. Since the coefficient is 2, the period of f(x) is frac{2π}{2}=π. Therefore, the period of |f(x)| is also pi, because taking the absolute value of a function does not change its period. Thus, conclusion A is correct.2. Center of Symmetry:To check if ({frac{2π}{3}},0) is a center of symmetry, we evaluate f(frac{2π}{3})=sin(2times frac{2π}{3}-frac{π}{3})=sin(π)=0. This means the graph of f(x) passes through the point (frac{2π}{3}, 0), and due to the properties of the sine function, this point acts as a center of symmetry. Hence, conclusion B is correct.3. Monotonically Increasing Interval:For f(x) to be monotonically increasing on the interval [-a,a], the derivative of f(x) must be positive. The critical point occurs when 2a-frac{π}{3}=frac{π}{2}, solving for a gives a=frac{5π}{12}. However, this does not account for the entire interval where f(x) is increasing. The correct approach is to consider the period of the function and the nature of the sine function. The incorrect interpretation in the original solution leads to the conclusion that C is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the behavior of f(x) over its period.4. Shifting the Graph:Shifting the graph of f(x) to the right by frac{π}{12} units results in the function y=sin[2(x-frac{π}{12})-frac{π}{3}]=sin(2x-frac{π}{2}). This simplifies to -cos(2x), which is an even function because cos(2x) is even, and multiplying by -1 does not change the evenness.

Define ( q(n, k) ) as the number of ways to split ( n ) distinguishable pieces of candy into ( k ) groups.2. The total number of ways to split ( n ) pieces of candy into any number of groups is given by ( p(n) ). Thus, we have:   [   sum_{k=1}^{n} q(n, k) = p(n)   ]3. To find the sum of the number of groups over all splittings, we need to consider the contribution of each ( k ) groups. For each splitting into ( k ) groups, there are ( k ) groups. Therefore, the sum of the number of groups over all splittings is:   [   sum_{k=1}^{n} k cdot q(n, k)   ]4. Consider the function ( p(n+1) ), which represents the number of ways to split ( n+1 ) pieces of candy. Each splitting of ( n+1 ) pieces can be derived from a splitting of ( n ) pieces by either adding the ( (n+1) )-th piece to one of the existing groups or by creating a new group with just the ( (n+1) )-th piece.5. Therefore, the number of ways to split ( n+1 ) pieces into ( k+1 ) groups is ( q(n, k) ), and the number of ways to split ( n+1 ) pieces into ( k ) groups is ( k cdot q(n, k) ) (since the ( (n+1) )-th piece can be added to any of the ( k ) groups).6. Summing these contributions, we get:   [   p(n+1) = sum_{k=1}^{n} (k+1) q(n, k)   ]7. We can rewrite this as:   [   p(n+1) = sum_{k=1}^{n} k q(n, k) + sum_{k=1}^{n} q(n, k)   ]8. Using the fact that ( sum_{k=1}^{n} q(n, k) = p(n) ), we have:   [   p(n+1) = sum_{k=1}^{n} k q(n, k) + p(n)   ]9. Rearranging, we find:   [   sum_{k=1}^{n} k q(n, k) = p(n+1) - p(n)   ]10. For ( n = 8 ), we need to find the sum of the number of groups over all splittings of 8 pieces of candy:    [    sum_{k=1}^{8} k q(8, k) = p(9) - p(8)    ]11.

Using the point-slope form of a line, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is the point on the line, we have:y - 1 = 2(x - 0),which simplifies to:y = 2x + 1.Hence, the equation of the tangent line to the curve y=e^{2x} at x=0 is boxed{y = 2x + 1}."},{"problem":"3.

Therefore, the areas of the three smaller triangles are proportional to ( a^2, b^2, ) and ( c^2 ).4. Let ( A ) be the area of the original triangle.

Introduce the cumulative sum sequence:   Define ( t_n = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n ). Then, the recurrence relation can be rewritten in terms of ( t_n ):   [   alpha x_n = t_{n+1}   ]   Since ( t_{n+1} = t_n + x_{n+1} ), we can express ( x_{n+1} ) as:   [   x_{n+1} = t_{n+1} - t_n   ]3.

Modulo 9 property: The sum of the digits of a number (x) in the decimal system is congruent to (x mod 9). This is a well-known property of numbers in base 10. Therefore, (a_n equiv a_{n+1} pmod{9}).3.

Therefore, the coordinates of the center (C) can be found by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of A and B: C = left(frac{x_A + x_B}{2}, frac{y_A + y_B}{2}right) = left(frac{1+3}{2}, frac{4+(-2)}{2}right) = (2, 1) Next, we calculate the radius of the circle (r), which is half the distance between A and B: r = frac{1}{2} |AB| = frac{1}{2} sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}  r = frac{1}{2} sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (-2 - 4)^2}  r = frac{1}{2} sqrt{4 + 36}  r = frac{1}{2} sqrt{40}  r = sqrt{10} The standard form equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 Substituting the center (2, 1) and radius sqrt{10}, we get: (x - 2)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = (sqrt{10})^2  (x - 2)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10 To convert this into general form, we expand the equation: x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 2y + 1 = 10  x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2y - 5 = 0 Thus, the general form equation of the circle is: boxed{x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2y - 5 = 0} "},{"problem":"In triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to the internal angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively. It is known that cos ^{2}A-cos ^{2}B+sin ^{2}C=sin Bsin C=frac{1}{4}, and the area of triangle ABC is 2sqrt{3}. Find the value of side a.","solution":"To solve for the value of side a in triangle ABC, we follow these steps:1. Given cos ^{2}A-cos ^{2}B+sin ^{2}C=sin Bsin C=frac{1}{4}, we can use trigonometric identities to simplify this equation. Recall that cos^2 theta = 1 - sin^2 theta for any angle theta. Thus, we can rewrite the given equation as:   [   (1-sin ^{2}A)-(1-sin ^{2}B)+sin ^{2}C=sin Bsin C   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   sin ^{2}B+sin ^{2}C-sin ^{2}A=sin Bsin C   ]2. From the Law of Sines, we know that frac{a}{sin A}=frac{b}{sin B}=frac{c}{sin C}. This implies that for any two sides x, y and their opposite angles alpha, beta, we have frac{x^2}{sin^2 alpha} = frac{y^2}{sin^2 beta}. Applying this to our triangle, we can deduce that:   [   b^2+c^2-a^2=bc   ]   This is derived from the fact that the sum of the squares of any two sides minus the square of the third side equals the product of those two sides times the cosine of the angle between them, which is derived from the Law of Cosines.3. Using the Law of Cosines, we find that cos A = frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}. Given that b^2+c^2-a^2=bc, we substitute this into our equation for cos A to get:   [   cos A = frac{bc}{2bc} = frac{1}{2}   ]   Since A is an angle in a triangle and thus must be between 0 and pi radians (0 and 180^circ), we conclude that A = frac{pi}{3}.4. Using the Law of Sines again, we can express the relationship between the sides and angles of the triangle as:   [   frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}   ]   This implies that:   [   frac{bc}{sin Bsin C} = frac{a^2}{sin^2 A}   ]   Given that sin A = sin frac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we can simplify the equation to find a^2:   [   a^2 = 3bc   ]5. The area S of triangle ABC is given by S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A = 2sqrt{3}. Since we know sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we can solve for bc:   [   bc = frac{2S}{sin A} = frac{2 cdot 2sqrt{3}}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 8   ]   Substituting bc = 8 into our equation for a^2, we get:   [   a^2 = 3 cdot 8 = 24   ]   Therefore, solving for a gives us:   [   a = sqrt{24} = 2sqrt{6}   ]   Hence, the value of side a is boxed{2sqrt{6}}.This step-by-step solution follows closely to the original solution, breaking down the process into more detailed steps and ensuring the final answer is clearly highlighted as requested."},{"problem":"8.

Initial Setup and Assumptions:   We are given a non-constant monic polynomial ( f(x) ) with integer coefficients and a natural number ( M ) such that for all ( n geq M ), ( f(n) ) divides ( f(2^n) - 2^{f(n)} ). We need to determine all such polynomials.2. Divisibility Condition:   Let ( p ) be a prime such that ( p mid f(n) ). Then, for all ( k geq 0 ),   [   p mid f(n + pk) implies p mid f(2^{n+pk}) - 2^{f(n+pk)}.   ]   This implies that ( p mid f(2^{n+k}) - 2^{f(n+k)} ).3.

Then,   [   p mid f(2^m).   ]   Since ( p mid f(2^m) - 2^{f(m)} ), we conclude that ( p = 2 ).4. Power of 2 Condition:   For each ( r > N ), ( f(2^r) ) must be a power of 2. Suppose ( f(0) neq 0 ). Then,   [   f(2^r) equiv f(0) pmod{2^r}.   ]   This implies ( f(2^r) leq |f(0)| ) for all ( r > N ), which is a contradiction since ( f ) is not constant. Therefore, ( f(0) = 0 ).5. Form of ( f(x) ):   Write ( f(x) = x^d g(x) ) for some ( d > 0 ) and ( g in mathbb{Z}[x] ) with ( g(0) neq 0 ). Since ( g(2^r) ) is a power of 2 for all large ( r ), and ( g(0) neq 0 ), ( g ) must be a constant function. Thus, ( f(x) = x^d ).6. Checking ( f(x) = x^d ):   For all odd primes ( p ), substituting ( f(p) = p^d ) gives:   [   p^d mid 2^{p^d} - 2^{p^d} implies p mid 2^{p^d - d} - 1 implies p mid 2^{d-1} - 1.   ]   By taking ( p ) large enough, we conclude that ( 2^{d-1} = 1 ), hence ( d = 1 ).

A large number of arithmetic proofs, for example, rely on the pigeonhole principle.## - Pigeonhole Principle -If at least n+1 objects are placed into n drawers, at least one drawer will contain at least two objects. More generally, if at least k n + 1 objects are placed into these same n drawers, at least one drawer will contain at least k+1 objects. For example: knowing that a human has fewer than 300,000 hairs and that there are 3,000,000 Parisians, at least two Parisians have the same number of hairs. We can even specify that there are at least 10 Parisians with the same number of hairs. If there were 3,000,001 Parisians each with at most 300,000 hairs, we could assert that at least 11 of them have the same number of hairs.One of the first mathematical results that can be deduced from this is that the decimal expansion of the fraction frac{p}{q} is periodic with a period strictly less than q. Indeed, when performing the division, each new decimal corresponds to a new remainder. Among q consecutive remainders, either one is zero (and the division stops, which corresponds to a period of 1 since from a certain rank, all decimals are equal to 0), or these q remainders are all between 1 and q-1, which proves that at least two of them, r_i and r_j, are equal. Since each remainder determines the entire sequence of the division, r_{i+1} = r_{j+1}, r_{i+2} = r_{j+2} ldots therefore the decimal expansion will be periodic with a period of at most |i-j| < q."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} with the sum of the first n terms denoted as S_n, and a_1=2, S_n= frac{1}{3}(n+2)a_n.

It is advisable to regularly list the numbers that can be written as the sum of the squares of two natural numbers, so that we can select the smallest pair, or three consecutive numbers, from among them. For example, let's write the sum of a square number with its predecessors and double it:| 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 || ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- || 2 | 5 | 10 | 17 | 26 ldots ||  | 8 | 13 | 20 | 29 ldots ||  |  | 18 | 25 | 34 ldots ||  |  |  | 32 | 41 ldots ||  |  |  |  | 50 ldots |In the written part of the table, we find the pair 17, 18. Since the smallest number in the next column is also 26, and the numbers in the subsequent columns are even larger, this is the smallest suitable pair.To find the triplets, it is better to arrange the obtained sums (remaining below 100 for now) in ascending order, in the pattern of the \\"two-input\\" square number table in the I. division textbook, writing the numbers whose tens are 0,1,2, ldots, 9 in consecutive rows, and the numbers whose units are 0,1,2, ldots, 9 in consecutive columns.

Among four consecutive integers, two are even and two are odd. The latter can only be the sum of one even and one odd number. Now, the square of an even number can only be the square of an even base, and the square of an odd number can only be the square of an odd base, because if n is an integer, then (2 n)^{2}=4 n^{2}=4 k, even, and (2 n+1)^{2}=4 n(n+1)+1=4 k+1, odd. When divided by 4, these give a remainder of 0 or 1, so their sum also gives a remainder of 0, 1, or 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the remainder of a two-term square sum when divided by 4 cannot be 3, whereas the consecutive odd numbers give a remainder of 1 and 3 when divided by 4. This proves the statement.Kiss Árpád (Budapest, Bláthy O. Erősáramú Ip. Techn. I. o. t.)Remarks. 1. Among the found numbers, 18 and 72 are the sum of two equal squares. If we relax the conditions and do not accept such, then the first pair is 25=3^{2}+4^{2}, 26=1^{2}+5^{2}, and the first triplet is 232=6^{2}+14^{2}, 233=8^{2}+13^{2}, 234=3^{2}+15^{2}.Surányi László (Budapest, V., Szemere u. Ált. Isk. VIII. o. t.)2. The first number of the suitable triplets is divisible by 8. According to the above, only triplets of the form 8 k, 8 k+1,8 k+2 and 8 k+4,8 k+5, 8 k+6 can be considered. However, the latter is impossible. It is known that if an even number can be expressed as the sum of two integer squares, then its half can also be expressed as such:2 x=a^{2}+b^{2} text { implies } quad x=left(frac{a+b}{2}right)^{2}+left(frac{a-b}{2}right)^{2}and applying this to 8 k+6 would result in 4 k+3 being expressible.Furthermore, one of the numbers in a suitable triplet is divisible by 3, and therefore by 9. The squares of numbers of the form 3 n, 3 n+1,3 n+2 are9 n^{2}, quad 3left(3 n^{2}+2 nright)+1=3 k+1, quad 3left(3 n^{2}+4 n+1right)+1=3 k+1The sum of two such numbers can only be divisible by 3 if neither term is of the form 3 k+1, so the representation is of the form 9left(n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}right)=9 k. Therefore, the smallest number of a suitable triplet is divisible by 8 and either divisible by 9, or 1 or 2 less than a number divisible by 9. It is easy to see that then this number gives a remainder of 0, 8, or 16 when divided by 72.Lovász László (Budapest, Fazekas M. Gyak. Gimn. I. o. t.)3.

Determine all pairs (m, n) of natural numbers for whichm+s(n)=n+s(m)=70where s(a) denotes the sum of the digits of the natural number a.(Jaroslav Švrček)","solution":"SOLUTION. Both numbers m and n are clearly two-digit. Let then m=10a+b and n=10c+d, where a, b, c, d are digits of the decimal system (a neq 0 neq c). According to the problem, we havebegin{aligned}& m+s(n)=(10a+b)+(c+d)=70 & n+s(m)=(10c+d)+(a+b)=70end{aligned}By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get 9(a-c)=0, and thus a=c. By substituting c with a, both equations (1) and (2) will turn into the same equation 11a+(b+d)=70. Given that 0 leq b+d leq 18, we obtain the estimates for a: 52 leq 11a leq 70. From this, it immediately follows that either a=5 or a=6. In the first case (for a=c=5), from the condition 11a+(b+d)=70 we get b+d=15, i.e., (b, d) in{(6,9),(7,8),(8,7),(9,6)}. In the second case (for a=c=6), we get b+d=4, and thus (b, d) in{(0,4),(1,3),(2,2),(3,1),(4,0)}. Verification is not necessary, as we are guaranteed the validity of both equations (1) and (2).Conclusion.

In the year 2000, Alena found out that her age was equal to the sum of the digits of the year in which she was born. How old is she in 2020? [The sum of the digits of her birth year is at most 28 (=1+9+9+9). Her birth year is thus a four-digit number of the form overline{19xy}, for which 2000-overline{19xy}=1+9+x+y. From this, after rearrangement, we have 90=11x+2y, from which it is clear that x=8 and y=1. Alena's age in 2020 is therefore 39 years.]D1.

Labeling and Initial Setup:   We are given a (3 times 3) table with numbers (1, 2, ldots, 9) placed in the cells.

We need to determine the possible values of (a) such that all numbers in the table become equal to (a) after some number of moves.2.

This circle is divided into l arcs by these l points, and each arc divides a closed region of the plane into two, or encloses a closed region from the infinite region (Figure 1). Therefore, the number of regions in the plane increases by l in the n-th step, while the number of intersection or tangency points of the circles increases by at most l, since among the l points of intersection or tangency created by the n-th circle with the previously drawn ones, there may be points that already belonged to at least two circles before the n-th step.In the first step, the single circle drawn divides the plane into two regions, and the number of points lying on at least two circles is 0. According to the above, the number of regions increases by at least as much as the number of intersection or tangency points of the circles in each step, so - after a total of k points lie on at least two circles - the number of regions created is at least k+2.Switching to the case m>1, if the i-th connected component (i=1,2, ldots, m) has k_{i} intersection or tangency points of the circles, then at least k_{i}+2 regions are created in this component (including the infinite region). Considering that sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}=k, and that the infinite region was counted in each of the m connected components, the total number of regions created is at least=sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}+2 m-(m-1)=k+m+1![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_ad8ed6bcd1c9967242d6g-1.jpg?height=466&width=480&top_left_y=2071&top_left_x=801)In the problem, k=12, so the minimum number of regions is 14.

For the equation ( Pleft(x + frac{1}{n}right) + Pleft(x - frac{1}{n}right) = 2P(x) ) to hold, each term in the polynomial must satisfy the equation. This implies:   [   a_d left[left(x + frac{1}{n}right)^d + left(x - frac{1}{n}right)^dright] = 2a_d x^d   ]   [   a_{d-1} left[left(x + frac{1}{n}right)^{d-1} + left(x - frac{1}{n}right)^{d-1}right] = 2a_{d-1} x^{d-1}   ]   [   vdots   ]   [   2a_0 = 2a_0   ]6.

This is only possible if ( d leq 1 ), because for ( d geq 2 ), the left-hand side will not simplify to ( 2x^d ).7. Therefore, the polynomial ( P(x) ) must be of degree at most 1.

If both (p) and (q) are odd, then (c) would be even, which contradicts the given information that (c) is odd. Therefore, one of (p) or (q) must be 2. We assume (p = 2) and (q) is an odd prime.4.

Therefore, the side length of the base equilateral triangle of the prism is 2sqrt{3}r = 6sqrt{3}.Since the sphere is also tangent to the two bases of the prism, the height of the prism is equal to twice the radius of the sphere, which is 2r = 6.Therefore, the volume V of the triangular prism is frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times (6sqrt{3})^2 times 6 = 162sqrt{3}.Hence, the answer is boxed{162sqrt{3}}.By determining the radius of the sphere from its volume and knowing the tangency points with the prism, we can deduce the height of the prism as the diameter of the sphere and calculate the side length of the base triangle.

Assume a point at the origin:   Without loss of generality, we can assume that one of the points is at the origin, ( O(0,0) ). This is because we can always translate the entire set of points such that one of them is at the origin.2. Area formula for a triangle:   If ( A(a,b) ) and ( B(x,y) ) are two points, the area of triangle ( OAB ) is given by:   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| ax - by right|   ]   For the area to be an integer (possibly zero), ( left| ax - by right| ) must be an even integer.3. Coordinate parity analysis:   - If one of the points, say ( A ), has both coordinates even, then ( a ) and ( b ) are even. Thus, ( ax ) and ( by ) are even for any integer coordinates ( x ) and ( y ). Therefore, ( left| ax - by right| ) is even, ensuring the area is an integer.   - If two points, say ( A ) and ( B ), have all their coordinates odd, then ( a, b, x, ) and ( y ) are all odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, so ( ax ) and ( by ) are odd. The difference of two odd numbers is even, ensuring ( left| ax - by right| ) is even.   - The same logic applies if two points have coordinates of the form ( (o,e) ) or ( (e,o) ), where ( e ) stands for even and ( o ) stands for odd.4. Conclusion from parity analysis:   If a set of integer points does not contain three points which are the vertices of a triangle with integer area, then this set must have at most 4 elements. This is because there are only 4 possible combinations of parity for the coordinates: ( (e,e), (e,o), (o,e), (o,o) ).5. Existence of a set with 4 elements:   Consider the four vertices of a unit square: ( (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) ). None of these points form a triangle with integer area, as the area of any triangle formed by these points is either ( frac{1}{2} ) or 0.Therefore, the minimum value of ( n ) which ensures that three of the points are the vertices of a triangle with integer area is 5.The final answer is (boxed{5})."},{"problem":"If left(a-5right)^{2}+|b^{3}-27|=0, then the value of a-b is:A: 2B: -2C: 5D: 8","solution":"Given the equation left(a-5right)^{2}+|b^{3}-27|=0, we can analyze it step by step.1.

Find the degree measure of angle A C D.","solution":"Solution 1: As shown in Fig. mathrm{i}, let E be the point symmetric to D with respect to the perpendicular bisector of BC. It is easy to see that triangle ADE is an equilateral triangle.From the given information, we have DA = DB. Therefore, EA = EC = ED, which means E is the circumcenter of triangle ADC.therefore angle ACD = frac{1}{2} angle AED = 30^{circ}.Here, an equilateral triangle is constructed, and a circumcenter is found, making the solution unconventional.Solution 2: As shown in Fig. 2, construct an equilateral triangle ECA with AC as a side inside triangle ABC, and connect BE and DE. It is known that AD bisects angle BAE. Therefore, AD is the perpendicular bisector of BE. This gives DE = DB, and thus DE = DA. It follows that CD is the perpendicular bisector of AE.therefore angle ACD = frac{1}{2} angle ACE = 30^{circ}.Here, an equilateral triangle is constructed, and two easily provable facts about the concyclic points A, F, E, C are used. It is known that angle DAF = 20^{circ} = angle DEF, so A, D, F, E are concyclic. Thus, A, D, F, E, C are concyclic.therefore angle ACD = angle AED = 30^{circ}.Here, an equilateral triangle is constructed with AB as one side, achieving the same goal in a different way. The construction is ingenious.Solution 4: As shown in Fig. 4, construct an equilateral triangle EAB with AB as a side inside triangle ABC. Let the angle bisector of angle BAE intersect BC at F, and connect ED, EC, EF. It is known that angle AFC = 80^{circ}. Additionally, angle EFC = angle ABC = angle ACB, so EC = ED = EF. Therefore, E is the circumcenter of triangle CDF.therefore angle ACD = frac{1}{2} angle DEF = 30^{circ}.A simple auxiliary circle is constructed, forming an equilateral triangle and six equal line segments, making the solution unique.Solution 3: As shown in Fig. 3, with D as the center and DA as the radius, draw a circle intersecting BC and CA at E and F respectively. It is known that B lies on the circle. Connect DF, DE, EF. It is easy to prove that triangle DEF is an equilateral triangle, and the perpendicular bisector provides convenience for solving the problem."},{"problem":"10.

We also want the sum of these integers to be as small as possible.1. Factorize 2016:   [   2016 = 2^5 times 3^2 times 7   ]   This means that the product of the seven integers must include at least five factors of 2, two factors of 3, and one factor of 7.2. Choose the smallest distinct integers:   We start by choosing the smallest integers that can provide the necessary factors:   - To get at least five factors of 2, we can use ( 2, 4, 8 ) (since ( 2 = 2^1 ), ( 4 = 2^2 ), and ( 8 = 2^3 )).   - To get at least two factors of 3, we can use ( 3, 6 ) (since ( 3 = 3^1 ) and ( 6 = 2 times 3 )).   - To get at least one factor of 7, we use ( 7 ).3. Verify the product:   Let's list the smallest distinct integers that meet the criteria:   [   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8   ]   - ( 1 ) is included to ensure we have seven distinct integers.   - The product of these integers is:     [     1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 6 times 7 times 8     ]   - Calculate the product step-by-step:     [     1 times 2 = 2     ]     [     2 times 3 = 6     ]     [     6 times 4 = 24     ]     [     24 times 6 = 144     ]     [     144 times 7 = 1008     ]     [     1008 times 8 = 8064     ]   - Check divisibility:     [     8064 div 2016 = 4     ]     Since 8064 is divisible by 2016, the product meets the requirement.4. Calculate the sum:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 31   ]5. Verify if a smaller sum is possible:   - We need to ensure that any other combination of seven distinct integers that meets the factorization requirement does not yield a smaller sum.   - The next smallest integers that could replace any of the chosen ones would increase the sum, as they would be larger than the current smallest integers.Thus, the smallest sum of distinct positive integers ( n_1 < n_2 < dots < n_7 ) such that their product is divisible by 2016 is 31.The final answer is (boxed{31})."},{"problem":"Example 3 Given that alpha, beta are the roots of the equation x^{2}-7 x+8=0, and alpha>beta.

Let a large cube of 4 times 4 times 4 be composed of 64 unit cubes, and select 16 of these unit cubes to be painted red, such that in each 1 times 1 times 4 small rectangular prism composed of 4 unit cubes, there is exactly 1 red cube. How many different ways are there to select the 16 red cubes? Explain your reasoning.","solution":"34. Taking the base of a 4 times 4 times 4 cube as the reference plane, divide the large cube into four layers parallel to the reference plane (each layer being a 4 times 4 times 1 rectangular prism), and number the layers sequentially as 1,2,3,4. Project each red cube onto the reference plane and fill in the layer number of the red cube in the corresponding grid on the reference plane. This results in a 4 times 4 grid, where each cell contains a number from {1,2,3,4}. Cells with the same number are neither in the same row nor in the same column. Such a 4 times 4 grid is called a 4th-order Latin square. Conversely, each 4th-order Latin square uniquely determines a coloring method that meets the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the problem is reduced to determining: How many different 4th-order Latin squares are there? Let a_{ij} (i, j=1,2,3,4) represent the number filled in the cell at the i-th row and j-th column of the 4 times 4 grid. For any permutation {a, b, c, d} of {1,2,3,4}, first consider the Latin squares when a_{11}=a, a_{12}=a_{21}=b, a_{13}=a_{31}=c, a_{14}=a_{41}=d (as shown in the figure). Since a_{22} can be any number from {a, c, d}, we divide it into 3 cases: (1) When a_{22}=a, then a_{23} and a_{32} can only be d, and a_{24} and a_{42} can only be c. Then a_{33} can be a or b. Once a_{33} is chosen, the values of a_{34}, a_{43}, a_{44} are uniquely determined. Therefore, there are exactly 2 Latin squares corresponding to this case. (2) When a_{22}=c, a_{24} and a_{42} can only be a, thus a_{23} and a_{32} can only be d, and then a_{34} and a_{43} can only be b, and a_{44} can only be c, and a_{33} can only be a. Therefore, there is exactly 1 Latin square corresponding to this case. (3) When a_{22}=d, a_{24} and a_{42} can only be c, thus a_{23} and a_{32} can only be a, and then a_{34} and a_{43} can only be b, and finally, a_{33} can only be d, and a_{44} can only be a. Therefore, there is exactly 1 Latin square corresponding to this case. In summary, there are exactly 4 Latin squares as shown in the figure. Since there are 4! permutations of {a, b, c, d}, and for a fixed {a, b, c, d}, the Latin squares shown in the figure can form 3! different Latin squares by permuting the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th rows. Therefore, the total number of 4th-order Latin squares is 4! cdot 3! cdot 4 = (4!)^2 = 576. Thus, the total number of ways to select 16 red unit cubes is (4!)^2 = 576.Note: Consider a more general problem: In an n times n times n large cube, select n^2 unit cubes to be painted red, such that any 1 times 1 times n rectangular prism composed of n unit cubes contains exactly one red unit cube. How many different ways are there to select n^2 red unit cubes that meet the above requirements?Following the previous solution, the problem can be reduced to finding the number of different n-order Latin squares L_n. Typically, the number of n-order Latin squares with the first row and first column being the standard permutation {1,2, cdots, n} is denoted as l_n, so we have L_n = n!((n-1)!) l_n. As n increases, l_n and L_n grow rapidly. The known results are l_1=1, l_2=1, l_3=1, l_4=4, l_5=56, l_6=9408, l_7=16942080, cdots. For n geq 5, many cases need to be considered to count l_n without repetition or omission, which is impossible to do in a short time.

What is the maximum total length of its edges? Solution","solution":": 5 + √3. Suppose AB is the edge which may be longer than 1. Then if we rotate the triangle ACD about CD until A lies in the same plane as BCD and is on the opposite side of CD to B, then we maximise AB without changing any of the other side lengths. So the maximal configuration must be planar. Now suppose we regard C and D as fixed and the other points as variable. Suppose CD = 2x (<= 1). Then A and B must both lie inside the circle center C radius 1 and inside the circle center D radius 1 and hence inside their intersection which is bounded by the two arcs XY (assuming they meet at X and Y). Obviously we maximise AC + AD + BC + BD by taking A at X and B at Y (or vice versa). We claim that that choice also maximises AB. Suppose that is true. Then it also maximises AC + AD + BC + BD + AB at 4 + 2(1 - x 2 ) 1/2 . So we now have to vary CD to maximise 2x + 4 + 2(1 - x 2 ) 1/2 . We show that x + (1 - x 2 ) 1/2 is increasing for x <= 1/2 and hence that the maximum is at x = 1/2. Put x = sin t. Then we have x + (1 - x 2 ) 1/2 = √2 sin(t + π/4) which is indeed increasing for x ≤ π/6. It remains to prove the claim. Take the circle diameter XY. Then the two arcs both lie inside this circle. [Two circles intersect in at most two points, so each arc must lie entirely inside or entirely outside the circle center O and it obviously does not lie outside. ] But AB lies inside a chord of this circle The length of the chord cannot exceed the diameter of the circle (which is XY) and hence AB ≤ XY. 14th USAMO 1985 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 26 Aug 2002"},{"problem":"8.

The desired number of sequences is thus equal to the number of ways the six given primes can be distributed into one or several numbered nonempty groups (each corresponding to the prime factors of the ratios in (2), hence the order of the primes in a group is irrelevant). The word \\"numbered\\" means that the order of groups, on the other hand, does matter. For instance, for the distribution into two groups {3,11,19} and {7,13,17} we get, depending on the order in which the groups are considered, two possible sequence (1, u, u v) and (1, v, u v), where u=3 cdot 11 cdot 19 and v=7 cdot 13 cdot 17.We have thus arrived at the combinatorial problem of determining the value of P(6), where P(n) denotes the number of ways an n-element set X can be partitioned into any number of \\"numbered\\" nonempty subsets X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, ldots To compute P(6) we use the recurrence relationP(n)=left(begin{array}{l}n 1end{array}right) P(n-1)+left(begin{array}{l}n 2end{array}right) P(n-2)+cdots+left(begin{array}{c}n n-1end{array}right) P(1)+1valid for any n geqslant 2, which we now proceed to prove.We divide the desired partitions of the n-element set X into n groups according to the number j of elements in the first subset X_{1}(1 leqslant j leqslant n).

Before flipping over each card, she may choose to guess the color of the card she is about to flip over. She stops if she guesses incorrectly. What is the maximum number of correct guesses she can guarantee?[i]Proposed by Espen Slettnes[/i]","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of correct guesses Alice can guarantee when flipping over the cards after the volunteer has riffled the two piles together. 1. Understanding the Riffle Shuffle:   - The volunteer picks an integer (0 le n le 52) and cuts the deck into two piles: one with the top (n) cards and the other with the remaining (52 - n) cards.   - The volunteer then riffles the two piles together. This means that the cards from the two piles are interleaved, but the order within each pile is preserved.2. Analyzing the Problem:   - Alice needs to guess the color of the card she is about to flip over. She stops if she guesses incorrectly.   - The goal is to find the maximum number of correct guesses Alice can guarantee.3. Strategy for Maximum Guesses:   - Consider the worst-case scenario where Alice has no information about the order of the cards after the riffle shuffle.   - The key observation is that the cards from each pile remain in their original order within the shuffled deck.4. Optimal Strategy:   - Alice can guarantee 26 correct guesses by alternating the colors of the cards in the deck before the volunteer cuts and shuffles them.   - For example, if Alice arranges the deck such that the cards alternate between red and black, she can ensure that every other card is a different color.5. Detailed Steps:   - Suppose Alice arranges the deck such that the cards alternate between red and black.   - When the volunteer cuts the deck into two piles and riffles them together, the resulting deck will still have alternating colors, though the exact sequence may vary.   - Alice can then guess the color of every other card with certainty. For instance, if she starts by guessing the top card is black, she can continue guessing black for every other card.6. Guaranteeing 26 Correct Guesses:   - By alternating the colors in the deck, Alice ensures that she can guess the color of every other card correctly.   - Since there are 52 cards in total, this strategy guarantees that Alice can guess at least 26 cards correctly.The final answer is (boxed{26})."},{"problem":"Let * be a natural number n a three-digit number, the sum of all three-digit numbers formed by the arbitrary permutation of its three non-zero digits minus n equals 1990.

A calculator gives that in this case alpha=15^{circ}.Indeed, using the addition theorems,operatorname{tg} 15^{circ}=frac{sin 30^{circ}}{1+cos 30^{circ}}=frac{1 / 2}{1+sqrt{3} / 2}=frac{1}{2+sqrt{3}}Since 2+sqrt{3} and 2-sqrt{3} are reciprocals, the other angle is indeed 75^{circ}, so the problem has a unique solution.II. solution.

By the converse of Thales' theorem, O A=O B=O C=frac{c}{2}. In triangle C O T:sin C O T varangle=frac{frac{c}{4}}{frac{c}{2}}=frac{1}{2},and since the angle is acute, C O T varangle=30^{circ}. Since this angle is the exterior angle of triangle O A C, C O T varangle=O A C varangle+O C A varangle=30^{circ}. Triangle O A C is isosceles, so from this B A C varangle=O A C varangle=O C A varangle=30^{circ} / 2=15^{circ} follows. The size of the third angle, A B C varangle, is 75^{circ}.III. solution. Denote the sides and angles of the triangle in the usual way. We know that a=c sin alpha and b=c cos alpha. Using this,frac{c^{2}}{8}=t=frac{a b}{2}=frac{c sin alpha cdot c cos alpha}{2}from which, after dividing by c^{2} neq 0 and multiplying by 4, we getfrac{1}{2}=2 sin alpha cos alpha=sin 2 alphafrom which 2 alpha=30^{circ} or 2 alpha=150^{circ}, and thus alpha=15^{circ} or alpha=75^{circ} follows.Therefore, the exact values of the angles of the triangle are 90^{circ}, 75^{circ}, and 15^{circ}."},{"problem":"## 273.

First Derivative Calculation:     The first derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4ax + b. To find the critical points, we set f'(x) equal to 0.2.

This leads to omega = 2n+1, whereby omega is an odd positive integer.Since f(x) is given to be monotonic on the interval left(frac{pi}{18}, frac{5pi}{36}right), we need the length of this interval, which is frac{5pi}{36}-frac{pi}{18}=frac{pi}{12}, to be less than or equal to half of the period of the sine function, i.e., frac{pi}{12} leqslant frac{T}{2}.

Therefore, the value omega=11 is not acceptable.For omega=9, we have varphi=frac{pi}{4}, which fits all the conditions and ensures that f(x) is monotonic on the prescribed interval, and omega being the maximum odd integer no greater than 12 results in omega = 9 being the solution.Therefore, the maximum value of omega is 9.boxed{omega = 9}"},{"problem":"In the Pascal family, each child has at least 2 brothers and at least 1 sister.

What is the circumference of the largest circle that can be drawn entirely on the black squares of the board?","solution":"radius = √40, circumference = 2√40 π Solution Consider the arc of the circle that lies in a particular black square. Its endpoints must be vertices of the square (otherwise the continuation of the arc would enter a white square). Suppose the two vertices are opposite (A and B in the diagram below). Then the two vertices of the next square along the circle cannot be opposite or the circle would pass through three collinear points (so they must be B and C in the diagram). Hence the center lies on the the perpendicular bisectors of AB and BC, so it must be O. That works, as shown in the diagram above. If no square on the circle has opposite vertices on the circle, then it is easily seen that the circle must pass through the four vertices of a square and so is smaller than the case above. (Of course, if the circle is contained in a single square, then it is smaller still.) 3rd Swedish 1963 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 30 December 2003 Last corrected/updated 30 Dec 03"},{"problem":"3.

Calculate the selling price per unit that maximizes profit. What is the maximum profit obtained?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Relationship Between y and xGiven that the base daily sales volume is 500 units and for every 1 yuan increase in price, the daily sales volume decreases by 10 units, we can directly write the relationship between y (daily sales volume) and x (increase in price per unit) as:[y = 500 - 10x]# Part 2: Expressing and Maximizing Profit WThe profit W obtained from selling each humidifier per day can be expressed as the product of the profit per unit and the number of units sold per day. The profit per unit is the selling price per unit minus the cost price per unit, which is (100 + x - 80), and the number of units sold per day is given by y = 500 - 10x. Therefore, the expression for W is:[W = (100 + x - 80)(500 - 10x)]Simplifying this expression:[begin{align*}W &= (20 + x)(500 - 10x) &= 20 cdot 500 + 500x - 10x cdot 20 - 10x^2 &= 10000 + 500x - 200x - 10x^2 &= -10x^2 + 300x + 10000end{align*}]To make it easier to find the maximum value of W, we can complete the square:[begin{align*}W &= -10x^2 + 300x + 10000 &= -10(x^2 - 30x) + 10000 &= -10(x^2 - 30x + 225) + 10000 + 10 cdot 225 &= -10(x - 15)^2 + 12250end{align*}]From this form, it's clear that W reaches its maximum value when x = 15, because the square of a real number is always non-negative, and the negative sign in front of the square term means the expression is maximized when the square term is minimized, which is 0 when x = 15.Thus, the maximum profit W is:[W_{text{max}} = -10(15 - 15)^2 + 12250 = 12250]To maximize profit, the selling price per unit should be set at 100 + 15 = 115 yuan.Therefore, the maximum profit obtained is boxed{12250} yuan."},{"problem":"## Subject 4.Let x be the age of the youngest daughter, m be the age of the mother, and t be the age of the father.The ages of the other two daughters will be x+2 and x+4.From the relationships: quad t + m + x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 88x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = m - 10 andt = m + xwe obtain that x = 5, which means:the daughters are 5, 7, and 9 years oldthe mother is 31 years oldthe father is 36 years old.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_f98a9d6c106196fc3d80g-2.jpg?height=212&width=310&top_left_y=68&top_left_x=496)## MATHEMATICS OLYMPIAD  LOCAL STAGE  FEBRUARY 9, 2013## GRADE 5","solution":"## Subject 4.The sum of the father's, mother's, and the three daughters' ages is 88 years.

Therefore, we can assume that among the three unknowns, y is the (magnitude-wise) middle one, so either x leqq y leqq z or x geqq y geqq z. The largest unknown cannot be less than 1, since the sum of the positive powers of three numbers less than 1 is less than 3. Similarly, it can be shown that the smallest unknown cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, in the two distinguishable cases, x leqq 1 leqq z, or x geqq 1 geqq z.From the equality of the left sides of the first and second equations,y-1=frac{1}{y}left(left(x^{3}-xright)+left(z^{2}-z^{3}right)right)follows, while from the first and third equations,y-1=frac{1}{y^{2}}left(left(x-x^{2}right)+left(z^{3}-zright)right) .In the first case, the right side of (1) is the sum of two non-positive numbers, and the right side of (2) is the sum of two non-negative numbers; thus y-1=0, i.e., y=1.

Substituting y=1 into the first two equations of the system:x+z^{3}=2=x^{3}+z^{2},thusx-x^{3}=z^{2}-z^{3}In the first case, therefore,0 leqq x-x^{3}=z^{2}-z^{3} leqq 0which means x-x^{3}=z^{2}-z^{3}=0, i.e., x=1=z.

Observe that [OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;] the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from AF = FP and AE = EP.  Thus, by the Perpendicularity Lemma, AO is perpendicular to FE and hence BC.  Analogously, O lies on the B-altitude and C-altitude of triangle ABC, and so O is, indeed, the orthocenter of triangle ABC.To find the coordinates of O, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes BE and AD.

How many edges does the dodecahedron have where one of the two adjacent faces is blue and the other is green?","solution":"A dodecahedron has 12 faces, each of which is adjacent to exactly 5 others. The faces are labeled from A to L such that two faces of the dodecahedron are adjacent if and only if the corresponding regions on the first diagram are adjacent (the first diagram can be obtained by projecting the dodecahedron from a point \\"above\\" the A-labeled face onto the plane of the L-labeled face).Suppose A is red. Then B, C, D, E, and F cannot be red. If L is red, then G, H, I, J, and K cannot be red. If L is not red, then at most two of G, H, I, J, and K can be red. Therefore, the number of faces that are the same color as A, including A itself, is at most three. By the symmetries of the dodecahedron, this can be said about every face. Thus, each of the four colors appears on at most three faces; however, we have 12 faces in total, so each of the four colors must appear on exactly three faces.Write down the three colors that can meet at each vertex. Since faces of the same color do not share a vertex and there are three faces of each color, each color is written down at 5 cdot 3 = 15 vertices, and thus 20 - 15 = 5 vertices do not have any color written down. An edge connecting a blue and a green face must start from exactly one of the vertices where either the red or the yellow color is not present. This amounts to 2 cdot 5 = 10 vertices, but since each edge has two endpoints, there are exactly 5 edges where one face is blue and the other is green. Based on the work of Gábor Lippner (Fazekas M. Fóv. Gyak. Gimn., 12th grade).Note. The dodecahedron can be colored in several ways that meet the conditions - one possible coloring is shown on the back cover - and for every valid coloring, it is true that for any two colors, there are exactly 5 edges of the dodecahedron where the two adjacent faces are of the given two colors.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_a92da8a7c48288df6f11g-1.jpg?height=550&width=548&top_left_y=934&top_left_x=775)"},{"problem":"1.

The answer is (B).Let's refer to the figure below and assume that the ant starts from vertex A.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_e415f128e14398de33bcg-8.jpg?height=288&width=417&top_left_y=741&top_left_x=882)One type of path the ant can take is to initially traverse three sides of the same face (one of those to which A belongs), passing through all four of its vertices, then move (necessarily) to a vertex of the opposite face, and traverse its three sides, passing through all its vertices. An example of such a path is the sequence of vertices:## A B C D H G E F,where the ant first traverses three sides of the face A B C D and then the three sides of the opposite face: H G E F. Note that each of the two faces can be traversed in two distinct directions, so for each choice of the two opposite faces, there are four such paths. On the other hand, the starting vertex is common to three distinct faces, so we have 12 paths of this type. A second possibility is that the ant initially traverses only two sides of the same face, for example, the face A B C D, and then moves to a vertex of the opposite face, for example, suppose the beginning of the path is the sequence: A B C G. At this point, the ant must still pass through all the vertices of the face H G E F, except for G, and must pass through D. The only way to do this without passing through the same vertex twice is the sequence of vertices: E F H D. Thus, we have identified the path A B C G E F H D. A path similar to this, where the first two vertices are still from the face A B C D, is: A D C G H F E B. Therefore, we have two paths of this second type if we fix the face containing the first two sides that the ant traverses. Keeping in mind that the initial vertex is common to three faces, we have six paths of the second type. In total, we have identified 12+6=18 distinct paths.

For x_1 to be greater than 3, we have:[a - 1 > 3.]Solving this inequality for a gives:[a > 4.]Thus, the range of values for a for which the equation has one real root greater than 3 is a > 4.Therefore, the range of values for a is boxed{a > 4}."},{"problem":"The solution to the equation 9^x + 3^x - 2 = 0 is?","solution":"Let's first rewrite the equation by noticing that 9^x can be expressed as (3^2)^x = (3^x)^2.

Conclusion:   - The expression ((2^{a^2} cdot 19^{b^2} cdot 53^{c^2} + 8)^{16} - 1) modulo 17 simplifies to:     [     (2^{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} + 8)^{16} - 1 equiv (k)^{16} - 1 pmod{17}     ]     where (k) can be 9, 10, 12, or -1 modulo 17.   - Since (k^{16} equiv 1 pmod{17}) for any (k) (by Fermat's Little Theorem), the expression ((k)^{16} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{17}).Thus, the greatest common divisor of all numbers of the form ((2^{a^2} cdot 19^{b^2} cdot 53^{c^2} + 8)^{16} - 1) is 17.The final answer is (boxed{17})"},{"problem":"(solved by Mathieu Aria, Jeanne Nguyen and Thomas Williams).

Therefore, the number of second-grade parts drawn in the sample can be calculated as follows:The total number of parts is the sum of first-grade, second-grade, and third-grade parts. Since the sample is drawn proportionally from each grade, and 10 out of 20 parts drawn are third-grade, it implies that half of the parts in the batch are third-grade parts. Given that there are 24 first-grade parts and 36 second-grade parts, the total number of parts before adding third-grade parts is 24 + 36 = 60. Since half of the parts are third-grade, the total number of parts in the batch must be 60 times 2 = 120. Therefore, the number of third-grade parts is 120 - 60 = 60.The number of second-grade parts drawn in the sample can be calculated based on the proportion of second-grade parts in the non-third-grade parts. Since there are 36 second-grade parts out of 60 non-third-grade parts, and 10 parts are drawn from the non-third-grade parts (since 10 are third-grade parts), the expected number of second-grade parts drawn is frac{36}{60} times 10 = 6.Therefore, the number of third-grade parts in this batch is boxed{60}, and the number of second-grade parts drawn in the sample is boxed{6}."},{"problem":"9.

Both (k_1 times n) and (k_2 times n) boards can be covered.   - By joining the tilings for these two boards along the common edge of length (n), we obtain a tiling for the ((m+1) times n) board.   - Thus, by strong induction, any (m times n) board can be tiled for (m, n geq 5).5. Determining which boards cannot be tiled:   - (4 times n) boards: For (n < 5), specifically (4 times 1), (4 times 2), and (4 times 4) boards cannot be tiled since the number of squares is not a multiple of 3 and a (2 times 5) tile cannot fit.   - (3 times n) boards: Every (3 times n) board can be tiled trivially.   - (2 times n) boards: A (2 times n) board can be tiled if (n = 3a + 5b) for nonnegative integers (a) and (b). By the Chicken-McNugget theorem, every integer (n) beyond 7 can be written in this way. Thus, (2 times 1), (2 times 2), (2 times 4), and (2 times 7) boards cannot be tiled.   - (1 times n) boards: A (1 times n) board can be tiled if (n) is a multiple of 3 since the (5 times 2) piece cannot fit.6. Conclusion:   - The boards that cannot be covered are the (4 times 4), (2 times 2), (2 times 4), (2 times 7), (1 times (3k+1)), and (1 times (3k+2)) boards.   - Every other board can be covered.The final answer is the boards that cannot be covered are the ( boxed{ 4 times 4 } ), (2 times 2), (2 times 4), (2 times 7), (1 times (3k+1)), and (1 times (3k+2)) boards."},{"problem":"11) Marco says: \\"My team was ahead of yours in the standings for all the first three rounds, and only now at the fourth have you caught up with us\\".Roberto replies: \\"But don't forget that at the third round we drew at your place and that, unlike you, we are still undefeated\\".

This problem explores inductive reasoning and computation, making it rather challenging.To begin, we can try listing the first few terms of the sequence: a_1 = -1, a_2 > a_1 implies that a_2 = -1 + |a_{2}-a_1| = -1 + 2^1 = 1.

Continuing this pattern, we notice that for each odd-index term, the sequence decreases and each even-index term, the sequence increases.

One set of alternate vertices forms a square area 5. The other set forms a rectangle area 4. What is the maximum possible area for the octagon? Solution","solution":": 3√5. Evidently the circle has radius √5/√2, and the rectangle has sides √2 and 2√2. The trick is to focus on the rectangle. The area of the octagon is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the four triangles on its sides. The area of each of these triangles is maximised by taking the vertex midway between the two vertices of the rectangle. But these four midpoints happen to form a square. The area of the two triangles with common base on a side of the rectangle, one with third vertex at the centre of the circle and the other at the midpoint of the arc is (radius x side)/2. So the total area of the octagon is (radius x sum of two adjacent sides of the rectangle) = 3√5. 61st Putnam 2000 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 1 Jan 2001"},{"problem":"33.

Since they are perpendicular and pass through the point P(1,1), one of the lines will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the other line's slope.Let the slope of line l1 be m; consequently, the slope of line l2 will be -frac{1}{m}.The equation of a line with slope m that passes through P(1,1) is given by: y - 1 = m(x - 1).
