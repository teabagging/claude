This is mainly self limiting and doesnt require any specific treatment and you should just be patient and have fluids to promote urination.  Less likely it may indicate possible bleeding in urethra, bladder or kidneys from popped vessel or some other cause. IF this continues you should do urine analysis, urinoculture and kidneys ultrasound to rule these main causes out. You should drink raspberry tea and plenty of water till you do tests. Also, avoid sexual intercourse and have keep good hygiene. You should reduce salt in your diet as well since this could lead to increased risk of urinary stone formation.

I understand your concern. Uric acid level of 7.8mg/dl seems to be borderline high. If you are taking alcohol and frequent non-vegetarian diet, kindly avoid it, as it would contribute to increased uric acid level. Also, drink good quantity of water along with citrus fruit juices, which would help to bring uric acid level down and maintain within normal limits. However, increased uric acid level does not contribute to cause dizziness. It might have happened due to decrease in hemoglobin level. Kindly check your hemoglobin level in blood.

I understand your concern. It appears from your description that you are having delay in ejaculation rather than premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation means getting ejaculation soon after inserting penis into vagina, most often within a minute of sexual activity. Since you are able to ejaculate during masturbation, things are fine and normal with you. Delay in ejaculation could be due to lack of proper sexual stimulation or aurosal and due to apprehension or anxiety. Spend more time during foreplay to get enough stimulation. Penetrate slowly and relax in between while having intercourse. Use proper lubricant to achieve good lubrication. You must remember that every sexual activity doesn't always end up with ejaculation.

He wants to know if this is caused by excessive weed smoking or excessive smoking in general...","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. It is a known fact that cigarette smoking in general leads to impotency. Weed or marijuana smoking is highly associated with erectile dysfunction (lack of erection) and both of these in combination are too bad for sexual health in a male. Even otherwise, both these agents are highly addictive, and potentially dangerous as you must know. It is highly recommendable that he stops smoking both these agents as early as possible. He can seek medical attention for treatment of withdrawal. It is not easy, and you, as fiance, must persuade him and support him mentally to quit. Take care,Regards"},{"Patient":"thank you for your web, I'm male in age 22 (172cm - 70kgs). actually I have a question about HYPERSNMNIA, I felt that throughout previous days, I used to sleep for much longer time than usual, I'm not married, so my question is, could that oversleeping be related to the lack of ejaculation? coz I got red of masturbation for few days ago. thank you so much.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, your hypersomnia, is not due to lack of ejaculation. Ask someone who sleeps near you if you are snoring in deep sleep. If yes, get your blood pressure checked. Snoring, causes less oxygen supply to the body during sleep, which is a usual cause of oversleeping. Also, rule out fatigue, excessive drinking or smoking, excessive stress and ever exercise can lead to oversleeping. You must avoid taking any medicines for sleep related issues, unless prescribed.

I can understand your concern. Spots on the Penis are usually not as serious as they appear. They may be regular modifications of the underlying skin structures. They are of concern only if you have had a unprotected sexual intercourse in the last couple of weeks to months.

Phimosis is a congenital narrowing of the opening of the foreskin so that it cannot be retracted. Phimosis is a very common problem. In most of the cases you can clear the problem yourself.  Phimosis could cause moderate to severe pain while having vaginal intercourse. Apply oil on your foreskin and on the glans. Move the foreskin forward and back slowly without hurting you much. Because the oil is lubricant, it will be easier than without oil. Do this forward and back movement 20 times several times in a day. Repeat the same every day for around one month. You will get the elasticity and you will be able to retract the foreskin completely. In case if there is no result from the above massage, you can always go for a minor surgical procedure called circumcision. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Sorry to hear about your problem but as such torn frenulum should not cause any kind of problems except pain. I've seen so many such cases who present with torn frenulum following violent usage. You can do one thing, wait for the thing to settle down or Get a small surgery done. Circumcision. This can completely solve your problem forever and you can be tension free. I strongly recommend that you get a circumcision done. There are absolutely no side effects or complications associated. We do a lot of such surgeries.

I had sexual contact with a female about a month ago. We did not have sex though we may have had genital contact and she performed oral sex on my unprotected. I had not taken a shower after the oral sex for about a week and a half. About a week and half after contact and after not showering i noticed one bump on the head of my penis. I also got tonsilitis. I talked to a doctor and he said it was nothing to worry about and it healed in a week. About a week after that i noticed a rash on my scrotum which spread to my whole penis.

It has come and gone over the last few days and only recently i noticed one small painless red bump on the shaft of my penis. Could this be herpes?

Is it likely that Pradaxa is the cause of the hematospermia? Is this anything to worry about?","Doctor":"Good day and thank you for being with healthcare magic!!!Yes pradaxa would make you at risk for bleeding in the seminal vesicle especially after sexual activity or rigorous ejaculation. It is also better to have your prostate checked to rule out prostate pathology that may cause the blood in the semen.  Prostate should be checked by serum PSA, ultrasound and a digital rectal examination by a urologist. Majority of blood in the semen are self limiting and goes away on its own. You might need to abstain for 1-2 weeks from ejaculation and everything will become normal."},{"Patient":"I'm a 29 year old female, 5'3\\", 125 pounds, no current health problems.

This condition is termed hematospermia and is self limiting without any treatment. Cessation of masturbation or any form of ejaculation would help heal the body              .

The Dr. said that because the stone had started to grow into the tissue he had to cut a little with laser to actually get it out. After this procedure I of course had the expected burning when urinating. He also put a temporary stent in the right ureter which stayed in for four days. On the fifth day I had it removed. By this time the stent had made urinating nearly impossible and always bloody with very little flow. During all this time I restrained from any sexual activity. Upon removal of the stent my urination improved quite a lot, meaning that the stream is stronger ( although still not normal ) and no blood is visible. Although there is no burning, there was for about a day a slight ache in the urethra. By today I felt well enough to try sex. Upon ejaculation I experienced an extreme aching pain and some burning. The was also a little blood and I was unable to pass urine for a good 10 minutes after even though I felt like I needed to.

A few days after it started, I went to the bathroom and peed a dark cherry red color with blot clots that looked like little leaches.  I went to the hospital and they said i had an infection and put me on antibiotics.  The dark colored pee went away within 24 hours, but the low dull pain remained.  I developed infections on both sides of my torso 6 inches below my armpits.  I went to my doctor and he gave me a complete evaluation.  He put me on an antibiotic to treat both the infections in my side and my testicle pain.  The infections in my torso have healed but, the testicle pain persists and has moved to right above my penis.  I treat the pain with ibuprofin and my doctor has me on a generic flowmax, in case it is kidney stones.  I went to a specialist, and they had a PA look at me.  He did not have any answers but reccommended a CT scan and another procedure where they stick a probe down my penis...not looking forward to that.  Yesterday, I peed another of those leachlike blood clots, but ulike last time my pee was yellow not dark cherry red.  It was a single clot.   Oh, I am 45 years old, 5'10\\", and weigh 240.

The width and length of erect penis vary greatly from one individual to another. Practically there is no absolute length of penis which may be considered as NORMAL. In fact, size of penis has no relationship with sexual satisfaction of the partner by genital contact during vaginal entry and movements. This is because only outer one and half inch vagina is sensitive to touch and stimulation. Inner vagina is largely insensitive. So, if your penis size is greater than two inch, it gives enough satisfaction to both of you during sex. So do not worry about it. Early ejaculations for your expectations are common at your age. You can use start stop method, double condom, female on top with active role and Kegel's exercise to delay the ejaculations. Medicines are usually not required for you. Once you indulge in sexual activity with your partner, you can gradually use these methods and learn to improve the duration of delay.Hope I have answered your query.

Semen comes out normally under following circumstances: sexual intercourse orgasm, masturbation orgasm, night emission or night fall. All these are normal body responses. Sexual arousal (watching, thinking about erotic content) usually causes discharge of pre ejaculate (Not semen). This is a fluid of sex organs and small glands in urine tube. This is also a normal response. Masturbation itself does not cause spontaneous semen leakage. Don’t worry about that. I suggest counseling with a psychiatrist. No pills are required because you do not have any disease.Hope I have answered your query.

This kind of curiosities is common at your age and I will address them with my best efforts. The size of penis has no relationship with sexual satisfaction of the either partner by peno vaginal contact. Only outer vagina is sensitive. Inner 2/3 is largely insensitive. So penis size more than two inch is enough. There are small glands in the way of urine tube (prostate and bulbourethral glands) which produce the fluid during sexual arousal. Just alike food causes salivation in mouth. This is also a normal response of your body, not a disease. Do not worry. Night falls are normal response of body when semen accumulates in the pouch and not utilized in sexual intercourse or masturbation. It will stop when you regularly remain active sexually.Hope I have answered your query.

Spend more time in foreplay and withdraw your penis when you feel like ejaculation.

He has been stressed out about money and not sleeping very much so I thought it was that, but I can't help thinking he isn't interested. Can stress cause erectile issues?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Sex is largely what happens between two ears and two minds and not that happens between two legs. There are many possible reasons leading to erectile dysfunction and commonest is stress or performance anxiety. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This diminishes arousal level and hence erection too. This seems more likely with your partner. Both of you can go for counseling with sex therapist if this happens repeatedly.Hope I have answered your query.

Size does not matter at all as far as sexual satisfaction of either partner by peno vaginal contact is concerned. Only lower 1 and half inch vagina is sensitive to touch and stimulation, inner is insensitive. For this penis size more than 1.5 inch is more than enough. Size varies from person to person.

Please suggest me","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I can understand your concern about size of penis and fear of early ejaculation with partner. Penis size or circumference has no effect on sexual satisfaction of either partner by penis-vaginal containment. Only lower vagina (outer 1 and half inch only) has nerve fibers. Inner vagina is largely insensitive and lacks nerve fibers. So, to arouse the partner during vaginal containment, you should focus only on outer vagina. For this erect penis size more than 2 inches is more than enough. Fear of early ejaculation does cause it. Once you engage in sex with partner you will learn gradually.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I can understand your concern to stop night emissions. Night dream name is a misnomer. In fact, dreams have nothing to do with semen emission.

Frankly a lower testosterone level probably cannot have an effect that fast nor is it likely to occur.Everything about the testicle can be examined with some simple tests (testosterone blood level + ultrasound)."},{"Patient":"Hi, i have a problem with what seems like hives/ blisters that keep appearing under my foreskin. Sometimes they get better and seem to go away, leaving a small scar-like mark. Whenever i have sex or masturbate it seems to come back though. Do you have any idea what this may be?","Doctor":"Dermatologic conditions are difficult to say without seeing them. This is a very good example of that. while it could be herpes, it is NOT LIKELY AT ALL.Local irritation breaks the skin there in patterns of small holes. Local irritation:1) occurs with rubbing 2) occurs immediately after rubbing 3) is only in the area of rubbing 4) goes up and down fast and can reoccur in under 30 days 5) can leave scarsHerpes is the opposite on each and every one of those.While some of the possibilities are herpes, other skin or venereal infections, heck, even insect bites. None of those is at all likely, and just local skin breakdown is a more likely possibility.Better lubricant mainly; You want one that allows surfaces to slide better not worse.

Masturbation is done in privacy and one often have concern 'to finish it fast' for fear of breach in privacy. So one's mind learns to ejaculate soon unconsciously.I suggest reducing the frequency of masturbation.You can practice start-stop technique to learn to identify the point of ejaculatory inevitability.

(As if try to hold urine intermittently during voiding)5.  Penile squeeze technique applied at the point of ejaculatory inevitability.6.

(Other than vaginal containment movements only)8. You can do masturbation before sex (at least 2 hours before). It will make seminal vesicles somewhat empty. So, at the time of sex, semen will take more time to come out.Remember that do not evaluate the sexual satisfaction and success ONLY in terms of TIC TIC OF TIME, SEX STROKES , NUMBER OF THRUSTS OR HOURS. It is the PLEASURE (touching and being touched) NOT THE TIME is the key to healthy sex life.There are medications like Paroxetine20 mg or Dapoxetine 30 mg with Sildenafil 50 mg which helps to delay orgasm with improving erectile function.

When you donate one unit of blood (350ml) your body makes it again within 1 month. Similarly when you spit, the mouth restores saliva soon. When you cry, the lost tears get restored by our eyes and they do not get dry. Thus semen also keeps on being generated by our sex organs. Semen is being manufactured by genital organs continuously; it has to be expelled by some means. This situation is just similar to a glass of full water to which you add more water, with the logical result that it overflows! This happens to semen too. If one neither has sex nor masturbation for long time, semen gets expelled in the form of night emissions, which is normal. You may simply use sanitary pad temporarily. Night emission will gradually disappear when you become sexually active.Consistency and the manner of ejaculation (spurting or oozing) largely depend upon factors such as period of abstinence, age and intensity of arousal and sexual stimulation.However, reduced consistency and oozing semen during ejaculation does not indicate sexual inadequacy. Do not worry about it. You may go for semen analysis test for your satisfaction.Penis size has no relationship effect on sexual satisfaction of the partner because only outer vagina is sensitive to stimulation. Inner vagina is insensitive.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"hello doctors how r u i hope u r all is well. my questio is that i am 23 year old and my penis is 6 inc but i like to grow my penis longer then natural position plz give me advice which type of oil or medicin  i can use. for growthing penis fast please answer my mail question on my personal mail id my id is ( YYYY@YYYY ) i am waiting for ur reply thanks for all of u","Doctor":"Dear service userThank you for writing to Healthcaremagic.I have gone through your question and understood your query regarding size of your penis.Dear friend, the concern regarding penile size is very common especially among young men. The width and length of erect penis vary greatly from one individual to another. Your concern to increase the size of penis is seems unrealistic. Large penis gives better sexual satisfaction to partner is a very common myth.The fact is that the size of penis has no relationship with sexual satisfaction of the partner. The lack of knowledge causes fear and apprehension. Another fact is that only outer one third and the front wall of vagina have nerve fibers and hence sensitive to stimulation and contact by penis. Rest of inner two third vagina is largely insensitive. So if you want to arouse your partner during sex, you should focus on the areas of maximum nerve endings hence clitoris and inner lips or labia minora, the outer wall and outer two third of vagina. Now you can understand that female sexual gratification, the size of erect penis could be anything from two inches or more! (Your is six)You remember that what important is strength and not the length! Entry and to and fro continuous movements are adequate. It is men's technique, not his penis size that characterizes the lover in him.Avoid these unrealistic expectations and be happy.I hope this will help you.If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

The man starts masturbation and stops just prior to orgasmic inevitability. He allows arousal level to decline and re-stimulates. One should continue this 'start-stop' sequence for about 15 minutes. This is how you can gain ejaculatory control gradually. There are medications like Paroxetine20 mg or Dapoxetine 30 mg with Sildenafil 50 mg which helps to delay orgasm with improving erectile function. These medicines must be taken under medical supervision.Female on top position with active role during coitus helps one to delay climax. One can lead the partner to orgasm by stimulating other erogenous zones rather than vaginal containment only. I recommend you to consult psychiatrist trained in psychosexual medicine, who will guide you how to utilize all these techniques effectively best suited for you.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"hi dr. i m 29 yrs old boy. i want to know about the bad effect of hand pratice? and how i can core this problem? i m going to b married in next few months i m feeling so bad after reading the bad effect of hand practice. kindly suggest me diets and herbal foods to core. and kindly tell me is hand practice effects future fertility? and satisfaction of women sexual desire?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic.

You should  avoid intercourse for till symptoms persist and drink plenty of fluids. If symptoms persist it would be good to do prostate ultrasound and check your PSA levels to rule out prostate tumor or hypertrophy and further treatment depends on these findings.

If you are able to achieve and maintain erection in any one of the above mentioned situations than your problem is more likely psychological rather than physical.Sex is largely what happens between two ears and not that happens between two legs. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to functional or situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This is the most common cause of inability to achieve or loosing established erection during sexual intercourse with partner.This 'failure' of erection makes one feel 'I should perform best' and he 'tries to erect’. This in turn further leads to lack of erection as mind gets anxiously diverted towards own performance rather than enjoying kindling.Some common causes of erectile dysfunction are:- 1. Diabetes 2. Some medicines like anti depressants and anti psychotics3. Hypertension3. Performance anxiety (the most common reason as I described earlier)4. Alcohol use5. SmokingWhen similar patients come to my clinic I prescribe them Sildenafil 50 to 100 mg to be taken 1 hour before anticipated sexual activity. But it should be taken only under medical supervision as it can be harmful if taken in extra dose than needed.  I also suggest them sensate focus exercise. You may read on internet. For helping you in the best way, I recommend you to consult a psychiatrist well versed with psycho sexual therapies. He will definitely assist you to find out cause of erectile dysfunction in your case.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Am worried about my penis size. Even though I haven't lost my virginity yet, after marriage, my ex-wife gave me divorce mainly due to penis size. The size of my penis is hardly over 3.7 inches after erection and 1.5 inches when in flaccid state. Now, have I lost my manhood & manly women's perspective? Am I unfit to satisfy any girl on earth sexually? Please answer.","Doctor":"DDear service userThank you for contacting Healthcaremagic.Hi, I have gone through your question and understood your query regarding size of your penis.Your concern regarding penile size is genuine. The width and length of erect penis vary greatly from one individual to another.The fact is that the size of penis has no relationship with sexual satisfaction by female partner by experiencing genital sensations during intercourse. This is very rampant myth. The lack of knowledge causes fear and apprehension. Let me explain how this happens.Only outer one third and the front wall of vagina have nerve fibers and hence sensitive to stimulation. Rest of inner two third is largely insensitive. So if you want to arouse your partner during sex, you should focus on the areas of maximum nerve endings hence clitoris and inner lips or labia minora, the outer wall and outer two third of vagina. So for female sexual gratification, the size of erect penis could be anything from two inches or more!You remember that what important is strength and not the length! Entry and to and fro continuous movements are adequate. It is men's technique, not his penis size that characterizes the lover in him.\\"Bigger is better\\" logic does not apply here.You are fit to satisfy your partner by intercourse.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"i suffer from premature ejaculation. im terrified of sex, to the point ive stayed single for a year so i wouldnt have to deal with this problem. but, ive got a new girlfriend, we havent had sex yet but ive told her about this problem and she says she understands and she wont be upset, but i know it will frustrate her. i dont know how to stop it. its affecting me emotionally. what can i do?","Doctor":"Hello, Premature ejaculation is usually a psychological problem rather than physiological and it happens due to stress and anxiety.

What penis does in vagina during sexual intercourse, same it does during masturbation in your folded palm!

Is it unusual to have this beyond the teen years? These are not preceded by erotic dreams, in fact i am not sexually aroused during the day either. Im not currently sexually active, is that the cause? I read that masturbation can cause these, but i haven't masturbated in a very long time. I dont have any backache, or fatigue the following morning, no problems really, except for the fact that it is embaressing and annoying. Is this a medical problem? Do i need to consult a doctor? Is there any way to stop this?","Doctor":"Dear user,Thank you for writing to HCM.I understand your concerns about night emissions.There is nothing unusual to have this. It can occur at any age, common in those who are less sexually active (Not engaged in masturbation or sexual intercourse with partner).Semen is a body fluid which keeps on generated in body like other body fluids as blood, saliva and tears. When you donate one unit of blood (350ml) your body makes it again within 1 month. Similarly when you spit, the mouth restores saliva soon. When you cry, the lost tears get restored by our eyes and they do not get dry. Thus semen also keeps on being generated by our sex organs. Semen is being manufactured by genital organs continuously; it has to be expelled by some means. This situation is just akin to a glass of full water to which you add more water, with the logical result that it overflows! This happens to semen too. If one neither has sex nor masturbation for long time, semen gets expelled in the form of night emissions, which is normal.Masturbation doesn't cause it but reduces night emissions. This is not a disease. No need for any treatment.You may simply use sanitary pad temporarily. Night emission will gradually disappear when you become sexually active.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I'm dashmeet singh. Actualy I ws very fat ws suffering frm obesity..

Most likely, the fluid is of sex organs and tiny glands in the way of urine tube that come out from penis during voiding urine. This is not semen. The smell of the fluid and consistency may be like semen. Nothing to be worried about. This is normal thing and not disease.2. Retrograde ejaculation (Ejaculation of semen does not occur outside but it occurs back into the urine pouch during sexual orgasm).

It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines.I hope I have answered you query.

This situation is just akin to a glass of full water to which you add more water, with the logical result that it overflows! This happens to semen too. If one neither has sex nor masturbation for long time, semen gets expelled in the form of night emissions, which is normal.  This is not an illness or disease. No need to consult doctor for this.When one engages in regular sexual activity with partner or masturbation, the night emissions will be decreased or disappear. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

This is not semen. The smell of the fluid and consistency may be like semen.Physical, mental weakness and premature ejaculations are secondary to anxiety of your perceived semen loss.When patients with similar problem comes to my clinic, I suggest them Capsule Fluoxetine 20 mg to be taken daily in the morning after breakfast and Clonazepam 0.5 mg to be taken at bedtime. These medicines should be taken under medical supervision. There are some behavior modification techniques proven to be useful for premature ejaculation.1. Stop-start technique of behavior therapy.2. Female on top with active role.3. Double condom5. Pelvic muscle strengthening exercise. (As if try to hold urine intermittently during voiding)6.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Blood in the semen can come from several different sources:Infection and inflammation. This is the most common cause of blood in the semen. Blood can come from an infection or inflammation, in any of the glands, tubes, or ducts that produce and move semen from the body. These include: Prostate(the gland that produces the fluid part of semen), Urethra (the tube that carries urine and semen from the penis and Epididymis. Treatments target the known cause:•     Antibiotics are used for infections.•     An anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed for some types of inflammation.•     If an STD or medical condition such as high blood pressure or liver disease is the culprit, the doctor will treat that condition.•     When blood in semen stems from a recent urology procedure, such as a prostate biopsy, it usually disappears by itself in a matter of weeks.In younger men, blood in the semen that happens just once or twice without any additional symptoms or history of certain medical conditions can disappear on its own without treatment.It can also come from an STI (sexually transmitted infection) such asgonorrhea or chlamydia, or from another viral or bacterial infection.

He used to do PEgym but not for a long time. One day he used a vacuum pump and after a week we noticed a small bruise on his glans. He also noticed extremely sharp pain one day while urinating and that never happened again in that shape. He sometimes could feel mysterious pain, not knowing where is it from- is it in penis, testicle, his foot or gluteus. Somewhat before that he was on his TRT since he s a bodybuilder. He never had problems with erection even on his post cycle therapy, but after that injury he suddenly lost his ability to reach orgasm. That bruise was still there, and we went to a 6 OR 7 DIFFERENT UROLOGISTS, AND NOT A ONE TOLD US TO QUIT SEX. We always got a reply THE MORE THE MERRIER. And since we didn t receive NOT ONCE different answer, we kept having sex daily, even with anorgasmia problem. Later on, A YEAR LATER, after neverending research via internet for possible diagnosis, we gave ourselves a death sentence that it MUST be a nerve damage. Since his numbness wasn t present on entire glans, and not even on that part where the bruise is, i just thought this could be some liquid trapped in his glans, and i also did not want to believe that human body doesn t have a defensing system that can take care of that. I mean, if God, or whoever, have us joy of sex and orgasms, why he won t give us something that can protect our friends from that kind of injury, right? So, after a year and a few months, he realized that his glans skin started to thicken and loosen its color. It started being somewhat pale-ish and dry, also with some of the wreckles that started to emerge. I got a new job and my boss s wife is a dermatologist, so i realized we need to see a new doctor (since even dermatologists weren t able to tell us WHAT S THE PROBLEM- and since here in Serbia not a single doctor believes in keratinization) we gave that doctor a visit. She looked at his penis and right away she said- that s eczema . My fiancee used to wash his penis with baby soaps that are a bit more alkaline and can cause dryness, but we never had a direct thought that could lead us that that s wrong. He used a lot of creams to moisture his glans, urea&those kind of creams, but nothing could change. He did blood work and his estradiol and prolactin levels were THREE (yes) times higher than normal level should be. So we also took cabergoline (dostinex) to try with that. Those days he also had erection problems...a lot of them. So the dermatologist told us to STOP USING SOAP, try using only non perfumed creams (here in our country we have a cream that s called Pantenol and it s for all skin problems), and to take some apothecary cream that she s going to prescribe. Suddenly, literally a weak after he stopped using soap and started using right creams (Pantenol, we still didn t get a pharmacy one) his penis started tingling like when he was uncircumcised. He called that as a constant arousal feeling . His glans has became all sensitive like before, he could feel everything from the ligther touch to harder ones. We were enormously happy... I cant even tell you what kind of problems we were having with our relationship since he agreed that his life can end now if he can t enjoy in me, or I can with him, since I couldn t relax always wondering does he feel something when i do something or not. It was hell. Fights, crying, depression. I can t even describe. So we were in heaven again! Sex 3-4 times a day, two or three times a week. Living a dream. We also took HGH (human growth hormone) since we read that it helps skin and nerves rejuvenation. It is expensive as hell but we took a shot. But then, he got on his another steroid cycle. His sensitivity had also slighter decreased before cycle, but we thought it s probably cause we did it too much. And on cycle it started increasing again. But then it stopped. And then started decreasing again. I need to say that he started his cycle with still increased levels of estrogen. His glans dried even more. It was red only in the middle, right on the tip and on his upper side, opposite of frenulum. But there was no bruising, no capillaries broken, nor anything. I guess we just went too much again and it caused that. His erections are fine, he gets aroused only by kissing me and having a foreplay, but now he tells me he doesn t feel a SINGLE SPOT on his glans that s sensitive. Not even when he squeezes glans a bit. His orgasms are again, how he s saying dry, without build up, the build up lasts for a second or two and then disappears. I can actually relate that problem with post cycle therapy since he had that problem before. But the paleness... I don t know how can that even happen since in last 2 months we were really careful, we had sex only once a week with sometimes two weeks break, just in case. He is again in that stadium that this is a nerve damage, but i really doubt that since ENTIRE SENSITIVITY GOT BACK ONCE BEFORE, even after a YEAR of bruise on glans! I m sorry for the words, but i m completely in pain. My soul aches cause I can t give him any advice, he just rejects everything and sometimes even blames on me. But he always says that before there were spots on glans where he always could feel something, and in that way he learned to check whether something damaged or not. PLEASE give me some advice, has anyone had this problem and solved it? I need to say that he takes supplements, vitamins D, E, maca root, muira puama, lecithin, royal jelly, l-arginine, and so and so since i can t remember every of them right now. PLEASE HELP.

If he is able to achieve and maintain erection in any one of the above mentioned situations than his problem is more likely psychological rather than physical.Sex is largely what happens between two ears and not that happens between two legs. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to functional or situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This diminishes arousal level and hence erection too.This 'failure' of erection makes one feel 'I should perform best' and he 'tries to erect’.

Hence the pouch of semen remains full and it gets expelled in the form of night emission.When you will engage in regular masturbation or sexual activity and semen gets expelled, night emission will not occur.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Im 40 yrs old, 5 11,210 lbs and no serious medical history.

Thank you for your query.It sounds like varicose vein or epididimal cyst and usualy isnt anything serious. Especially considering that it last for 3 years.  If I am right then treatment isnt needed.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.All these symptoms are suggestive of epididimitis which is inflammation of part of testicle and not uncommon in males. This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequances. MAsturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy.

Nothing else happened (no sex, no bleeding). No other sexual encounters. I cannot recall if the massager had any cuts on his hand. For a week I felt sore which is what I m used to after I do solitary anal masturbation (rarely). But after that week I ve been feeling moderate to severe rectal pain; mostly burning pain; sometimes spasm-like pain; feeling something is stuck in the rectum; sometimes the pain radiates into my groin, testicles and upper thighs. The pain starts a while after a bowel movement and lasts the whole day, reducing in pain in the late evening and starting again next morning with the next BM. This was since 7 weeks; there were days when I felt almost healed - mostly when I had soft stool BMs. However, a somewhat large stool would trigger it again. I never had any bleeding nor discharge; light diarrhea is also painful. Defecation itself hurts a little, but after an hour it starts to burn the whole day. A GP did a digital exam and found nothing. A GI doctor did proctoscopy up to the descending colon and found nothing (I was feeling OK that day I must say). Said it could be a fissure that heals and recurs. Well now to the question. I m worried that I got an STD from this act. What worries me in particular is that the radiating stinging pain into the groin area/thigh is not typical of fissures, but could be herpes (from my own internet research). Burning pain is predominant though. Do my symptoms sound like early herpes proctitis? Should I test for STDs? Could proctoscopy examination show nothing, while an STD infection could still be there and cause symptoms? I appreciate your answers and insight into how to continue dealing with this if it doesn t resolve.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.It may still be std even if rectal examination was fine. you should have tested for herpes and hpv and also do colonoscopy to reevaluate possible rectal polyps or hemorrhoids.I hope I have answered you query.

It is not only about regrowth of the skin but getting back the sensitivity of the nerves after circumcision also.

Any ideas what could be causing this.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.All these symptoms are suggestive of epididimitis which is inflammation of part of testicle and not uncommon in males. This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequances. MAsturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy. In this particular case, I don’t think this is required.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.DR.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.All these symptoms are suggestive of epididimitis which is inflammation of part of testicle and not uncommon in males. This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequances. MAsturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy.

Should i go back to a doctor to have him check it out again?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Bactrim is not associated with twitches in the scrotum. If your doctor said that your are suffering for epididymitis, then these spasms may be associated with the epididymitis and not the antibiotics. You can wait until the course is complete and infection is eliminated. Most probably it will go away with the infection. In addition, try to do some changes in your lifestyle so that if the spasms are muscular, it can help. You can try to avoid prolonged sitting and try to do some exercises like swimming or brisk walking.

Later that evening my left testicle kind of tingled and the next day I have felt a greater aching feeling in my groin area radiating back to my left testicle. Its not an intense pain but its uncomfortable. Whats goin on?","Doctor":"Higreetings. Since your pain started after a heavy work it could be a traumatic injury to the groin area and left testis.When you have pain in the testis ,pain will radiate to the groin area as testis is  connected with spermatic  cord and it's structures.If there is a weakness in muscles near the groin  area chances of hernia after lifting heavy object is there.so if you feel so avoid lifting heavy object. Some times inflammation of the spermatic cord can also cause a dragging pain in testis and groin. If there is swelling or severe pain you should consult a urologist to rule out torsion  of testis.Or else can try some analgesic tablets.If no relief consult an andrologist.hope my answer helps you.

So basically my question is how long will all the changes take? Its just I've met somebody recently but I've always been very reluctant to get into a relationship as I wouldn't be able to have sex/get an errection. So I was wondering how long does it take till I can start getting erections and engaging in intercourse","Doctor":"Higreetings. I understand your concern. Since your consultant told you that with out testosterone injection you will not reach puberty meaning, either your testis is not producing enough testosterone or there is inadequate stimulus from your pituitary gland to the testis.Now I have no idea of your age , present hormonal status and your body stature.(I mean your hair pattern and size of the Penis etc).IF TESTOSTERONE IS NOT PRODUCED IN YOUR BODY YOU WILL NEED THIS FOR A LONG TIME TILL YOU HAVE TO BE ACTIVE IN SEX.It depends up on the dose and it is calculated as per your hormonal levels. It is safe and you will be able to have normal sex.So don't worry about it and to know about your present stage discuss with your doctor as I have no access to examine you.hope my answer helps you.

I understand your concern .Most probably your pain could have been because of hernia getting partly obstructed and ending up in casualty. I hope that was repaired and you are free of hernia now.Coming to the second reason for pain is of epididymis infection.Even if you take antibiotics for 2 to 3 weeks the pain may not subside as the infection may not be corrected completly.There may be associated testis and prostatic involvement which might need prolonged antimicrobial treatment. An urology consultation will help you in  confirming the pain and continuing antibiotics .So I suggest you to take an expert opinion.Hope my answer helps you.

It seems like you are having two problems concurrently, one is the start of urinary tract infection felt as pain and burning sensation in the pubic area while other being the bruising on the outer thigh due to constant rubbing of your clothes while walking.I would advise you to start antibiotics for the UTI. Levofloxacin 250 mg (Levoflox) twoce a day for 5 days can help you along with drinking lots of water and taking rest. A usual painkiller that suits you can help in relieving pain.For the bruising, try to use a lubricant over the area and wear loose fitting clothes so that the rubbing and sweating is less resulting in less bruising and discomfort.I hope this answer helps you.
