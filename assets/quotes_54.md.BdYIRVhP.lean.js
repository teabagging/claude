Determine |FQ|: The distance from the focus F to the point Q on the asymptote can be found using the formula |FQ|=frac{|bc|}{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}. Given that |FQ|=b, we have frac{|bc|}{sqrt{a^2+b^2}} = b.3. Use the right triangle QOF: In the right triangle formed by Q, O (the center of the hyperbola), and F, we can express cos angle QFO as cos angle QFO = frac{b}{c}.4. Define |QN| and |QM|: Let |QN|=t, then according to the problem, |QM|=3t, and thus |FN|=b-t.5. Apply the definition of the hyperbola: For the distances to the foci, we have |NF'|=b-t+2a and |MF'|=b+3t-2a.6. Calculate cos angle NFF' and cos angle MFF': Using the cosine rule in triangles FNF' and FMF', we get:   - cos angle NFF' = frac{4c^2+(b-t)^2-(b-t+2a)^2}{2 times 2c(b-t)}   - cos angle MFF' = frac{4c^2+(b+3t)^2-(b+3t-2a)^2}{2 times 2c(b+3t)}7.

Find the relationship between a and b: Equating the two expressions for t, we get a+b=3b-3a, which simplifies to b=2a.9.

From the last estimate of C and the maximum value of D, it follows thatfrac{C}{D} geqq frac{5 N-81}{(7 N+9)(5 N+9)}The last fraction is \\"many times\\" larger than the fraction at the end of case A, because both fractions have the same denominator, while comparing the numerators clearly results in: 5 N-81 gg 18 (the inequality 5 N-81>18 holds for values of N geq 20).Conclusion: We will add the digit x=2 to the numerator and the digit y=9 to the denominator.GUIDING PROBLEMS:"},{"problem":"Let's group the triangles from the previous task according to their longest side.

Let the radius of the sector be r and the arc length be l. The problem gives us two key pieces of information:1. The circumference of the sector is 12, which includes the arc length and the two radii. This can be expressed as:[l + 2r = 12]2. The area of the sector is 8, which can be calculated using the formula for the area of a sector, frac{1}{2}lr. This gives us:[frac{1}{2}lr = 8]From the second equation, we can express lr in terms of 8:[lr = 16]Now, we need to solve these equations to find the values of r and l. We can substitute lr = 16 into the equation l + 2r = 12 to find the values of r and l.By rearranging the equation lr = 16 and substituting into l + 2r = 12, we have two possible scenarios for r and l:- If r = 2, then l = 8 because lr = 16.- If r = 4, then l = 4 because lr = 16.To find the measure of the central angle alpha in radians, we use the formula alpha = frac{l}{r}. Substituting the values of l and r from our solutions:- When r = 2 and l = 8, alpha = frac{8}{2} = 4.- When r = 4 and l = 4, alpha = frac{4}{4} = 1.Therefore, the measure of the central angle of the sector in radians can be either 1 or 4.

Let k be the slope of PA, hence the equation of PA is y - 4 = k(x - 2) with k neq 0.Substituting PA into the equation of the parabola, we have:begin{cases}y^2 = 8x y - 4 = k(x - 2)end{cases}Longrightarrow y^2 - frac{8}{k}y + frac{32}{k} - 16 = 0,The solutions of this equation are 4 and y_1.By Vieta's formulas, y_1 + 4 = frac{8}{k}, which gives y_1 = frac{8}{k} - 4. By the same logic, y_2 = -frac{8}{k} - 4.Also, since y_1^2 = 8x_1 and y_2^2 = 8x_2,the slope of line AB isk_{AB} = frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = frac{8}{y_1 + y_2} = -1.Let the equation of AB be y = -x + b. We substitute AB into the parabola's equation:begin{cases}y^2 = 8x y = -x + bend{cases}Longrightarrow y^2 + y + 8b = 0.By Vieta's formulas, we obtain y_1 + y_2 = -8 and y_1 y_2 = 8b.The length of AB is |AB| = sqrt{2}|y_1 - y_2| = 8sqrt{b + 2}.The distance (d) from point P to line AB is d = frac{|6 - b|}{sqrt{2}}.Therefore, the area of triangle PAB isS_{triangle PAB} = frac{1}{2} cdot |AB| cdot d = 2sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{(b + 2)(6 - b)^2}.Let t = b + 2.

Therefore, the roots of the equation are:   [   f(x) = 0, quad f(x) = 1, quad f(x) = -1   ]   Since the problem states that there are three real roots, one of these factors must have a double root. This means that one of the roots must be repeated.3. To determine which root is repeated, we need to consider the nature of the polynomial (f(x)). Since (f(x)) is a trinomial (a polynomial of degree 2), it can be written in the form:   [   f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c   ]4. For (f(x)) to have three real roots (considering multiplicity), one of the roots must be a double root. Let's assume (f(x) = 0) has a double root. This means the polynomial can be written as:   [   f(x) = a(x - r)^2   ]   where (r) is the root with multiplicity 2.5. Since (f(x) = 0) has a double root, the other roots (f(x) = 1) and (f(x) = -1) must be single roots.

Ali-baba came to a cave where there was gold and diamonds. Ali-baba had one large bag with him. It is known that a full bag of gold weighs 200 kg, and if the entire bag is filled with diamonds, it will weigh 40 kg (the empty bag weighs nothing). A kilogram of gold costs 20 dinars, and a kilogram of diamonds costs 60 dinars. What is the maximum amount of money Ali-baba can get if he can carry no more than 100 kg in this bag? Justify your answer.","solution":"# Solution:Method 1. Let Ali-Baba have placed a set of gold and diamonds that gives him the maximum possible revenue - we will call such a bag optimal. Then either the bag is filled to the brim, or it weighs exactly 100 kg: otherwise, more diamonds could be added to it and the revenue would increase. Consider the first situation, when the bag is full. It is clear that it contains diamonds, since the full weight of a bag of gold is more than 100 kg. Note that a bag filled with only gold is worth 200 cdot 20=40000 dinars, and one with only diamonds is -40 cdot 60=24000 dinars, so an equal volume of gold yields more profit than the same volume of diamonds. If the weight of the optimal bag is less than 100 kg, we can replace some of the diamonds with an equal volume of gold (so that the weight of the bag increases but does not exceed 100 kg). In this case, the value of the bag will increase - a contradiction to the optimality of the bag. Therefore, the weight of the optimal bag is exactly 100 kg. Suppose the optimal bag is not full. Then it contains gold, and Ali-Baba can replace part of it with diamonds of the same weight (while ensuring that the volume of the bag does not become too large). Since a kilogram of diamonds is more expensive than a kilogram of gold, Ali-Baba's profit will increase - again a contradiction to the optimality.Thus, the bag is full. Let there be x kg of diamonds in the bag. Then there is 100-x kg of gold in it. The diamonds occupy x / 40 of the bag, and the gold - (100-x) / 200. Since the bag is full, we have the equation frac{x}{40}+frac{100-x}{200}=1, from which x=25. The value of the optimal bag is now trivial to find. It turns out to be 3000 dinars.Method 2. Let Ali-Baba put x kg of gold and y kg of diamonds in the bag. Then he will earn 20 x+60 y dinars. Ali-Baba has two constraints: first, he cannot carry more than 100 kg, so x+y leqslant 100. Second, such an amount of gold and diamonds must fit in the bag. Since one kilogram of gold occupies 1 / 200 of the bag, and one kilogram of diamonds -1 / 40, another inequality arises: frac{x}{200}+frac{y}{40} leqslant 1, or x+5 y leqslant 200. In addition, it is clear that the variables x and y are non-negative. We have the problem: find the maximum value of the expression 20 x+60 y on the set of all pairs of non-negative numbers (x ; y) that satisfy the system of inequalities left{begin{aligned} x+y & leqslant 100  x+5 y & leqslant 200end{aligned}right..

If the curve C is symmetric about the y-axis, then a center of symmetry of the curve C is ______.","solution":"To solve for the center of symmetry of the curve C, we follow these steps:1. Identify the Transformation:   When the graph of f(x) = sin(omega x + frac{pi}{3}) is shifted to the left by frac{pi}{2} units, the new function for curve C can be expressed as y = sin[omega (x + frac{pi}{2}) + frac{pi}{3}].   2. Simplify the Expression:   This simplifies to y = sin(omega x + frac{piomega}{2} + frac{pi}{3}).3. Condition for Symmetry:   For curve C to be symmetric about the y-axis, its function must be an even function. This implies that the phase shift frac{piomega}{2} + frac{pi}{3} must equal kpi + frac{pi}{2}, where k is an integer because the sine function has symmetry around multiples of pi plus frac{pi}{2}.   4. Solve for omega:   Setting the phase shift equal to kpi + frac{pi}{2}, we get:   [   frac{piomega}{2} + frac{pi}{3} = kpi + frac{pi}{2}   ]   Solving for omega gives us:   [   omega = 2k + frac{1}{3}   ]   Since 0 < omega < 1, we find that omega = frac{1}{3}.   5. Equation for Curve C:   Substituting omega = frac{1}{3} into the equation of curve C, we obtain:   [   y = sin(frac{x}{3} + frac{pi}{2}) = cos(frac{x}{3})   ]   This shows the curve C in terms of a cosine function, which is even and symmetric about the y-axis.   6. Find Center of Symmetry:   For the curve to be symmetric, frac{x}{3} can be set as kpi + frac{pi}{2} (using the cosine function's symmetry points), where kinmathbb{Z}. This gives us:   [   x = 3kpi + frac{3pi}{2}   ]   Thus, a center of symmetry of the curve C is at (3kpi + frac{3pi}{2}, 0), where kinmathbb{Z}.

Analyzing the equations:    - The equation (x + y = 20.19) is a linear equation representing a line in the (xy)-plane.   - The equation (tan x + tan y = 20.19) is more complex due to the periodic nature of the tangent function.3. Behavior of the tangent function:    - The tangent function, (tan x), has a period of (pi) and vertical asymptotes at (x = frac{pi}{2} + kpi) for any integer (k).   - For large values of (tan x) and (tan y), the sum (tan x + tan y) can be approximated by considering the periodicity and the behavior near the asymptotes.4. Approximating the graph:    - Given that (20.19) is a relatively large number, we can approximate the graph of (tan x + tan y = 20.19) as a grid of squares with side length (pi).   - This approximation simplifies the problem to counting intersections of the line (x + y = 20.19) with this grid.5. Range of (x):   - The minimum value (x) can take is (-100pi + 20.19) (with (y = 100pi)).   - The maximum value (x) can take is (100pi).   - Therefore, (x) has a range of:     [     200pi - 20.19.     ]6.

Understanding the problem:   - There are 800 marbles in total, with 100 different colors, and 8 marbles of each color.   - Anna draws marbles one by one without replacement until she gets 8 marbles of the same color.   - We need to find the probability that she stops immediately after drawing the 700th marble, given that she has not stopped after drawing 699 marbles.2. Analyzing the situation after 699 draws:   - After 699 draws, Anna has not yet drawn 8 marbles of any color.   - This means that for each of the 100 colors, she has drawn at most 7 marbles.   - Therefore, she has drawn exactly 7 marbles of some colors and fewer than 7 marbles of the remaining colors.3. Remaining marbles:   - There are (800 - 699 = 101) marbles left in the bag.   - Since she has drawn at most 7 marbles of each color, there are at least 1 marble of each color left in the bag.   - Specifically, there are 1 marble left for each of the 99 colors from which she has drawn 7 marbles, and 2 marbles left for each of the remaining colors.4. Probability calculation:   - To stop immediately after drawing the 700th marble, Anna must draw the 8th marble of some color.   - There are 99 colors for which she has already drawn 7 marbles, so there are 99 marbles in the bag that would cause her to stop.   - The total number of marbles left is 101.5.

Coloring the lattice points:   Color a lattice point ((x,y,z)) red if there exists a student who got (x), (y), and (z) as their scores for the first, second, and third problems, respectively.

Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:   Consider all lattice points ((x,y,k)) such that (x, y in [0,7]) and (k) is a constant. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there can be at most 8 red lattice points in any such set, because if there were more than 8, there would be at least two points with the same (x) and (y) values but different (k) values, which would violate the problem's condition.4.

Similarly, considering the rows, it follows that in the entire table there are no fewer X's than O's. Therefore, there are an equal number of X's and O's in the entire table, and also there are an equal number of them in each row and each column.From the condition, it also follows that in each column there cannot be 0 or 1 O's, so there are no fewer than 2.

Establishing the congruence relationship:   - Given ( a_1 = 1989^{1989} ), we need to find ( a_5 ).   - Note that ( a_n ) is the sum of the digits of ( a_{n-1} ) for ( n > 1 ).   - By properties of digit sums, ( a_{n-1} equiv a_n pmod{9} ). Therefore, ( a_1 equiv a_2 equiv a_3 equiv a_4 equiv a_5 pmod{9} ).2. Calculating ( a_1 mod 9 ):   - ( 1989 equiv 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 27 equiv 0 pmod{9} ).   - Thus, ( 1989^{1989} equiv 0^{1989} equiv 0 pmod{9} ).   - Therefore, ( a_1 equiv 0 pmod{9} ).3. Bounding the values of ( a_n ):   - ( 1989^{1989} < 10000^{1989} ).   - ( log_{10}(10000^{1989}) = 4 times 1989 = 7956 ).   - Hence, ( 10000^{1989} ) has 7957 digits, so ( 1989^{1989} ) has at most 7957 digits.4. Calculating the maximum possible values for ( a_2, a_3, a_4 ):   - If ( a_1 ) has 7957 digits, the maximum sum of its digits (i.e., ( a_2 )) is ( 9 times 7957 = 71613 ).   - The maximum sum of the digits of ( a_2 ) (i.e., ( a_3 )) is when ( a_2 = 69999 ), so ( a_3 leq 6 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 42 ).   - The maximum sum of the digits of ( a_3 ) (i.e., ( a_4 )) is when ( a_3 = 39 ), so ( a_4 leq 3 + 9 = 12 ).5. Determining ( a_5 ):   - The maximum sum of the digits of ( a_4 ) (i.e., ( a_5 )) is when ( a_4 = 12 ), so ( a_5 leq 1 + 2 = 3 ).   - Since ( a_5 equiv 0 pmod{9} ) and ( a_5 ) must be a single-digit number, the only possible value is ( 9 ).Conclusion:[a_5 = boxed{9}]"},{"problem":"Given the sequence {a_n} that satisfies a_{n+1}=a_{n}+2n and a_{1}=2, find the general term formula a_{n}= ______.","solution":"Since a_{n+1}=a_{n}+2n and a_{1}=2,begin{align}a_{n}&=(a_{n}-a_{n-1})+(a_{n-1}-a_{n-2})+cdots+(a_{2}-a_{1})+a_{1} &=2(n-1)+2(n-2)+cdots+2+2 &=2times frac{(n-1)n}{2}+2 &=n^{2}-n+2, quad (text{which holds true when } n=1)end{align}Thus, the answer is: boxed{a_{n}=n^{2}-n+2}.This problem can be solved using the \\"summation by parts\\" method and the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Each time a group is divided into two, the product of the number of coins in the two resulting groups is recorded. What can the sum of all recorded numbers be?","solution":"Answer: 300.Solution. First method. Let's represent the coins as points and connect each pair of points with a segment. We will get frac{25(25-1)}{2} =300 segments. With each division of one group of coins into two, we will erase all segments connecting points corresponding to coins that end up in different groups. Suppose at some step we divide the coins of one of the already existing groups into two groups of x and y coins. Then we erase x y segments. This is the number we record. Thus, the sum of the recorded numbers is the total number of erased segments. Since there were initially 300 segments, and in the end, all segments are erased, the total number of erased segments is 300.Second method. Consider the variable quantity S, equal at each moment to half the sum of the squares of the number of coins in the piles. Initially, S=frac{25^{2}}{2}=312.5, and at the very end, S=frac{1^{2}+1^{2}+ldots .+1^{2}}{2}=frac{25}{2}=12.5. If a pile with x+y coins is divided into two piles of x and y coins, then S decreases by frac{(x+y)^{2}}{2}- -frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{2}=x y. Thus, with each division, the quantity S decreases by the next recorded number. Therefore, the sum of all recorded numbers is equal to the total decrease in the quantity S, which is 312.5 -12.5=300.Third method. We will prove by induction that if there are initially n coins, then the desired sum is frac{n(n-1)}{2}.Base of induction. For n=2, after the first step, we get two piles with one coin each and record the number 1 cdot 1=1. Since the equality frac{2(2-1)}{2}=1 is true, the statement is true for n=2.Induction step. Assume the statement is true for all n<k and prove that it is also true for n=k. Suppose on the first step k coins are divided into two groups of x and y coins ( k=x+y ). For x and y coins, the statement is true by the induction hypothesis.If in such a division x geqslant 2 and y geqslant 2, then the recorded sum isx y+frac{x(x-1)}{2}+frac{y(y-1)}{2}=frac{x^{2}-x+y^{2}-y+2 x y}{2}=frac{(x+y)^{2}-(x+y)}{2}=frac{k^{2}-k}{2}=frac{k(k-1)}{2}If, however, x=1 and y geqslant 2, then k=y+1 and the recorded sum in this case is 1 cdot y+frac{y(y-1)}{2}=frac{(y+1)^{2}-(y+1)}{2}= =frac{k(k-1)}{2}. According to the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is proven for any natural n geqslant 2. In particular, for 25 coins, we get: frac{25(25-1)}{2}=300.## Grading criteria:+ a complete and well-reasoned solution is providedpm the correct answer and a generally correct solution with minor inaccuracies or gaps is provided- only the answer is provided"},{"problem":"6.2.

The diagonals of this trapezoid turn out to be two chords of two 2d-degree arcs. Let AB, AC, and BD be the chords of the d-degree arcs, and let CD be the chord of the 3d-degree arc. Also let x be equal to the chord length of the 3d-degree arc. Hence, the length of the chords, AD and BC, of the 2d-degree arcs can be represented as x + 20, as given in the problem.

You start with a difficult question.How many different final scores are possible after 10 questions?","solution":"B4. 27 To simplify the problem, we look at a variant of the quiz. We give one extra point for each question: 6 points for a correct answer to a difficult question, 4 points for a correct answer to an easy question, and 0 points for an incorrect answer. Everyone thus gets exactly 10 extra points, so the number of possible final scores does not change. We now see that all scores are divisible by 2, and we divide by 2 to make the problem even simpler. A participant now gets 3, 2, or 0 points for each question. This also does not change the number of possible final scores.The final score is a maximum of 30 points (if all questions are answered correctly) and a minimum of 0 points (if all questions are answered incorrectly). We will now show that the final scores 1, 25, 28, and 29 are not possible, and that all other scores from 0 to 30 are possible.The final scores 0,3,6, ldots, 30 can be achieved by first answering 0,1,2,3, ldots, 10 questions correctly and then answering all questions incorrectly.The final scores 2,5,8, ldots, 26 can be achieved by first answering 9,8,7,6, ldots, 1 questions incorrectly, then answering an easy question correctly, and subsequently answering all difficult questions correctly.The final scores 4,7,10, ldots, 22 can be achieved by first answering 7,6,5, ldots, 1 questions incorrectly, then answering an easy question correctly, a difficult question incorrectly, another easy question correctly, and all difficult questions correctly thereafter.If at least one question is answered correctly, you already have at least 2 points. For this reason, the final score of 1 is not possible. If at least one question is answered incorrectly, you have at most 9 cdot 3=27 points. For this reason, the final scores of 28 and 29 are not possible. If exactly one question is answered incorrectly, two things can happen: the incorrectly answered question is the last question and you have 9 cdot 3=27 points, or the incorrectly answered question is not the last question and you have 8 cdot 3+2=26 points. If at least two questions are answered incorrectly, you have at most 8 cdot 3=24 points. For this reason, the final score of 25 is also not possible.We see that the possible final scores (in the new quiz format) are the numbers from 0 to 30, with the exception of 1, 25, 28, and 29. (In the original quiz format, the possible final scores are the even numbers from -10 to 50, with the exception of -8,40,46, and 48.) There are thus 27 possible final scores."},{"problem":"Example 13 The solution to the equation frac{1}{x^{2}+x}+frac{1}{x^{2}+3 x+2}+ frac{1}{x^{2}+5 x+6}+frac{1}{x^{2}+7 x+12}=frac{4}{21} is qquad -(Tenth Zu Chongzhi Cup Junior High School Mathematics Competition)","solution":"Solution: After transformation, each fraction in the original equation is in the form of frac{1}{n(n+1)}.

Let's complete the square: a^2 - 10a = -17  a^2 - 10a + 25 = -17 + 25  (a - 5)^2 = 8  a - 5 = pm sqrt{8}  a = 5 pm 2sqrt{2} So, we have two possible locations for the circle centers: (5 + 2sqrt{2}, 5 + 2sqrt{2}) and (5 - 2sqrt{2}, 5 - 2sqrt{2}).To find the distance |C1C2| between the two centers, we apply the distance formula again: |C_1C_2| = sqrt{[(5 + 2sqrt{2}) - (5 - 2sqrt{2})]^2 + [(5 + 2sqrt{2}) - (5 - 2sqrt{2})]^2}  |C_1C_2| = sqrt{[4sqrt{2}]^2 + [4sqrt{2}]^2}  |C_1C_2| = sqrt{32 + 32}  |C_1C_2| = sqrt{64}  |C_1C_2| = boxed{8} "},{"problem":"78.

Since frac{1}{2}left(3^{6}+1right)=3651000, the smallest value of n is 7.(2) The convex hull of K_{n} is a hexagon. Taking any two points in K_{0} and performing n symmetric reflections as in (1), we can obtain these six vertices.To prove that all points of K_{n} are within the convex hull H_{n} formed by the six \\"support points,\\" we can view H_{n} as the intersection of three strips, each defined by a pair of opposite sides of the hexagon (n=1,2, cdots). Clearly, the initial equilateral triangle is the intersection of three strips, each of which has a side of the triangle and a parallel line through the opposite vertex. After each symmetric reflection, the three strips remain as three strips, with the center line unchanged but the width increasing by a factor of 3. Thus, the intersection of the three strips, i.e., K_{n}, remains a hexagon.The area of H_{n} can be calculated using the areas of triangles that are similar to triangle ABC in the same direction and in the opposite direction, and it equals frac{1}{2}left(3^{2 n+1}-1right).(3) In addition to the points of K_{0}, K_{1} also includes 12 points that are images of symmetric reflections. It can be seen that these 12 points are the support points of the convex hull of K_{1}. We construct a cube L_{0} such that the four vertices of the given tetrahedron ABCD are exactly one set of four non-adjacent vertices of the cube. By performing a homothety with a coefficient of 3 about the center of L_{0}, we obtain the cube L_{1} and its corresponding non-adjacent vertices A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}, D_{1}. At this point, the 12 support points of the convex hull of K_{1} are precisely on the 12 edges of the cube L_{1}, and each point divides its edge in the ratio 1:2, with the shorter segment having one of A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}, D_{1} as an endpoint (see the figure above). If a plane is used to cut off a cone from each vertex of L_{1}, the remaining polyhedron M_{1} is the convex hull of K_{1}, where the planes pass through one support point on each of the three edges emanating from the vertex. In this way, it is easy to see that M_{1} has 14 faces, of which 6 are a times 2a rectangles (where a is the edge length of the tetrahedron ABCD), and 8 are equilateral triangles, 4 with side length a and the other 4 with side length 2a.(4) The volume of M_{1} can be calculated by subtracting the volumes of the 8 truncated cones left(4 times frac{1}{2}+4 times 4=18right) from the volume of the cube L_{1} (which is 81), so the volume of M_{1} is 63.(5) The convex hull M_{n} of the set K_{n} is similar to M_{1}, also being a convex polyhedron with 12 support points as vertices, which are obtained by performing n symmetric reflections on the vertices of the tetrahedron ABCD. The vertices of M_{n} are on the edges of the cube L_{n}, dividing each edge in the ratio left(3^{n}-1right):left(3^{n}+1right), where L_{n} is the cube obtained by performing a homothety with a coefficient of 3^{n} about the center of L_{0}.

Let's first try to deduce some estimate of the value of the number n that could satisfy the given equation. On its left side, we have the sum of two natural numbers n and s(n), and therefore both must be less than 2019. More precisely, the value of the sought number n=2019-s(n) will be at most 2018, since s(n) is a natural number. Then we know that the digit sum of the number n leqq 2018 is at most 1+9+9+9=28, and therefore the number n itself must be somewhere between 2018 and 2019-28=1991.Now it is enough to test for which values of n in{2018,2017, ldots, 1991} the equality n+s(n)=2019 holds:| n | s(n) | n+s(n) || :---: | :---: | :---: || 2018 | 11 | 2029 || 2017 | 10 | 2027 || 2016 | 9 | 2025 || 2015 | 8 | 2023 || 2014 | 7 | 2021 || mathbf{2 0 1 3} | mathbf{6} | mathbf{2 0 1 9} || 2012 | 5 | 2017 || 2011 | 4 | 2015 || 2010 | 3 | 2013 || n | s(n) | n+s(n) || :---: | :---: | :---: || 2009 | 11 | 2020 || 2008 | 10 | 2018 || 2007 | 9 | 2016 || 2006 | 8 | 2014 || 2005 | 7 | 2012 || 2004 | 6 | 2010 || 2003 | 5 | 2008 || 2002 | 4 | 2006 || 2001 | 3 | 2004 || 2000 | 2 | 2002 || n | s(n) | n+s(n) || :---: | :---: | :---: || 1999 | 28 | 2027 || 1998 | 27 | 2025 || 1997 | 26 | 2023 || 1996 | 25 | 2021 || mathbf{1 9 9 5} | mathbf{2 4} | mathbf{2 0 1 9} || 1994 | 23 | 2017 || 1993 | 22 | 2015 || 1992 | 21 | 2013 || 1991 | 20 | 2011 |Analyzing all 28 possibilities from 1991 to 2018 (or in a similar interval) can be shortened in various ways.One way is, for example, the observation that if we decrease the number n by one unit and do not cross a ten, the value of the sum n+s(n) decreases by 2 (for example, for n=2005 we get n+s(n)=2012, for n=2004 we get 2010, etc.). Therefore, the sum under consideration has the prescribed value 2019 for at most one n in each ten of natural numbers that differ only in the units place, and we can even determine them from the value of the sum for a single number of this ten, for example, for the one that ends in the digit 9. According to the previous estimates, we will need the values of n+s(n) only for n equal to 2019, 2009, and 1999.For n=2019 we get n+s(n)=2031=2019+2 cdot 6, and therefore among the numbers from 2010 to 2019, only the number 2019-6=2013 satisfies, which is indeed one of the solutions to the given problem (the check is not necessary due to the observed decrease in the sum by the value of 2).For n=2009 we get n+s(n)=2020, which is even, unlike 2019, and so we would look for a solution among the numbers from 2000 to 2009 in vain.Finally, for n=1999 we get n+s(n)=2027=2019+2 cdot 4, and therefore only the number 1999-4=1995 satisfies, which is the second solution.Another way to reduce the number of cases to be analyzed is to realize that the number n gives the same remainder as its digit sum s(n) when divided by three. If we denote this remainder as d, the number n+s(n)=2019 will give the remainder d+d=2d when divided by three. The digit sum of the number 2019 is 12, so the number 2019 is divisible by three, and therefore the remainder of the number 2d when divided by three is zero, and thus d=0. In other words, the sought number n isdivisible by three. In this case, we would need to check only 9 numbers between 1991 and 2018 that are divisible by three, i.e., 9 possibilities n in{2016,2013, ldots, 1992}.The previous method of reducing the number of possibilities (using the remainder when divided by three) can be further improved if we realize that we can also use divisibility by nine. It holds that the number n and its digit sum s(n) give the same remainder when divided by nine. Let's denote this remainder as r. The number 2019 gives the remainder 3 when divided by nine (i.e., the remainder when dividing the number 2+0+1+9=12 by nine). From the equation 2019=n+s(n), it follows similarly as in the previous paragraph that n gives the remainder 6 when divided by nine, because its double must give the remainder 3. The numbers from 1991 to 2018 that give the remainder 3 when divided by nine are only three, namely n in{2013,2004,1995}.Answer.

He asked an expert to identify this coin using a balance scale without weights, and required that each coin participate in weighings no more than twice. What is the maximum number of coins the banker can have so that the expert can definitely identify the counterfeit one in n weighings?","solution":"Let's first solve a simpler problem. Suppose the banker allows placing coins on the scales no more than once. From what largest number of coins can a lighter one be identified in k weighings?If at some weighing there are more than one coin on the scale, it will not be possible to identify the fake coin (you cannot weigh a coin a second time!). Therefore, at each weighing, only one coin is placed on each pan.If the scales are not in balance, the fake coin is obvious. If they are in balance, the number of suspicious coins decreases by 2. Therefore, with k weighings, one can identify the fake coin from 2k + 1 coins.Returning to the original problem, let's denote the answer as f(n). Suppose that in the first weighing, there are s coins on each pan. If the scales are not in balance, it will be necessary to find the fake coin among s coins, and only n-1 weighings remain. According to the proven result, s leq 2(n-1) + 1 = 2n - 1.If the scales are in balance, we get the original problem for the coins that did not go on the scales (there are f(n) - 2s of them) and n-1 weighings, sof(n) - 2s leq f(n-1)Therefore,f(n) leq f(n-1) + 2s leq f(n-1) + 2(2n - 1)Thus,f(n) leq 2(2n - 1) + 2(2n - 3) + ldots + 2 cdot 3 + f(1)Since it is easy to check that f(1) = 3, we have f(n) leq 2n^2 + 1 by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression.On the other hand, if there are 2n^2 + 1 coins and each time s is taken to be maximal, i.e., s = 2n - 1 on the first step, s = 2n - 3 on the second, and so on, the expert will be able to identify the fake coin.

GCD and LCM of Polynomials]  [Complex Numbers Help Solve the Problem.]Author: Evokkimov M.On the board, three functions are written: f_{1}(x) = x + 1/x, f_{2}(x) = x^2, f_{3}(x) = (x-1)^2. You can add, subtract, and multiply these functions (including squaring, cubing, ...), multiply them by any number, add any number to them, and perform these operations on the resulting expressions. Obtain the function 1/x:Prove that if any of the functions f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3} is erased from the board, it is impossible to obtain 1/x.## SolutionSince f_{2}(x) - f_{3}(x) = 2x - 1, and since we can add 1 and multiply the resulting expression 2x by 1/2, we can obtain the function x. Subtracting it from f_{1}(x), we get 1/x = f_{1}(x) - 1/2(f_{2}(x) - f_{3}(x) + 1).Since the division operation is not allowed, it is impossible to express 1/x using only the functions f_{2} and f_{3}: if you multiply and add polynomials, you will get polynomials again, and the function 1/x is not a polynomial. The derivatives of the functions f_{1} and f_{3} at the point x=1 are 0. If the derivatives of two functions at the point 1 are 0, then the derivative of both their sum and their product is 0. So all functions that can be obtained from f_{1} and f_{3} using the specified operations have a zero derivative at the point 1. The derivative of the function 1/x at the point 1 is not 0.All our functions are defined for all complex x neq 0. If we substitute x=i into f_{1} and f_{2}, we get i + i^{-1} = 0, i^2 = -1 - real numbers. This means that each of the functions obtained from f_{1} and f_{2} will have a real value at the point i. And it is impossible to express the imaginary number f_{3}(i) = -2i using only real numbers."},{"problem":"4.

Let D be the foot of the altitude from point A, and point E be the intersection of this altitude with the circumcircle of triangle ABC, point A' be diametrically opposite to point A on this circle, and point N be the second intersection of line AK with this circle. From the parallelism of lines OH and BC, it follows that line OH is perpendicular to the altitude AD. Since AA' is the diameter of the circle, angle AEA' = 90^circ and, therefore, lines A'E and OH are parallel. Thus, OH is the midline of triangle AA'E, so AH = HE. Further,angle CBE = angle CAE = 90^circ - angle ACB = angle CBH,so in triangle BEH, segment BD is both a bisector and an altitude, and therefore also a median. Thus, HD = DE. From the equalities AH = HE and HD = DE, we get that AH: AD = 2: 3.By the condition, lines AK and BH are parallel, and line BH is perpendicular to line AC, so angle NAC = 90^circ and points C and N are diametrically opposite. Therefore, angle NBC = 90^circ and lines NB and AH are parallel. Thus, quadrilateral AHBN is a parallelogram. Therefore, AN = BH = AK and segment CA is a median in triangle KCN. But segment KO is also a median in this triangle. Therefore, L is the intersection of the medians of this triangle and AL: AC = 1: 3. Then, by Thales' theorem, AM: AD = 1: 3.

Triangles ALK and B'LO are similar by two angles (angle ALK = angle B'LO as vertical angles, angle OB'L = 90^circ = angle KAL) and their similarity coefficient is 2. Let LB' = x, then AL = 2x and CB' = AB' = 3x, since B' is the midpoint of side AC. Therefore, AL: AC = 2x: 6x = 1: 3 and AM: AD = 1: 3, since triangles ALM and ACD are similar.

Therefore, AH = 2OA' and BH = 2OB'.Let D be the foot of the altitude from point A, M be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from point L to AH, and P be the midpoint of segment AK. Line OA' is the perpendicular bisector of segment BC, so it is parallel to the altitude AD. By the condition, lines OH and BC are parallel, so OHDA' is a rectangle and HD = OA' = frac{1}{2}AH. Thus, frac{AH}{AD} = frac{2}{3}. By the condition, lines AK and BH are parallel, and line BH is perpendicular to line AC, so angle KAC = 90^circ. By the condition, ABHK is a parallelogram, so AK = BH. Segment B'P is the midline of triangle CAK, so B'P = frac{1}{2}AK = frac{1}{2}BH = OB'. Moreover, OB' and PB' are perpendicular to AC, so points O, B', and P lie on the same line. Thus, OP = 2OB' = AK and OP is parallel to AK. Therefore, AOPK is a parallelogram. Let Q be the intersection of its diagonals, then AQ = QP. Therefore, AB' and OQ are medians of triangle AOP, and L is their intersection, so AL: AB' = 2: 3 and, therefore, AL: AC = 1: 3.

Identify the Graph as a Tree:   Since every two vertices in the graph are connected by a unique path, the graph ( G ) must be a tree. This is because a tree is a connected acyclic graph, and the unique path property implies no cycles.2. Sum of Pairwise Distances ( W ):   For every edge ( e ) in the tree, if we delete ( e ), the tree will be divided into two separate trees ( A_e ) and ( B_e ).

Since each triangle is rotated ( 75^circ ) clockwise from the previous one, the angle between ( A_1 ) and ( A_6 ) at the center ( O ) is:   [   75^circ times 5 = 375^circ   ]   However, since a full circle is ( 360^circ ), we subtract ( 360^circ ) to find the actual angle:   [   375^circ - 360^circ = 15^circ   ]   Therefore, ( angle A_1 O A_6 = 15^circ ).3. Each triangle is isosceles with the two equal sides being the radii of the circle.

The other 9 moves are all equally likely to end the game. Examining these, we see that Zuca will win in exactly 2 cases (when Bamal and Halvan collide and Zuca goes to a neighboring vertex). Combining all of this, the answer isdfrac{3}{10}+dfrac{2}{9} cdot dfrac{1}{10}=boxed{dfrac{29}{90}}[/hide]","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Parity Argument:   - Consider the vertices of the hexagon ABCDEF colored alternately in black and white.   - Since the players start at random distinct vertices, there are two possible scenarios:     - All three players start on vertices of the same color (same parity).     - One player starts on a vertex of a different color (different parity) than the other two.2. Probability of Different Parity:   - The probability that Zuca starts on a vertex of different parity from Bamal and Halvan is frac{3}{10}.   - The probability that all three players start on vertices of the same parity is frac{1}{10}.3. Game Dynamics:   - If Zuca is on a different parity vertex, he will always remain on a different parity vertex because he can only move to adjacent vertices or the opposite vertex, which are all of the same parity.   - Bamal and Halvan, moving to adjacent vertices, will also remain on vertices of the same parity.4. Collision Analysis:   - If Zuca is on a different parity vertex, he will never collide with Bamal or Halvan, so he wins with probability frac{3}{10}.   - If all three players are on the same parity, we need to analyze the possible moves:     - There are 2 cdot 2 cdot 3 = 12 possible moves (2 for Bamal, 2 for Halvan, and 3 for Zuca).     - Out of these 12 moves, 3 will lead to the same arrangement, so we disregard those, leaving 9 possible moves.     - Among these 9 moves, Zuca wins in exactly 2 cases (when Bamal and Halvan collide and Zuca moves to a neighboring vertex).5. Combining Probabilities:   - The probability that Zuca wins when all three players are on the same parity is frac{2}{9}.   - Combining the probabilities:     [     text{Total probability that Zuca wins} = frac{3}{10} + left(frac{2}{9} cdot frac{1}{10}right) = frac{3}{10} + frac{2}{90} = frac{27}{90} + frac{2}{90} = frac{29}{90}     ]The final answer is boxed{frac{29}{90}}"},{"problem":"152.

Therefore, option A does not meet the criteria for being an irrational number.- Option B: frac{2}{7}frac{2}{7} is already in fraction form, representing a ratio of two integers (2 and 7). This makes it a rational number. Hence, option B is also not an irrational number.- Option C: sqrt{0.04}sqrt{0.04} = sqrt{frac{4}{100}} = frac{2}{10} = 0.2. This shows that sqrt{0.04} simplifies to 0.2, which can be expressed as frac{2}{10}, and further simplified to frac{1}{5}. Being representable as a fraction means it is a rational number. Thus, option C does not qualify as an irrational number.- Option D: pi - 3.14pi is known to be an irrational number because it is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal.

Let M_{1}={0,1, ldots, p-1} and M_{2}={p, p+1, ldots, 2 p-1}. We shall denote by |A| and sigma(A) the number of elements and the sum of elements of the set A; also, let C_{p} be the family of all p-element subsets of M. Define the mapping T: C_{p} rightarrow C_{p} as T(A)=left{x+1 mid x in A cap M_{1}right} cupleft{A cap M_{2}right}, the addition being modulo p. There are exactly two fixed points of T : these are M_{1} and M_{2}. Now if A is any subset from C_{p} distinct from M_{1}, M_{2}, and k=left|A cap M_{1}right| with 1 leq k leq p-1, then for i=0,1, ldots, p-1, sigmaleft(T^{i}(A)right)=sigma(A)+i k(bmod p). Hence subsets A, T(A), ldots, T^{p-1}(A) are distinct, and exactly one of them has sum of elements divisible by p.

Second solution. Let C_{k} be the family of all k-element subsets of {1,2, ldots, 2 p}. Denote by M_{k}(k=1,2, ldots, p) the family of p-element multisets with k distinct elements from {1,2, ldots, 2 p}, exactly one of which appears more than once, that have sum of elements divisible by p. It is clear that every subset from C_{k}, k<p, can be complemented to a multiset from M_{k} cup M_{k+1} in exactly two ways, since the equation (p-k) a equiv 0(bmod p) has exactly two solutions in {1,2, ldots, 2 p}. On the other hand, every multiset from M_{k} can be obtained by completing exactly one subset from C_{k}. Additionally, a multiset from M_{k} can be obtained from exactly one subset from C_{k-1} if k<p, and from exactly p subsets from C_{k-1} if k=p. Therefore left|M_{k}right|+left|M_{k+1}right|=2left|C_{k}right|=2binom{2 p}{k} for k=1,2, ldots, p-2, and left|M_{p-1}right|+pleft|M_{p}right|=2left|C_{p-1}right|=2binom{2 p}{p-1}. Since M_{1}=2 p, it is not difficult to show using recursion that left|M_{p}right|=frac{1}{p}left(binom{2 p}{p}-2right)+2.  Third solution. Let omega=cos frac{2 pi}{p}+i sin frac{2 pi}{p}. We have prod_{i=1}^{2 p}left(x-omega^{i}right)= left(x^{p}-1right)^{2}=x^{2 p}-2 x^{p}+1; hence comparing the coefficients at x^{p}, we obtain sum omega^{i_{1}+cdots+i_{p}}=sum_{i=0}^{p-1} a_{i} omega^{i}=2, where the first sum runs over all p-subsets left{i_{1}, ldots, i_{p}right} of {1, ldots, 2 p}, and a_{i} is the number of such subsets for which i_{1}+cdots+i_{p} equiv i(bmod p). Setting q(x)=-2+sum_{i=0}^{p-1} a_{i} x^{i}, we obtain qleft(omega^{j}right)=0 for j=1,2, ldots, p-1. Hence 1+x+cdots+x^{p-1} mid q(x), and since deg q=p-1, we have q(x)=-2+sum_{i=0}^{p-1} a_{i} x^{i}=cleft(1+x+cdots+x^{p-1}right) for some constant c.

A function of the form sin(ax + b) does not necessarily inherit all properties of sin(x), especially when it comes to symmetry about the origin. For the function to be odd, it must satisfy f(-x) = -f(x).

This concentration implies that the probability of the physical quantity falling within a narrow range around the mean (e.g., (9.9, 10.1)) increases. This is a fundamental property of the normal distribution, where a smaller standard deviation means the data points are closer to the mean. Therefore, option A is correct.Option B: In a normal distribution, the mean divides the distribution into two equal halves. Since the distribution is symmetric about the mean, the probability of a measurement being greater than the mean (10 in this case) is equal to the probability of it being less than the mean, which is 0.5. Thus, option B is correct.Option C: Given the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean (10), the probability of the physical quantity being less than a value on one side of the mean (e.g., 9.99) is equal to the probability of it being greater than a corresponding value on the other side of the mean (e.g., 10.01). This property stems from the symmetric nature of the normal distribution. Hence, option C is correct.Option D: This option compares the probabilities of the physical quantity falling within two different ranges: (9.9, 10.2) and (10, 10.3). Given the symmetry of the normal distribution about the mean, the range (9.9, 10.2) is not symmetric about the mean, unlike the range (10, 10.3). However, the critical misunderstanding here is assuming equal probabilities for asymmetric ranges about the mean. The correct interpretation, considering the symmetry and how the normal distribution's probability density function behaves, would suggest that the range closer to the mean on both sides (which would be a range like (9.7, 10.3)) would have a higher probability than a range not symmetrically distributed about the mean.

Spacecraft need to achieve one of these three cosmic velocities depending on their mission. Let's look at each of them in turn.One, First Cosmic Velocity: The first cosmic velocity is also known as the minimum launch speed of a spacecraft, the maximum operational speed of a spacecraft, and the orbital speed. It refers to the speed at which an object can move in a circular orbit just above the Earth's surface, and it is also the minimum launch speed for artificial Earth satellites. According to mechanical theory, the first cosmic velocity is calculated to be 7.9 kilometers per second. In reality, the Earth's surface has a dense atmosphere, so spacecraft cannot orbit the Earth at such a low altitude. They need to be at a flight altitude of 150 kilometers to orbit the Earth in a circular path. Here, it is particularly important to remember: the first cosmic velocity is approximately 7.9 kilometers per second.Two, Second Cosmic Velocity: The minimum speed required for a man-made object to escape Earth's gravitational pull. When an object reaches a flight speed of 11.2 kilometers per second, it can break free from Earth's gravitational pull, leave Earth, and enter an orbit around the Sun, no longer orbiting Earth. This minimum speed to escape Earth's gravity is the second cosmic velocity. The initial flight speeds of various planetary probes are all higher than the second cosmic velocity. The second cosmic velocity is approximately 11.2 kilometers per second.Three, Third Cosmic Velocity: The minimum speed required to launch a spacecraft from the Earth's surface to escape the solar system and venture into the vast Milky Way is called the third cosmic velocity. According to mechanical theory, the third cosmic velocity is calculated to be approximately 16.7 kilometers per second. It is important to note that this value is calculated assuming the spacecraft's entry speed is in the same direction as Earth's orbital speed; if the direction is different, the required speed will be greater than 16.7 kilometers per second. In short, the speed of the spacecraft is the only factor that can break free from the gravitational pull of Earth and even the Sun, and currently, only rockets can achieve this cosmic velocity.Therefore, let's summarize the key points: The speed that allows an object to orbit the Earth in a circular path is called the first cosmic velocity, approximately 7.9 kilometers per second; the speed to escape Earth's gravitational pull and leave Earth is called the second cosmic velocity, approximately 11.2 kilometers per second; and the speed to escape the Sun's gravitational pull and leave the solar system is called the third cosmic velocity, approximately 16.7 kilometers per second."},{"problem":"Example 3.

Analyze the factored form:   For the equation (a^2(1 - b) + b^2(1 - a) = 0) to hold, we need to consider the cases where each term is zero.   - Case 1: (a^2(1 - b) = 0)     [     a^2 = 0 quad text{or} quad 1 - b = 0     ]     Since (a) is a positive integer, (a^2 neq 0).

How many different ways are there to select the 16 red cubes? Explain your reasoning.","solution":"[Solution 1] Divide the large cube into 4 layers in the order from front to back, each layer being a 1 × 4 × 4 rectangular prism. Number the 4 layers as 1, 2, 3, 4. Project all the red cubes onto the 4 × 4 square grid on the front face. Thus, the projections of the 16 red cubes are all different and exactly fill the 4 × 4 square. Write 1, 2, 3, or 4 in each unit square to indicate which layer the red cube is from. In this way, the different ways to choose the red cubes correspond one-to-one with the different ways to fill the 4 × 4 square grid with numbers. Therefore, we only need to calculate the number of different ways to fill the grid.It is easy to see that each of the 16 unit cubes in each layer contains exactly 4 red cubes, and these 4 red cubes are in different rows and columns. Therefore, in the 4 × 4 square, the 16 numbers filled in include 4 each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and each set of 4 identical numbers is in different rows and columns.First, fill the 4 ones into the 4 × 4 grid, each in a different row and column, which can be done in 4! = 24 different ways.Then, note that the other 3 numbers in the first row can only be 2, 3, and 4, each appearing once, which can be done in 6 different ways.For any way of filling the 4 ones, it is always possible to swap layers so that the 4 ones are exactly on the main diagonal of the 4 × 4 grid. Then, by permuting the last 3 numbers in the first row, we can assume the first row is 1, 2, 3, 4.Consider the square in the second row and first column, which can be filled with 2, 3, or 4. If it is filled with 2, then the 4 numbers in the second row are 2, 1, 4, 3. Thus, the squares in the third row and fourth column and the fourth row and third column must be 2. The remaining 2 × 2 square in the lower left must contain 3 and 4, each appearing twice and with the same number on the diagonal, which can be done in 2 different ways. If the square in the second row and first column is filled with 3, then the 4 numbers in the second row are 3, 1, 4, 2, and there is only one way to fill the rest. Similarly, if the square in the second row and first column is filled with 4, there is also only one way to fill the rest. Therefore, there are 4 different ways to fill the grid.In summary, there are 24 × 6 × 4 = 576 different ways to fill the grid. Thus, there are 576 different ways to choose the 16 red cubes.[Solution 2] From Solution 1, we know that each valid way to choose the 16 red cubes corresponds to a way to divide the 4 × 4 grid into 4 groups, each group containing 4 squares in different rows and columns. Therefore, we only need to count the number of different ways to divide the grid into groups.Use 1, 2, 3, 4 to represent the group number of each square and fix the 4 squares in the first column to belong to groups 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Thus, there are 24 different ways to divide the grid:By corresponding the 4 groups of squares to the 4 layers of red cubes, there are 24 different ways to do so. Therefore, there are 576 different ways to choose the 16 red cubes."},{"problem":"Problem 8-5. 8 8-5. A divisor of a natural number is called proper if it is different from 1 and the number itself.

Initial Observation:   - For ( p = 2 ), we check the condition:     [     y^2 equiv x^3 - x pmod{2}     ]     The possible values for ( (x, y) ) are ((0, 0)), ((0, 1)), ((1, 0)), and ((1, 1)).

Hence, ( p = 2 ) is a solution.2. Lemma 1:   - The number of solutions ((x, y)) of the equation ( y^2 = x^3 - x ) in (mathbb{F}_p) is equal to ( p ) if and only if:     [     sum_{y in mathbb{F}_p} left( frac{y^3 - y}{p} right) = 0     ]     where (left( frac{a}{p} right)) is the Legendre symbol.3. Proof of Lemma 1:   - Let ( a = |{ y in mathbb{F}_p : left( frac{y^3 - y}{p} right) = 1 }| ),     ( b = |{ y in mathbb{F}_p : left( frac{y^3 - y}{p} right) = -1 }| ),     and ( c = |{ y in mathbb{F}_p : left( frac{y^3 - y}{p} right) = 0 }| ).   - We know ( c = 3 ) because ( y^3 - y = 0 ) has exactly 3 solutions: ( y = 0, 1, -1 ).   - Therefore, ( a + b + 3 = p ).   - Also, ( sum_{y in mathbb{F}_p} left( frac{y^3 - y}{p} right) = a - b ).   - The number of solutions ( N ) of the equation ( y^2 = x^3 - x ) is ( N = 2a + 3 ).   - For ( N = p ), we need ( 2a + 3 = p ), which implies ( a = frac{p - 3}{2} ).   - Since ( a + b + 3 = p ), we get ( b = frac{p - 3}{2} ), hence ( a = b ).4. Lemma 2:   - For a prime ( p ),     [     S = sum_{y in mathbb{F}_p} left( frac{y^3 - y}{p} right) = 0     ]     if and only if ( p equiv -1 pmod{4} ).5. Proof of Lemma 2:   - Let ( h = frac{p - 3}{2} ).   - If ( S = 0 ), then:     [     P = prod_{y in mathbb{F}_p, y neq 0, pm 1} left( frac{y^3 - y}{p} right) = (-1)^h     ]   - Notice that if we put ( F(x) = frac{x^{p-1} - 1}{x^2 - 1} = 1 + x^2 + x^4 + cdots + x^{2h} ), then:     [     prod_{y in mathbb{F}_p, y neq 0, pm 1} (y^3 - y) = F(0) F(1) F(-1) = (h + 1)^2     ]   - Therefore:     [     (-1)^h = P = left( frac{(h + 1)^2}{p} right) = 1     ]     so that ( h ) is even. This precisely means that ( p equiv -1 pmod{4} ).   - Conversely, if ( p equiv -1 pmod{4} ), then:     [     S = sum_{y in mathbb{F}_p} left( frac{(-y)^3 - (-y)}{p} right) = left( frac{-1}{p} right) S = -S     ]     which gives ( S = 0 ).6. Conclusion:   - Combining Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we conclude that the prime numbers ( p ) for which the number of ordered pairs ((x, y)) with (0 leq x, y < p) satisfying ( y^2 equiv x^3 - x pmod{p} ) is exactly ( p ) are those primes ( p ) such that ( p equiv -1 pmod{4} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ p equiv -1 pmod{4} } )."},{"problem":"A Tim number is a five-digit positive integer with the property that it is a multiple of 15 , its hundreds digit is 3, and its tens digit is equal to the sum of its first (leftmost) three digits.

These are exactly the numbers that, when divided by 5, leave a remainder of 1, i.e., exactly the numbers 1, 1 cdot 5 + 1 = 6, 2 cdot 5 + 1 = 11, 3 cdot 5 + 1 = 16, ldots, 199 cdot 5 + 1 = 996.Their number (as this enumeration shows, obtained as the number of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 199) is 200.

The library is 15 kilometers away from Rongrong's home. On the same route, the speed of taking a car is 4 times the speed of riding a bike. Therefore, Rongrong needs to leave 45 minutes earlier than taking a car in order to arrive at the library at the same time. Find the speed at which Rongrong rides the bike.","solution":"To solve the problem systematically, let's follow the steps below:1. Define Variables:   Let the speed at which Rongrong rides the bike be x kilometers per hour. Consequently, the speed at which Rongrong takes the car would be 4x kilometers per hour, given that the car's speed is four times the bike's speed.2. Set Up the Equation:   The time difference between riding a bike and taking a car to cover the same distance of 15 kilometers is given as 45 minutes (which is frac{45}{60} hours). The time taken to travel a certain distance is the distance divided by the speed. Therefore, the equation based on the given information is:   [   frac{15}{x} - frac{15}{4x} = frac{45}{60}   ]   This equation represents the difference in time (in hours) taken by Rongrong to reach the library by bike and by car.3. Solve the Equation:   Simplify the equation step by step:   [   frac{15}{x} - frac{15}{4x} = frac{3}{4}   ]   Multiplying every term by 4x to eliminate the denominators, we get:   [   4 cdot 15 - 15 = 3x   ]   Simplifying further:   [   60 - 15 = 3x   ]   [   45 = 3x   ]   Dividing both sides by 3:   [   x = 15   ]4. Verification:   Substituting x = 15 back into the original equation to verify:   [   frac{15}{15} - frac{15}{4 cdot 15} = frac{3}{4}   ]   Simplifying:   [   1 - frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4}   ]   This confirms that x = 15 is indeed a solution that satisfies the given conditions.Therefore, the speed at which Rongrong rides the bike is boxed{15} kilometers per hour."},{"problem":"Throwing two dice, the sum of the points obtained is xi, then xi=4 represents the result of the random experiment is ( ).A: One die shows 3 points, the other shows 1 pointB: Both dice show 2 pointsC: Both dice show 4 pointsD: One die shows 3 points, the other shows 1 point, or both dice show 2 points","solution":"For the results of the random experiments represented by A and B, the random variable both take the value 4, while D represents all the experimental results that xi=4 can represent.

If vertices A, B, C, D, and E are each painted with one of three colors - red, yellow, or green - such that adjacent vertices are painted with different colors, how many different coloring methods are there?","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to classify the different cases.First, vertex A can be painted in 3 different ways (red, yellow, or green).Let's break it down into two scenarios based on the colors of vertices adjacent to A:1. The two neighboring vertices of A are colored the same: There are 2 possibilities for choosing one color different from A for these two vertices. Once these are set, the remaining two vertices (the ones not adjacent to A) will also have 2 color options to ensure they are not the same color as their adjacent painted vertices. This results in 2 times 2 scenarios.2. The two neighboring vertices of A are colored differently: There are 2 cases for assigning two different colors to these vertices. Now for the last two vertices, there are 3 possibilities since we need to ensure that they are different from both their adjacent vertices and each other. This leads to 2 times 3 scenarios.Therefore, the total number of coloring methods for the pentagon is:3 times (2 times 2 + 2 times 3) = 3 times (4 + 6) = 3 times 10 = 30So, there are boxed{30} different ways to color the pentagon under the given conditions.Enhanced Explanation:The problem mentioned is a combinatorial one, and such problems often are best approached through strategic case analysis.- Choose a color for vertex A: 3 options- Case 1: Vertices B and E (adjacent to A) are the same color.  - There are 2 options for the color for B and E (not the color of A).  - Vertices C and D will each have 2 options to ensure they also adhere to the coloring rule.  - Total for Case 1 is 2 times 2 = 4 ways.- Case 2: Vertices B and E have different colors.  - There are 2 options for picking distinct colors for B and E.  - The remaining two vertices (C and D) have 3 options now, considering the adjacency rule.  - Total for Case 2 is 2 times 3 = 6 ways.The principle used here is the rule of product in combinatorics, which states that if one event can occur in 'm' ways and a second can occur in 'n' ways, then the number of ways the two can occur in sequence is m × n ways.By analyzing through categorized steps, we tackled a problem that wasn't straightforward at first glance. This method is handy when addressing more complex counting problems, utilizing the combination of both the rule of product and the rule of sum (which says if something can happen in m ways and another independent event in n ways, there are m + n ways for either to happen)."},{"problem":"It is known that the volume of a sphere is numerically equal to its surface area.

Let's show that these are the only ones. We fix a set of colored cells that works.Suppose that on row a, the cell (a, b) is colored but not (a, c). Take a scattered set that contains (a, b) and left(a^{prime}, cright) (This is possible, for example, by taking all (x, x) for x neq a, b, a^{prime}, c, as well as (a, b), (b, a), left(a^{prime}, cright), and left(c, a^{prime}right); to verify that it works, one just needs to distinguish the cases where a=b and where a^{prime}=c). If we replace these two cells with left(a^{prime}, bright) and (a, c), we still have a scattered set. The only way to keep the number of colored cells the same is for the cell left(a^{prime}, bright) to be colored but not left(a^{prime}, cright).Thus, if we take a colored cell and its entire row is not colored, then we have just shown that its entire column is colored. By symmetry, if we take a colored cell and its entire column is not colored, then its entire row is colored. Therefore, either its entire row is colored, or its entire column is colored (or both).Now suppose that row a is colored as well as column b and let's show that all cells in the grid are colored. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a cell (c, d) that is not colored. We fix a scattered set containing (a, b) and (c, d). By replacing them with (a, d) and (c, b), we gain a colored cell; contradiction.Finally, to obtain a valid configuration, we first choose an orientation (rows or columns) and then, for example, if we choose the rows, we decide which rows to color, and we color these rows entirely, and only these. By observing that a scattered set has exactly one cell in each row and each column, we deduce that the coloring thus obtained is valid.We then count 2 cdot 2^{n} configurations, 2^{n} for each orientation. However, two of them are identical, namely the configurations where everything is colored or nothing is colored, which can be obtained from both orientations. Therefore, there are a total of 2^{n+1}-2 ways to color the grid.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_7f99ab0e41c82ac4a4c9g-07.jpg?height=420&width=824&top_left_y=1652&top_left_x=648)FIGURE 2 - The only possible types of configurations for scattered setsGraders' Comments: The exercise is only partially successful.

The number (43=42+1) is prime which is good news since we have ((x+y-1)left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}right)=43 x y).Now we can employ some wishful thinking: if (x) and (y) happen to be coprime, then (left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}right)) has no factors in common with (x) or (y) so it must divide 43. This feels like a significant step except for the fact that (x) and (y) may not be coprime.This suggests writing (x=d X) and (y=d Y) where (d) is the highest common factor of (x) and (y).We end up with ((d X+d Y-1)left(X^{2}-X Y+Y^{2}right)=43 X Y) so (X^{2}-X Y+Y^{2}) equals 1 or 43.The first of these readily gives (X=Y=1). A neat way to deal with the second is to assume (Y leq X) so (43=X^{2}-X Y+Y^{2} geq Y^{2}). This gives six cases for (Y) which can be checked in turn. Alternatively you can solve (X^{2}-X Y+Y^{2}=43) for (X) and fuss about the discriminant.In the end the only solutions turn out to be ((x, y)=(22,22),(1,7)) or ((7,1)).Another reasonable initial plan is to bound (x+y) (using observation (iii) above) and then use modular arithmetic to eliminate cases until only the correct solutions remain. Working modulo 7 is particularly appealing since (7 mid 42) and the only cubes modulo 7 are 0, 1, and -1.We have (x^{3}+y^{3}=(x+y)^{3}-3 x y(x+y)) and also (x^{2}+42 x y+y^{2}=(x+y)^{2}+40 x y) so the equation becomes ((x+y)^{3}=(x+y)^{2}+x y(3 x y+40)). Now using (x y leqleft(frac{x+y}{2}right)^{2}) leads to (x+y leq 44).This leaves a mere 484 cases to check! The modulo 7 magic is not really enough to cut this down to an attractive number, and although the approach can obviously be made to work, to call it laborious is an understatement.Other possible approaches, such as substituting (u=x+y, v=x-y), seem to lie somewhere between the two described above in terms of the amount of fortitude needed to pull them off."},{"problem":"(1) Calculate: 0.01^{-1}+(-1frac{2}{7})^0-sqrt{9};  (2) Solve the equation: frac{2}{x-3}=frac{3}{x-2}.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part (1): Calculate 0.01^{-1}+(-1frac{2}{7})^0-sqrt{9}1.

Call the smallest number of the k+1 on the blackboard L_{k+1}. Find the maximum of L_2+L_3+cdots+L_{2024}.","solution":"1. Initial Setup: We start with the number (1) on the blackboard. In the first step, we erase (1) and write two nonnegative reals whose sum is (1). Let these numbers be (a) and (1-a) where (0 leq a leq 1). The smaller of these two numbers is (L_2 = min(a, 1-a)).2. Subsequent Steps: For each subsequent step (k geq 2), we erase a number on the blackboard and replace it with two nonnegative reals whose sum is the number erased. We denote the smallest number on the blackboard after the (k)-th step as (L_{k+1}).3. Strategy for Maximizing the Sum: To maximize (L_2 + L_3 + cdots + L_{2024}), we need to consider the smallest numbers that appear on the blackboard at each step. The optimal strategy is to always split the smallest number on the blackboard into two equal parts. This ensures that the smallest number on the blackboard is minimized at each step.4. Pattern Recognition: When we split a number (x) into two equal parts, we get (frac{x}{2}) and (frac{x}{2}). If we continue this process, the smallest number on the blackboard after (n) steps will be (frac{1}{2^n}).5. Summing the Smallest Numbers: We need to find the sum (L_2 + L_3 + cdots + L_{2024}). Notice that:   - For (k = 2), (L_2 = frac{1}{2}).   - For (k = 3) and (k = 4), (L_3 = L_4 = frac{1}{4}).   - For (k = 5) to (k = 8), (L_5 = L_6 = L_7 = L_8 = frac{1}{8}).   - Generally, for (2^{n-1} < k leq 2^n), (L_k = frac{1}{2^n}).6. Calculating the Sum: We sum the smallest numbers for each range:   [   sum_{k=2}^{2024} L_k = sum_{n=1}^{10} sum_{k=2^{n-1}+1}^{2^n} frac{1}{2^n}   ]   Each inner sum is:   [   sum_{k=2^{n-1}+1}^{2^n} frac{1}{2^n} = frac{2^n - 2^{n-1}}{2^n} = frac{2^{n-1}}{2^n} = frac{1}{2}   ]   There are 10 such sums from (n=1) to (n=10), so:   [   sum_{n=1}^{10} frac{1}{2} = 10 times frac{1}{2} = 5   ]7.

If the university invests b million dollars in better food, the students will spend an additional 3b hours per week studying. Finally, if the c million dollars are invested in parties, students will be more relaxed and spend 11c - c^2 more hours per week studying. The university wants to invest its 5 million dollars so that the students get as many additional hours of studying as possible. What is the maximal amount that students get to study?","solution":"1. Define the variables and constraints:   - Let ( a ) be the amount invested in dorms (in million dollars).   - Let ( b ) be the amount invested in better food (in million dollars).   - Let ( c ) be the amount invested in parties (in million dollars).   - The total investment is constrained by ( a + b + c = 5 ).2. Express the additional hours of studying:   - Investing ( a ) million dollars in dorms results in ( 5a ) additional hours of studying per week.   - Investing ( b ) million dollars in better food results in ( 3b ) additional hours of studying per week.   - Investing ( c ) million dollars in parties results in ( 11c - c^2 ) additional hours of studying per week.3. Formulate the objective function:   - The total additional hours of studying, ( H ), is given by:     [     H = 5a + 3b + (11c - c^2)     ]   - Since ( a + b + c = 5 ), we can express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( c ):     [     a = 5 - b - c     ]4.

Analyze the simplified function:   - To maximize ( H ), we need to consider the terms involving ( b ) and ( c ). Since ( b ) has a negative coefficient, it is not sensible to invest in better food (( b = 0 )).   - Thus, the objective function reduces to:     [     H = 25 + 6c - c^2     ]6. Maximize the quadratic function:   - The function ( H = 25 + 6c - c^2 ) is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value occurs at the vertex.   - The vertex of a quadratic function ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is given by ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ).   - Here, ( a = -1 ) and ( b = 6 ), so:     [     c = -frac{6}{2(-1)} = 3     ]7.

Using Euler's Formula: Euler's formula for a convex polyhedron states that:   [   V - E + F = 2   ]   Given that the polyhedron has ( F = 32 ) faces, we can rewrite Euler's formula as:   [   V - E + 32 = 2 implies V - E = -30   ]2. Relating Edges and Vertices: Each vertex is joined by ( T + P ) faces, and thus by ( T + P ) edges. Since each edge is counted twice (once at each end), the total number of edges ( E ) is:   [   E = frac{V(T + P)}{2}   ]   Substituting ( E ) into the modified Euler's formula ( V - E = -30 ):   [   V - frac{V(T + P)}{2} = -30   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   V left(1 - frac{T + P}{2}right) = -30 implies V left(frac{2 - (T + P)}{2}right) = -30 implies V left(frac{2 - T - P}{2}right) = -30   ]   Solving for ( V ):   [   V = frac{60}{T + P - 2}   ]3. Counting Faces: Each vertex connects ( P ) pentagons and ( T ) triangles. Since each pentagon has 5 vertices and each triangle has 3 vertices, the total number of vertices counted by faces is:   [   V left(frac{P}{5} + frac{T}{3}right) = 32   ]   Substituting ( V = frac{60}{T + P - 2} ) into the equation:   [   frac{60}{T + P - 2} left(frac{P}{5} + frac{T}{3}right) = 32   ]   Simplifying:   [   60 left(frac{P}{5} + frac{T}{3}right) = 32 (T + P - 2)   ]   [   60 left(frac{3P + 5T}{15}right) = 32 (T + P - 2)   ]   [   12 (3P + 5T) = 32 (T + P - 2)   ]   [   36P + 60T = 32T + 32P - 64   ]   [   4P + 28T = 64   ]   [   P + 7T = 16   ]4. Solving for ( P ) and ( T ): The equation ( P + 7T = 16 ) must be solved for positive integers ( P ) and ( T ). Testing values, we find:   [   T = 2 implies P + 14 = 16 implies P = 2   ]5. Calculating ( V ): Substituting ( T = 2 ) and ( P = 2 ) into ( V = frac{60}{T + P - 2} ):   [   V = frac{60}{2 + 2 - 2} = frac{60}{2} = 30   ]6. Final Calculation: We need to find ( 100P + 10T + V ):   [   100P + 10T + V = 100 cdot 2 + 10 cdot 2 + 30 = 200 + 20 + 30 = 250   ]The final answer is (boxed{250})"},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, A, B, C are the three internal angles of the triangle, and a, b, c are the three sides corresponding to the internal angles.

Zero Power:   (frac{2}{3})^{0} = 1   Any non-zero number to the power of zero equals 1.2. Negative Exponent:   2^{-2} = frac{1}{2^2} = frac{1}{4}   A negative exponent indicates reciprocal and squaring.3.

Let X, Y, be the feet from D to overline{B A}, overline{B C}, and let Z=overline{B D} cap overline{A C}. By Simson theorem, the points X, Y, Z are collinear. Consequently, the point P is the reflection of D over Z, and so we conclude P is the orthocenter of triangle A B C.Suppose now we extend ray C P to meet omega again at Q^{prime}. Then overline{B A} is the perpendicular bisector of both overline{P Q^{prime}} and overline{D E}; consequently, P Q^{prime} E D is an isosceles trapezoid. In particular, it is cyclic, and so Q^{prime}=Q. In the same way R is the second intersection of ray overline{A P} with omega.Now, because of the two isosceles trapezoids we have found, we concludeE Q=P D=F Ras desired.Remark. Alternatively, after identifying P, one can note overline{B Q E} and overline{B R F} are collinear.Since B E=B D=B F, upon noticing B Q=B P=B R we are also done.Second solution (Danielle Wang).

Let alpha=measuredangle D E B=measuredangle B D E and beta=measuredangle B F D=measuredangle F D B.Observe that B E=B D=B F, so B is the circumcenter of triangle D E F.

Additionally, partial progress in problems (for example, considering an important case, proving a lemma, finding an example, etc.) is evaluated. Thus, when calculating the final scores for a problem, the jury takes into account all these cases, as well as possible logical and arithmetic errors in the solutions.The checking of works at the Mathematical Olympiad is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the jury checks the works without assigning scores, using a so-called \\"plus-minus\\" system. The sign is assigned according to the table provided below. The preliminary evaluation in the \\"plus-minus\\" system may be slightly adjusted after discussing the criteria and classifying the cases.| Correctness of Solution |  || :---: | :--- || + | Complete correct solution || .+ | Correct solution. There are minor flaws that do not significantly affect the solution || pm | The solution is generally correct. However, the solution contains significant errors or cases are omitted, which do not affect the logical reasoning || +/ 2 | One of two (more complex) significant cases is correctly considered, or in a problem of the type \\"estimate + example,\\" the estimate is correctly obtained || mp | Auxiliary statements that help in solving the problem are proven || .- | Important individual cases are considered in the absence of a solution || - | The solution is incorrect, and there is no progress || 0 | The solution is absent |Sometimes the grade \\"++\\" is given to note a correct and elegant solution.After the first stage of checking, the group of checkers for each problem, analyzing and generalizing the provided solutions, highlights various ways of solving, typical partial progress, and main errors. In accordance with the comparative analysis of different progress, a scale of evaluation criteria is developed.In the second stage, final scores are assigned for each problem. According to the regulations for conducting school mathematical Olympiads, each problem is scored out of 7 points. The table below provides the scale for converting signs into points.| Sign | + | .+ | pm | +/ 2 | mp | .- | - | 0 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || Points | 7 | 6-7 | 5-6 | 4 | 2-3 | 0-1 | 0 | 0 |The maximum score for completing all tasks is 35.It is important to note that any correct solution is scored 7 points. Points are not deducted for a solution being too long or for a solution that differs from the one provided in methodological developments or from other solutions known to the jury.At the same time, any arbitrarily long text of a solution that does not contain useful progress is scored 0 points.A traditional mistake made by students when solving proof problems is using the statement to be proven as an initial condition or the basis of the proof. For example, in a problem requiring proof that a triangle is isosceles, the proof begins with the words: \\"Let triangle A B C be isosceles.\\" Such \\"solutions\\" are scored 0 points due to a gross logical error.Each work is evaluated and checked (rechecked) by at least two members of the jury.After the preliminary results of the Olympiad work checking are published, Participants have the right to review their works, including informing about their disagreement with the assigned scores. In this case, the Chairman of the Olympiad Jury appoints a jury member to reconsider the work. The score for the work can be changed if the Participant's request for a score change is deemed justified. The score change is agreed upon with the Chairman of the Jury and entered into the final table.A final table is created for each parallel based on the results of the Olympiad."},{"problem":"Currently, the influenza A virus is spreading in the country.

Let the numbers at the vertices be denoted as x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{2019}. Since the sum of any nine consecutive numbers is the same, the numbers that are 8 apart are equal. Therefore, x_{1}=x_{10}=x_{19}=ldots=x_{1+9 k}=ldots. Since 2019 is not divisible by 9 but is divisible by 3, continuing this sequence in a cycle will include all numbers of the form x_{3 k+1}.

The condition is that for any ( x, y in S ), there exists ( z in S ) such that ( x + y equiv 2z pmod{99} ).2. Case 1: ( m mid 99 ):   - Let ( 99 = m cdot d ). Consider the set ( S = {0, d, 2d, ldots, (m-1)d} ).   - For any ( x = ud ) and ( y = vd ) in ( S ), we have ( x + y = (u+v)d ).   - We need ( z ) such that ( 2z equiv x + y pmod{99} ). Let ( z = wd ). Then ( 2wd equiv (u+v)d pmod{99} ).   - This simplifies to ( 2w equiv u + v pmod{m} ), which always has a solution ( w ) in ({0, 1, 2, ldots, m-1}) because ( m ) is odd.   - Therefore, if ( m mid 99 ), the condition is satisfied.3. Case 2: ( m nmid 99 ):   - Let ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m ) be the elements of ( S ).   - Consider the sums ( x_m + x_1, x_m + x_2, ldots, x_m + x_{m-1} ) and let ( x_m + x_i equiv 2y_i pmod{99} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ).   - Since ( x_i )'s are distinct modulo 99, the ( y_i )'s are also distinct modulo 99.   - None of the ( y_i )'s can be equivalent to ( x_m ) modulo 99 because otherwise, we would have two equivalent terms.   - Thus, ( (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{m-1}) ) is a permutation of ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{m-1}) ).   - Adding these equations, we get ( (m-1)x_m equiv x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_{m-1} pmod{99} ).   - This implies ( mx_m equiv x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_m pmod{99} ).   - Repeating this for all ( x_i )'s, we get ( mx_1 equiv mx_2 equiv ldots equiv mx_m pmod{99} ).   - Let ( gcd(m, 99) = d ) and ( m = dm_1 ), ( 99 = dk ). Then ( x_1 equiv x_2 equiv ldots equiv x_m pmod{k} ).   - We have ( m ) numbers equivalent to each other modulo ( k ). Since there are ( d ) numbers modulo ( kd ) equivalent to each other modulo ( k ), we must have ( m leq d ).   - This implies ( dm_1 leq d ), so ( m_1 = 1 ). Hence, ( m = d mid 99 ).4. Conclusion:   - The possible values of ( m ) are the divisors of 99 that are greater than or equal to 3.   - The divisors of 99 are 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, and 99.

According to Legendre's three-square theorem, the set ( S ) consists of natural numbers that can be written in the form ( 4^a(8b+7) ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are nonnegative integers.2.

Since ( n ) and ( n+1 ) are consecutive integers, one of them must be even and the other must be odd.4. If ( n ) is even, then ( n+1 ) is odd. Conversely, if ( n ) is odd, then ( n+1 ) is even.5. Consider the case where ( n+1 ) is odd. For ( n+1 ) to be in ( S ), it must be of the form ( 4^a(8b+7) ). Since ( n+1 ) is odd, ( a ) must be 0 (because ( 4^a ) would make it even for ( a geq 1 )).6.

Since ( fleft(frac{1}{10}right) ) is rational, the decimal representation of ( fleft(frac{1}{10}right) ) must be eventually periodic.

What is the maximum number of natural numbers not exceeding 2016 that can be marked so that the product of any two marked numbers is a perfect square?","solution":"Answer: 44.Solution. Let's find the number of natural numbers whose squares are no greater than 2016. There are 44 such numbers, since 44^{2}=1936 < 2016. Since the product of two perfect squares is a perfect square, the numbers 1=1^{2}, 4=2^{2}, ldots, 1936=44^{2} can be marked.We will prove that it is impossible to mark a larger number of numbers. Indeed, consider the desired set of numbers and divide each number in this set by the largest perfect square that divides it. We will get a new set of numbers, and in the factorization of each of the resulting numbers into prime factors, these factors can only enter to the first power. Note that each prime factor (if it exists) must be present in all factorizations, since when multiplying any two numbers in the resulting set, it must end up in an even power. This means that after dividing each number in the desired set by the largest squares, we should get the same number q. If q=1, we get a set of 44 numbers that are perfect squares themselves (see above), and if q>1, we get a set of fewer numbers, since 1936 q > 2016.Grading Criteria“+\\" - a complete and well-reasoned solution is provided“士” - a generally correct reasoning is provided, containing minor gaps or inaccuracies\\"Ғ\\" - only the correct answer and a correct example are provided“-” - only the answer is provided“-” - the problem is not solved or solved incorrectly"},{"problem":"5.

However, each number on the circle is part of exactly five segments of five consecutive numbers, so each of the 16 numbers is counted exactly five times in the mentioned sum. Therefore, the sum S_{5} is also equal to five times the sum of all the numbers on the circle, which is 35. This is in contradiction with the derived inequality S_{5} < 32. Therefore, there must exist five consecutive numbers on the circle whose sum is at least 2 (in fact, more than 2).b) First, let's show that k leq 6 cannot be true.

By repeating the reasoning from part a), we can prove that the desired segment already exists: Assume, on the contrary, that the sum of any seven consecutive numbers (from the given sixteen) is less than three. There are sixteen such segments along the circle (their number does not depend on k!), so the sum S_{7} of all 16 sums of the numbers in the individual septets is less than 16 cdot 3 = 48. Each of the given 16 numbers is counted seven times in the sum S_{7}, so S_{7} = 7 cdot 7 = 49, which contradicts the previous estimate S_{7} < 48.The sought number k is 7.For a complete solution, award 6 points.

Given that the incircle of a triangle with sides (a, b, c) has a radius (r = frac{b+c-a}{2}), we need to find the magnitude of (angle A).2. The formula for the inradius (r) of a triangle is given by:   [   r = frac{A}{s}   ]   where (A) is the area of the triangle and (s) is the semiperimeter. The semiperimeter (s) is:   [   s = frac{a + b + c}{2}   ]3. The area (A) of the triangle can also be expressed using the formula:   [   A = frac{1}{2}bc sin A   ]4. Substituting the expressions for (A) and (s) into the formula for (r), we get:   [   r = frac{frac{1}{2}bc sin A}{frac{a + b + c}{2}} = frac{bc sin A}{a + b + c}   ]5. According to the problem, the inradius is also given by:   [   r = frac{b + c - a}{2}   ]6. Equating the two expressions for (r), we have:   [   frac{bc sin A}{a + b + c} = frac{b + c - a}{2}   ]7. Cross-multiplying to clear the fractions, we get:   [   2bc sin A = (b + c - a)(a + b + c)   ]8. Expanding the right-hand side:   [   2bc sin A = (b + c - a)(a + b + c) = b^2 + c^2 + 2bc - a^2   ]9. By the Law of Cosines, we know:   [   a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A   ]10. Substituting (a^2) from the Law of Cosines into the equation, we get:    [    2bc sin A = b^2 + c^2 + 2bc - (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A)    ]11. Simplifying the equation:    [    2bc sin A = 2bc (1 + cos A)    ]12. Dividing both sides by (2bc), we obtain:    [    sin A = 1 + cos A    ]13. Rearranging the equation:    [    sin A - cos A = 1    ]14. Squaring both sides:    [    (sin A - cos A)^2 = 1^2    ]15. Expanding the left-hand side:    [    sin^2 A - 2 sin A cos A + cos^2 A = 1    ]16. Using the Pythagorean identity (sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1), we get:    [    1 - 2 sin A cos A = 1    ]17.

Here, ( M(a) ) is defined as the number of positive integers ( b ) for which ( a + b ) divides ( ab ).1. Understanding ( M(a) ):   We start by analyzing the condition ( a + b mid ab ). This can be rewritten as:   [   ab equiv 0 pmod{a + b}   ]   This implies that ( a + b ) must be a divisor of ( ab ). Let ( d = a + b ). Then ( d mid ab ) and ( d > a ). Therefore, ( b = d - a ) and ( d ) must be a divisor of ( ab ) that is greater than ( a ).2. Counting the number of valid ( b ):   The number of such ( b ) is the number of divisors of ( ab ) that are greater than ( a ). Let ( tau(n) ) denote the number of divisors of ( n ). The number of divisors of ( ab ) is ( tau(ab) ). Since ( a + b > a ), we need to count the divisors of ( ab ) that are greater than ( a ).3. Simplifying ( M(a) ):   We can express ( M(a) ) as:   [   M(a) = left| { d mid ab mid d > a } right|   ]   This can be simplified to:   [   M(a) = frac{tau(a) - 1}{2}   ]   because for each divisor ( d ) of ( a ), there is a corresponding divisor ( frac{ab}{d} ) of ( ab ), and we need to exclude the divisor ( a ) itself.4. Maximizing ( M(a) ):   To maximize ( M(a) ), we need to maximize ( tau(a) ). The function ( tau(n) ) is maximized when ( n ) has the most divisors, which occurs when ( n ) has many small prime factors raised to higher powers.5. Finding the maximum ( tau(a) ) for ( 1 le a le 2013 ):   We need to find the integer ( a ) within the range ( 1 le a le 2013 ) that has the maximum number of divisors. We can check the values of ( tau(a) ) for different ( a ) and find the maximum.6. Checking specific values:   - For ( a = 1680 ), the prime factorization is ( 1680 = 2^4 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 ). The number of divisors is:     [     tau(1680) = (4+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 5 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 = 40     ]   - For ( a = 2013 ), the prime factorization is ( 2013 = 3 cdot 11 cdot 61 ). The number of divisors is:     [     tau(2013) = (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 = 8     ]   Clearly, ( tau(1680) = 40 ) is the highest among the values checked.7.

(2) The first meiotic division: ① Prophase: Synapsis, crossing over between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes; ② Metaphase: Homologous chromosomes line up in pairs at the metaphase plate; ③ Anaphase: Homologous chromosomes separate, non-homologous chromosomes freely combine; ④ Telophase: Cytoplasm divides.

Identify the condition for a and b from the set equality: Given {a, frac{b}{a}, 1} = {a^{2}, a-b, 0}, we understand that for the sets to be equal, each element in one set must correspond to an element in the other set. Since 0 is present in the second set, and the only way for frac{b}{a} to equal 0 (given that a neq 0 to avoid division by zero) is if b = 0.2. Substitute b = 0 into the sets: Substituting b = 0 into the sets, we get {a, 0, 1} = {a^{2}, a, 0}. This implies that one of the elements of the set on the left must match a^{2} and since a is already present, it leads us to conclude that a^{2} = 1.3. Solve for a given the constraints: The equation a^{2} = 1 has two solutions, a = 1 and a = -1. However, since a and a-b (which simplifies to a when b=0) are distinct elements of the set, and we already have a in the set, a cannot be 1 because it would not add a new value to the set. Therefore, a = -1.4. Calculate a^{2019} + b^{2019}: With a = -1 and b = 0, we calculate a^{2019} + b^{2019} = (-1)^{2019} + 0^{2019}. Since any non-zero number raised to an odd power preserves the sign, (-1)^{2019} = -1. Also, 0^{2019} = 0. Therefore, a^{2019} + b^{2019} = -1 + 0 = -1.5.

All circles are internally tangent to a circle C with radius 30. Let K be the area of the region inside circle C and outside of the six circles in the ring. Find lfloor K rfloor.","solution":"1. Understanding the Geometry:   - We have six smaller circles, each with radius ( r ), forming a ring.   - Each smaller circle is externally tangent to its two adjacent smaller circles.   - All smaller circles are internally tangent to a larger circle ( C ) with radius ( 30 ).2. Finding the Radius of the Smaller Circles:   - Consider the center of the larger circle ( C ) and the center of one of the smaller circles.   - The distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of a smaller circle is ( 30 - r ).   - The centers of two adjacent smaller circles form an equilateral triangle with side length ( 2r ) (since they are tangent to each other).3. Using Geometry to Solve for ( r ):   - The distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of a smaller circle is also the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle, i.e., ( 30 - r ).   - The centers of the smaller circles form a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius ( 30 - r ).   - The side length of this hexagon is ( 2r ).4. Relating the Side Length to the Radius:   - The radius of the circumscribed circle of a regular hexagon is equal to the side length of the hexagon.   - Therefore, ( 30 - r = 2r ).5.

Then, its symmetric point P' (-x, -y) with respect to the origin lies on the graph of f(x). This means that -y will be equal to (-x)^2 + 2(-x). Thus, we can say:-y = x^2 - 2xand flipping signs, we get:y = -x^2 + 2x.Therefore, the explicit expression for function g(x) is:boxed{g(x) = -x^2 + 2x}.(2) Since g(x) geq f(x) - |x| - 1, we have the inequality:-x^2 + 2x geq x^2 + 2x - |x| - 1.By simplifying this inequality, we get:2x^2 - |x| - 1 leq 0,which can be factored into:(2|x| + 1)(|x| - 1) leq 0.Applying the zero product property, we find the critical points where the inequality changes sign. Understanding that 2|x| + 1 is always positive since the first term is twice the absolute value, we focus on |x| - 1, which is zero when |x| = 1 and changes sign crossing x = 1 or x = -1.

Then x can take the values left[frac{n}{2}right]=frac{n-1}{2}, frac{n-1}{2}-1, frac{n-1}{2}-2, ldots, 1and for each of these values of x, the number of positive integers between frac{n}{2}-x and frac{n}{2} is x (these conditions are satisfied by the numbers frac{n-1}{2}, frac{n-1}{2}-1, left.ldots, frac{n-1}{2}-(x-1)right). Therefore, forthere are frac{n-1}{2} different solutions ( y can be frac{n-1}{2}; left.frac{n-3}{2} ; ldots ; 1right) ; forx=frac{n-1}{2}-1there are frac{n-1}{2}-1 different solutions ( y can be frac{n-1}{2}, frac{n-1}{2}-1, ldots, 2 ), and so on; for x=1 there is only one solution ( y must be frac{n-1}{2} ). It is clear that the condition x+y<n is satisfied for all these solutions. Finally, the total number of different positive integer solutions to the equation x+y+z=n, satisfying the given inequalities, in this case isfrac{n-1}{2}+frac{n-3}{2}+ldots+1=frac{frac{(n-1)}{2} cdotleft[frac{n-1}{2}+1right]}{2}=frac{n^{2}-1}{8}2) n is even. Here x can take the values left[frac{n}{2}right]=frac{n}{2}, frac{n}{2}-1, frac{n}{2}-2, ldots, 1. For x=frac{n}{2}, the number of positive integersfrac{n}{2}=x (these conditions are satisfied by the numbers left.frac{n}{2}, frac{n}{2}-1, ldots, 1right), and for x<frac{n}{2}, the number of positive integers between frac{n}{2}-x and frac{n}{2} is x+1 (these conditions are satisfied by the numbers frac{n}{2}, frac{n}{2}-1, ldots, frac{n}{2}-x; for x=frac{n}{2}, the number of solutions is only x, since the number frac{n}{2}-x=0 is not positive and must be discarded). Thus, for x=frac{n}{2} there are frac{n}{2} different solutions ( y can be left.frac{n}{2}, frac{n}{2}-1, ldots, 1right); for x=frac{n}{2}-1 there are also frac{n}{2} different solutions ( y can be left.frac{n}{2}, frac{n}{2}-1, ldots, 1right), and so on; finally, for x=1 there are two different solutions ( y can be frac{n}{2} or frac{n}{2}-1 ). From all these solutions, one (namely, x=frac{n}{2}, y=frac{n}{2} ) must be discarded, as it does not satisfy the condition x+y<n. Thus, in this case, the total number of different positive integer solutions to the equation x+y+z=n, satisfying the given inequalities, isbegin{aligned}& frac{n}{2}+frac{n}{2}+left(frac{n}{2}-1right)+left(frac{n}{2}-2right)+ldots+2-1= & =left(frac{n}{2}+1right)+frac{n}{2}+left(frac{n}{2}-1right)+left(frac{n}{2}-2right)+ldots+2+1-3= & =frac{left(frac{n}{2}+1right)left(frac{n}{2}+2right)}{2}-3=frac{(n+2)(n+4)}{8}-3= & =frac{n^{2}+6 n-16}{8}=frac{(n+8)(n-2)}{8} .end{aligned}Note that the condition of the problem can also be interpreted geometrically. Each integer solution to the equation x+y+z=n is fully determined by two integers x and y (since z=n-x-y is uniquely determined by x and y). Let's consider a Cartesian coordinate system on a plane and mark all points with integer coordinates x and y that are solutions to our problem (Fig. 36). We have seen that for such solutions, y leqslant frac{n}{2}; therefore, all points corresponding to these conditions must lie below the line N Pleft(O N=M P=frac{n}{2}right) or on it. Due to the inequality x leqslant frac{n}{2}, all these points must lie to the left of the line P Mleft(O M=N P=frac{n}{2}right) or on it. Finally, the inequality x+y geq frac{n}{2} shows that all these points lie above the line N M or on it.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-131.jpg?height=464&width=470&top_left_y=517&top_left_x=185)Fig. 36. Thus, all the points we are looking for must be located inside or on the sides of the triangle N P M, shaded in Fig. 36; the vertices N, P and M of the triangle do not count (even if their coordinates are integers), because for them one of the numbers x, y, z becomes zero.It is easy to see that conversely, all points of the triangle N P M with integer coordinates (except the vertices) correspond to positive integer solutions to the equation x+y+z=n, satisfying the inequalities x+y geqslant z, x+z geqslant y, y+z geqslant x. Thus, our problem can also be formulated as follows:On a plane with a Cartesian coordinate system, the lines x=frac{n}{2}, y=frac{n}{2} and x+y=frac{n}{2} are drawn. How many points with integer coordinates are located inside and on the sides of the triangle bounded by these lines (vertices are not counted)?"},{"problem":"17.

Since mathcal{I}(ell+2) cup {k+ell} is an interval, mathcal{I}(ell+2) contains one of the three integers k+ell-1, k+ell, and k+ell+1. Therefore, there exists an integer a, equal to ell-2 or ell-1, such that mathcal{I}(ell+2)={k+a, k+a+1}. We then denote ell^{prime} the integer mathcal{I}^{-1}({k, k+1}). Since r^{1}+r^{2}=r^{ell^{prime}} geqslant r^{ell}=r^{a+1}+r^{a+2}, we know that a=0. Thus, mathcal{I}(ell+2)={k, k+1} and ell is equal to 1 or 2.triangleright If ell=1, then r+r^{2}=r^{3}. This situation is currently analogous to the case n=2.Furthermore, the interval mathcal{I}(4) is a singleton {k-1} or {k+2}, and its disjoint union with mathcal{I}(3) forms an interval mathcal{I}(m) equal to {k-1, k, k+1} or {k, k+1, k+2}, for which r^{m}=r^{3}+r^{4}=r^{2}left(r+r^{2}right)=r^{5}. But then mathcal{I}(5) has 6 subintervals, which is impossible.triangleright If ell=2, then r+r^{2}=r^{4}. We immediately deduce that r^{2}+r^{3}=r^{5} and r^{3}+r^{4}=r^{6}, so mathcal{I}(5)={k+1, k+2} and mathcal{I}(6)={k, k+1, k+2}. This situation is currently analogous to the case n=3.Thus, the interval mathcal{I}(7) is a singleton {k-1} or {k+3}, and its disjoint union with mathcal{I}(6) forms an interval mathcal{I}(m) equal to {k-1, k, k+1, k+2} or {k, k+1, k+2, k+3}, for which r^{m}=r^{6}+r^{7}=r^{5}left(r+r^{2}right)=r^{9}. Consequently, mathcal{I}(9) has 10 subintervals, which is impossible.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_12_06_ea9148e0135587c25e52g-12.jpg?height=438&width=1715&top_left_y=1232&top_left_x=179)In conclusion, no integer n geqslant 5 works, and the solutions are therefore n=2, n=3, and n=4."},{"problem":"A line perpendicular to the x-axis passes through the focus F of the parabola y^2=12x, intersecting the parabola at points A and B.

Explain your answer.","solution":"Answer: No, it could not.Solution. The first method. There are two possible cases.1) If Anton told the truth about himself, then he scored 3 goals. Then Seryozha lied about Anton, so Seryozha told the truth about himself, meaning he really scored 6 goals. Consequently, Ilya lied about Seryozha and told the truth about himself, meaning he scored 4 goals. In this case, the boys scored a total of 3+6+4=13 goals.2) If Anton lied about himself, then he told the truth about Ilya, meaning Ilya scored 1 goal. Then Ilya also lied about himself and told the truth about Seryozha, meaning Seryozha scored 5 goals. Consequently, Seryozha lied about himself and told the truth about Anton, meaning Anton scored 2 goals. In this case, the boys scored a total of 1+5+2=8 goals.The second method. A total of six statements were made, three of which are true. Each boy made two different statements, one of which must be true and the other false. Therefore, Anton scored either 3 goals or 2, Ilya scored either 1 or 4 goals, and Seryozha scored either 5 or 6 goals.

(1) Find the functional relationship between the daily sales volume y (boxes) and the selling price per box x (yuan).  (2) To make a daily profit of 6000 yuan and provide customers with the best value, what should the selling price be?  (3) At what selling price per box will the daily profit P (yuan) be maximized? What is the maximum profit?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Functional Relationship between Daily Sales Volume y and Selling Price per Box xGiven that at a selling price of 45 yuan, 700 boxes are sold, and for each 1 yuan increase in price, 20 fewer boxes are sold, we can establish the relationship as follows:- When x = 45, y = 700.- For each 1 yuan increase in x, y decreases by 20 boxes.This can be modeled as a linear equation where the change in y is proportional to the change in x from the base price of 45 yuan. Thus, we have:y = 700 - 20(x - 45)= 700 - 20x + 900= -20x + 1600Therefore, the functional relationship between the daily sales volume y (boxes) and the selling price per box x (yuan) is boxed{y = -20x + 1600} for 45 leqslant x < 80.# Part 2: Selling Price for a Daily Profit of 6000 YuanGiven the profit goal of 6000 yuan and the cost of 40 yuan per box, we can set up an equation to find the required selling price. The profit from selling each box is (x - 40), and the total profit is the product of this and the number of boxes sold, which is (-20x + 1600). Setting this equal to 6000 gives:(x - 40)(-20x + 1600) = 6000Rightarrow -20x^2 + 1600x - 800x + 32000 = 6000Rightarrow -20x^2 + 800x - 26000 = 0Rightarrow x^2 - 40x + 1300 = 0Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots to be x_1 = 50 and x_2 = 70. To provide customers with the best value, we choose the lower price, which is boxed{x = 50} yuan.# Part 3: Maximizing Daily Profit PThe daily profit P can be expressed as a function of x:P = (x - 40)(-20x + 1600)= -20x^2 + 2400x - 64000To find the maximum profit, we complete the square:P = -20(x^2 - 120x + 3600) + 8000= -20(x - 60)^2 + 8000Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-20), this parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex represents the maximum point. The vertex occurs at x = 60, and the maximum profit is P = 8000 yuan.Therefore, when the selling price per box is boxed{x = 60} yuan, the daily profit P is maximized at boxed{8000} yuan."},{"problem":"Given (a in mathbb{R}) and (i) as the imaginary unit, if ((1-i)(a+i)) is a pure imaginary number, then the value of (a) is ( ).A: (2)B: (1)C: (-2)D: (-1)","solution":"Since ((1-i)(a+i) = 1 + a + (1 - a)i) is a pure imaginary number,it follows that (begin{cases} 1 + a = 0  1 - a neq 0 end{cases}).
