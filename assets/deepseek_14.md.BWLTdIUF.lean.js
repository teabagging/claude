I would like to know more about her growth and development and if she had any major hospitalizations or serious bacterial infections till now. If these are not there, you need not worry and it could be a viral illness. At this juncture, I would breif you on what a viral illness is and I suggest you stop using Mefkind P. Its is more harmful than useful.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Mefkind-P contains Mefenamic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Mefkind-P.

I think your kid is having habitual constipation. I have certain suggestions for you.Suggestions:1. Natural methods are the best to relieve constipation.2. Constipation is a risk factor for UTI3. Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4. Minimum 3-4 cups of fruits and vegetables to be consumed per day5. Toilet training - that is - sitting in Indian type of lavatory daily at the same time will help a lot.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

I ve been in doctor couple times for this matter but has not gotten any wiser. I shall take a video and book appointment. What tests i should demand?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic. Greetings from Chennai.By what you quote I feel what your kid could be having viral associated wheeze or multi triggered wheeze. Both these diagnoses are clinical and no test however extensive will prove them at this age. Spirometry is useful only above 6 years of age. I have a few questions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place. No point in using antibiotics every time. It will do more harm than good by increasing bacterial resistance.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

Such children needs local application of medicine on regular basis. Usually this condition subsides by the time the child reaches two years of age.Wiping will not help.

It could also be due to regurgitation. Burp the baby after each feed. Take the baby on your lap with the baby facing you and with the head end raised. Maintain the position like this comfortably for 20 mins after each feed for proper burping and things should be fine. For a breast fed baby if stool is not hard, passing stool once in 10 days is equally acceptable as passing stool 10 times a day. You need not worry in any of these.

How much we have to continue???","Doctor":"Hi , I'm Dr Suresh K Yadav M D (paediatrics) ,I have gone through your question and understand your concerns,9.5 kg weight for 18 months child is slightly on lower side. Apart from weight growth  and activities of child are also important. If baby is active and gaining weight regularly (although a bit on lower side) , it is not much reason for concern. Try to give him frequent and energy dense foods to help gain weight.Zerolac was started in March . Is he still having diarrhoea? Zerolac is used for lactose intolerance , most cases of which are transient in nature secondary to temporary lactase deficiency post prolonged diarrhoea , I do not see any reason to continue it for such a long time unless there is permanent lactase deficiency.If we are considering cow's milk allergy or intolerance than also 6 months have passed and a trial of normal milk diet can be given after discussing your doctor.Hope this answers your question.

For better control you need to keep good hydration of skin by using emollients and topical steroids ( if required ) regularly as advised by your doctor. Topical steroids are to be gradually tapered to reduce chances of flair up. Use of soap which causes dryness of skin is to be reduced , better use soaps like tedibar. Hope this answers your question.

Passing hard motion is very common i children as they are weaning, mostly take milk and very little of water and vegetables.This indeed is a very painful condition.You can apply Vaseline at the anal canal and push a bit inside. This will act as lubricant and smooth passage of stools. Apply this for three to four times a day even if not passing motion for a few days. You can also administer pediatric glycerin pessary half an hour before his usual time of passing motion. Apply Anovate ointment at anal passage - once after passage of motion (after cleaning the child) and once at night.Continue to try adding fluids, vegetables and fruits to the diet and increase its amount regularly, as advised by your current doctor.

The pain in the abdomen is likely to be muscular and your excessive weight could be contributing to it. I would also suggest you see your general physician for an evaluation of the depression.

He has 2 issues. First one, he has been having constipation and difficulty with his stool for a few years, pretty much since he was fully toilet trained at 3.5 yrs. We have been to the Gp a few times, plus a paedritrician twice, and everyone keeps telling us he just needs more fibre in his diet. But i think its more than that, as the stool he does is way bigger than a little kid like him should produce, and he only goes on average every 5-7 days, even up to 10 days when really bad. He eats a fair amount of fruit and vegie and drinks about 6-7 cups of watered down juice and milk each day. Second problem, he seems to have nose bleeds quite easily, has had 2 in the last 24 hrs.

I would also suggest him syrup zinc for 14 days which helps to recover early.4. If the rash is itchy, I would suggest you to give your baby cetirizine for 3 days.

MCT means \\"medium-chain-triglycerides\\". Commercial MCT oil is available which can be added in a small dose of 1-3 drops with each milk feed.

Dr told us that she was suffering from bronchitis.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would make suggestions for her as follows:1. If she gets fever and cough-cold every 20 days, I would suspect one of the following:a. I would highly recommend you to measure fever by thermometer. If it is more than 101, then only I would think of infections, usually viral.b. If fever is in range of 99-100, cough-cold may not be because of infections, but because of allergic causes.c. I would like to know more about her like - whether she has any other symptoms, whether she has breathing difficulty anytime, whether she has headaches, any problems with urination or stomach, whether her appetite is good, whether her weight is ok or not, etc. These details would help me to think about more possible causes.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, serum total IgE levels, urine routine & microscopic examination. These are basic investigations which would give clues towards possible causes.3. At present, I would suggest her an antihistamine like levocetirizine and a cough syrup for 5 days, I would suggest you to complete course of the antibiotic (Droxile) and to give her paracetamol for fever ONLY if temperature is more than 101.4. I would also suggest her iron syrup and multivitamin supplements including folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin C to maintain hemoglobin around 13-14 g% if it is not so. This will help her improve her immunity. Please consider iron and supplements only after her recovery and after her antibiotics are completed.5. I would suggest her good nutrition - adequate amounts of fluids, diet rich in vitamins & minerals (plenty of green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits and sprouts, etc) which will also improve her immunity.6. In general, I would suggest her to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 36 days old.i am giving him lactozin 1 and breast feeding also but I am worried if I feed him bottle milk then he sleeps for hours but if he is breastfeeded of mine then he sleeps less and feel hungry quickly and urinates more.Doctor what to do? Every one is getting angry not feed bottle milk but if I feed then my baby by no seconds he sleep and stop drinking. Please help me and from last two days he is having gas with peculiar smell,stool once a day but bit tight. Waitting for reply doctor.","Doctor":"Hello madam,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and understand your concern.I would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. In general, I would suggest exclusive breast feeding (nothing but breast feeding, even not water) to baby up to 6 months of age. This is because breast milk helps to build immunity of the baby and protects him from many infections. So I would suggest you to try to shift him on only breast milk as early as possible. You can gradually increase breast feeding and gradually decrease formula.2. It is good sign that with breast feeding, he is urinating more. But if he feels hungry quickly, it means whole breast is not getting empty. I would like to mention here that the first part of breast feeding (foremilk) contains more water and the last part of breast feeding (hindmilk) contains more solids.So at present, he is getting more of watery part from breast feeding. So please make sure that when you breast feed him, whole of the breast is getting emptied first, then only offer the other breast. This will satisfy his appetite.3. To ensure better nutrition for him, I would suggest you to take plenty of fluids during day and a nutritious diet so that he will get nutrients from the breast milk. Please avoid stress and be relaxed while breast feeding as it is very important for milk production and milk let down.4. I would suggest you not to worry about occasional gas and change in bowel habits as it is common during first 4-6 months of life. 5. If still he is not satisfied and not gaining weight over time, then only I would suggest you formula or any feeds other than breast milk as per doctor's guidance.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and solves your query.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your baby the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 10 years old. she is suffering from recurrent cough and cold from very child hood.

From her complaints, I would first think of allergy.

I would suggest her regular montelukast + levocetirizine for at least 28 days.3. Regular steam inhalation which will help in nose blocks.4. I would also suggest her to use salbutamol inhaler when she experiences wheezing or breathing difficulty.5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution to her as much as possible.6.

Cough and colds are common at this age and they are mostly due to viral infections or allergies.So if he does not have fever, I would not suggest you to give him Azee (Azithromycin - an antibiotic, used ONLY for bacterial infections)2. Sinarest contains paracetamol, which is useful for fever. It also contains decongestant, which is useful for blocked nose.As your son does not have fever or nose obstruction at present, I would even not suggest him Sinarest syrup as two of the three ingredients within it are unnecessary for him at present.3. I would suggest him only an expectorant type of cough syrup containing an antihistamine like chlorpheniramine, terbutaline and guanphesin. 4.

Local pain will not persist for so long. But minor abdominal surgeries may cause adhesions and intra-abdominal bands which can cause altered bowel motility and thus lead to vague lower abdominal pain on both sides.

Formula feeds are cow milk based which is difficult for a human child to digest. So I will strongly advocate against formula feeds. Hence I am not commenting on how much lactogen should be given. Breast milk is produced in response to the child's suckling. If the child is more hungry, it will suck more and more breast milk will be produced and the child will automatically get what is needed. If you give formula feeds the hunger would be reduced and hence breast milk production will also come down.

The treatment of such infections is with some antiallergic like levocetirizine. You can give the child montair LC (monteleukast + levocetirizine) for a few days during such episodes.

It has to be greater than 100 to be considered as fever.Fever in children is however very common and most commonly occurs due to viral cause. There can be some amount of lethargy but since you mention that the child is otherwise responding well, there is probably less cause of concern.

The effect is usually short lived lasting for a day or two but may also continue for as long as 5 days. The cause does not need to be treated unless associated with bloody stools. The salt and water lost needs to be replenished by giving ORS frequently. Unless ORS is given adequately, dehydration may occur and would make the condition serious.

This may be preceded and caused by gastric over distention leading to hiccups. This may also be due to dicreased tone of the lower oesophageal opening leading to recurrent regurgitation.I would suggest, you try some changes like putting him to sleep atleast half an hour after his meal, keeping the head end high or putting her to sleep on his left side.If there is no change then I suggest you take a medical consultation and consider taking medicines like proton pump inhibitors to decrease the acidity of the stomach and thus the reflux symptoms.

The information would have been helpful. Nebulisation is expected to give the child relief. The home made alternative would be steam inhalation. Asthalin (salbutamol) inhalater with spacer device will also be helpful. Give ibuprofen only if there is fever and not for any other reason in such a child."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 4 month old.

What should i do?","Doctor":"Fenistil drops contains dimetindene which is an antihistamine/anticholinergic that is used orally and locally as an antiallergic and antipruritic. The most common side effect of such drugs is increased sleepiness. It is normal and not a cause of worry. No problems are expected to occur in case a few extra drops are given.

Antibiotics are ineffective. The fever has to be managed by the use of paracetamol as you have rightly done. 7 ml of P-125 syrup is the right dose for him. Give it to him at at least an interval of 3-4 hours in case fever comes back. You can give sponging with water at room temperature to relieve his fever.

Ponstan (mefenamic acid) is more effective than Nurofen (ibuprofen) but both are good medicines and can be given. Most of the fevers in children of this age is due to viral cause and does not need antibiotics. The medicines that you mentioned are enough for managing the fever.

Most commonly it is due to a viral cause. The cause does not need to be treated and becomes ok in 3-7 days without any treatment. But the loss of salt and water from the body needs to be replenished. ORS has to be given to prevent dehyration. You can give curd or yogurt but avoid milk based products for a week or so. Give him Ondem (ondansetron) syrup to relieve his vomiting.

Please suggest","Doctor":"Your child seems to be suffering from an allergic reaction to the paint, the smell of which is probably still in the air. The hypersensitivity to the material in the paint is causing her respiratory distress and swelling of eyes. Give her calpol only if she has a fever. T-minic is an effective antiallergic but I guess the effect is not staying as she is still continually exposed to the offending agent. She would probably get relief once the smell of the paint dies down. Also wash her face and eyes frequently with plain water and she should get some relief."},{"Patient":"Assalamoalaikum.

It is only not as nutritive as home made food can be. I would simply affirm that your pediatrician has told you the right thing although there is no problem if you give it a few times. Your child needs basically the mashed version of adult food low on spices.

Should I give him a laxative?","Doctor":"Let me assure you that breast milk is the best feed for the baby and with it the baby with not get an infection. Green stool occurs due to rapid transit through the large intestine and is absolutely normal in breast fed babies and you need not worry about it.

They are often associated with wheezing and it does not necessarily mean asthma. Inhalers are likely to be helpful in such a situation. Honey is good and can be given.

It generally has an allergic component. It is not that she is allergic to certain things and hence montair LC (monteleukast + levocetirizine) is being given. It is simply to reduce the allergic reaction of cough. Your doctor has done the right thing. Also give the child steam inhalation.

Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and resolve on their own in 5-10 days. The treatment is supportive. Rather than benadryl, I would suggest giving the child some antiallergic syrup like levocetirizine. Also give him steam inhalation. Water in the form of vapour will reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough and give him relief. Paracetamol can be given for fever if present alongside. You can wait for a few days and see."},{"Patient":"Hello, My 10 year old is complaining of pain and tenderness in his testicles. Please advise if this is something serious that requires a doctors visit, or it may be growing pains? I m sure that when the testicles drop it hurts and this may be the cause, but I m not sure how to treat it.","Doctor":"Growing pain does not involve testicles. Pain in testicles can occur due to a number of non-serious causes but there is a serious condition called torsion of testis which needs immediate attention. Please visit a doctor and get it examined at the earliest. A T-bandage would give him relief."},{"Patient":"I have an 8 year old little girl. She started out with a sneezing attack so severe we went to the ER. She was sneezing back to back - 400 sneezes in an hour.

She has been on Baclofen & now Reglan & her Dr. just added a form of Xanax to the list. We are going on weeks of sleepless nights & stress. Please if you can give us any advice... Thanks so much!! Lost ...","Doctor":"The sneezing and hiccups are indeed due to allergic reaction to some agent present in the apartment. Even though you have moved away from the apartment, some trigger might still be present. Identifying that might be really difficult. Fatigue of the diaphragm cannot occur as otherwise her respiration has to stop which is not the case. The doctor suspects gastro oesophageal reflux rightly and has given reglan. You can add liofen to the regimen. I would also suggest adding montair LC (monteleukast + levocetirizine) tablet once a day. Xanax (alprazolam) will help her sleep and I strongly suggest you take the same."},{"Patient":"my son is 8 years old and currently has a fever of 102.6. The only other symptom is a headache.

Read and understood your problems.Cramps - pain - hot flashes - numbness of both legs when you lie down - and low back ache - crusts on nipples... All these symptoms taken together can be due to intestinal infection or intestinal obstruction causing all the other associated symptoms. I would suggest you the following:Clinical evaluation and actual physical examination by a General Surgeon or a Gastroenterologist. Enteroclysis- meaning barium studies under direct fluroscopy control.CT scan of the abdomen. Routine tests of the blood, urine and stool. The final reports will give an idea and if obstruction you may need Diagnostic Laparoscopy and procedures as needed. If a Medical problem like Tuberculosis or Typhoid. You will also need additional investigations for other symptoms like leg pains and treatment."},{"Patient":"I am having laparoscopic surgery on 3/28 to remove a mirena IUD which has lodged somewhere on my left side behind my uterus. The CT scan used to locate the IUD also revealed a small ovarian cyst and I was told my appendix is slightly inflamed and may be removed during the procedure. My question: what is slightly inflamed and does it usually clear up on its own?","Doctor":"Hi Jen, Thanks for writing in. An inflamed appendix means that this is redder and bigger than usual and is swollen. It may or may not clear on its own. The best assessment can be done only on the operating table once the appendix is seen. Usually, if there is a sign that this appendix can get obstructed, then the appendix is removed as it does not subserve any important function in the body. Wishing you the very best for your surgery.

She s been quite snotty sneezing and coughing this past week also been sick sleeping a lot aswell what do you think is the cause if this?","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Rashes over body along with other symptoms like sneezing, running nose, cough etc. most probably indicate a viral infection. Most of the viral infections can present with mild rashes similar to the description that you have given. In such cases, nothing needs to be done except application of calamine lotion over the rashes and any antihistaminic drug (for itchy rashes) if required.It may also be due to other relatively rare causes. In any case, I would advise you to keep a watch on the progression of the rash. Any increase in size or area of distribution, swelling, discharge or any new or associated symptoms like high grade fever , toxic look, behavioral changes, decreased urine output, swelling in any part of the body should be reported and dealt with immediately.

Oh baby was birn 3 weeks premature. Will appreciate your professional insight. Trish","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Spasms or abdominal colic is a very common and near normal occurance in newborns. It occurs due to the air that is ingested along with the milk. Hypospasmal syrup that you have mentioned is never routinely prescribed in children, let alone newborns. Colic is a very benign condition and usually decreases as the child grows. Measures that could be used include strict burping after every feed and anticolic drugs containing simethicone. Hypospasmal is not indicated.Also, in breasted babies, passing stools upto 20 times a day is considered normal hence nothing needs to be done for the same.If you have any more doubts, do write back."},{"Patient":"Hi...I ve just been prescribed flucloxacillin for my 1 year old who has matitis(bad spelling)I m just wondering is it supposed to have that horrendus taste,I thought something was wrong with it,it s that bad,I tasted it with my tongue and couldn t get rid off the taste from my mouth,is it supposed to be like this???","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question. You are absolutely right about the taste of flucloxacillin. It is one of the 'worst to taste' oral antibiotics.

Manoj Rai (0000 )","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.It is very difficult to comment with such a little information as muscular dystrophies are a group of unrelated diseases, each transmitted by a different genetic trait. Most likely your child is suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy which is transmitted as X-linked recessive trait  , most likely inherited from your wife ( carrier for disease)  and in that case there are 50 percent chances of your children affected ( male having disease and female being a carrier ). On a positive side there is 50 percent chances  of having a normal baby , but chances are like head and tail , although chances are 50 percent of coming head or tail , but any can come any number of times.So I suggest you to  get  proper genetic counseling and diagnosis of disease with full family history to reach a conclusion and then make an informed decision.If planning for next pregnancy prenatal diagnosis is possible as early as the 12th wk of gestation by sampling chorionic villi for DNA analysis by Southern blot or PCR , decision to abort fetus can be taken if affected.Hope this answers your question.

He is not having food properly except milk. Our doctor prescribed Zincovit Syrup(5ml per day). Please provide your solution. Also, please let us know if we need to give any medicine for intestinal worms or any other worms that may present in his stomach.","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Low appetite is a common and overrated problem in children. First of all what needs to be known is whether actually your child does not eat well or is it just that your child does not eat as much as you expect him to. To know this you need to study the weight and height patterns of your child. If he comes in the normal range for his weight and height for age and there has been no dip in the same, you could relax knowing that your child is eating as much as his body needs in order to remain active and healthy. If there has been a fall in his weight or height, then you probably need to do something about it. You could introduce home made food for your child and make sure it suits his palate. Trial and error would help you know what is it that your child likes to eat. Prabably a change in the consistency of the food may make it more comfortable for him to finish his meals. Multivitamin supplements like zincovit it may help as they might have mild appetite stimulating effect along with supplementation of deficient vitamins.Deworming may be done every 6 monthly and a single night time dose of drugs like ablendazole may be used. If nothing works, then there are appetite stimulating drugs which are under trial but I suggest you keep that as the last option as they are not commonly prescribed in children and are better avoided.Along with the above mentioned methods, patience and regular monitoring of weight and height would definitely help you to deal with this.Wishing you all the best, if you have any more doubts do write back."},{"Patient":"My seven year old developed red, sore feet yesterday after a field day event (2-3 hours while soaking wet including shoes) and then changed in the girls room without her shoes on.

I do not believe he fell or anything I have been with him for 2 days prior to that he was in kindergarten. It feels like there is a ridge on his head and also the front of his head in the center an indentation. He is sleeping now.","Doctor":"Hi...headache is a dangerous symptom only if associated with other red flags like vomiting, neck pain, altered sensorium, seizures, incoherent behavior or double vision or fever or focal or generalized weakness in the body parts.

The orthopedic doctor had an MRI done at that time and it came back clear. After about a month and half and her going back to play soccer, it was not getting better and she started seeing a physical therapist. She has been seeing him once every 2 weeks for 6-8 weeks. He is now at a loss because it is not getting better with the strengthen stretches, ice and ibuprofen he has given her. She is now back on crutches and in a full leg brace to keep it from moving. Her knee is swollen and her pain is in a horse shoe shape around the bottom of her knee. I am not sure what the next step should be?","Doctor":"Hi...I feel it could be a internal ligament sprain or tear... Either anterior or posterior ligament... Early MRI might not have picked up, but a repeat MRI might help along with 3D reconstruction imaging...

This seems like a hand foot mouth disease. It's a self limiting viral infection. Don't worry. At times it can be inrensely itchy.... Apart from that rarely it can cause skin peeling of fingers and toes around 4-6 weeks later. For itching you can use age appropriate antiallergics as you have not mentioned her age or weight.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter how to temperature yesterday afternoon and then vomited once it has been 24 hours about 24 hours and she vomited and 4 hours ago her temperature was 97 point 6 and currently it is 98. 7 so should I allow her to have milk milk or how should I handle her diet diet","Doctor":"For a child with fever, you can give the child simply normal diet or anything that the child can tolerate. The diet should contain more of proteins as our body is made of proteins and the healing and repair process requires resources. MEat, fish and eggs contain proteins. Spinach, pulses, soya etc. are vegetable sources of proteins. If she is vomiting, be sure to give ORS alongwith. It is better to leave out milk for a week or so but if she can tolerate it, there are no issues.

I was using mixed....because im working for now i feed her with nan pro one...do i need to continue the milk?doc is it true that much prefer to use milk which can help to develop the brain?","Doctor":"At 6 months of age, it is already time for weaning. It is basically a transition to the adult diet. At this age milk is simply not adequate to meet the nutritive requirements of the body for which semi solids need to be introduced. If you give milk, it is just an optional element and you can give any milk that the child can tolerate. NAN pro 1 is for children below 6 months. You may give NAN 2. Rather, give any sort of adult food low on spices in a mashed up form. Give a boiled rice based diet. Add pulses and vegetables to it. You can also add chicken or eggs in mashed form. You can give fruits in grated form. No need to boil fruits if they can be otherwise converted to semi solid form. Instead of formula feeds, these are more nutritive and should be given. I hope that these will help the baby gain weight. For brain development, omega 3 fatty acids play an important role. These are found in sea fishes. I would prefer those rather than opting for supplements."},{"Patient":"my 2 year old just had a mustard brown colored stool.

Over the last year or so I m feeling the same type of pain I had before the repair. Burning pain and now a new sensation, a crawling/fluttering feeling over the insicion area. There is stiffness and pain around that area, mesh was used to fix the hernia. My doctor said CT scan showed no hernia reoccurrence. Could I be having mesh reaction? Would CT show this? No pain in the morning, but starts once I start eating and unbearable by mid afternoon. Worse when i sit for long periods at work. Even worse if I have gas/ bloating . What can be done? Naproxen, lidoderm patches don t help.","Doctor":"Did you undergo an open incisional hernia repair or a laparoscopic one? If you had a laparoscopic repair, then the tacks used to fix the mesh can sometimes lead to the symptoms you are complaining of. In open repair, extensive dissection is done and that can lead to this feeling as well. These complaints will settle down with time. If you are overweight, then try to reduce a couple of kg's and you will feel better. You have already been assured by getting a CT done that it is not a recurrence. Another possibility could be gastritis or an peptic ulcer. You can try a proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole, etc) for your pain and see if it helps you out. If the pain still persists, then you should consult your doctor.

She has not had a bowel movement since Saturday (when she had two big ones). Before Saturday, she was having one normal sized bowel movement a day. She is still eating normally, and is not spitting up any more than normal or vomitting. She does not have a fever. My husband and I have tried the leg exercises, tummy massage, rectal stimulation, warm baths, and Karo syrup in her expressed breast milk (on the advice of the nurse at our pediatrician s office). Nothing seems to be working. She is breastfed, but does get 2-4 ounces of Enfamil Premium Lipil formula a day. She is passing very smelly gas, but not without a lot of grunting and straining. Should I be worried? Is there anything else I can do to help her go?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. For an infant of this age, passing stool 10 times a day is as normal as passing stool once in 10 days. In either case, you need not worry unless the stool is hard/constipated. If the child is eating well, there is nothing to worry. No need of the measures you are taking. Only in case of constipation, I would recommend use of glycerine suppository which will make the child pass stool.Gas indicates bacterial overgrowth in intestines which occurs when there is undigested carbohydrate matter present and degraded by the bacteria. Formula feeds are hard to digest and probably responsible for this.Breast milk is the best food for a baby. The production of breast milk is triggered by the suckling of the baby on the mother's breast. If the baby gets external feeds, the hunger of the baby comes down and the baby suckles less. So the breast milk production automatically comes down. I would insist you to keep this in consideration and to go for breast feeding as far as feasible. You can give expressed breast milk if required."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Is this consider constipation?","Doctor":"Passing stool 10 times a day is equally normal as passing stool once in 10 days for a child of this age. You may relax and need not worry about that. Unless the stool is hard and pellet like, you need not consider it as constipation. No additional methods required. Continue breast feeding the baby or give top feeds in case feed supplementation is being done."},{"Patient":"My ten year old son has a possible poison ivy rash above and below his eye.

Some points that would favour it being viral is normal behavior in between fever spikes, presence of running nose or associated diarrhea etc. In such cases an antibiotic like azithromycin is usually not indicated.However, for the treatment of such conditions proper control of fever and symptomatic relief is all that is needed along with patience and monitoring of symptoms.In case you have started the course of azithromycin, completion of atleast 3 days of the drug would be recommended. As the cough is relieved by levolin, I suggest you continue that along with other home made remedies like honey, ginger or warm water or milk with turmeric to sooth the throat. For the cold you could use any antihistaminic drug like cetrize or chlorpheniramine. You could also use normal saline nasal drops for nasal block due to dried secretions or apply agents like Vicks to the night clothes or bedding.Apart from this keep a watch for decrease in general activity, urine output, respirations(whether very fast of with efforts) etc. and consult a doctor immediately if present.If you have any more doubts, do write back."},{"Patient":"hi, my daughter is 3 yrs old.

The best treatment for such cases is Oral rehydration therapy as dehydration is the major threat. ORS salts are available over the counter. Keep drinking ORS at frequent intervals. However if it does not subside within 2-3 days I suggest you visit your physician for medication and have a stool microscopy and culture done to determine the exact cause."},{"Patient":"My 13 year old granddaughter has been having memory loss---forgetting words, can t make a complete sentence, has missed place things,walks with a bit of a limp .

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

It is true that foracort inhaler contains steroid. Inhaled steroid has been proved to be very safe in children and adults even if they are used for years together; it is used as a preventive therapy for asthma. Your doctor can take everything as food including ice cream, chocolate, sweets and cold water; she can play normally and can go to school provided you child uses foracort inhaler daily regularly. In about 80% of children childhood asthma clears of at the age of 8-10 years. Hence you need not have concern. However it would be preferable if your child is evaluated by a pulmonologist (specialist in lung diseases ) who will do certain simple investigations such as peak flowmetry, spirometry which will help in correct diagnosis and correct treatment of asthma."},{"Patient":"Hi!

Wax formation is normal protective mechanism for ear , it need not bee removed unless there is hearing problem or ear needs to be examined .Crying at touching of ear indicates otitis externa ( infection) which needs a course of antibiotic to resolve. In absence of obvious cold symptoms like running nose or cough it is unlikely to be due to cold . Augmentin is not required for treatment of wax, prescribing augmentin indicates that ENT doctor has kept the possibility of otitis externa .

I am a waitress by trade and gave it up a few years back because I was so weak and the headaches were that severe. I never fully understood how my health seemed to have improved the past few years some because now I tend bar and work in second hand smoke . I have had some down time but not like in the past. The past several months I have learned on my own not by a doctor that I severly reacted to anchovie paste that was used in a recipe made by a friend. I have eaten ceasar salad for as long as I can remember. I then had an experience with scollops more body pain and some thoat pain. But before the Christmas Holiday I had a few calamari and then I knew i was on track to all of my unexplained health. My throat closed so bad but I felt like someone had kick bocked my chest and could not expand it at all and get air. I have had this before but not this bad and never fully understanding why it happens. Five weeks back it was a haddock dinner at a local restaurant that had just opened. My throat felt like I had thyroiditis for weeks. I did loose my voice some etc.. I am afraid and will seek medical help eventually. At the moment I am just so mad that it took this long for me or anyone to put together. There is not a specialist I have not seen. I am 54 and it all started at age 39 which is the age I went back to work. Never did I see this connection until recently. When we started to sell Lobster and Steamers I went out of work and thought my symptoms getting much worse had to do with this. I went to an allergist who told me that I was developing a sensitivity but focused on celiac disease and that road ended when my GI doctor ruled it out. I now have seveve ischemic colitis and have been kept overnight in hospital for blood pressure dropping low and another time for intestnal bleeding. My questions are these. Will this heal. I cannot sit for any period of time because of my intestines and cannot lift much because of all that feels damaged inside most days. I have recently talked with a woman who watched what I went through recently and she explained she was in the Islands when she almost went into shock. She had seen prior the same allergist that I had gone to before. Can allergies to seafood and shellfish be trickey to catch??????? I was working long shifts just to keep moving because nothing in my body seems to function good if I stay idle. How much did my working in a restaurant have to do with this getting this bad. It all started many years back with a red face, neck and ears. Always around 3 in the afternoon. Then came the unexplained rash and they focused on detergent. Then I was rushed in and told my appendix but the hospital record shows them circuling they were normal. When I kept going back with the same repeated symptoms stating it is the same pain as before the appendix he yelled I only had one. I said I knew. He moved to Florida shortly after and I have lived years very sick. I had also moved at this time and four restaurants across the street that sold seafood. This is when I was originally sent to be tested for MS the first time. Major swelling, headaches, and no feflex response on left side. It was August and windows open and we thought heat being a trigger. Long road but faith. Will I heal?????? How much plays in to my health failing working and living near seafood restaurants?????????? Thanks and so sorry about the length.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. I would like to reassure you that ischemic colitis is something which can be taken care of to a very large extent. However, the exact course can be determined by actually assessing the severity of the disease. As far as your allergies are concerned, seafood and shellfish allergies are some of the most common ones. It is surprising you weren't diagnosed with this before. This can not only occur when you ingest sea food but can also occur when you inhale the protein when it is being cooked. I would suggest you stay away from the seafood restaurant and you should be good.

Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Meftal P can be given, if prescribed, in doses of 5 ml every 8 hour, but if there is possibility of viral fever with warning signs like poor oral acceptance or pain in abdomen, rashes over body, and dull look then it is better and safe to use paracetamol only.Better option will be to use paracetamol only (calpol), and do tepid sponging of whole body to bring down fever, and use Meftal P only after consulting your doctor.You need to consult your doctor earliest if there is presence of warning signs.DISCLAIMER: - All the information provided here is for information purpose only, it is not a substitute for the advice of a physician after physical examination, it is not intended to replace your relationship with your doctor.This information in no way establishes a doctor-patient relationship.

Alkasol is an urine alkalinising agent used in urinary tract infections(UTI) mainly to decrease the pain and discomfort during urination and it has no effect on other symptoms of UTI like fever. The dose of 22ml that your have mentioned is the adult dosage and is not recommended in children especially infants.This drug is not routinely recommended in children and if given then a dosage of around 2 ml in water is given. But I would suggest that you avoid using this drug unless indicated or prescribed by your child's pediatrician. UTI in an infant first needs to be confirmed by urine culture and then managed with appropriate antibiotics and plenty of oral fluids. Alkalinising agents are usually not prescribed. For the fever I suggest you continue using any paracetamol preperation with proper measurement of temperature.If you have any more doubts do write back."},{"Patient":"3 year old has very strong urine when he sometimes wets bed at night....doesn t seem to be so strong during the day....not overly thirsty.

Such concentration of urine is likely to occur due to prolonged periods without water intake. In normal circumstances such urine is found in all individuals towards early morning. Thus this finding of yours is most likely to be normal.Diabetes mellitus would present with increased urine frequency, increased thirst, increased hunger, loss of weight etc. If none of these are seen in your child, it is very unlikely that he would have the disease.

I would love to know if this is something I should be concerned about! Thank you in advance! Liz","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your question.Difficulty in taking long breath, could be interpreted in two ways. One, where there is true shortness of breath and the other where taking long breaths in painful leading to apparent shortness of breath. True shortness could be due to affection of any part of the respiratory tract from the nose the the lungs. It could also be caused by affection of other systems like liver, kidneys or rarely brain.Apparent shortness could be due to injury to the rib cage, muscular pain or rarely affection of the pleura i.e. the surrounding layer of the lung.In order to find out what the exact cause is, the associated symptoms, origin duration and type of breathlessness needs to be studied.The intention of the above mentioned list is not to scare you, but to reinforce the fact that if your child has shortness of breath then you need a medical consultation. It is also to suggest that if your child does not have any other symptoms apart from the shortness, then it is unlikely to be due to any organic or serious cause.

I was a lot of poop but it is now Sunday and no poop.what should i do?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. Brownish stool is normal and not a cause of concern. For an infant of this age, passing stool 10 times a day is as normal as passing stool once in 10 days. In either case, you need not worry unless the stool is hard/constipated. If the child is eating well, there is nothing to worry. No need of the measures you are taking. Only in case of constipation, I would recommend use of glycerine suppository which will make the child pass stool.Formula feeds are hard to digest and probably responsible for the nature of her stool. Breast milk is the best food for a baby. Try to give as much of it as you can."},{"Patient":"Hi, i am 27 years old and i have been experiencing lower right abdominal pain for about half a year. The pain is constant and it becomes worse after i have any form of bowel movement or bending movements. I did an ultrasound scan and nothing wrong was found with my reproductive organs. Subsequently, i saw a colorectal specialist who initially thought that my constipation problem is causing the pain. However, after being on mild laxatives for 3 weeks, the pain did not improve of go away. The doctor says he is unsure of what is wrong with me. I have also sought help alternatively from Traditional Chinese Medicine who has diagnosed me with Chronic Appendicitis . Basically, he identified this condition by first pressing on the lower right quadrant of my abdomen (where the pain is). After which, he lifted up my right leg and pressed on the same spot again and that set me off into a yelping pain in which i literally jumped up a little from the bed. Hence, i will like to seek other opinions as to what can be causing this constant lower right abdominal pain. Is it indeed a condition of chronic appendicitis? This is bearing in mind that the pain intensifies after bowel movements or during any bending motions. Thank you very much for your kind help and time.","Doctor":"Hello. There is such a thing as chronic appendicitis. This usually occurs when fecoliths (small rock-hard pieces of stool) get inside the appendix stump and cause inflammation. The pain you described with right leg flexion is characteristic of a \\"psoas sign\\" which helps support this diagnosis. In \\"chronic\\" appendicitis, the omentum (a curtain of fat overlying the gut) will usually start sticking to the inflammed portion of gut, causing more discomfort that can be constant. Alternative diagnosiis would include diverticular disease, irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, or ovarian pathology. The most usefull test in this case would be a Cat-Scan of the abdomen and pelvis with PO/Rectal and maybe IV contrast. If normal, I would then order a colonoscopy. If it is chronic appendicitis, this could be potentially dangerous. It usually responds to a long coarse of antibiotics, which can also be considered empircally if you dont have access to testing."},{"Patient":"my baby is 16months old n she is having loose motions for d past 1 week.....whatever I give to her she pass it out in d form of green stool.....even electrol is not being digested by her.....I m tooo worried abt her....at present I m giving her ornidox nt.....kindly suggest me something better","Doctor":"Most of diarrhoea in children is caused due to a virus called rotavirus. Antibiotics are ineffective in viral infections. All you need to take care of the hydration by giving Electral/ORS so that the salt and water balance is retained. Antibiotics like Ornidox NT can be given if bacterial infection is suspected. It is good and nothing more needs to be given. Complete the full course of 5 days.You may add curd or yogurt to the diet and it would help. Also give Zinconia syrup 5 ml once a day. Zinc has a beneficial role in diarrhoea.Green stool indicates rapid transit through the large intestine without time to change the colour to yellow. It may be seen in diarrhoea and is not a cause of concern."},{"Patient":"Hi. My daughter is 7 years old. I want your suggestion on what Milk should I carry along on a trip involving lots of road travel. Lactogen 3 was an earlier option. Can I give Dairy Whitener or something. ( I should be carrying Hot water along at most times.) Thanks.","Doctor":"For a 7 years old child, no milk is essential although you may give it if you like. For her adult food low on spices is all that she needs. If much of travelling is involved, just give her whatever things that you yourself consume on the way.

Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and resolve spontaneously in 5-10 days. Management is supportive. Giving tylenol should reduce the pain and help. Use lignocaine oral gel over the oral lesions and it will help in relieving the pain. You may give pedicloryl syrup and help the child sleep.

What is d best.suplements can i give to her? pls help me for some advice thanku.!","Doctor":"Breast milk is the best food for a baby upto 6 months of age after which the child needs additional nutrition and hence mashed semi solid food is to be added. Milk becomes an optional food ingredient after 1 year of age provided that adequate nutritive diet is given. At the age of 18 months, the child basically needs a slightly mashed version of adult food low on spices. No need to provide milk or health supplements. Curd or yogurt is helpful. Do not worry about diabetes in a child if the child has proper play habits along with fibre rich diet. Children are picky eaters, so you will have to identify the nutritive food items that the child likes and plan the diet accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello docter, please guide me as i am first time anxious mommy.my girl is 5 months old.since couple of days i have introduced her to amul toned milk.is it advicable and nutritious to her?

Cow milk is difficult to digest and can be regarded optional although you can give it if there is no intolerance. Weaning is supposed to be done at 6 months of age. If breast milk seems inadequate, there is no problem if you start slightly early as the child is already 5 months old. The child needs a mashed up version of adult food low on spices. You can start with rice and pulses boiled together with vegetables and mashed together preferrably using hand (not mixer and grinder). You may also add chicken and eggs in mashed form. Yogurt or curd can be given and is beneficial."},{"Patient":"Hi my son is 18 months old. All of a sudden yesterday morning at 3 he was running temperature of 103.

Sometimes, doctors prefer adding antibiotics like clavam forte to be on the safer side keeping bacterial infection in account. The medicines are proper and you would have to be a bit patient.I do not know if the dose of Sumol DS containing paracetamol is proper. It is to be given at 15 mg/kg/dose.

Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Consulted a doctor and did colonoscopy? It says as multiple ulceration in the colon buy my biopsy report shows as non specific proctitis. Prescribed tabs are mesacol, folic acid , vsl#3 and pantocid? I am not able to discuss briefly to the doctor. Why my colonoscopy and biopsy reports are different? But all these tablets are making me frighten. Is these tabs safe? Any side effects? Can i have it for a month without any confusion? PLEASE ANY DOCTOR SUGGEST ME?","Doctor":"Hai, 1. Proctitis means inflammation/ infection of rectum. Inflammation / infection in rectum can cause ulcers. Ulcers are products of inflammation / infection. Biopsy is what we see in microscope (so we cannot see ulcers in biopsy) and Colonoscopy is what we see in our naked eye (so we cannot see the microscopic changes of inflammation or infection). So your biopsy and colonoscopy reports are not different, rather they are complementing each other. 2. Since your biopsy reported it as Non-specific proctitis, there is no need to worry. 3. Mesacol is a drug given for ulcerative colitis or inflammation of colon/rectum: usually its safe with few side -effects. Pantocid is a drug given to reduce gastric acidity rarely causing any complications. Folic acid, VSL#3 are safe with hardly any side effects.

If your child responds immediately to nebulisation , chances of allergy are very much. Inhalation therapy is the best recommended treatment for such type of illness , also you need to check immunization of your son , apart form routine vaccines he needs yearly flu vaccination.What seems to be lacking is that you are giving only as and when required  treatment , you need to give prophylactic drugs ( Flohale in your case) regularly to control asthma.  Decision to give any kind of medicines is made on risk/benefit analysis , if asthma is hampering child's daily activities it is reasonably safe to take  regular prophylactic inhalation steroids to decrease disease burden.Hope this answers your question.

Giving steam inhalation and some anti allergic like levocetirizine helps.ESR is a non specific indicator of disease process in the body. You need not worry about it.

Any ideas of what it might be?","Doctor":"Hi..by what you quote, I feel that this could be an eczema. The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be dry. For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help. Regarding cure options - eczema is a sort of allergy...allergies can only be controlled and can never be cured. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses.But Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly. I suggest you to upload photographs of the same on this website, so that I can guide you scientifically.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my son is 9 months old turning 10 months in 10 days. He is on formula and some solid food. Since he started some solid food when he was 6 months old, his poop has been more solid, like turd.

Lately during dinner time, he would get fuzzy when I feed him but he would still eat but just seem he doesn t eat as much as he used to. I wonder if he has any intestine or digestive problems? Please help!!!","Doctor":"HI...please do not panic. This could happen form a mild change in his daily food composition too. Consistency of the stool or the colour is not an issue if the kid is his usual self and active and urinating well.

I feel like it may be gas pain but am concerned something may be wrong. All he does is eat and sleep mostly and then when he does cry I feel like it s because he s tired or has stomach pain. I m a first time mom and am nervous something is wrong.","Doctor":"Hi....Nothing wrong with his tummy.This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I had taken Esgipyrin -SP tablets for Burstitis.On the 3rd day i had severe abdominal cramps .I m not sure the medicine has caused this or i had fish in arestaurant the night before.Now i would like to take caourse of O2...

Only thing is palatability which is subjective for each kid. Other home-made food options will be - 1. Daal and rice well cooked and made into a porridge along with ghee2. Boiled apple or banana and mashed into a paste.3. Any made cereal porridge preparation with additional ghee added.Remember certain principles like -1. Add one food material / cereal or fruit per week. This will be useful because if he develops vomiting or diarrhoea, we will know what to avoid.2. Add vegetables and fruits made into a paste surely to avoid constipation.3. Do not add too much sugar as it may cause diarrhoea.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Widal test for my son shows O and H both 160 . the doctors have diagonised his fever with typhoid.He took antibiotics course for 8 days. and he was well and again after 12 days the symtoms reoccurred, with high fever 103 degrees. Is this typhoid relapse. the widal tests again shows same 160 parameters. How many more days does he have to take antibiotics","Doctor":"Hi..usually the treatment for typhoid fever is 14 days. But as he was well for 12 days you need not worry. But the typhoid titers in the Widal test have not become more than 1:160 like 320 or 640. So it is unlikely to be a typhoid. It could be a viral illness as well. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"% year old son banged his head on door, cried a little then went to sleep.

Just looking for another opinion. He is not dizzy and no headache.","Doctor":"HI...vomiting after a head injury in a 5 year old is concerning but as he is not doing it consistently and other wise active , you can wait. I will suggest you the other danger sings you need to look for - 1. Vomiting continuously2. Seizures3. Watery of bloody discharge from ears and nose4. Unconsciousness5. Altered sensorium or behaviour. If none of them are present, I don't think you should worry about his trivial head injury.

Pls advice another antibiotic.","Doctor":"Hi...Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. NO need for antibiotics. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My baby is 2 month old she having loose motion stool like yellowish and spot type and she do pressure while latrin she voice like hmm hmm i check up with doctor he given vizylac and bacigy syrup i wanted to know is this good to cure my baby problems pls ans","Doctor":"HI...this is completely normal fora breast fed baby.

Kindly answer for me","Doctor":"As per your history, your son is probably suffering from Allergic rhinitis & your doctor has appropriately prescribed Monticope (Montelukast + Levocetrizine) for him. Duration of this treatment  is usually 6-8 weeks, then doctor should re-evaluate the response and treat accordingly. An alternative to this treatment is inhalational corticosteroid by inhaler. People are sometimes afraid of inhalers, but no need to worry, it is only a targeted drug delivery method to reduce side effects of drugs. Your next query was what food to avoid. Generally brinjal, egg, prawn, some types of fish, some variety of nuts, milk, soya are common causes of food allergies.

I need some advice, please.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. This is a very common occurrence.The most important part to the story is that your son did not lose consciousness at the time of the fall and that he cried. That essentially clears him of any brain injury. The only other sign to look for is vomiting within the first 24 hours after the fall. As long as this doesn't happen, there is nothing to be concerned about. In the meantime, he may continue with regular activity. If he wants to sleep, he may sleep.

The hallucinations just reinforce the fact that your child needs to be taken to the ER atleast to bring her temperature down as quickly as possible. Though it is quite possible that a virus may cause such possible, other causes like a bacterial infection especially a urinary tract infection should be ruled out. Although such high fever is known to cause delirium and altered sensorium in a few patients, if such behavior continues even after the fever has come down, then a brain infection also needs to be ruled out.If you have any more doubts do write back."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, my name is Bukky I accidentally gave my 7month old baby an overdose of piriton instead of 1ml morning and night I gave him 2.5ml morning and night for 2 days I stopped immediately I realised and now today being the 3day night he is very hot his temperature is high and he has been cranky and not comfortable but I have given him paracetamol 2.5ml just now.","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for asking us.You should not worry at all, this much dosage is not over dosage.

Fever with loose stools in an 11month old baby is most likely due to viral cause. In such a case heavy antibiotics like taxim o are usually not indicated. Also if it is a viral infection then the fever and loose stools usually take 5-7 days to resolve completely. The fact that the fever spike and loose stools have decreased indicates that the infection is slowing getting into control.Apart from the mentioned symptoms, if your child have blood in stool, toxic look, behavior changes like lethargy or irritability then considering antibiotic would be logical.All that needs to be done for now is monitoring of urine output, fever spikes, presence or absence of blood in stool and behavior of your child along with proper maintenance of hydration by giving oral rehydration solution/lemon or any juice with a pinch of salt etc to prevent dehydration."},{"Patient":"I m 19 year old,Male.I had stomach pain on right side from yesterday.its between belly button and rib cage.pain is concentrated at a point,it only occur when i press that portion and there is mild swelling in that portion.I had mild fever from last 6 days(98-99).No nausea or vomiting or other symptom.i m eating normally.pain is not so sharp but mild.What it could be?","Doctor":"There are a number of possibilities 1.

The symptoms of cold/low grade fever/decreased appetite that you have mentioned indicate most probably a low grade viral infection. This should take around 5 days to resolve.The pins and needle sensation that you have mentioned are usually due to partial nerve compression. This commonly could occur in cases where the sleep position might cause mild compression of the nerve to the hand. This is likely to be the case. In this case the sensation should resolve is some time and movement of the hand should be easy and not associated with any pain. Also I suggest that you look for any weakness in the affected limb or increase in/spread of the sensation, in which case a medical consultation would be required.To prevent recurrence ensuring proper sleep position should be enough.

I don't have any idea of your age and you have not provided exact size of the ovary, but let me tell you some facts; in a women of reproductive age ovarian size may vary slightly ( e.g. your left ovary may be carrying a dominant follicle, making the adnexa look swollen). So we cannot diagnose a problem on the basis of findings provided by you. I think you should repeat your ultrasound in 6 weeks to re-assess the size of your adnexa ( combined term for ovary & tubes). This will make everything clear. But anytime you feel sever pain in the abdomen you should go to the hospital. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I slammed the car door on my six year old sons hand earlier.

Cough itself can cause vomiting and nausea. Cough can be due to wheezing too.

You can go ahead.Hope I have answered your query.

I have recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome . I have been having a lot of abdominal pain and severe bloating (but not diarrhea or passing gas) which mainly occurs when I get up in the morning. I have actually watched my flat stomach abruptly inflate and then I have a sharp pain primarily down the center of my abdomen. It eases off if I lie back down again. I regularly have a sharp pain if I cough, sneeze , laugh hard or have a bowel movement. Twice I have had a strange episode where I have sudden pain and stiffness in my groin area, accompanied by sharp abdominal pain.(Both time were during my period - the sharp pain was not like menstrual cramps). In the last 5 months I have had two CT scans, a colonoscopy, a pelvic ultrasound, a gall bladder ultrasound, lots of blood tests and two stool tests. All that has turned up is that I have a slight vitamin D deficiency, a small umbilical hernia (probably from having my tubes tied) and endometrial hyperplasia (probably from my fibroid - not considered serious). I am taking 150 mg of Lyrica per day (gradually increasing to 300mg), am 47 yrs old, female, 207 lbs on a protein diet (protein shakes, 1 meal/ day meat and vegetables) recommended by my gastro-enterologist. I can t go back to work with this unpredictable, on-going abdominal pain. Taking an anti-spasmodic did not help.

And is she allergic to wheat?","Doctor":"Hi...according to the WHO (World Health Organization) the best way to feed any baby till 6 months of age is 100% exclusive breast feeding till 6 months of age. The gut will be too tender before that in some babies and will not tolerate cereal proteins like wheat and rice.The rash you have mentioned could as well be an allergic one to wheat.Stop all cereal proteins will 6 months of age and feed her only breast milk till then.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"an 8 month old baby is suffering from blood infection accompanied by high fever and loose mitions. his TRP level turned out to be 27 instead of d usual 6. he looks physically weak though active otherwise. he was given injections through drip. pls suggest treatment.","Doctor":"Hi...it can as well be a viral diarrhea. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

First week breast feeding was good enough for him however from last couple of days it has reduced a lot. Hence we started feeding lactogen but he vomits it out very frequently. What we are supposed to do to ensure he is being feed properly?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. Breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. Lactogen or any other formula, is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. So, in such a condition, the baby often vomits it out. Try not to go for formula feeds and go for breast feeding as far as you can. You may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. In case of breast feeding, insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the baby's mouth. Feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. Breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. In case of formula feeding, the hunger of the baby is reduced and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. So, reduce formula feeds as far as you can. The adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. Passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate.Hope that helps. Feel free to revert back with further queries if any."},{"Patient":"hello docter, my wife meet an operation for our new born baby, after ten day she feels less milk for her new born so ples suggest how can she increase her milk for new born for sufficient feeding. our docter said that no milk n milk product can be take by mother due to her operation n after 1 month she will use milk. i give her all types of green veg n whole grains but there is no sign of satisfactory result.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. Breast milk is the best food for a baby and is produced on the demand of the baby. With hunger, as the baby suckles more, more breast milk is produced. The adequacy of breast milk would be expressed by the number of times urine is passed. At least 5-6 episodes of passing urine in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. Do not give any supplemental feeds as it is going to reduce the hunger and hence reduce the amount of breast milk further.Giving lactonic granules 1 sachet twice daily with a glass of milk to the mother should increase the amount of breast milk produced. Giving medicines like reglan tablets for a few days may also help."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My daughter is having vomiting for past 6 days. Doctor gave domstac & emeset injection. still she is having vomiting & she is not having any food. Could you please tell me what may be the reason for vomiting???? What food can be given to her to avoid dehydration.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. Unfortunately you have not mentioned the age and weight of your child which would have significance in determining the cause of vomiting. The cause of vomiting in a newborn is likely to be different from that in a child of 1 year of age. Moreover, the dietary habits are also important. Vomiting is more likely in case of a formula fed infant than that of an exclusively breast fed infant.ORS should be given to a child in order to balance the salt and water lost through vomiting. In case the child is breast fed, breast feeding should be continued and given more rather than giving ORS. Emiset or domstal are supposed to reduce the frequency of vomiting. If the child is not well, often the child does not feed well.Blood should be tested to see if the CRP is elevated and if so, the child may require to be hospitalised.Frequency of urine will indicate if there is dehydration. In case of dehydration, frequency of urine will come down and indicate that intervention is required.Hope that helps. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any"},{"Patient":"i m feeling pain in my lower AAAAAAA i sleep alot i eat plenty i have itch over my breast and my teeth hurts whats wrong","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query. At the outset your complaints seem to be unconnected. Lower abdominal pain can occur due to a urinary tract infection or in women pelvic inflammation. You can do a urine microscopy to rule out infection. Drink plenty of fluids. Check the skin over your breasts. Is there any rash or swelling? If there is a rash, you can try applying an antifungal skin cream. If there is any swelling it is best to see a doctor who will examine the swelling and decide if it needs to be further evaluated with tests like mammogram or ultrasound. Bad dental hygiene or gum inflammation can lead to toothache. For relief of pain you can take some over-the-counter pain killer, but get tested by a dentist to rule out cavities that need to be treated. Take a diet rich in Vitamin C by including plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"hi doc, my baby boy is now 8 days old. he got severe jaundice reaching at 31.

When the level of bilirubin in blood rises beyond a certain amount, there are possibilities of its deposition in the brain, a condition called kernicterus. In such a case, brain function may be affected and hence the doctor has rightly pointed out that in your case a follow up with an MRI and hearing test would be required. The fact that the bilirubin level has come down is good and unless it starts rising again, further interventions would not be required. You need not grow anxious at the moment. Relax.Hope that helps.

Every day she stooling 6 or 7 times . We did not go any doctor. Is it dangerous situation and need to go doctor immediately ?","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on HealthCareMagic. Let me address the issues one by one. Breast milk is the best food for a baby and there can be no alternatives to that. Formula milk like lactogen are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for a baby. It may lead to greenish stools. But reddish is not normal and you should get the stool tested for routine microscopy and occult blood. Passing stool 10 times a day is equally normal as passing stool once in 10 days and you need not bother about it unless the stool is very hard.Lactogen 3 is unsuitable for a baby of this age and can be given only after 1 year of age. So stop giving it.I would like to ask what do you mean by 'normal food'. A baby is supposed to receive only breast milk and nothing else till the age of 6 months. In case breast milk is inadequate, supplementation with formula milk can be given but that should be age appropriate.Although it is not a dangerous situation, it needs to be managed properly and you need to get guidance on this from a pediatrician. Visit a doctor with the stool report or post a query directly to me with the report and I would try to help you further."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Thank you!","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand the cause of your concern and have gone through the details carefully. Your daughter seems to have acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. It generally occurs when some preformed bacterial toxin enters the body through some food item. It generally resolves on its own in a few days and the cause does not need to be treated. But the loss of salt and water from body may cause dehydration which needs to be managed with priority. Give her frequent sips of ORS. You may give Ondem MD (ondansetron mouth dissolving) tablet 15-30 mins before taking food and that will reduce the throwing up. Giving curd/yogurt could be helpful.Gurgle with lukewarm water will give her throat some relief. It is probably caused due to erosion caused due the gastric acids during her throwing up.She may skip her school for a day or two till she is stable enough to attend her classes.I hope that helps.

Formula milk like similar are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for a baby and could cause greenish stools whereas isomil is a hydrolysed formula and easy to digest. If your doctor assumes the cause of diarrhoea to be lactose intolerance or intolerance to milk, it would be better to go for isomil. It is safe and you need not worry about it, it is just not as tasty for the baby.I hope that helps. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any."},{"Patient":"Hello.

He is now dry heaving. please help... what else could this be?","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand the cause of your concern and have gone through the details carefully. I would give you some suggestions. Try to follow them.1. Give the child rice based diet. Avoid any wheat based product altogether. The abdominal complications could be result of a condition called coeliac disease. Try this for a few weeks and see if the child gets relief.2. Avoid milk based products. Curd or yogurt can be given. Lactose intolerance could also be a cause.3. You may give decolic syrup SOS in order to relieve abdominal pain as and when it occurs.4. Constipation needs to be kept in control. Increasing fibre content of food is a must. Include green leafy vegetables in the diet. Fibre supplements like isabgol can be given on regular basis. Greenish stools indicate rapid transit through the large intestines and is not a cause of concern.5. Using lactulose syrup (available in brands like livoluk, duphalac) will help in keeping the stool soft.I hope that helps.

I have gone through the details carefully and do not think that it is a cause of your concern. You may relax. Probably the child was crying because he was not prepared for the sudden situation. Even if the child has ingested a bit of water (if any), all that can happen is some amount of diarrhoea or vomiting. In case it happens, you need to manage it using ORS. I do not see any other major issue. Do not be bothered by jargon like dry 'drowning' or 'delayed drowning'. I do not think that this can be the situation in the case of your child.

Breast milk is the best food for a baby and there can be no alternatives to that. Let me ask you what made you feel that the breast feeds are not adequate? The adequacy of the feeds can be judged by the number of episodes urine is passed. If the baby passes urine at leat 5-10 times in 24 hours, you would know that feeding is adequate. Moreover, the amount of breast milk produced depends upon the hunger of the baby. If the feeding is inadequate, the baby will suckle more and more breast milk would be produced. If supplemental feeds are given, the hunger of the child would decrease and the child will suckle less and thereby the amount of breast milk produced would drop further. I strongly suggest that you switch back to exclusive breast feeding if possible.Most of the formula milk are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. Top feeding is also a source of external infection and may give rise to diarrhoea as in your case, although diarrhoea could also result from intolerance to cow milk.Continue the medicines for the prescribed duration. Continue breast feeding. No more interventions required. Things should be fine in no time.I hope that helps.

All you need to do is to prevent dehyration by the use of ORS.It is not clear whether the white pieces that you refer to are worms or undigested food matter. The latter is more probable. However, worms are quite common in children of this age as they have a tendency of putting anything in their moutn. In case you think that he could have worms could be present. Giving a single dose of albendazole 400 mg syrup (10 ml) and repeating it after 14 days should be helpful.I hope that helps. Feel free to revert back with further queries if any."},{"Patient":"Hello, so i was cleaning my sons ear tonight with wet q-tips and of course there was a lot of build up because he doesnt let me clean them often maybe once. A month or two, but as i was cleaning i happen to see pink spots on the q-tip (blood) immediately stopped! Should i be concerned? Should i take him to the doc?","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on healthcaremagic. Ear wax is a substance produced by the ear canal and helps in keeping it lubricated. It comes out on its own and you need not clear it periodically unless there are specific problems. Certain drops like Ceruklean can be helpful if required. While cleaning you might have inadvertently caused some injury and it would be better to get it examined by a ENT doctor.Hope that answers your query. Feel free to revert back with further queries if any."},{"Patient":"my daughter will be 4 in may and she has been getting frequent coughs and colds and she has been getting treatment by being given antibitics.It subsides for a few weeks and we are back to squre one.What is worrying me is because at night her nose gets really congested that she has to breath through her mouth so she ends up snoring and she kind of holds her breath for a few seconds then she starts breathing again.I feel she is suffering alot.At the moment she is on treatment on antibiotics since she developed a runny nose with yellow discharge and fever.Am thinking that after clearing her antibitic dose i take her back to be reviewed again.","Doctor":"Many children have a tendency to catch cold easily. Runny nose is an expression of allergic reaction which is associated with cold. Generally these are due to viral infections. Sore throats are due to acute tonsillitis and often can be cause of the snoring, not due to the nasal block itself. Generally tonsillitis regresses with age. It does not require surgery unless:1. The episodes of sore throat are disabling and prevent normal functioning.2. Seven or more well-documented, clinically significant, adequately treated sore throats in the preceding year; or3. Five or more such episodes in each of the preceding two years; orThree or more such episodes in each of the preceding three years.Get her reviewed if her condition matches the above criteria. A six-month period of watchful waiting is appropriate if the conditions do not match exactly.Antibiotics may or may not be required. Taking some antiallergic like levocetirizine should help. Nasal decongestants like Nasivion drops may be used. Gurgle with lukewarm water would give her some relief.I hope that helps. Feel free to revert back with further queries if any."},{"Patient":"My 13 month old has HFMD. I was told by the dr that we have to wait it out. Tonight he was beyond miserable due to his mouth sores. I have never heard him cry like this. In desperation I tried the magic mouthwash; mixing 1/2 tsp of mylanta and 1/2 tsp of children s Benadryl. In an attempt to get him to swish it around he swallowed it...is he going to be ok? Should I take him to urgent care? I am worried.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Hand, foot and mouth disease is a a common and highly contagious viral infection caused by Coxsackievirus A16 or Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and is characterised by painful mouth sores. So it is natural for your child to cry like hell.There is no harm if the child swallows Mylanta and you need not worry about it. All that can happen is that the child may feel sleepy for sometime.Currently, there is no specific curative treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease. Disease management typically focuses on achieving symptomatic relief. Pain from the sores may be eased with the use of analgesic medications. Infection is typically mild and lasts approximately 1 week, but may occasionally run a longer course. Fever reducers like paracetamol and lukewarm baths can help decrease body temperature. It is a self containing disease and corrects on its own but with time.Hope that I have been able to clarify the matter. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any."},{"Patient":"hello sir my 16 months old baby boy getting cold cough and fever and loose motions from last 7 days i am giving calfstop ,s mucolite and crocin syrup but it is not recovering so is it cerious condition? then what should i do if yes or what to do if not","Doctor":"Cough and cold are common in children of this age and are cause due to certain viruses. Generally these are not a cause of concern as these are self containing conditions and resolve in 5-7 days without any treatment of the cause. Antibiotics are ineffective in a viral infection. At times, in case of a severe reaction, secondary bacterial infection may be present and only then antibiotics are indicated. Generally the viral infections have an allergic component and some anti-allergic may help. The medicines being given are proper and you may continue giving them without worrying. Additionally, giving steam inhalation will help in diluting the cough and give the child relief."},{"Patient":"My son had an asthma attack a couple of days ago. They picked his finger three times before they could get a blood sample. He has clubbing on his fingers and his doctor checks his chest regular. The ambulance people told me to get him tested for reins coz they couldn t get blood and coz of his fingers. When he puts his thumbs together there is no diamond. How do I go to my doctors and ask them to test and should I ask. He s 13","Doctor":"Thank you for asking on HealthCareMagic. Veins of many children are not very prominent and hence at times we find it really hard to collect a blood sample and may need to prick a few times.Clubbing can sometimes be a normal finding though it is also seen in patients with respiratory diseases like asthma. The manifestation of clubbing is that there is no diamond. No test is usually required for the clubbing though tests might be done for the underlying cause. Since he already has a diagnosis, I would insist you not to get worried.Hope that helps. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any."},{"Patient":"MY BROTHER IS SUFFERING FROM SHARP AND SUDDEN ABDOMINAL PAIN FROM LAST ONE YEAR. WE HAVE TRIED ALMOST 10 -12 DOCTORES BUT STILL DONT GET FINAL CONCLUSION, HE IS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SAME, HE HAS LOST HIS 35 KG WT, AND UNABLE TO DIGEST ANYTHING.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM. You have not mentioned if he has also been investigated. Loss of a significant weight along with inability to digest food definitely requires routine blood investigations as well as special tests pertaining to GIT ( including endoscopy and biopsy). For a definite opinion you need to mantain a pain diary with precipitating factors and associated symptoms (if any e.g diarrhoea, flushing or sweating etc). So, you must visit a Ge physician who will investigate your brother in a staged fashion and treat according to cause.

Most children suffer from cough and cold which is caused due to a viral infection. It generally has an allergic component which is manifested by runny nose.Giving some antiallergic like levocetirizine along with steam inhalation thrice daily should give the child relief. For calming the child at night pedicloryl syrup may help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctors, i had some queries for my baby. Actually when my baby was born she was very fair.And now she has become very dark.

After doing all this still my baby is getting dark day by day. Doctor is also telling me that it is fungul disease. Will you please help me out with this problem. My baby is 5 months old now","Doctor":"Although environmental factors like sunlight and UV rays have a role to play in determining the colour of an individual, genetics plays a very important role in this regard. The skin colour does not express itself properly at birth. So it is not unusual for a newborn to look fair. Even the present colour might not be the final colour of skin of your child. Although fungal infection is possible, it seems less likely.Oil does not get absorbed through the skin and hence your doctor has asked you to avoid it."},{"Patient":"My 10 yrs son gets reoccurring periods of swollen legs with puss.

Thanks for your time, Morgan Thank you Morgan","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on HealthCareMagic. I do not think that you or your baby requires collagen supplements unless there are specific indications that you have.

Lumps don t seem to be painful and she seems fine, no fever or pain, but does have some tiny red bumos/rash on skin around neck and elbows.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on HealthCareMagic. The lump is body's excessive reaction to an injury, a condition called keloid. They are painless and often increase in size rather than going away. Unless they are itchy, you need not do anything.

He has already had high fever 5 times (nearly every 2 weeks) and his tonsils get swollen.  He had his strep test and it is negative. Antistreptolisine test (blood test) result was 50.  I therefore thought he would not need an operation and his tonsils removed.

I am a bit cautious of anesthesia and tonsilectomy.","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.Criteria for removal of tonsils  as per Indian Academy of Pediatrics  are1.   7 or more episodes of tonsillitis in 1 yr.2.   5 or more episodes per year over a 2 year period.3.   Enlarged tonsils that create significant upper airway obstruction.4.   An abscess in the tonsils.Yes operation is to be done under general anesthesia , it is quite safe in expert hands. If your son needs a tonsillectomy as per these criteria you should go for operation as it is unlikely to shrink before age of  12 years .

They also produce antibodies to fight against infection. But sometimes the tonsils themselves become infected by bacteria or viruses, where they swell and become inflamed,  which is called as tonsillitis. This age group is prone for repeated tonsillitis. Left alone, it may cause further complication like rheumatic fever, rheumatic chorea, and arthritis.  I  strongly recommend to give full dose of antibiotics to your 5 year old kid as part of management.The drugs which  he is already taking is the first drug of choice.

I just read through your question.Undescended testicles are not uncommon. It is not something to be overly worried about because often the testicles will descend on their own. When they don't, they can be pulled down with a very simple surgical procedure. the first step is to alert your pediatrician as to your finding. Most often, the more experienced hands of a pediatrician are able to feel the testicles and rule out the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"My husband dropped my 4 month old son.

Information that is important to know is:  what height the fall was from, the surface landed on (i.e.concrete, carpet etc),  the general state of behavior of the baby. Babies have open fontanelles which offer a level of protection from excess pressure.

It maybe avoided by frequent changing of diapers, cleaning of the area and keeping the area dry. Also while cleaning make sure you clean from front to back i.e. vagina to anus. This would prevent any infection from the anal canal to affect the vagina. Apart from that, you may try applying any zinc oxide containing rash cream around the vaginal opening(not inside). Having said so I suggest you also keep a watch for any discharge from the a opening, difficulty in passing urine or increase in rash in which case a medical consultation would be advisable.

He also is still very oral , every thing goes in the mouth , he licks my wall , puts leaves and pine needles in his mouth any thing he touches it goes in his mouth. I think something is wrong. What do you think.","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.The number of hours of sleep that can be considered adequate for any child is usually individualized. It depends on the pattern that has been formed from the beginning, the diet that the child consumes, the level of activity the child has , the routine of other members of the family, the sleep conditions provided to the child in the house etc. Although sleep is also likely to be affected in any disease process going on in the body, if decreased sleep is a routine affair for the child then it is unlikely that it would be due to any illness. The process of ensuring good sleep for the child would be long, requiring continous efforts and patience. Certain tips that could be used include increasing the level of activity in the child, avoiding day time sleep as much as possible, giving a glass of milk before bed, giving a warm bath before bed, making sure other family members are asleep and lights switched off in order to provide an ambience to the child etc.Having said so, one cause that is often overlooked and causes sleep disturbances in a lot of children is obstructive sleep apnea. This occurs due to obstruction in any part of the upper airway due to either a deviated nasal septum/ tonsillar enlargement/allergy/cold/obesity etc. It usually manifests in the form of snoring and disturbed sleep at night and is considered if it causes day time irritation/lethargy or other system involvement. If it is suspected consulting a doctor would be advisable.Apart from this, the habit of eating unedible substances also known as pica could be due to deficiency or iron or calcium which may be corrected be giving supplements."},{"Patient":"Hi my daughter age 7 is not breathing right .when she is eating food she needs to stop chewing and take deep breath from her mouth,and she gets uncomfortable,is her nose blocked or is she just not used to breathing from her nose I don t understand what to do","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.The most common reason for what you describe is nasal congestion. Usually this is cleared by simply blowing the nose and perhaps administering saline nose drops. However, this could sometimes be an issue with the lungs (ie: wheezing). If she is otherwise comfortable, I don't consider this an emergency. However, I do recommend consulting with your pediatrician."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is stormy im 22.

Asthma usually presents with chronic coughing or difficulty in breathing which are not present from the symptoms you described. Although asthma may attack even after several years from your last attack, it is best to have yourself checked by your doctor to confirm that this really is an asthma attack. As for treatment, SABA (short acting beta2 agonist) like Salbutamol is the drug of choice for exacerbations of asthma.

Lariago is a medicine to treat malaria. You have not mentioned if malaria had been confirmed by blood test. If not, you have not done a good thing and unless he has malaria, the fever would not respond. There can be a number of causes for fever. Viral fevers are most common. Viral fevers do not respond to lariago or any antibiotics and come down on their own in 5-10 days and I guess that you have to wait till then. In the meantime you have to keep the temperature in control by use of paracetamol. Meftal P contains mefenamic acid which is more effective than paracetamol in relieving fever and hence has kept the temperature normal for few hours. The dose can be repeated in 3-4 hours. Stay relaxed. Just give paracetamol. Also give sponging with water at normal temperature."},{"Patient":"I have a baby girl who is 7months and 14 days old. She was born 19 days before her due.

Will this not give her more problems with reflux as I hear perlagon is acidified. Please help","Doctor":"Hi, since your kid is just 9 weeks old, try as much as possible to breast feed your baby. As you would know it has antibodies and hence would give lot of immunity to your baby. I will give you some tips which might help. Do not feed your baby every time he cries. That is similar to binge eating. Feed him every 2 hrly for at least 45 min. I hope you are taking at least 2 lts. Of water. Be in a positive frame of mind. Things would be fine.Well as to giving NAN perlagon, I think it would not cause much problem. If all your above efforts fail then you can give this. Burp the baby properly. Make him sleep at an inclination of 45 degrees and let his head be turned to a side and not straight up. This would avoid your baby from vommiting. If the baby is putting on weight inspire of vommiting then day not about it.Hope your query is answered.

Sometimes if it is not a bacillary dysentery and we use antibiotics unnecessarily, it can aggravate diarrhoea. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol like Ibugesic Plus.Another issue is that I think that your son has got Hand foot Mouth disease which is a viral illness and is self limiting and will be better in another 2 weeks. Meanwhile for itching you can use some over the counter antihistamine medication.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My baby is 3 mo 2 weeks old (5 weeks premature) and has sounded hoarse since yesterday.

Another issue is that it can lead to pregnancy complications and birth weight issues. But at the same time it doesn't mean that all consanguineous marriages will lead to defective babies. It is not so.The best way for you will be that - Consult a genetics specialist (both of you) and get evaluated and then take a decision of the marriage.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor...

My 9 month old is having frequent bowel movements (5-6 a day) for the past 2 weeks which are sometimes frothy, sometimes green, sometimes watery/liquidy and at times contains mucus. He was exclusively breastfed until 6 months and currently breastfed along with solids. He takes about 2 servings of solids per day usually, sometimes just one. One small serving of home made whole grain cereal and another snack of puréed fruit or veggie. Occasionally we will let him take a bite or nibble a bit of what we are eating. He had acid reflux and gas initial months of his life. His bowel movements were irregular meaning he will usually go a few days between movements. Then around 8-8.5 months, it became more regular and then for the past 2 weeks (he is now 9 mo), he is having bowel movements several times a day. He seems to be straining to pass stool but those are always soft...it s mostly frothy, sometimes watery and sometimes contains mucus. It was green a couple of times. He passes gas and has Bowel movements during nights as well or wake up from a map needing to pass stool. Do you know what s going on? Should I be concerned? He is otherwise a happy baby. He is only one percentile in height and weight but he had always been that way. Parents are on the smaller side as well.","Doctor":"HI...the kid is definitely failing to thrive and needs further evaluation. It could be a malabsorption. I am happy that he is a happy kid.

Is the stool oily and floats in the pan?4. Is there any colour change in the hair or skin?5. Is there any history of recurrent serious infections?Possibilities:1. Chronic diarrhoea - ?

Severe pain associated with dyspepsia (burps) can be an indication of Helicobacter pylori infection which is very common in India. It is possible that some small ulcer is also present. Sometimes, the muscles of stomach or near gastric inlet may go into spasm.

Also she has crazy bad gas. I need some insight as to whats going on with her. Thank you","Doctor":"Your child may be demonstrating a protein intolerance and she should be examined by her pediatrician for this.  She may need an elemental (predigested) formula."},{"Patient":"Yes my grandson is on meds for a adhd and odd and I am very concerned of the side effects. He is taking buprion, vyvanse, d-Amphetamine, and resperdone. He complains to me about headaches,shortchanged,his bones hurting, and he has little appetite most times and is very skinny. I truly feel he should be on some other safer meds. How can I address these problems to my daughter sensitively,so that she can address his psychiatrist with these concerns to so he sees these side effects and changes his meds.","Doctor":"Your grandson is being treated by a Psychiatrist, an expert in the treatment of ADD and ODD,  As Vyvanse is an amphetamine, I do not think he is taking another amphetamine also.  Amphetamines can cause headaches and loss of appetite.  Perhaps you can ask your daughter to let you accompany her to his next appointment so you can not only bring up these concerns to the doctor but also better understand his needs and treatment decisions."},{"Patient":"Daughters friend developed temp of 103. Took to ER. I think they did blood test and say nothing is wrong. RX doxycycline, Motrin, ASA. He s been taking the meds and the fever came back 24 hrs later. Returned to ER, lower lumbar tap showed negative. They work at a Boy Scout camp and went this weekend to Northern VA to visit his family. On trip back to camp he started saying he was cold and she realized he was burning up","Doctor":"Sounds like his fever is due to a virus.  An antibiotic will not stop a viral infection, it has to run it's course."},{"Patient":"my 10year old child had done peripheral smear last year when he was suffering from viral fever, it shows hypochromic megaloblastic anemia with active lymphocytes.his hb count is only 8.4.now his hb is 12.2 .he advised me to take bone marrow test.but i dis agree.is this smear shows any serious problem","Doctor":"Megaloblastic anemia can be due to a deficiency in a vitamin, B12.  hypo chromic just means low iron content.  The only information here for his current test is his HGB which appears to have recovered after the illness which caused it to decrease earlier.  Some viral illnesses can slow down red cell production but recovery is spontaneous.  To answer your question about the bone marrow biopsy we would need more information about his labs and his clinical condition.  This is not a recommendation a doctor makes lightly so he must have a good reason.  Get a second opinion if you must but be sure to to it quickly."},{"Patient":"hello! I am Sukhninder Kaur. I have children - one elder and then twins. One of the twins is down syndrome. My elder Son recently diagnosed with thyroid. He is 9 years old. His TSH is 579 and FT3 and FT4 are also not normal. Doctor prescribed him thyronorm 100mcg. I want to know whether he can get rid of this problem or not? Is it a lifelong problem. For your information i would like to tell you that me and my father have also thyroid.","Doctor":"Hypothyroidism can be congenital or acquired such as after thyroiditis.  Either way the child will need to take thyroid replacement therapy for the rest of his life.  Your child with Down Syndrome also has a higher risk for developing low thyroid function so should be tested periodically.  Fortunately, thyroid hormone replacement does solve the problem entirely."},{"Patient":"hello , this is shaik mohammad ali basha from kadapa,a.p ,india , my son 6 moths old he is having nemonia ,Dr. given me Asthalin for him. but he is having cuff and fever is not controlled. hand and legs are very heat but body is cool. i don t have what to do . Drs are not good here.please advice me it is very emergency, thank you","Doctor":"Your son needs to be on an antibiotic if he has pneumonia.  Even though pneumonia can be viral, it is done to prevent secondary bacterial infections.  Fever should be treated with acetaminophen and you should give him his asthalin to help him keep his airways open and be more comfortable.  Another very important thing to know his that pneumonia and wheezing as well as fever all cause the loss of fluids and his fluid requirement is at least double normal.  Do not worry about his eating food but be sure he gets plenty of liquids like electrolyte replacement liquids, diluted juices etc.  Make sure he is having wet diapers 4-5 times a day.  If he is having paleness, blue color, lethargy when his fever is down or very rapid breathing (greater than 40 per minute) and heart rate(greater than 160 per minute)  he needs to go to the hospital.  Also if you cannot get him to drink a lot he needs to go."},{"Patient":"My 1 year old son is suffering from severe chest congestion. He has been prescribed Asthalin syrup 5 ml 3 times daily Advent antibiotics 5 ml 2 times daily It s been 3 days of medication n there is no improvement. He coughs throughout night he is not able to eat nor drink milk. He passes watery motion after consumption of these medicines. Plz help.","Doctor":"I do not know where you are but if you have an option of giving the Asthalin as a breathing treatment rather than syrup that would be better.  Advent is known to cause diarrhea.  It is a good antibiotic however and you can lessen the diarrhea by giving probiotics (lactobacillus).  For now do not worry about milk but try to get your child to drink a lot of liquids so he has good urine output (4-5 times a day wet diapers) .  You need to keep up with his increased need for fluids from the illness as well as with the extra fluid losses from the diarrhea.  He would benefit from a small amount of mashed banana (not baby food but real banana mashed up) to help slow the diarrhea and replace potassium lost in the diarrhea. You can help with the cough by giving him warm water with honey to sip and by cool humidified air if possible.  If you have cough driops, you can smash them and let him suck on small pieces to sooth his cough. After three days a bacterial infection should be better so this tells me that his illness if likely viral.  Even though, I would continue the antibiotic so he does not get a secondary bacterial infection while ill.  A viral respiratory illness can take up to a week to improve."},{"Patient":"My 10 yo daughter fell off chair at sunday school this morning and hit her head directly on concrete floor. her hands were in her pocket and her legs were in her sweat jacket. She took the brunt of impact with her head. she still has headache, dizzy and does not like the light on in the room. My concern is I feel a dent in the middle of the bump on the top of her forehead. I am scared that means a fracture in her skull. Pupils look ok. I am just wondering if I should bring her to ER.","Doctor":"Given the findings you describe, I would recommend having her seen in the ER.  She may have a small fracture but that will heal on it's own.  Most important is to be sure she is not having any internal bleeding which can be slow to show signs of and should be treated sooner rather than later.  Head trauma associated with a fracture requires evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hi, my toddler daughter accidentally stepped on my 5yr old s thumb and it is now swollen and painful.

Many thanks","Doctor":"Is your son unable to move the  thumb?  Is there any specific point where it seems to be exquisitely painful, is the swelling getting worse, is the thumb cold, does it have poor circulation, is there a new break in the skin?  If any of these are true he should be examined."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 2. She will be 3 in November. She has all of her teeth in and we brush them everyday.

She is in the middle of a growth spirt right now. But I can t imagine that would cause her gums to be red, swollen and bloody or give her such a fever.","Doctor":"Your daughter may have a viral illness affecting the mouth as well.  For example, hand foot and mouth disease can cause mouth blisters as well as swollen and painful gums.  The presence of fever makes this more likely.  Check to see if you can find small white spots with red rim in her mouth and small blister like lesions on her hands or feet."},{"Patient":"The lower part of my abdomen feel very swollen.

The mark under the elbow that you mentioned might have evolved to become thicker and hence palpable.However it is important to know what kind of birth mark ( hyper pigmented/depigmented/hairy etc.) that you are talking about, which could help us rule out any other cause.By and large it seems to be a benign occurance and the only thing that needs to be done is keeping a watch for similar lumps on other parts of body or an increase in size of the existing lump. If so, a medical consultation would be advisable.Also rule out some trivial local injury that may have caused a temporary swelling under the elbow.If you need any more advice regarding this, do write back."},{"Patient":"My son who is 135 days old.

He already taken 1st does of rotavirus. From last 3-4days, he is not having enough neither from bottles nor from his Mom..not even sleeping enough. Now from last day he is vomiting frequently, please suggest. Is it Stomach infection? BuMotinorm is enough for this or should i go with injection?","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Before answering your question I would like to inform you that  6 months is not a correct age for the first dose of rota virus vaccination. The course should have been completed by now. It is not ideally supposed to be given this late.Now coming to the symptoms, vomiting and decreased feeding are very non specific symptoms and could occur in a variety of conditions. In order to clearly determine the cause of such symptoms, their association with other symptoms like fever, diarrhea, cold, cough etc. should be studied.It is less likely(though not impossible) that the symptoms may be due to rota viral vaccine. There is a higher probability that it could be due to some viral infection of the gut or any other infection causing the child to refuse for feed. If there is associated cold, then nose block should be ruled out as it can also cause decreased feeding and it should be managed by applying nasal saline drops. Also reflex vomiting should be ruled out if there is associated cough. Here the baby will vomiting right after a bout of cough. Vomiting may be managed by antiemetic drug like moti norm. Make sure to keep the head end of the child elevated while asleep and keep the child well hydrated by frequent feeding. If the complained of decreased feeding continues or additional symptoms arise, a medical consultation should be taken.If you have any more doubts regarding this case, do reply back."},{"Patient":"Hi, My 11 month old baby is vomiting after eating fish (very small amount of fish). It happened 3 times already over 1 month period; every time after trying to give him dinner containing fish (he hates fish). Is he allergic to fish? I didn t observe any other allergic reaction. Thanks Anna","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Allergy to any food item would not manifest as vomiting alone but with rash/itching/swelling/breathing difficulty or diarrhea. In the absence of any of these symptoms it is unlikely that your child is allergic to fish, in which case it clearly means that the reason your child vomits out fish is that the taste does not suit her. Absence of vomiting to other food items reinforces this theory.In such a case I would suggest that you either change the method of preperation of fish in such a way that the basic taste gets camouflaged or accept the fact that your daughter is not a fan of fish and omit it from her diet. You may later try reintroducing it slowly and look for response as taste preferences are known to change over time."},{"Patient":"My son is 2.11 years old and time and again almost once in 4 weeks time he is getting cold and fever... and cough is not going from last 4 to 5 months...sometimes is getting severe cough and coughing almost every minute.

Epilepsy could be due to a variety of reasons. It could be due to damage to the developing brain of your child due to insult either before/during or after delivery. It could also be due to a genetic cause.The drugs iracet and neurolep that you have mentioned are drugs to treat epilepsy while cortan is a steroid.According to the information you have given, your child seems to be have a delay in achievement of social milestones (which include eye contact,social smile, recognition of people, non verbal communication). Apart from this, sole delay in attaining eye contact may also mean that the vision is probably disturbed. This could not only be due to corneal issue (which has been ruled out) but also due to other issues in the eye or brain(probably not ruled out).Whether your child has a risk of developing autism or not depends on the study of other developmental milestones ( gross and fine motor and language skills) and also the reason behind the epilepsy. Thus the first step here would be to find out what kind of epilepsy your child has and what is the reason behind it. Similarly the reason behind absent eye contact should be found out. It is only by answering the above two questions and by regular monitoring, any more comments can be made on the likely direction of your child's development."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was sterilizing baby bottles and pacifiers in a boiling pot of water and I fell asleep…3 hours later, I remembered, jumped out of bed and realized that my apt smelled of burnt plastic and most of it had melted and some burned.

Red spots over the buttocks and redness near the anal opening suggests that your child has a rash at the nappy area. This may be due to infrequent changing of diapers(in case not toilet trained), excessive heat/perspiration or some irritant cloth material of the undergarments.The blood that you mentioned may be due to one of the boils being broken while wiping.  However it is also important to rule out that your child does not have blood in his stools. For that I suggest you keep a watch on his stools to observe any red or black streaks.

Yesterday during our pediatric visit for vaccination , his doctor told that he has liver with more than 3cm in size and said its more than normal. I am worried. Please help.","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question. In a lot of normal infants, the liver is found to be felt below the ribs upto 3 cms. Thus this finding may be absolutely normal.However, an enlarged liver is also found in a lot of disease conditions. The diagnosis would only be possible if the associated symptoms and clinical findings in the baby are correlated. Based on the clinical suspicion lab reports may be ordered to confirm.It is not possible to give you an entire list of conditions causing liver enlargement, not only because it is too vast but also because it might just end up scaring you more than you ought to be.However, what can be done for now is that you keep a watch watch any associated symptoms. This symptoms may include fever, yellowish discoloration of skin/eyes/urine, pale colored stools, altered smell in urine, abdominal swelling, breathlessness, swelling in any other part of body, decreased urine output, decreased feeding, excessive or poor weight gain, spots over body or any other skin or hair changes etc. If you find any of these, I would advice you to have a detailed talk with your pediatrician and based on the clinical assumptions you may decide on the further course of action.If you need any more guidance do write back."},{"Patient":"Hi My son is 4.6yrs old ,is going to K.g ,he started school when last year.He is having problem in peer interaction & and does not participate in class activity .His o.t sessions and IEP sessions started last year ..but can t see much of change in him ... need help ...","Doctor":"Hi thank you for choosing healthcare magic.

I had a stomach virus maybe 3 weeks ago and my stomach was hurting alot. They gave me some pills and that went away. But then I started having pain in the appendix area and I was sure it was appendicitis . I had the pain and low fever. I m 22, my parents took me to the emergency room and they did a CAT scan and said everything was normal even my appendix. Gave me stomach medicine again. But for some reason it wasn t hurting as bad that day. About a week ago it was hurting really bad, and now it s kind of a little bit of pain, but it makes my eyes red and I look really tired. I want to make an appointment to go to a gastreologist. But can anyone tell me what this could be, any ideas? It makes me really nervous because the pain won t go away, even though it s not as bad now. Thank you and I would really appreciate any answers. Thank you so much. -Yuriy","Doctor":"Hi, . From what I understand, you are suffering with right lower abdomen pain. Yes, appendicitis does present with right lower abdomen pain. But if the pain is not very severe and you do not have fever / nausea / vomiting, it is less likely to be appendicitis. Besides the CAT scan was also normal ruling out any chances of appendicitis. This pain what you have could be related to some minor intestinal infection; renal stones or minor muscle sprain. Adequate rest and analgesics like motrin would be helpful in these conditions to relieve your pain. In addition, drinking plenty of fluids is recommended. I understand you are concerned. But all the test and your symptoms are against possible appendicitis. This is more likely a sinister problem which should settle down in a few days.

For all you know your son might have just laid hands on a diaper lying somewhere and slipped it in place of his regular underwear. If that is not the case then there is a probability that he might be bed wetting, most likely at night. In any case, I think talking to him calmly is to only logical option. You may ask him calmly in a non accusing tone why he did that. Also if your find out that he has been wetting himself, then a proper medical consultation should be taken. However the first step would be to find out the cause for his altered behavior which can be done by a open two sided conversation.

Does this mean he could possibly have a form of cancer? He shows no signs of illness.","Doctor":"Reactive hyperplasia of Lymphnode is acommon finding that we come across from histology report of lymphnodes. the Reaction may be secondary to any infection in the draining area of the node which could be the skin or inside the throat. Generally these lymphnodes respond to a course of 7 days antibiotics. Give him Augmentin 625mg 1 tab twice daily for 7 days. Extremely rarely this can be very early indication of lymphoma, but I personally dont think it is anything like that.

He is not eating properly only breast feeding. Also he is not walking himself now he is 14 months. Can i give him mutton soups etc., what are the major food i can give to him. Looking forward for your valuable reply.","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.The diet of a 14 month old child should comprise of everything that is included in a basic family meal, in short the baby should ideally eat whatever other family members are eating, as long as its all homemade.He may be given all vegetables, fruits. You may boil and mash the vegetables and then add some salt to make it palatable.You may add rice, pulses. You may slowly introduce strong proteins like egg white or chicken/meat.The consistency should initially be kept curd like and gradually thickened. Alone breast feeding would not be sufficient for the growing needs of your child at this age thus complementing it with other foods is very necessary at this point.You need to use the method of trial and error to know and understand what kind of foods suit your baby. Any more delay in establishing proper complementary diet would have adverse consequences on his nutritional status.If you need any more information, do write back."},{"Patient":"Hi.

This is at the higher dose level beyond which it should not be increased and if required a 2nd drug should be tried.

She is suffering from allergic rhinitis which is causing her nasal obstruction particularly at night. As her nose is getting blocked she is compelled to breath through mouth cauing the frothing.

I am reluctant to give it to her if unnecessary as I have a feeling that she has an allergy to food through my having my breast milk. Will she still need to take the antibiotics if that is the case or could she take bioflor ? Thank you","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Greenish mucoid stools are an absolutely normal occurrence in an exclusively breast fed infant and so is increased stool frequency( upto 20 times a day may be considered normal).This is because of a phenomenon known as gastrocolic reflex which causes reflex defecation in response to feed. Here the contents of the intestine do not get time to change colour and are excreted in the same colour as they are found in the small intestine. Thus if your child is being exclusively breasted, these symptoms are to be taken as normal especially in the face if a happy and normally growing child. Thus antibiotics are not indicated. Also, since it is a normal occurance, probiotics like bioflor are also not indicated.If it is the stool report that is causing the confusion then repeating the report before starting antibiotics would be my suggestion. Having said so I would suggest you also keep a watch on your child's symptoms.Any change, decreased feeding, decreased urine output or activity, faltering in weight gain should be reported and dealt with immediately."},{"Patient":"My three year old son suddenly developed bright red spots (like a cluster of dots) on the shaft of his penis, which we can only see when we stretch the skin out.

Make baby gargle 3. Comination of Levocetrizine and Montelukast ( Syrup can be used): It will decrease the airway hyper reactivity4. Decoction: 1 cup of milk+ 20 Tulsi leaves+ 1 spoon of turmeric+ 2 spoon sugar. Bring it to boil. Filter it and give child warm.

She is also very tired and lathargic but is still sleeping her normal times and she has had a slight temp the last 2 days.If u could help or give me an idea or what might be happening that would be great. I am going to take her to the bush nurse tomorrow","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question. Smelling stools in the absence of actual passage of stools indicates that your child has been frequently passing gas. This would most probably be a benign occurance, associated with some gas producing content in diet. However, in the face of mild fever and lethargy, it could also be due to a mild infection in her gut. If this causes pain or discomfort, you may try giving any anti colic agent (preferably with simethicone). Keep her away from any offending or gas producing food. You may try giving her cold milk or ice cream to allay the acidity.If you need any more guidance regarding the case, do write back."},{"Patient":"my daughter who is 10months and 3 weeks weighing 9 Kgs has been having a pimple on the skin that covers the eye for the last three months. we have been taking her to hospatal and every time we go she given medicines. in the course of taking medication the pimple reduces and immediately after medication it starts growing again. she too has a itching ear since she was three months old phsicians who attend her link the ear and the eye and admister the same drugs for both with little success. please advice on the cure of my daughter","Doctor":"Itching in the ear is generally due to allergy or fungal infection in the ear called otomycosis. For this giving Candibiotic drops will suffice. But a pimple at the margin of the eyelid can be a Chalazion ( painless) or stye (painful). In case of stye oral antibiotics may be required if persisting.

This has only happened since the accident. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Local pain and soreness after injury to the nose can easily be explained. However, reaction to cold drinks in the form of pain in nose and headache is an uncommon complaint. The only explanation that can be thought of is that the injury must have left some sore area in and around the nose and the nasal sinuses. Thus anything that is too cold when ingested, the effervescence might be causing irritation of the teeth roots, nasal mucosa and the sore sinus mucosa leading to pain, irritation and headache.The management should be symptomatic which includes avoiding cold drinks for a while, pain killers if the pain is very severe and local cold fomentation.The soreness will take its time to resolve following which there should be no issues in ingesting cold liquids."},{"Patient":"my 13 year old daughter has been vomiting weekly for the past 2-3 monthe she also get a red face and feels sleepy when this happens she is fine one min then red face then vomiting. i have had her to the family dac several times she has seen an alergest. we went to the hospital they said it was like a migrane headache in the abdomin but i am not ok with this they gave her some antivomit meds that they use for people on cemo theripy they are not helping. what could this be and how long does a 13 year old girl go on like this? the hosp made her an appointment for a gi as i have severe chrones myself but it is not until sept what should i do?","Doctor":"13 yr girlwith recurrant vomiting ,if colour of vomitus is greenish to startwith likely cause woulld be malrotation of gut requiring BMFT investigation to rule out this problem. if nnogreenish vomiting,in b/w bcild is ok having headache also,and parents have h/o headache likely cause would be abdominalmigraine or cyclicalvomiting syndrome.consult pediatric GI doctor."},{"Patient":"my 6 year old nephew has black dots on the palm of his hands his feet and hands are both swollen and he s in pain on his back he s in the hospital waiting for results from his blood work they can t figure out what s going on the test will take 5 days I m scared","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote it seems like a Hand foot mouth disease.

The indentation of bones however is not likely as the bones of a five year old are not normally supposed to be soft enough to give way to local swelling.Also, if your child is playful, eating well and not complaining of pain, serious consequences can be ruled out to a great extent.Having said that, if you still feel that his skull is showing some bony depression, I would suggest a medical consultation and if required atleast an X-ray skull may be done to rule out skull fracture.If you have any more doubts , do write back."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

The other option is that for the rash you can use Calamine lotion application to soothe the sensation.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my baby is just 6 months 8 days, she is exclusively breastfed.

What could it be? What can I try?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. For infants, formula feeds are not easy to digest and often semi digested portions appear in the stool. Semi digested milk can also give rise to substances that may cause loose stools to be passed. However, rotavirus is a very common cause of diarrhoea in infants and probably that is the cause of diarrhoea in your child. Unless associated with bloody stools, even without treatment of the cause, such diarrhoeas generally resolve spontaneously within 5-7 days so antibiotics are not required. All you need to do is to replenish the salt or water loss by the use of ORS. Had he been exclusively breast fed, I would have insisted you to continue breast feeding however.Hope that helps.

Cough and cold, a viral condition referred to as bronchiolitis, is pretty common in children of this age. Calcough contains glycerine. The dose mentioned on the package is for laymen. Doctors calculate paediatric doses based on the body weight. There is no harm in case of slightly more dose being given.

I am sorry to hear about your daugther. During illness when the child does not eat properly, the body has to manage nutrition from elsewhere and converts fats to ketones which act as the food for brain. That is probably the reason for your child to have 4+ ketones. All that has to be done is to give her feed properly. I would also insist giving her ORS to help her regain salt and water imbalance.At times it is extremely difficult to find the vein in small children and in case of a dehydrated child finding a vein is tougher.Your daughter seems to be suffering from an infection. Most of these conditons are caused due to viruses and hence antibiotics are ineffective. Without listening to her chest and examining her abdomen, it is hard for me to comment further.Zofran (Ondansetron) is intended to reduce the nausea and vomiting and would help her feed. It is unlikely that the doctor did not prescribe antibiotic to avoid interaction with Zofran, rather probably he thought that the antibiotics are not required, and has not given her one. Do not worry about it.I would insist you to give her steam inhalation as it would help in diluting the cough and give her relief.Hope that helps.

Most commonly such infections are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Irrespective of the cause, treatment of the cause is unimportant unless associated with bloody stool. All you have to do is to maintain the salt and water balance of the body. Give her ORS and it will take care of the same. The stool frequency will get controlled automatically in 2-4 days. Give her some zinc supplement like Zinconia syrup 5 ml twice daily for 5 days and that will help in controlling the diarrhoea.

Any need to worry about clots?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. Your son suffered an injury. The injury could cause localised damage to the bony structures as well as soft tissue and blood vessels. The injury to the blood vessels has caused the localised bleeding, bruising and clots which will soon get resorbed. It would turn purple, brownish and blackish in the process and there is nothing to worry about it. Blood is an irritant fluid and so long as it does not get resorbed, the area would be painful. About the bony injuries, if present would be visible on an x ray. I would insist you to get an x ray done. The soft tissue damage would not be visible in the x ray.

The fever is caused due to an infection and the blood counts indicate that the infection is of bacterial origin. The reduction of WBC count indicates that the child is responding to the antibiotics and the dose needs to be continued further. Please note that the dose of azithromycin is once daily and not thrice daily.Meftal P contains paracetamol and is meant to control the fever. The temperature needs to be controlled either with medicines or cold sponging or both. Else, high temperature can cause damage to the brain. So the medicines for control of fever need to be continued as required.Nebulisation helps in dilating the airway tracts and diluting the cough. So it provides relief and needs to be continued too.

The skin of her scalp has excess oily secretions which get infected by the fungi. As the secretions get crusted and dry, it often bleeds as they get peeled off.Treatment will consist of two parts. Ketokonazole shampoo available in brands like Nizral, is to be applied over the scalp thrice a week.

Unfortunately the details provided by you are not enough. You have not indicated whether the swelling had been present since birth and whether it has progressed in size. There are some conditions like spina bifida, meningocoele and meningomyelocoele etc. where there are deformities in the spine and the covering of the spinal cord portrudes through the gap of the vertebrae. Your baby could have such a condition. It is difficult to comment further without feeling it. Get in touch with your doctor and ask him.

If it is not present since birth, there is less cause of worry. Although vomiting can occur in spite of domstal, information on how much he is throwing up is also important. If he is throwing up less than 50% of the preceding feed, it is not something to worry about. But if it is more than 50% of the preceding feed, you may drop the next feed and see if still there is a problem. If it is still there, systemic causes of the vomiting needs to be looked into. Since you mention that the child is otherwise hungry, infection is unlikely. I also do not know his weight and so cannot comment on whether the dose of domstal is adequate for him.Hope that answers your query.

His cough though l not fully gone but bettet. Is it normal","Doctor":"Thank you for consulting in HealthCareMagic. The condition that you mention, is probably bronchiolitis and not bronchitis. It is a viral infection that affects children between 6 months and 3 years of age. It is characterised by chest congestion and wheezing. In order to dilute the cough steam inhalation or nebulisation is required alongside the mucolytics. Generally it is associated with an allergic component for which the antiallergics like ascoril are given. The side effect of such antiallergics is drowsiness and hence the child seems dull. The cough and restlessness would get relieved in a few days time and I insist that you bear with it till then.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Diarrhoea in children is typically caused by rotavirus although it could also be caused by certain bacteria. Stool is generally foul smelling in such cases. Unless associated with bloody stools the cause is not important and does not need to be treated. All you have to do is give ORS to replenish the salt and water loss. In case of abdominal colic, antispasmodics like decolic can be given.Macpod is cefpodoxime, an antibiotics which was not essential but since you have begun it, you should complete the 5 day course of twice daily dose.Hope that helps.

I am keeping an eye on her tightly feeling that this is what she is about to do and caught her of course before she had opportunity... but what can I do to sway her away from this type of behavior ..she gets in trouble for something and and hour or two later does the exact thing that she already got in trouble for earlier. I feel that the communication is clear... we talk about why she is in trouble and she exceeds her years in intelligence she reasons as if she is 6 instead of 4 Is cautious in many ways.. and seems to listen when grandparents talk or correct her with no problem and they are so very patient with her.

Do not expect her to be extremely obedient and follow all the instructions to the core. You are doing it right by explaining her the dangers and for her own good and also keeping an eye. But that is not the concept at this age. You can ask grand parents too to keep an eye.Instead of not letting her touch something let her do it in front of you. If gym equipment are like cycle or treadmill let her use it in front of you. You can buy an appropriate cycle for her. This will curb her curiosity for the thing.

Thanks, Veda","Doctor":"Thank you for asking on HealthCareMagic. Breast feeding is the best food for a baby and there can be no substitute for it. Formula milk is hard to digest and hence affects the quality of stool. Greenish stools are caused due to rapid transit through the large intestine. It is not a cause for worry.If mother's milk is inadequate and if formula feeds are not well tolerated, you may introduce small amounts of mashed boiled semi solid food make from rice, pulses and vegetables.

He s been getting nosebleeds for quite sometime now and they keep getting worse. Could this be related to the hydrocephalus in any way.","Doctor":"Thank you for asking on HealthCareMagic. Newborn brains are in the process of development especially in preterms. The inner lining of the brain is very thin. As the development of the brain progresses, a substance called myelin is formed and acts as an insulator of the nerve fibres and helps them in functioning. But in preterms sometime bleeding may occur below the thin lining and as there is resorption of the blood, the blood debris often block the drainage of the CSF leading to hydrocephalus. A shunt creates a bypass tract for the CSF preventing the hydrocephalus from progressing.The nose bleeds are probably unrelated. Whether he has a nasal pathology like nassl poly needs to be investigated.Hope that helps.

I am sorry to hear that your child had been suffering from bronchopneumonia. Even if the infective process gets resolved, the effects of the disease process take time to heal. So the wheezing and cough may take some time to go. Levolin dilates the airway tracts so that the cough may come out more easily. Steam inhalation thrice daily or nebulization may give him some relief. I would not suggest taking codeine or any other agents that reduce cough production. Expectorants act better.

Known history of mild colitis, belching and tremendous stress. The causes are very obvious. This is type if IBS, meaning Irritable Bowel Syndrome, You have to take a combination of medicines for stress and anxiety.

I think it is throat clearing because it is not episodic, but a one cough burst and she claim tickling at throat. She is on Claritin once a day...although it seems to help other allergy related symptoms, it doesn t seem to address the post nasal drip. Is there something you can recommend? The Claritin is antihistamine only.","Doctor":"Hi, according to me your kid is suffering from some allergic symptoms. To help her come out of this, I would recommend you to give her warm water to drink and ensure she takes some steam inhalation. This will definitely help. Antihistamines cannot be given for a long term for the simple reason that it would not work and the body gets addicted.You can consult your doctor and probably ask for nasal sprays which would reduce cold and post nasal drips...

Was exceptionally calm at time with no critical sign of head injury. But since, has been complaining of headaches & dizziness, has been more argumentative & says he finds it hard to listen in class. He is an elite football player & high level co- ordination, speed & endurance have also been affected but normal daily functioning is fine. He also has dark circles under eyes. Is this post concussion syndrome ? Should he be resting? Not exercising? Is there any medicine or anything that can speed his recovery. Should we be pushing for further investigations or is there nothing we can do but wait?","Doctor":"Hi, I guess you should go for further investigations because headache and dizziness are not to be taken light following a fall. Other symptom that is no t able to hear properly and back circles under the eyes are not good signs. Probably you have to get a CT scan done and based on the reports , probably even a MRIHope this has helpedTc"},{"Patient":"i have very prem babies 3 months early twins the hospital thought one had menigitis.bout done lumber puncture and was not.but said he had small white spots on his brain that they didnt know what they were ....hes getting blood transfussions.and antibicotices p could it be e..d.f / LACK OF MYOLINE!","Doctor":"Thank you for asking on HealthCareMagic. Although the details provided by you are not adequate, I will try to explain the possibilities. Newborn brains are in the process of development especially in preterms. The inner lining of the brain is very thin. As the development of the brain progresses, a substance called myelin is formed and acts as an insulator of the nerve fibres and helps them in functioning. But in preterms sometime bleeding may occur below the thin lining or due to meningitis and as there is healing, the deposition of myelin occurs improperly. Myelin appears while on the imaging of the brain and hence probably the white patches over the brain have appeared.The blood or blood fraction transfusions may have been given for anaemia of prematurity or in order to control infection.Hope that helps.

My parents took her to the er where a brain scan was done and also a look at her heart. Everything came back normal. Today she is acting very slow and strange. She can t sleep. She says she s too hot one minute and then she gets cold a little while later. She says her feet and hands feel like pins and needles and that light is too bright and that her hair is too heavy. She talks slowly and can t seem to think clearly and answers to questions are unorganized or not relevant to the question. I am very scared for her. I asked my parents to take her to a psychiatrist but they are waiting to see if she gets better. I don t know what to do.","Doctor":"Your sister is likely suffering from Conversion Reaction. This is common in this age group specially in girls. Something has happened which is sub conciously causing problem to her. She is not able share the problem to any one and that is increasing her distress. There may be any problem starting from onset of periods, any bulling or teasing in school, any love issues... any thing. Ask your parents to talk to her regarding any problem giving assurance that they will be by her side. Once she starts communicating things will resolve. . Tab clonazepam can give her some relieve.

Let me mention that completing the immunization schedule is important for your child. Rather than considering the enlarged liver and bulky pancreas as the cause of his vomiting, let me consider all these pree as the part of the same gastrointestinal problem your child has. To be certain what is his exact nature of problems, I would need to put my hands on his abdomen and also see the ultrasound report in details.One speculation that I can make is that he is on formula feed which is hard to digest and his liver and pancreas is striving hard to cope with the same and have increased in size in the process. When he cannot digest the food and undigested food from the previous meal is still present in his stomach, he simply vomits it out.Hope that helps.

But I still can see them with a flash light. when she opens her mouth and says ahhhhh theses pointy white things point out. I am worried. She does not have any fever, any pain. I really appreciate your answer","Doctor":"Its small cysts inside the mouth which could be the opening of parotid glands on both side at same location. If your child feels no problem you need not worry. If small lesions all appear at the angle of mouth, tongue becomes shiny then Vitamin deficiency has to be suspected. Otherwise dont worry."},{"Patient":"I have a 15 month old boy who had a CT scan showing he has his 8th rib on his left side growing inward towards his liver. His surgeon has never seen this in his practice and is recommending that the rib be removed, he is uncertain at what age the rib should be removed and is consulting his peers.","Doctor":"I dont think removal of the rib is necessary if its not causing any problem. Bones grow very slowly, and if it grow inward it will cause some pressure but the liver will also have enough time to restructure it. Thus you can wait and watch until its causing any problem."},{"Patient":"i take epsolin 100 twice a day regularly, at present my son of age 12 has the sympton of nerve pulling of leg , if he continues to move then his hands and legs twist and he may fell down so he stops for awhile and then moves, what i did is i gave him epsolin 100mg a tablet a day it suits him, but i didnot wnt to continue without any medical instruction, so my question is what shall i do?","Doctor":"Epsolin is a drug with lots of side effects and complication. It should be strictly used only under physician's prescription. I would ask you to stop the drug at once. The problem your child is facing are mild cramps which will not require any medication. Only rest and balanced diet rich in fruits are required. If it continue consult a doctor and never give epsolin by yourself."},{"Patient":"my son is 25 days old. He is not feeling well for last 3-4 days. His stomach is very tight sometimes. And he moves his stomach up and down very fast. He is not able to sleep properly. Doctro precribed Domstal (.3ml) and Coidacid(.7ml). But still not getting much relief. What else I can do. His feeding is good almost in every hour and passing urine properly.","Doctor":"Thank you for asking on HealthCareMagic. In newborns not feeding well is not a good sign. If associated with lethargy, it might indicate infection. Since you have already visited a doctor, he must have kept that in consideration. In newborns respiratory distress is manifested by increased respiratory rate which may seem to you as increased abdominal movement. The cause of abdominal distension if present needs to be looked into. I would still ask you to stay relaxed as he is feeding well and is passing urine properly.Domstal and decolic are safe and you need not worry about them.

Most of the sore throat in children is caused either due to a bacteria called streptococcus or due to a virus called Epstein Barr virus. Both of these infections are self limiting and recovery occurs spontaneously in 5-7 days irrespective of the use of antibiotics. It is often associated with fever or pus over tonsils. Your child probably has such a condition.

Usually you will see improvement after 48-72 hrs or around 6 doses (if every 12 hours) of antibiotic. If fever will persist, it is best to bring back your child to the doctor.

It lasted for a couple of mins. This has happened about 3 times already.

There are certain cardiac and non cardiac causes of this which also includes ingestion of certain things like excessive tea/coffee or certain drugs.However it is quite unlikely that an 8 yr old would appreciate his own heart rate, let alone attributing chest pain to his heart. Hence, the way the symptoms are being described by your son, it is likely that he is enacting something that he has seen or heard somewhere. However, not to take his symptoms lightly, I would suggest you keep a watch on his symptoms and look for associated changes like sudden loss of colour from his face, vomiting, radiation of pain to any other site,lethargy or irritability, decreased urine output etc. Apart from this acitdity or heart burn could also cause symptoms similar to chest pain. In this case decreasing intake of spicy food , having cold milk or ice cream, or drugs like omeprazole or ranitidine may be found to be useful.Having said so, if the symptoms continue and if you wish to rule out heart disease, an ECG may be done. If found necessary this may be followed by chest Xray or echocardiography.If you have any more doubt regarding the case, do write back."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 7 years old she has been suffering with lower abdominal pain she has shown high antibody levels in her blood to show she maybe celiac ......she suffers most pain in the morning when she wakfes and when she goes to the toilet for a wee or opfening of bowels......is this more likely to be celiac related pain or bowels?","Doctor":"It is celiac related problem.

Well, you can begin with her high-school or university education counsellor; if she is no longer schooling, you need to visit with an educational counsellor again, but outside the ambit of the school health services.

If these are also not useful, you should take him to a paediatrician or/and an orthopedic surgeon.Regards,Dr. Taher"},{"Patient":"my 13 year old daughter ha milia on her face and more bigger bumps under and over her eyelids for three years now, i took her to the dermatoloist here and she says they will go away on her own, my question is is there a quick treatment for her milia, my daughter is getting sad and self conscious about her looks and she thinks she looks ugly, i keep assuring her that she is the pretiest girl on this earth.","Doctor":"Hi...milia is a self limiting disorder and doesn't require any specific treatment.

Hence, at present, the illness just being 1 day old, can only be treated symptomatically. Thus an antiemetic like domperidone for vomiting and paracetamol for fever should suffice at this stage along with plenty of fluids to maintain hydration.

If the rash is not very severe and not progressing, then watchful waiting could be done. At the most some antihistaminic a like certizine and local calamine lotion could be used.

Firstly, viral fever per se is a very vague terminology and doesn't really point towards any specific disease process. Secondly, most of the viruses do not have any specific treatment and drugs are usually directed towards preventing further complications.However for a child aged 14 yrs who is on a ventilator with normal reports and doctors suggesting its viral fever, I can think of two possibilities. One of them is viral encephalitis which is a viral infection of the brain. It is a condition with varied presentations often requiring ventilator support. It could occur due to a variety of viruses, most of which do not have any specific treatment, except one. If a herpes virus encephalitis is suspected a drug called acyclovir may be used.Second possibility i can think of is a viral pneumonia probably secondarily infected by bacteria. In this case antibiotic coverage with antiviral drugs like oseltsmivir may be tried. If you could provide more clear details of the case, it would be easier to guide you.

This leads to release of certain substances which cause a rise in body temperature. This manifests in the form of low grade fever.Also, since post surgery normal solid diet is not established and the patient is usually kept on liquid or semi solid diet for initial few days, softening of stool consistency and increased frequency of stools may be seen. Thus both the symptoms that you have mentioned may be a normal occurance following an uneventful Appendicectomy.

Blood sugar below 40 mg/dl indicates hypoglycemia that is low blood sugar although less than 70 mg/dl is considered by some standards as the cutoff.

Congenital hypothyroidism needs to be treated with thyroxin (thyronorm) which is already being given. Generally the dose is reduced after 6 months after checking the levels. Do not worry about it and your paediatric endocrinologist will know what to do as it is a very simple condition.Many children suffer from lower respiratory tract infections or another condition called bronchiolitis and your child could be suffering from the same CRP or C-reactive protein indicates an infection or inflammation in the body and antibiotics need to be given to control it. Your doctor is right in this regard.CRP is unrelated to TSH levels and do not link the two.Constipation can occur in response to medicines or diet. Assuming that your child is above 6 months (as you have introduced food like prune juice), you may give high fibre diet to your child although lactulose should also be effective.Include green leafy vegetables in the mashed and boiled food to be given to him.Vegetables are a major source of fibre. Lettuce, Swiss chard, raw carrots, and spinach are good. You may also give:Tender cooked vegetables, such as asparagus, beets, mushrooms, turnips, and pumpkin.Broccoli, artichokes, squashes, sweet potatoes, and string beans.Vegetable juices.Legumes, such as lentils, black beans, split peas, kidney beans, lima beans, and chickpeasSunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios nuts, and pecansFruits are another good source of fibre. You can give:Apples and bananasPeaches and pearsTangerines, prunes, and berriesFigs and other dried fruitsGrains are another important source of dietary fibre.

What you have taken is antibiotic for infection and anti-diabetic medication. You could be having endometriosis which is menstrual tissue growing probably on your ovary which is causing the pain by peritoneal irritation as well. You need to get a thorough checkup by your Doctor and also probably need an ultrasound scan to confirm. For time being for the pain you can take Meftal spas under medical supervision.

When I consulted a pediatrician, he suggested ventryl cough syrup. He said if u want u can give amoxylin. There is not chest infection. I am confused whether to give antibiotic or not. Can u plz help me? My kid is 19 months old.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. Children of this age often suffer from a condition called bronchiolitis which is caused by a virus. Antibiotics are ineffective and the condition spontaneously resolves in 5-7 days without antibiotics. However, in an apprehension of secondary bacterial infection, somebody may add antibiotics. Unless there are chest findings, you can skip antibiotics. You may add some antiallergic like levocetirizine as there is generally an allergic component. Also use nasal saline drops for nasal blockage and give steam inhalation if possible.Hope that helps.

Your child could be suffering from gastritis although there could be many other reasons. Try giving decolic or coliza drops and see if it is releived. Give small but frequent meals.

I’m thinking about Similac but I’m just not sure.. Any suggestions???","Doctor":"constipation is common in formula fed infants . this problem increase if the milk is not prepared in proper concentration. Add 1 scoop of milk in 30ml of water and maintain this ratio when preparing the milk in whatever amount. Use the scoop in the container to measure.

My question is what is that is called?","Doctor":"your child may be suffering from torticolis which occurs due to injury on the muscles of neck. In some conditions its due to hematoma in the neck muscle which resolves gradually with time, and the deformity also goes away. Do an ultrasonography of he neck muscles to detect any hematoma or deformity there. Do not try to forcibly correct the deformity as that can aggravate the lesion.

We have already had all the basic tests done (Celiac, Thyroid, Metabolic Panels, and most recently an upper Endoscopy), all of which are normal. The last four months she has been complaining of belly button pain, sometimes back pain at the same time. The complaining is 3-4 times a day, she just had a UA with Micro/Culture and Stool testing for absorption done. The urine was fresh, the pH was high at 7.5, could this be due to her Prilosec medication? Also, she has mucous in her urine, but everyting else was normal...including the culture. I m thinking something kidney related, based on the fact that her bowel movements are normal any thoughts? I haven t heard back from the GI specialist yet, but I want to be prepared when we speak. Should I ask for an ultrasound to be performed? The constant tummy pain is a worry, and we can t seem to get to the bottom of it. Thanks, Kelli","Doctor":"The urine PH is worrying. High urine Ph with failure to thrive suggest only one diagnosis - a variety of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). You have to examine the urine for bicarbonates, glucose , amino acids and Ph. If all of them come high and Blood Ph comes low its RTA. You have not mentioned the weight of the baby, also i require to go through all your reports. Kindly sent me the reports and also the weight, height, head circumference of the baby. also try to measure the 24 hours urine output. Prilosec does not cause high Ph.

Check the birth card for head circumference and add 11 cms to it if it comes 0.5cms plus or minus 46.5cm, then the HC is within normal range and you should not worry. Generally babies are born with HC of 35-36 cms , in that case as you can calculate its in normal range.

I have a young daughter, about 18 months old, and tonight while giving her some water from the faucet with her leaning back in my arms, she gurgled for a moment, then seemed to swallow, and then was fine. My question is, if the water had gone down the airway toward the lungs, would her body produce coughing automatically, or is it possible for a drink of water to go down the wrong pipe without coughing?","Doctor":"No water if enters into the windpipe will produce tremendous cough and choking. Body's cough reflex will automatically try to expel the water out of the windpipe through cough. But one thing I should suggest is never to feed or let drink your child in supine position as this increases the chance of choking. Always feed your child in sitting position, and after you end your feed take her on your shoulder to burp him properly. As though cough reflex protects from food and drink entering the lungs, but even if some amount goes in the lung may cause problem, thus always feed the child in sitting posture."},{"Patient":"hi i just want to ask. my baby sort of ate an insect repelant liquid lotion. but im not sure though. coz when she gagged i put my finger inside her mouth to make her vomit and she didnt. i smeeled my fingers and it just smelled nothing like the insect repelant. i had her drink water and gargle some too. is there any other way to prevent her from getting sick?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. You should immediately rush her to a hospital where the doctor would be able to assess her and if required give her a stomach wash.

I ad given Maftol P syrup 2.5ml (when fever comes) since last 4 days. But se is not showing any sign of improvement. Please suggest what to do? Should i need her to give combiflam syrup?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on HealthCareMagic. I understand the cause of your concern. Most of fevers in children of such age are caused by certain viruses. Viral infections are generally characterised by high rise of temperature as in your daughter's case. Generally these also have an allergic component as exhibited by the running nose. Such fevers last for 5-10 days before they resolve on their own. Antibiotics are ineffective in such cases. All you have to do is to keep the temperature in control. This can be done either by cold sponging or by use of medicines. Meftal P contains paracetamol. Combiflam additionally contains ibuprofen and can reduce temperature more effectively and can be given. Give some antiallergic like levocetirizine if not given already. Cold sponging or bathing the child are effective methods and should be resorted to.Hope that helps.

The initial stool report did not reveal any stool infection although the latter has some evidence for which your doctor has given the antibiotic (Taxim O).

Please advice why echo is take for new born. He is 50 days baby","Doctor":"Thank you for posting your question.Echo ( echocardiography ) is an imaging technique for the heart and is done when some cardiac issue( structural or functional) is suspected. The reason an echo is ordered in a newborn or in this case a 50 day old baby, is mostly that the doctor might be suspecting some birth defects in the child's heart. These suspiciouns arise if there are abnormal heart sounds that are heard or if there are recurrent respiratory tract infections or certain changes in the child's x ray which suggest that the heart may be involved.Here according to the information you have given, your child was suffering from cold and excessive crying. These two symptoms are usually not enough to indicate that there is a heart problem. Hence I feel there must be something else your doctor might have noticed that gave him/her the idea to check your child's heart. In the meantime what you could do is keep a watch on your child's urine output, feeding patterns, presence or absence of swelling of body, or excessive sweating while feeding. These could help you to monitor your child's heart at your level.Apart from this, excessive crying after a bout of cold is usually due to nasal blockade as kids of his age are usually obligate nose breathers. I this case saline nasal drops in both his nostrils should help relieve the blockade.

Moreover a kid of 2 years weighing 10 kg is good if otherwise the activity is normal. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.

But I suggest you certain facts regarding viral illness. When you give paracetamol and when the fever comes down for few hours, if the kid is active at that time, then you need not worry. Only Paracetamol will do every 4-6th hourly and that too only if temperature is more than 100 F.Apart form this give him plenty of water.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 5 yr old has had a fever of 38-39 degree s for the past 5 days.

After eating, I feel nauseous, and have been getting sporadic, painful stomach cramps. This became worse yesterday, at about 1pm, as I felt nauseous after eating, and this has now been a consistent thing. I have felt nauseous constantly since then... Today, I have had quite an acidic taste in the bottom of my throat, with the need to vomit, only to find that all I do is belch. However, I have been quite close to vomiting on a number of occasions today. I am becoming quite worried, Can you give me a little idea of what it could be, just to put my mind at rest, until I see my doctor.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.The symptoms of nausea, after taking food, and cramps, acidic taste in the bottom of throat and belching is all suggestive of an Acid Peptic Disease with may be ulcer in the stomach and esophagitis due to GERD. I would suggest the following: Zantac 12 hourly.Pepcid every 3 to 4 hours when on empty stomach. Add Domperidone or such motility regulators.Soft bland diet. No aerated colas / soda/ drinks.Early dinner. No late nights.Treatment for anxiety (as prescribed / needs a prescription by your Doctor)Lying in a reclining positionWalk around after dinner.Think of the factors which increased the present problem, GERD, anxiety and try to avoid.

I have a few questions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place. No point in using antibiotics every time. It will do more harm than good by increasing bacterial resistance.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi my daughter is 4 and it s about 7 days that she has got Swollen gums between 2 of her teeth (down) at first days it was very painful and she could not brush it, now it isn t painful but when she brush her teeth it has a little blood. could you please tell me what i have to do? thank you","Doctor":"Hi...I feel that she could be having gingivitis or infection of the gums. That is the reason why they are swollen and bleeding on brushing. The other possibility is that she could be having vitamin C deficiency...but in the later case she should be having bone pains and it will be very severe. So I suggest you consult your Paediatric dentist get her checked.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I m writing to you from India. My 3.5 year old son is suffering from diarrhoea since last morning... have been giving him ORS and a little milk... hes active otherwise, except that hes getting weaker due to no intake of food... hes epileptic and is on Leveracetam 2.5-2.5 per day. He was diagonized with bilateral hippocampal atrophy when he was 2 yrs old. He suffered his first seizure at 14 months. Can i give him nor metrogyl. If yes, what would be the ideal dosage and for how many days should it continue (given the fact that its an antbiotic)? Many thanks in advance for your advice, doctor...","Doctor":"Hi...this seems like a viral diarrhoea to me. There is no need to use antibiotic unless there is blood in the stools. Actually metrogyl is metronidazole and can cross react with some antiepileptic medications. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

The most likely diagnosis for fever with no other symptoms in a 4 year old is a harmless viral illness. Typically, the fever lasts 2-3 days and resolves. I agree to treat with Motrin. However, if other symptoms arise (ie: ear pain, throat pain, vomiting, etc...), or the fever lasts beyond 2-3 days, he should be examined."},{"Patient":"sir, i am haveing twins which are born on 02/10/2014 who are premature babies of 27 weaks and boy : 1.2kg and girl 1.3 kg and till now their are haveing repetaed infections for Boy: mainly mouth infections where are using vitamin c and for girl : repeted cold and cough and fever , this cold and cough are coming for boy at a frequncy of every 30 days and for girl for every 20 days its being very defficalt for us to look after can u give me better solution to get rid after this","Doctor":"Preterm low birth weight babies are very much prone to infections as there immune system is very poor. they are also very prone of getting cold as they cannot maintain their body temperature... First thing you have to do is always monitor their body temperature.

In this case there shouldn't be any devastating consequences and the pain should be relieved by hot fomentation and pain killers. Here you child should not have difficulty in walking and generally you child should be well. This seems most likely in your case. However, pain could also be due to bony injury to the spine or spinal nerves. In this case, the pain would be much more and would be debilitating enough to prevent your child from moving about normally. Here an E.R. visit is mandatory.Also since you mentioned that your child is able to follow his normal routine, climb a bicycle etc. and the pain starts only after some time, this most likely seems to be a muscular pain. Giving him painkillers with some local relief sprays and hot fomentation should suffice."},{"Patient":"premature baby born at 28 weeks with low birth weight 10 months now with spastic lower limbs MRI showed: White matter gliosis - PVL . Dilated ventricles with no signs of obstructive hydrocephalus. what does this mean? any signs he will develop cerebral palsy?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for posting your question.Cerebral Palsy is a long term result of any kind of damage to the developing brain. This damage could be either before/during or after delivery. Preterm birth with low birth weight is an independent risk factor developing cerebral palsy. The MRI changes that you have mentioned suggest a damage to the brain which is commonly found in children born prematurely. These changes do strongly suggest that your child has a significant risk of developing cerebral palsy. Apart from that spasticity also indicates that the damage has started manifesting itself. The main signs that would suggest that your child is likely to develop C.P. are delay in attaining developmental milestones as expected or his head size not increasing as expected, continuous thumb in fist position of his hand, scissoring of his legs when you lift him in the air, spasticity of limbs etc.If you find these signs I would suggest talking to your doctor regrading consulting a physiotherapist along with starting some stimulation therapy. Apart from these regular follow up and monitoring of your child's development and progress would help you decide the next step.Do reply back if you need any more guidance."},{"Patient":"My 2 year old daughter was diagnosed with e.coli UTI ( 100000 colonies-plastic bag)on 6/17 and she was treated with antibiotics for 10 days-Rocephin for 6 days and Omnicef for 4 days. She had a repeat urine cultue on 6/18-catheterized , 12 h after starting the antibiotic and it was negative. She became afebrile 60 h after starting the antibiotic. She has been afebrile ever since. She is doing well, back to baseline. She had a repeat urine culture (plastic bag)7 days after the last antibiotic and it grew 10.000-20.000 colonies of Pseudomonas, sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. The pediatrician said that it is most likely a contaminant and we are planning to repeat the test. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for posting your question.All laboratory reports should be correlated clinically and treatment should be directed to the patient and not just the reports. These are two of the basic principles of medical practice.In this case as you mentioned, your daughter seems to have responded to the treatment and has shown clinical signs of improvement. In such a scenario if the reports show something that is not correlated clinically, it is better to repeat and confirm the result rather than blindly treating. Pseudomonas is a common pathogen found in hospital acquired infections. Hence, in this case it is likely that it could be a contaminant of the collected bag or container, or the collecting method could have been faulty. Also, the colony count mentioned is not high enough to cause concern at this point of time. Thus the next logical step would be to confirm the test and decide accordingly.If you have any more doubts regarding the case, do reply."},{"Patient":"hello - my 21 month old son dropped his full sippy cup right on his big toe this morning.

However tonight he does not want to walk on the toe, although he does not flinch or cry out when we touch the tow itself. Should we do anything to alleviate the selling or address the toenail being black now?","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your question.Blackening of a toenail after an injury is most likely due to local bleeding. In this case associated swelling and pain may also be there. Here painkillers and rest should relieve the condition in a few days.Another rare reason that could cause blackening of the toe is the arrest of the blood supply to the tip of the toe, due to the injury. In this case pain would be severe and your child would be completely unable to move or use the toe. This should be considered as an emergency and be attended immediately. In any case attending a doctor would be the next logical step.If you need any more assistance kindly write back."},{"Patient":"Dear sirs, I have a baby boy of 04(four) months old. Some white soft things are seeing during he pee. He has fever also. An antibiotic zithiumO & crocin is prescribed by the physician. Is this antibiotic is correct for such type of UTI ? please reply at the earliest.","Doctor":"Hi. thank you for posting your question.The diagnosis of UTI ( urinary tract infection) in any child especially a 4 month old should not be based on merely the presence of whitish discharge in urine and fever. It should be confirmed by getting a urine culture done and only then appropriate treatment initiated. Even if UTI has been confirmed, azithromycin ( zithium o) is not the drug of choice. Also UTI in a 4 month old child needs to be investigated further in lines of any structural abnormality of the urinary tract. This is usually done by an  ultrasound scan, a micturating cystourethrography and a DMSA renal scan. However your first approach should be to confirm whether it is the UTI that is causing this fever. In the meantime keeping his fever under control by crocin drops should be continued.If you have any more queries do reply back."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 3 years she is having fever with loose motion she had 2 vomit s before the loss motion now no vomiting. Actully we did a long journey we were sat in the ac car 4 2 hours then we came out in heat. We were in the heat temperature for 10 to 15 mints. Again in ac at home. Now please tell us Wat 2 do.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your question.Fever, loose motions and vomiting in a 3 year old are most commonly suggestive of a viral infection of the intestine. This is a self limiting condition and no treatment is needed for the infection. The treatment mainly needs to be directed towards prevent dehydration. This can be done by replenishing every loose stool with a glass full of rehydrating solution like O.R.S or home made lemon juice/rice water etc. with a pinch of salt. Apart from that monitoring of the hydration status by keeping a watch on the urine output and mental status ( whether lethargic/irritable) should be done.Along with these probiotics like lactobacillus suspensions and zinc supplements are also found to be helpful.However, if your child has blood in stool, high grade fever(>102 degree Fahrenheit ) or toxic look, it would suggest that the cause is probably bacterial. In such cases a course of antibiotics is needed.

He has been vomiting but that has stopped but he is still having diarrhea. this has been going on for 5 days. I can hardly get him to drink or eat. he is playing a little bit, but I am worried about dehydration. Should I take him to er?","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for posting your question.Diarrhea in a 2 year old unless associated with high fever/toxic look/blood in stool etc. is most probably benign viral. In this case it would take about a week or so for the symptoms to resolve completely. In the mean time, as you rightly mentioned, our main concern should be preventing the child from being dehydrated.In this case giving rehydration solutions like ORS or home made options like lemon juice with a puch of salt/ rice water with a pinch of salt etc should suffice. This should atleast be given once with each loose stool ( approx. a glass full) or else it may be given as many times the child demands.Oral intake in terms for food may not be as it was in his pre illness state and this may continue for a few days. Maintaining your child's fluid intake should be your main focus.Apart from that , if you notice any decrease in the urine output/ alteration in mental status e.g. lethargy or irritability, or any new symptom, you need to consult the e.r.

Shall I consult the doc again or wait for course completion. she is getting her canines (teeth) all four simultaneously. I wonder R the rashes related to it or medication. thanks","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your question.Your child seems to be suffering from a respiratory tract infection. The most common cause for such infections, especially when associated with running nose is viral. In such cases, appearance of a rash as a part of the disease process may be expected.Apart from this, the antibiotic prescribed to you (clamp forte) is also known to cause rashes and itching. Thus here the rashes could either be a part of the viral infection or due to the antibiotic prescribed to your child. In either case the next best step would be to strictly monitor the progression of these rashes. If you feel that they are spreading to other areas of the body, developing blisters/pus or crusts, involving the oral or genital mucosa etc. immediate medical consultation would be needed. If the drug is found to be the offending agent, immediate stoppage of drug along with appropriate treatment would be needed.If you have any more questions regarding the case, do write back."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 10 and is already going through pubery.

Here puberty in your child, though early is still at an acceptable age. In such cases, sudden surge of hormones may bring about many other changes in the body, infrequent vomiting and stomach upset being one of them.

She s had a bit of loose stool this week. is this a food allergy or a continuation of whatever she had last week?","Doctor":"HI ...this is not suggestive of food allergy. This is classically fitting into eczema as it is involving the flexural surfaces of the body. The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be dry. For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses, they become better starting from 6 months of age and they gradually get better.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 18 month old daughter was diagnosed on Monday with a hand, foot and mouth virus.

Should I be alarmed or is this normal?","Doctor":"I dont think there is anything to worry about if the baby is all right except for the stool. Reddish stool could be due to colouring agents in the food. If that would have been blood that would continue to come for days together.

Complextion and colour of skin are genetically determined and depends of the skin colour of the blood relatives.Hence no external applicators could really bring about any significant change in your child's complexion. Newborn children have a layer of hair on them when they are born, and when this layer is lost some changes in complexion could be appreciated. Also in the first year of life, the skin undergoes a lot of natural changes which are a part of maturation of skin, these may also lead to subtle changes in skin colour. However, the final colour of skin is genetically predetermined and cannot be changed. Hence focus here should be on keeping the skin healthy."},{"Patient":"My son aged 8 month is having fever since last two months. The fever comes at night time and lasts till 10-12 morning. After blood tests it has been diagnosed that mcv mch mhch are low level and rbc is anisopoikocytosis. Please guide for the reasons. Whether risky?","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for posting your question.Low MCV/MCH/MCHc and anisopoikilocytosis is most commonly suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia. To confirm the diagnosis serum iron/ferretin concentration, transferrin saturation tests can be done. Iron deficiency anaemia increases the risk of catching infections. These frequent infections could be the cause of the fever. However, it is also important to know whether the fever is significant. A fever of 100 degree Fahrenheit or more is only to be considered to be significant. air is also important to know whether the fever is continous since 2 months or comes in bouts. This would help us know if it is recurrent infections causing recurrent bouts of fever.Do reply back with more information if possible or if you have any more queries regarding this case."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter was taking this mirtazpine 30mg tablet and was having a lot of up set stomach with it and my son took her off of it.

My name is B.M.","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for posting your question. Mirtazapam is an anti depressant drug which is known to cause weight gain. After having stopped the drug, some weight loss could probably be attributed to withdrawl of the drug effect. But in this case as you said, the weight loss is significant. This could not solely be because of the stoppage of Mirtazapam. As she was already being treated for depression and all her reports have come out to be normal, I would consider the possibility of anorexia nervous as a cause of her weigh loss. In this condition low food intake is considered as the main cause of weight loss. If that is the case then I suggest keeping a food chart and consulting a psychiatrist should help.Do let me know if you have any more queries regarding the case."},{"Patient":"My two year old had a low grade fever 3 days ago and 2 days ago he walk into the door and hit the side of his head and a little knot was the but I but ice on it right away.

As your child already had fever before he hit his head, the running nose and cough could be attributed to a simple viral infection which has nothing to do with the injury. In this case all you have to do is keep a watch on his temperature, give him medicines for fever and cold/cough as your doctor would prescribe. The injury and bump on the head seems to be an unrelated issue here, for which some cold fomentation and pain killers should do."},{"Patient":"hello doc,my name is vivek and i ve a kid name athrv, age 1 yr 3 months, sex male.the patient is sick since over last two months having continuous gains/drops in fever. initially the doctor started the treatment of having infection in stomach. but that was of no use then suddenly the patient started losing his activeness and his temperature also started raising. one day his temperature got raised upto 104 deg celcius. the patient was rushed to some other specialist and he declared the disease to be pnemoniya, the doctor then started his treatment of having the symptoms of pnemoniya. after 2-3 days the doctor again said that he might have a doubt of the patient having some other issue also. he then conducted a ultrasound of the patient, the reprt of which stated that urinary bladder reveals mucosal irregularity seen involving the bladder wall. the doctor then said look i knew that there is some other problem then he stopped the treatment of pnemoniya and started paying attention to the infection in urinary instentine stating that this is the real problem and pnemoniya has got over.please advice","Doctor":"Hello Vivek, thank you for posting your question.The clinical diagnosis of any fever is based on a few principles. Firsly we enquire about the associated symptoms the child had with fever. Apart from that the extent and pattern of fever, whether it was associated with chills or came at any particular time of the day etc. These details would help us know what would probably have caused the fever and based on that investigations are usually ordered. In case of Athrv, as you informed he was initially treated for a stomach infection, then for pneumonia and finally for urinary tract infection. In such a situation you have two possibilities. Either he had 3 different kinds of infection which presented with fever over 2 months, in which case his fever should have subsided each time with the medication, he should have felt better and then again fallen sick with a new infection. If that is not the case then his fever could probably be attributed to a single cause , with the other two being misdiagnosis. In such cases investigations could give support and clue as to what the exact cause of fever is. Mucosal irregularities in urinary bladder is a very non specific finding and the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection should never solely be based on that. Associated symptoms of pain or difficulty in urination along with a positive urine culture is required for diagnosis. If you could provide any more information regarding what his urine culture report was, or what his associated symptoms were, then it would be much easier for me to provide you any further guidance."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old daughter has been experiencing night sweats.

It could also be a symptom of some underlying condition like hormonal changes, infections etc.If there are no other symptoms like fever, irritability, disturbed sleep etc. then it could be considered benign in which case nothing special needs to be done except for keeping the ambient temperature slightly cool at night."},{"Patient":"i am suffring from left upper abdomen only weekness since 4 months ...i had taken all types of medicine ...like gastic medicine ......but no improvement ..... and no pain on the abdomen .....and stool colour golden some times not frequently...why please help me.......","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcare Magic Kindly get your blood sugar tested to rule out diabetes as this can occur commonly.

Family history of heart murmur with mother, maternal grandfather & cousin. Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for posting on Healthcaremagic. Most of the fevers along with rash are caused by viruses. Viral infections do not get identified in blood work. Most children are prone to such infections. That is the reason that your doctor said that it is not unusual for children to develop rashes. Your family history of heart disease is not relevant at the moment.

Doctor suggested to use ofm along with nutrolineb and ors as he might be having some tight contractions with his intestine.Do you suggest anything else to use?He is 2years old","Doctor":"hi, Thank you for posting your question.Since your child has complains of loose stools, the most probable cause I would think of is viral diarrhea. In that case I would ask you only to take care of his hydration, which can be done with ORS. Apart from that probiotics e.g. nutrolin b which was given to you would also be useful. Any zinc supplement may also be helpful to recover the zinc lost in stools. This could be done after consulting your doctor. For the pain and discomfort that your child is experiencing any anti colic drug could be used. Also look for peri anal redness which could also be the cause for his discomfort.Unless your child has any symptoms suggestive of bacterial diarrhea such as blood in stool, high grade fever or toxic look, I would not recommend using an antibiotic i.e. ofm. In loose stools the most important aspect of management would be monitoring his hydration status.

She was getting better but since 3-4 days back all the problems have started again.She is now suffering from severe allergy problems.Now local doctors has advised her using nebulizer and steroids.She has now reported also pain in heart.Things are getting worse. Please suggest me any immediate treatment for her? also please tell me about the best doctors/hospitals in India from where she can be treated to put an end to this problem?? We are willing to take her to the best treatments available in India.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Allergy or hypersensitivity is practically excessive and improper immune response to something that is not harmful but the body confuses it with something harmful and hence produces a inflammatory response to combat it. So, the stimulus is something that our body does not normally need to react to. Dust is one such allergen. There could be many others and you have to identify the things your child is allergic to. There are two things that can be done. One is to decrease the immune response of the body by the use of steroids, as is being already done in your case. The other thing is to avoid the stimuli that the body is reacting to. There can be no other type of treatment irrespective of where you go in India or abroad. Please be patient and follow the advice that your doctor has given.It would have been really helpful if I could know the eosinophil count in blood. The chest pain that you mentioned need not be in the heart. It could well be due to gastro esophageal reflux or a lung cause and it is difficult to comment further without evaluating.Hope that the above information would be helpful to you.

He is still screaming a lot when it s time to urinate. It s not the actual urination that hurts him, he says he can t pee unless he pushes and the pushing is what hurts.

Atarax already contains Hydroxyzine which is a good antihistamine and this will take care of that mild cough and cold too.

When I look his penis is red underneath and his testicles are red where his penis lays. I ve been putting baby powder in that specific area every time I change his diaper thinking it may be caused by moisture but it doesn t seem to be going away. What could it be?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. For children being put on diapers, the area around buttocks and below penis remain moist and get exfoliated. At times such areas get infected with bacteria or fungi. This is the most likely cause of the itchiness over those areas. Eventually many of the children develop a tendency towards atopic dermatitis or eczema which needs to be assessed and treated. Please consult your doctor who can examine the region and prescribe some simple medication to relieve him. As of now, you may use candid powder and some antiallergic syrup like allegra.You may apply calamine lotion over the area should help.

Your kid might require it if he has wheeze, if not no need to use it.

Because baby would definitely require additional calcium which is not sufficient with breast milk, hence formula feed has to be given.

I am trying to say that it is so uncommon that we should think whether it is really tonsillitis and reconsider the diagnosis. You are right - we should not be using antibiotics so frequently. Using an antibiotic after a bacteriological evidence is prudent and it can be done by a throat swab culture or a rapid antigen test. 95% of kid's illness of sore throat in this age group are viral and they do not warrant antibiotic usage.Some times warm saline gargles will help a lot in preventing such recurrences.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is six years old and went in for her yearly visit today.

Our bodies use white blood cells to fight infection. We all have a baseline number of white blood cells in our bodies. These numbers increase when we have infections, even something as simple as a cold. An excess of white blood cells in the urine can sometimes be a sign of urinary tract infection, but not always.

I stumbled upon this site. I think I need a pediatrician. My 5 month old is breast fed no solids yet. She has a bowel movement every 7 to 10 days which my pediatrician said is totally fine. She has cried and strained during her last 3 bm and the consistency went from really explosive to soft but more firm. She has been unlatching frequently and eating far less although she doesn t seem to have lost weight. She won t take the sugar water my ped recommended. My milk supply seems very much lower. Any thoughts? Thank You","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.If I were your treating pediatrician I would like to know  thyroid status of your baby , if that is normal , I can assure you that we are not missing any treatable cause on time . I totally agree with your pediatrician , you can try sugar water , I usually prescribe Figolax drops . One more reason not to worry much is that problem will be resolved after one month when baby is six months with introduction of liquid, and semisolid foods and formation of bulk in diet.If your baby is gaining appropriate weight and height  and thyroid functions are normal, you need  not worry, things will resolve once baby is 6 months old.Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions , then please do not hesitate in writing to us.
