There is superimposed candidal infection in most cases (Candidal Intertrigo). Clinically intertrigo presents as red, moist, scaly patches of skin on closely opposed body folds. Foul smell is mostly due to bacterial overgrowth.Closely opposing body folds e.g thighs/groin, axilla, submammary folds etc can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area prone to Intertrigo, specially in those involved in strenuous physical activity.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked to use an OTC topical antifungal like clotrimazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks.An OTC antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg tablet, once daily would help in symptomatic itch relief.An Antifungal dusting powder e.g clotrimazole dusting powder, would not only keep the area dry but also inhibits the growth of fungus/yeast thus preventing recurrence.regards"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr Grief.

The best defence against irritation is to keep the area as dry and clean as possible.Clean the area with a soap free cleanser thoroughly and after drying it you can use a barrier cream containing dimethicone or other oils which can protect the skin from the action of the urine.

It is characterized by itchy red or skin colored raised wheals which are transient, that means appears in one place and soon disappears from there to appear somewhere else. The most common triggers of acute urticaria in children are infections and food. Seafood, meat, poultry, egg, strawberry, coloring agents etc are commonly implicated. It is subjective and any food can cause it. Other common causes are medicines and  insect bites.It is also possible that a child can develop urticaria without any identifiable triggering factor.I would suggest to you the following-1. Look for any triggering factors. If you identify it,( eg- any food item which was newly introduced) please avoid it in the future as it could trigger the rashes again.2. You could apply calamine lotion on the rashes which will have a soothing action.3. You could give benadryl syrup twice a day for 5 days. This will relieve his symptoms.4.

Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up.You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IgE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various anti-histaminics for long duration( atleast 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids.

However it would be good to rule out causes of itches especially given the fact that this particular itches as you said have been a problem since a month now and at night.Accumulation of certain substances in the body due to their not being able to be excreted can also cause such itches. This is common when the gall bladder which uses bile to excrete toxins from the body has some issues.So kindly see a physician for lab test especially for the gall bladder to rule out other causes other than allergies. Check to see if something ahs changed too in your diet or bed or what you use to ensure its not simply some allergy.

I do believe the rash you describe may be linked to the wearing of your corset but possibly not directly. As a result of occlusion & sweating, it is very possible to have developed some sort of a fungal infection & that would explain why the hydrocotisone cream is not working. Ideally, please upload a clear digital image of the region or visit a dematologist nearest you. Off the cuff, perhaps the use of a cream like Candid-B containing beclomethasone with a antifungal (steroid-antifungal combination) applied twice daily for 3-5 days may prove useful. If so, stop after 5 days & follow up with a plain antifungal such as 2% ketoconazole (eg Nizoral) for a further week. In this time, please do try avoid use of the corset. Good Luck & Cheers!

I look at myself and it looks like my skin is dry and so red like if it was peeling..what can I do to relieve this?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM, Presence of urinary tract infection and rash on the thigh can be due to similar infection of urinary tract and skin. The skin rash as I mentioned could be fungal infection of skin, or primary skin disease. A clinical examination of the skin lesion needs to be done to decide the further mode of action. A complete urine examination and microscopic examination needs to be done to look for evidence of infection. If detected the micro-organism needs to be isolated and drug sensitivity needs to be done to select most appropriate antibiotic.

I have been to 2 doctors and neither one know what is wrong.","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMFor itching you can apply soothing lotions like calamine lotion. If it is allergic rash antihistamines like cetirizine (zyrtec) or benadryl might give relief.Some cases corticosteroids will be necessary. First your condition should be diagnosed.Approach a dermatologist for that. If not scabies it can be psoriatic,or fungal urticarial etc.All have to be ruled out.Let me know if you have any further query."},{"Patient":"I have hives on my chest, upper thighs, back, shoulders, arms and neck that appear to have started out with just a couple of small itchy boils on my elbows (which I believed to be bug bites). I live in Wisconsin and it has been crazy cold the last month. My doctor initially believed my rash to be directly attributed to the lack of moisture in my house. He recommended I shorten my showers, take zyrtec (because I had previously taken both benadryll and loradadine with no result), and the temperature of my showers, only shower every other day, use a dove moisturizing soap and apply Eucerin lotion generously. It has been over a week now and the symptoms haven t gotten any better. My intensely itchy spells seem to come and go, but the rash still remains present. I shave my chest and my arms, but I don t believe this to be a factor as I ve been doing it for over 14 years. I track all of my food intake meticulously and haven t changed anything with my medications, laundry detergent, fabric softener, or any body cleansers prior to the onset of this rash. Any assistance you could provide would be GREATLY appreciated as I have been up since 1:30 in the morning trying to troubleshoot.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern for hives and boils on body.Urticaria is a common condition caused by bursting of allergy producing cells known as \\"mast cells\\" due to certain aggravating factors present in the environment. As the chemical inside them is released it produces a rash which you have mentioned. There can be multiple factors producing this condition which are included in day to day life and some times it is really difficult to find one exact cause. In your case you are correlating it with exercises, hot climate,spicy food. So it is better to stay away from the offending factors.The long term effective treatment for this is by oral anti histamine like loratadine under medical advise. It is one of the drug which is not having any side effects and can be taken for long term usage. Do not scratch or rub the skin as it can lead to further aggravation.All the best."},{"Patient":"i have three children of 9,7and 3. i fell pregnant within weeks of starting to try. i had the mirena after the second, and when it was taken out, concieved our third that day! so no problems there! i also had a mirena fitted after my third and now we decided that we would like to try for our fourth so had it taken out. we have now been trying to concieve for eight months and nothing has happened. As i had no periods with my mirena in, i didnt know what my cycle was so i have been doing opks every month so i know that i ovulate. im really scared the coil may have done some damage.","Doctor":"Hi, I think you should go for evaluation.  Do a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries. Also do a HSG to see for tubal patency.  You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to  6 months. You can also take medicines for ovulation.  Talk to your doctor regarding this.

I usually advise my patients to apply this type of cream for atleast 2 weeks to notice a visible effect.It is also not mentioned that what kind of steroidal cream (mild or strong one) you are using. A strong steroid antibiotic cream usually decrease the redness and itching in a 3- 5 days but a mild one won't have such a quick result.

Atopic eczema is associated with red itchy rash usually over limbs,face, neck(mostly over skin folds). Atopic individuals have sensitive skin which will develop eczema due to a lot of external and internal triggers. The triggers might be dust, extreme heat or cold, certain food stuffs, woolen clothes etc. The barrier function of the skin is not normal. A moisturizing lotion (for eg: cetaphil moisturizing lotion) is a must on a daily basis and reapply it 2-3 times according to the dryness. It helps to restore barrier function. Use very mild cleanser for bath like cetaphil sensitive cleanser. Topical steroid cream might be indicated to bring the eczema down if it is severe.

I was initially prescribed 40 mg/day, but about three years ago the dosage was changed to 20 mg/day. It seemed to be working well, until Tuesday, January 21st, about 2:00 PM, I noticed tiggling in both my hands after taking a shower. The tingling turned into viscous red itching hives on my hands that traveled up my forarms to my elbows. The next morning I went to the ER, where they told me that it was probably a reaction to penicillian that I was given for a throat infection. I have taken penicillin before in the past, (I m a 48 year old African American female), and was suprised to hear that after having taken the medication for about nine days, I would develop an allergic reaction. I threw the last two remaining doses of penicillin away, took the prednisone medication and benydril capsules given to me and went to bed. The next morning, I noticed that my hands had swollen up painfully. The hives I had previously on my forarms had gone away, but new more numerous smaller hives were there. I also had numerous hives on my lower torso, and thighs, some small about a quarter of an inch in diameter, some huge, almost five inches in diameter! My lower legs, feet, upper torso and face were completely unaffected. I took more benedyl and my second dose of prednisone and went to bed. Today I woke up with a swollen lip, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and even more vicious, numerous hives on my forearms, lower torso, and thighs. The benedryl capsules were useless and the predisone was not working. I went back to the ER where the doctor gave me benedryl intraveneously, and a stronger 6 day regime of predisone, and blamed this time the Lisinopril that I have been taking. My question is this. Why on earth would I have such severe hives and swelling now after being symptom free with Lisinopril for six years. Also, I wanted to add that I had been using a new body soap for about two weeks without any adverse reactions, and I had bought a new laundry detergent that I used for about a month without any previous adverse reactions. I have been going over my movements for the past week and can come up with absolutely no changes in eating, bathing, hygiene practices, etc. that would begin to address such a strong acute reaction.

HELP! :(","Doctor":"Hi,I can understand your concern for bruising at the back of skull and rashes over body.Regarding the problem of bruises which we call medially as \\"purpuric or ecchymotic spots\\" is common condition seen due to multiple causes. In your case it can be a normal phenomenon or can be due to other causes.To guide you elaborately- Bruise or the purpura is simply formed due to extravasation and collection of red blood cells from the vessels under the skin. This results in formation of reddish spots which we call as Bruise in simple language.There are multiple of factors causing extravasation of red blood cells from the vessels-1. Due to trauma to the small blood vessels of the skin.2. Due to some problem in the platelets ( the cells which prevents the extravasation of red blood cells from the vessels and forms the clot).3. Due to problem with the coagulation factors which helps in repair of the injury to blood vessels and helps in clot formation.4. Due to combination of all these factors.For the best part of the diagnosis there are simple tests of platelet function and coagulation factors done routinely in all the simple laboratories to rule out the exact cause of the problem. If these tests are normal then you can rest assured and relieve your tensions regarding the rash. Otherwise also if the test are abnormal then also can be very well treated without any problem.All the best."},{"Patient":"My husband has had a spreading itchy rash/bite type  to his chest back legs and stomach.

Go for your blood sugar check up to rule out diabetes and raised blood sugar if you are more than 40 years of age.To prevent the further spread maintain good hygiene wash it two times properly.

It is important to make a right diagnosis first. If there is a severe infection with pus discharge, you can take a course of oral antibiotics instead of applying a cream containing steroid - antibiotic combination. A steroid , especially a potent one can worsen infections. Hence you need to treat the infection first and then apply the steroid based on what diagnosis your doctor makes.As far as your query of MRSA is concerned, the only way to confirm is by sending the pus swab for culture and sensitivity testing. The symptoms per se will not give a clue about the underlying organism.Hope this answers your query.Take care."},{"Patient":"I suffer from cold sores above my top lip left handside of my face.( for about 8-10 days already) Developed cuts in the corner on left handside of my mouth,I also noticed a red raised lesion on upper chest and on abdomen left handside of body, which is very itchy and has a burning sensation.

But if its nickel that is leading to your rash, it could be contact allergic dermatitis. Daily use items such as belts with buckles, any ornament etc contain nickel in varying amounts and can induce body rashes. So you need to avoid that too. Sometimes cortisone cream doesnt work alone as its quite a mild steroid.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Your symptoms of itching and pain at the site may be heralding the appearance of a pilonidal infection/sinus, which occurs due to entrapped penetration of the broken hairs in that area and giving rise to a foreign body reaction and inflammation of the tissue. This may lead to a pilonidal abscess, which might require surgical drainage. If the above is excluded, then it could be some kind of fungal infection, with super added bacterial infection, which might be causing your pain apart from itching. Exact diagnosis is possible only after excluding the pilonidal sinus which can be done only with physical examination of the area.Therefore, I would advise you to consult a general surgeon/family physician, and  discuss with him  on the proper management after a complete physical examination.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Some of the moisturizing creams contains urea and other chemicals which can produce such irritation or allergy and produce such rashes. Similarly certain soaps and mops also may likely to irritate the already sensitized area and worsen the condition.You may need a potent steroid cream to control the same.

After reading your history I can make out two possibilities:1. Fungal infection of the area: if these are raised ring like areas or map like then this is the best possibility.2. Allergic contact dermatitis: if these are red areas with complete coverage without any ring like appearance.Do not pinch, pop or scratch the area.Keep the area dry and wear cotton clothes. Change the undergarments two time a day. DO not get exposed to extremes of environment and protect yourself from heat and humidity.For fugal infection, I suggest you to apply plane anti-fungal cream such as clotrimazole or ketoconazole. Take fluconazole 150 mg alternate days or tablet terbinafine 250 mg daily for 15 days. Do not apply any mixed cream or mixed ointments as it causes further aggravation of the problem.If at all the things are not improving in next couple of days after this above treatment then you can meet a dermatologist for best possible diagnosis.Take care."},{"Patient":"I broke out with very small bumps and rash patches on my neck and torso.

After onset, I noticed parotid swelling. This is my fifth episode. I have seen a PCP, dermatologist, and ENT specialist. Recent CBC shows 50 eosinophils, otherwise WNL. Titers are WNL. ENT consult suspected dehydration as a cause of the swelling, because I usually have associated tiredness and thirst from emotional and physical stressors being in medical school. Dermatologist suspects viral exanthem or drug allergy. I noticed hives related to cold for the past 2 years, however the parotid swelling is new this year. What do you think I may have?

Focal infection is a well documented cause of urticaria and it maybe due to infection in your parotids, you may be getting this. Once the infection is out of the system, maybe you'll get better.Or else it can certainly be that you are allergic to some drug, or some food items, which trigger the urticaria, but that only you'll have to find out and prevent the exposure.Take oral antiallergicslike cetrizine/ loratadine and see the response.

I have 7yrs old son. For past 6 months onwards,My Periods are regular but only 1 or 2 days and very low bleeding.  After i did test i came to know  that I have bulky uterus(11mm) problem. Now i am planning for 2nd child.  Is it possible that i can conceive.  At present i am taking homeopathy treatment.","Doctor":"Hi, I think bulky uterus is not a problem in conceiving.  But as you are having less menses, do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels.  If any problems are there, it can be treated.  You can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.

In the current scenario, I would ask you to get serial titers along with a sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the transvaginal route. Doubling of titers every 2 to 3 days suggests good progress of the pregnancy. Sometimes, the titers remain lower during the early days and pick up later. Take adequate rest and have a healthy diet.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Shanti Vennam"},{"Patient":"I have 3 children 21,10 & 8 yrs old.

Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 cycles.  But in your case, egg quality will be not good, so chances of pregnancy is less and abortions are more. So, IVF is a better option for you.  Hope this helps.

He is awakened from the itchiness every night. Clothes seems to irritate them. They last for about three days and then go away leaving a red mark behind.

If your periods delay then you can do a urine pregnancy test as soon as possible.  It will tell you if you are pregnant or not.  If you are peeing frequently, it can be due to some urine infections.  Get your urine checked for routine and microscopy and a culture.  Drink around 4 litres of water per day and take urine alkaliser.  You may need some antibiotics.  For conceiving, you should be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  Hope I have answered your question.

The fact that she has now developed fevers warrants and immediate consultation for proper investigation and management. You may continue to use the fever to control the fever  but getting her evaluated by a pediatrician is the best next step.All the creams you have applied are able to deal with the itches bu not the cause of these itches except they are allergies. If this is a child, the most common cause is usually a fungal infection that needs antifungal creams and not steroids.

My mother then took me to a naturepath and they said it could be oral thrush or something like that. I didn t tell them i had sexual contact because with my parents, things would turn very bad very quickly. So after taking it out it went away, did come back a tiny bit but very little and then went away for good. two months ago i decided to try my tongue piercing again. I was good with it, got a titanium piercing, no sexual contact, no smoking the whole works. And it was fine, no dramas. And now, two nights ago after no sexual contact for 2 months while the piercing heals, i had sexual contact and the next morning i woke up with the red rash around my mouth again.

It will tell you if your follicles are growing  or not.When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, injection will be given to rupture the follicles or it may rupture on its own. It can be confirmed on ultrasound.  So, if rupture is happening it means you can try naturally. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.

It is very itchy and it consists of a lot of little bumps (1 mm2) that also bleed if i scratch them too much.

In IVF, they will know about the quality of embryos, so chances of abortions are less. But you can give a try to conceive naturally also. Hope I have answered your question.

Last year i was advised a tb pcr which turned out to be positive. I was on akt-4 for three months and later on akt-2 and finally have completed almost an year of this treatment. 2-3 days back i have got an HSG done which according to the doctor shows tha my fallopian tubes are blocked. Just want to know what are my chances of conceiving?","Doctor":"Hi, I think HSG is not a confirmatory test for the tubal status.  You should go for a laparoscopy to confirm that the tubes are blocked.  Sometimes HSG can be incorrect also. So, if tubes are blocked even on laparoscopy, and it is a proximal block, cannulation can be tried to open the tubes. If it can't be opened, you have to go through IVF to conceive.

I have a recurring skin problem on my feet. It was first diagnosed as eczema and the treatment that was given was steroid injections on the part that was infected with some tablets and cream. Since it kept recurring after the effects of the injection wore off I went to another skin specialist. He too did the same thing. Then I decided to go to an allergy clinic. So I was allergic to a host of substances but not much improvement even though I took the medication and applied the cream. I then went to a homeopath in India. She diagnosed it (after sending me to a skin specialist for confirmation) as a mix of eczema and psoriasis, which she said is not curable. I was also advised to take an comprehensive blood test to test for allergies. Anyways, I took the medication. I was posted in France soon after and I started getting itchy under my armpit and other places. I saw a skin specialist there and he suggested some cream and medication. After seeing that there was improvement with the cream he did not continue with the medication. He diagnosed it as eczema (no psoriasis). But i still had the condition in my feet and no more cream left. In Indonesia, where I live, I was advised to put a Chinese cream called pi kang shuang which i did. Also to wash my feet with betadine soap and clean with Dettol. Which i did as well. Then i went to India and my sister-in-law suggested that i use Cosvate (clobetasol) and pasitrex together and this combination helped me a lot. Within a month the lesions had disappeared. But i started wearing socks very often to avoid dust mites and dust particles because I was convinced that that was the substance that was causing my allergy. Now i have it on my soles and the heels of my feet. I have been using the cosvate and pasitrex and it has improved a lot.

I used over the counter cortisone cream, and that's when I began noticing the uneven skin tone after about 2 weeks, so I stopped use. The only other person in my family to have eczema is my grandmother, however her skin tone is still even. She doesn't use cortisone cream, just vaseline and she has no problems.

These values indicate that you have less number of follicles in your ovaries.  So, you should not waste your follicles by timed intercourse and IUI.

IVF has a better pregnancy rates of 40 to 50 percent while timed intercourse and IUI it is around 10 to 15 percent. So, IVF is a better option for you.

So you may need some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after the rupture.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.

When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.

There can be multiple possibilities of the problem as per this short history. It would be better to fix an appointment with a dermatologist to check for the best possibility of the problem.Even then till that time there are certain suggestions which can be doen to reduce the problem:-Apply over the counter calamine lotion 3-4 times a day over body and not on scalp.-Do cold water compresses to reduce the intensity of itching.-Do not scratch or rub the skin as it can lead to further aggravation.-The best measure is to take oral anti histamine like loratadine or levocetrizine under medical advise.Hope these information will help.

The first places were red, really rough, dry circles beside my eyes towards the temples. Then it went up along the outside of the eye sockets, and some on my forehead, then - the main problem now - on my cheekbones and on my neck. Sometimes the places under my eyes/on my cheekbones are swollen, or puffy, and they're always red, really dry, and rough. The cheekbone places are kind of crescents or triangles radiating out from the bridge of my nose. A couple of weeks ago I had swollen hives-type bumps on my neck and on my cheekbones, and then I got two big raised, itchy ones (maybe 1/2 to 5/8 in diameter) in exactly the same place on both of my forearms. Then during the past week I developed two circular red, rough spots in the exact same place on the back of each upper arm. The neck rash itches, but the red across my cheekbones is not particularly itchy, just kind of tender and sore. I'm basically very healthy and active, I am normal weight, and I exercise regularly. I have been diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome with dry mouth and throat, a chronic painfully sore tongue, difficulty swallowing, and dry-watery eyes (which sounds like a contradiction of terms to me, but that's what the docs told me).","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using HCM.Since you are diagnosed as having Sjogren's syndrome, the symptoms you are refering may be mainly due to that. i.e decreased exocrine secretion.

Since the tendency and frequency of rashes has decreased, it means that the effect of gestone is waning off slowly and you will be completely normal in a month or two. You may take an anti histamine daily for 15-20 days for itching.-Apply local steroid cream over the red areas.-A soothing lotion like calamine lotion will help.-You may even take a short course of oral steroids for early recovery.

If your HSG had shown some signs of pregnancy or your doctor is giving it empirically, just discuss with her once again. I think you should go for a laparoscopy first to see if your right tube is actually blocked or not because HSG can give false results also.

I'll just explain shortly what's troubling me and i hope that you will be able to give me your opinion of what should i do about it. About a month and few weeks ago i got infected with the ringworm. First i had a little itchy spot on one side of my body just below breast, i wasn't sure what was it until it developed and looked like a big ring. I went to doctor and was advised to use anti-fungal cream Lamisil, it didn't go away but spread. So all my neck was infected, full of smaller rings, they developed kinda differently though, as i could see the light reddish/pink ring from start, not a spot. Gone back to doctor and got another cream, Daktacort and travocort cream, it stopped the existing ringworms growing but after 3 weeks , all my body is infected by the ringworm. As is my boyfriend's, but he seems to have it less. After closer looking (as i know by now what i'm looking) most of his arms and back is full of flaky rashes..It's wierd that on his skin they won't be as classic ringworm looking, more like batches of flaky skin, they only appear as ring-shaped rashes after the shower, so it's really easy to miss them and to show doctor. Now  my hands are affected with small tiny rings, hard to see @ first, once i've applied cream to them( they are red at first, but then change to darker rings after) but they still won't go away and never stopped spreading. My head is itching as well, so i quess my scalp is infected as well. My doctor haven't prescribed anything else then creams, but the truth is that one 30 gr ( that's the normal size for those creams or smaller) will be gone within a day as it's now developed all over my body. After so long time creaming my self and boyfriend it's getting very frustrating, time consuming and expensive. One big point i wanna make is that, i've seen them flaky batches on my boyfriend since i met him, and they were only pinky looking after shower, could he be a carrier, like i said the symptoms are rather lighter on him?  barely unnoticeable until after shower. It's most of his body just have to look really close... are we wasting the time with cream? my doctor seems to have a very little knowledge about it, and hopes to see the classic big ringworm what i have on the side and on my neck, missing all other body parts as they are so small ringworms and like  i said applying cream kinda stops them, but not really, they still remain just won't grow bigger, and look darker and harder to notice, so  he's not convinced that anything else is needed to treat the infection but cream, but 1 and half month and my body is fully infected. Should i ask him a bit more aggressive treatment? I know that my writing is kinda long, so i'm sorry, but i'd really appreciate your honest opinion. Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hi Anneli,Thanks for writing in HCM.The condition can be dermatophytosis , pityriasis versicolor   etc.Diagnosis cannot be made without visual clue.Your boyfriend can infact be carrier of organism.Both of you should be treated with oral antifungals for complete cure rather than only topical creams.A visit to dermatologist will confirm the diagnosis.Till the time you can take tab.Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily .It will decrease itching.Hope this helps.RegardsDrSudarshanMD Dermatology"},{"Patient":"dear doctor, i noticed a wart-like growth on my left nipple , same colour as the nipple. it s about half the size of the nipple. no pain, no discharge . i have had severe eczema which has affected the nipples as well, causing skin to peel and bleeding from the raw skin. i have also experienced a slight rash on my breasts last time but i don t know if it was due to my skin being sensitive. i am a 24-year old female, not married, not sexually active. i do not take drugs or alcohol or any daily medications or supplements . would appreciate your input. thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in HCM.The condition can be allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis etc.Diagnosis cannot be made without visual clue.Also few cases of breast cancer can present with eczematous skin lesions of skin over breast and nipple..A visit to dermatologist will confirm the diagnosis.Skin biopsy  may be required for diagnosis.I urge you to visit dermatologist at earliest for proper diagnosis.Till the time you can take tab.Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily .It will decrease itching.Also you may apply mild steroid like hydrocortisone 1% cream over the rashes.Hope this helps.RegardsDrSudarshanMD Dermatology"},{"Patient":"I am 18 years old.

In your case it appears to be due to physical factor, especially environmental inform of cold and warm weather.For the betterment kindly follow the suggestions below:-Most important thing to do is to avoid the abrupt change in weather from cold to hot and hot to cold. This would be the most important factor to reduce your problem.-Apply over the counter calamine lotion 3-4 times a day.-You can do cold water compresses to reduce the intensity of itching.-Do not scratch or rub the skin as it can lead to further aggravation.-Kindly stop taking oral steroids as self medication as it can lead to side effects. So you can take oral anti histamine like loratadine or levocetrizine under medial advice.Despite above measures if the problem is not getting better then it is better to consult a dermatologist for best guidance.

I have tested with a positive ANA (low positive) and have suffered from muscle pain and fatigue for the past 5 years, with no firm diagnosis.  I also have had unexplained blood in my urine, but have had a full work up on my bladder (CT and cystoscopy), with no material findings (my mother also has this).  A full CBC run just a few months ago was normal, except for the ANA. I have also tested postive for the Smith antibody and am positive for MTHFR.  Is this bruising possibly related to an auto immune condition?  Does the MTHFR have an impact?  I am not on any medication, but do take a B12 and folic acid daily.  I also took a very small dosage for predisone about 4 weeks ago, to help relieve inflammation from a back injury (twisted too much in yoga).  Not sure if the predisone could cause bruising so much later?","Doctor":"hello.thanks for using healthcaremagic.auto immune condition can cause bruising by platelet destruction. but since you had one episode of blood in urine,i will recommend you to consult hematologist.. he may advice you to go for complete coagulation assay..since you are positive for MTHFR you should take active form of folic acid like l-methyl folate.it is less likely that steroid causes bruising so lately...hope i have answered your querries satisfactorily..have a nice day ahead.."},{"Patient":"geritol  Hi i would like to know is there any chance  that i  Caint have children  i was  on  depo  shot  for  two  years  i now  have  been off for three years  been trying to have a baby since April  yet i fell to conceive so i started taking geritol  n June here we are in august i still have no baby could you please tell  me whats wrong","Doctor":"Hi, How are you doing ?

This rash starts as flat red bumps that then become crusted over. They usually start on the face and abdomen or back and then spread to the whole body. Other common viruses that cause rashes have become less common because of vaccination. These include measles and rubella or german measles. Bacterial infections can also cause rashes throughout the body.So as it is before the bee sting consult a pediarician for further advice.THANK YOU."},{"Patient":"Good day, I discovered symptoms of the jock itch around my groin area(it was itching & burning).

And if so if the baby is planted in the womb could i Carrie it I do have to have loveanox shots when I am pregeant I am stressed beyond please help ??? Thanks shelly Conley","Doctor":"Hi Shelly, How are you doing  ? I understand your concern. Let me start by saying that you can definitely conceive with the tubes clamped, but not by natural method, only by IVF or you will have to laparoscopically recanalise the tube & then try( ofcourse there is risk of tubal pregnancy then).The main risk factor I see here is your age. As you cross 35 yrs pregnancy chances reduce, but only after 40yrs it falls drastically. But the main plus point is that you had pregnancies in past , no matter how it ended, may be it was these underlying conditions which were causing abortions & blood flow problems to baby.With God's grace you can surely have baby through IVF/ ICSI. First have a Serum AMH level, this will tell you how many eggs you have in ovaries. They only give the quantity, not quality. I bet the result will be normal.In IVF you will be stimulated with hormone injections , when they are of mature size , diagnosed by scan, they will be aspirated out & at sme time your partner's semen is collected. They are taken into embryology lab, each egg is injected with one sperm. Now this is ready to grow into a baby. This is left in incubator for a stipulated time. Embryos are formed.In your country , they transfer 1 embryo at a time straight into the uterus. Baby is in uterus & it grows. So you see tubes are not needed at all !!You have to take Lovanox Injections till the end of pregnancy. This will improve the blood flow to baby, preventing abortions & also any blood flow problems to baby. Lovenox doesn't cross placenta , so will not affect the baby.After IVF extra embryos will be frozen in your name in the lab. You can use them at later date , say after this baby is old enough. Embryo's age will be frozen at 38yrs age( your present age), even when you are 40, 50, 60 or so , embryo will be 38yrs. So you can have babies till those frozen embryos get over.Pregnancy is God given, prey well, you will make it. Never lose hope & never get stressed, trust in God.hope I have cleared your queryAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"For the past 6+ months I have had a burning, itching, sometimes raised, very red rash on both areolas.

The eruption of the lesions on the skin usually happens few week to few months after the infection.Guttate psoriasis may clear completely following treatment. Sometimes, however, it may become a chronic (lifelong) condition, or worsen to the more common plaque-type psoriasis.There may be pain, secondary infection or severe itching...The disease may heal by itself,if you have mild form of disease.Local steroid and oral antibiotics may be needed.If you have severe guttate psoriasis ,you may take medicines to suppress the body's immune response. These medicines include corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate.Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburn. You may choose to have phototherapy.

It is also very painful when it is touched. i am very worried for him as he wont go see a doctor and because he just seems to think it willl dissapear and it isnt getting any better it is getting worse. any idea what it could possibly be? thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM, A painful lump on the chest which shows discoloration can be due to a number of causes. It can be due to hematoma, nevus, melanoma, etc. Pain in the lump can be due to nerve involvement. Is the lump red-purple in color? This is suggestive of hematoma. Is the lump brown-black in color? In that case nevus or melanoma can be suspected. You need to consult your doctor for clinical examination and relevant investigations. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the first line of investigation. This is an office procedure in which ceels are sampled with a needle. The cells are sampled, stained and examined under the microscope. This test will tell about the origin of the lump and its character. The further management will be decided by the result of this investigation. Thanks and take care.

I don't have any bumps except the ones I made from scratching. I looked up scabies and wondered about that, but I don't have a rash. We just recently let a girl move in with us and I am wondering if it could be that. Can you catch something like that off of furniture or anything like that?","Doctor":"hello dear, welcome to healthcare magic, Itching all over body could be due to various reasons, firstly scabies, which u doubt, let me tell you that in scabies there is an aggravation of itch in night time, rash and superficial furrow which is mostly linear, begins in extremities most commonly, does not spread through furniture or any object, most commonly spreads through skin to skin contact.Your itching looks like allergic origin, you have consumed something or used something allergic on your skin.Have you changed your cosmetics?Also get your blood sugar level checked as even in diabetes such an itch is experienced.All the best.have a healthy day.thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Donna & I have had a rash on my chest and now randomly on abdomen area as well.

It would have been great if you had mentioned your age your age/ weight & height.I would suggest you to go through the following check list & get the tests done if not done so farHusband- Semen analysis at least 2-  done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center ( examination done by andrologist), Blood sugarsWife - Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile Ultrasound scans to evaluate Uterus , Ovaries & adnexa          Confirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.           So check with HSG( Xray with dye), or SSG ( Scan with dye) or            LaparoscopyFrom your history I presume you to have PCOD ( Polycystic ovaries), this is usually associated with Obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for few months & later heavy periods with clots & fleshy masses, Thyroid abnormality & prolactin problem indirectly.You develop that extra-pad of fat around the mid-segment of body, especially waist, thighs & breast, no fat beyond elbow & knees. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall , dark shade over lower half of face, acne , oily face skin, black skin over back of neck, inner thighs & under surface of breast. May have a family history of Diabetes, especially father or his family.This will not allow ovulation to occur at time & so you cannot get pregnant, till treated.

Your weight has to be Weight(in Kgs)= Height (in cms)-100eg- If height 160cms, 160-100= 60-65 kg is expected weight.Once you reduce weight to normal range, you won't need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant & pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight -NO FASTING, No junk food/ fast foods/ red meat, reduce snacks in between mealsHave low calories food, high proteinsRegular exercise, aerobics , yoga, brisk walkingtry to reduce 2-4 kgs / month.

Acne affects mostly skin with the densest population of sebaceous follicles; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back. In your case, you seem to develop acne lesions only over chest and upper arms,..This is a common condition especially in adults,...Some general advise : Avoid using any kind of moisturising creams/ lotions or oils over the affected area. Wear cotton clothes as much as possible Do not use any liquids like dettol/savlon over the affected area You can however continue to use antibacterial soaps You might need to apply some antiacne medications like Clindamycin gel over the affected area in the morning along with another anti acne agent like benzoyl peroxide 2.5% at night. But if inspite of the above measures, you continue to develop the lesions, then you might need a course of oral antibioticsOral antibiotics have very good results in acne patients esp in those not responding only to topical agents.So i would recommend that you visit a dermatologist in that case for proper examination and treatment wishing you speedy recoveryDr Geetika Paul"},{"Patient":"Hello.

Keloid formation: Due to improper healing there is formation of elevated and progressive scar like thing which again is very itchy and sometimes painful too.3. Foreign body granuloma: It is a condition where due to deposition of foreign material (such as rock particle) it forms an area of reaction of skin.In all of the above situation there is itching and if done on higher side causes oozing.

This appears as small dark circular area or a kind of rash and later become larger map like figure. This is due to heat, humidity or certain factors related to hygiene and is quite common in children. As it responded well to the over the counter but didn't cleared completely. Also the OTC drugs contains mixture of chemicals on higher side so any of the chemical can cause mild irritation which is asked masked by steroids in the cream and then later heals with pigmentation. So is not a big issue. You can consult a dermatologist if the rash appears again for the better of the anti-fungal treatment in future.

Exceptionally, in certain cases, rashes are contagious and have the capability of spreading to the neighboring person from the host under a severe skin illness condition. The symptoms for the worst rash include fever, bright red patches around the rash with itchy swelling, sometimes removal of dermal layer on repeated scratch, spreads fast when it occurs between skin folds. Rashes reduce the comfort level of the patient and also create shyness in them.Treatment of this skin condition needs proper diagnose, a dermatologist’s prescription is required strictly. As the rashes occur in many ways and types it is essential for diagnosis before taking up the curative product. Examine the type of rash and the stage of rash, treatment at an early stage is easier than at the mature stage. Use of ointments and lotions for rashes were observed to be ineffective and requires continuous application. Thus a natural ayurvedic treatment reveals a better result within few days unlike artificial medications. Natural Neem oil can help in the treatment of rashes despite it types. Neem contains anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal properties accordingly it can reduce the swelling in rashes and its further spreading. Apply neem oil over the dry rash skin daily once.

I suspect that you have Contact DermatitisContact dermatitis is a rash on the skin that can be itchy, painful, or tender. Sometimes it can cause blisters or swelling. Contact dermatitis is caused either by a substance that irritates the skin, or a substance that causes an allergy on the skin. Some substances that can cause contact dermatitis include soaps, perfumes, poison  rubber products, cosmetics, jewelry, and medications.You usually can avoid further contact dermatitis by avoiding the substance that causes it, provided you are able to find the causeMost contact dermatitis is treated with corticosteroid skin creams or other skin creams or ointments. If the rash is severe, your doctor may suggest oral medications. Applying wet, cool compresses to the area or taking a cool bath can also help ease symptoms.Scratching the rash, rough clothing, and continued contact with the irritant or allergen can make the rash worse.Get the correct etiology (including diet) and treat accordingly.

After reading your query it seems your girl friend is suffering from Lichen simplex chronicus. It is a condition of skin where there is a vicious cycle of itch - scratch and itch. So once you start  scratching it causes more itching and it further aggravates the situation by scratching. As with defense mechanism of our skin, it gets thicker and thicker after scratching. So, in your girlfriend's part, after your foreplay and subsequent to intercourse it initiates the urge to scratch and then the rest of situation as above. For the relief part, ask your girl friend- DO NOT SCRATCH. She has to control her scratching tendency.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. Sorry to hear about your previous pregnancy loss. If you have delayed periods and your pregnancy test is negative, then you can simply wait for a week and test it again. I will suggest you to get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. In case you still have negative pregnancy test, you can simply wait for the onset of periods or induce the periods with progesterone tablets. Your treating doctor can guide you further about the same. As you might be aware that implantation bleeding occurs about 7 days after the ovulation day.  So please wait for at least 10 days after you have suspected of the implementation bleeding, and then you can check for the pregnancy.

Folliculitis is the inflammation of one or more hair follicles. The condition may occur anywhere on the skin with the exception of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

Avoid using any kind of cold dreams or hair oils..as it might increase the lesion. You can start using any topical antibiotic/antiseptic cream(like mupirocin cream) over the lesion and see if it persists even after using the cream for 2-3 days, then you need to consult a skin specialist as lesions on the scalp are very painful and also they tend to increase in size very quickly...Take some pain killers along for relieving the associated pain and discomfort Hope it helps Dr Geetika Paul"},{"Patient":"hi good evening i am 29 years old, 59.5 kgs and 5'6 in ht and undergo major operation last dec 2009 due to endometriosis ,and  they  removed the left ovary and a fallopian tube. after a mos  i undergo again utz , the result turned out as followsnormal size anteverted uterus with secretoty endometrium, normal size  ovary with cystic focus, considerations include hemarrhagic cyst and endometrioma.will it still be possible for me to bear a child? thank you so much","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1. First of all do not panic. 2.  Please consult IVF specialist.  As your only one ovary is present, you need to get its potential used and get pregnant as early as possible. With history of major surgery of endometriosis, there are chances of adhesions s and disturbed relationship between fallopian tubes and ovaries. So do not waste time in trying for any other ways to get pregnant. 3. If you have undergone hysteroscopy and uterine cavity is normal then you can very well get pregnant. I hope this answer helps you.

That is Benzal (two days in twice a day) but again I felt itchy so I use P-Scab (India- Five days evening).  Now I am 99% ok. Still one or two sopt itching.  Can I apply again this Benzal?  If the dressess are pour in Dettol water, it will kill the scabies?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for your query. I shall let you know some facts about scabies and its treatment: Scabies is caused by a mite which which makes burrows in the skin which causes itching more at night. It is contagious infection. It is treated with Permethrin5% single over night application below neck(8-10 hours). Usually this cures the infection, rarely it is repeated after 10-15 days. Itching persists for 10-15 days even after application because of irritation by the remnants of dead mites. So you don't need to repeat the application of Benzal , instead you may take any anti histaminic  like cetrizine for itching. Dettol will not kill the mite. The mite is sensitive to higher temperature . You may wash the dresses in hot water and dry in the sunlight. This will kill the mites.

To make a weak saline solution, mix a teaspoonful of salt into half a litre (500ml) of warm water. Alternatively, you could also try using an aqueous cream (eg E45 cream) to soothe and clean the area. If a skin irritant (eg soap or washing powder) is causing your balanitis, symptoms often go a couple of days after you stop using the product. But be careful - if you start using the product again symptoms can come back. Medicines Your GP will usually prescribe a mild steroid cream. This helps to reduce the inflammation around your glans. You will also receive treatment for any other underlying medical conditions causing your balanitis. Your GP may ask you to come back after a week or so to see how you are getting on with your treatment. If your symptoms aren't responding to treatment or they keep coming back despite treatment, you should tell your GP.

Many different agents can cause similar rashes because the skin has a limited number of possible responses. Very often the associated symptoms , in addition to the rash, help estabilish the diagnosis, such as a history of tick bites, exposure to other ill children or adults, recent antibiotics use, environmental exposures , or prior immunizations. Most rashes caused by viruses do not harm your child and go away overtime without any treatment .However, some childhood rashes have serious or even life- threatening causes.

I've been getting chills even though the day is really hot, i've been sweating when i sleep. It had been 4 days, and i noticed light rashes on my body (chest, arms, hand, legs, even on face). i worked out today (weight lifting) then i noticed rashes all over. i do not know if i had them before, but i think working out triggered it, because i got itchy afterwards which is why i looked.i just thought of this as simple cold or flu, but now that i get rashes all over my body, i am certain it's not simply cold.

It all started when I wore these new pair of pants that made me itch. I scratched my right shin and my nails were obviously sharp at the time and broke skin. The follicles around that area became red and swollen. It would start to heal then the itch would reoccur and the follicles would bled and the process would start all over again. I've also noticed that the itch occurs whenever the skin on my legs dry out. Should I get that checked? It's been 3 months now and the follicles are still red and swollen. It's healing, I think, but whenever it itches again, the scabs that were on the healing follicles would be scratched off.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for your query As per the details mentioned by you , it seems that the problem started with contact dermatitis due to the new fabric of pants which worsened to infection due to scratching of the skin. Once you itch , you feel a sense of relief but soon you have a sensation of increased intensity of itching every time to the extent that bleeding occurs. This is SCRATCH ITCH CYCLE which is most challenging part of the treatment. You are right ,dry skin aggravates itching. For this you may do as follows: -Avoid scratching the lesion instead apply ice or cold compresses which decrease itching -Take oral antihistaminic  for itching like cetrizine in the morning and fexofenadine at night for a few days to break the scratch itch cycle after prescription -Oral antibiotic for 5-7days Keep your skin well hydrated with moisturisers Use mild cleansing agent or syndet based soaps Wear loose fitting cotton cloths Get your blood sugar checked You may approach a dermatologist for examination or upload your pictures on our site .

It will tell you if you are pregnant or not.  Your periods can get delayed because of duphaston. Generally after stopping duphaston, you will get periods in 2 weeks. If it doesn't work, next time you can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound after taking cl9mid and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.

The burning sensation and reddness continued throughout all of yesterday and today as well. I know have a red mark that is smooth but feels numb on my upper lip. Are there any remedies I could use to heal my upper lip and bring it back to normal?","Doctor":"Hi Kim, Welcome and thanks for posting your query to HCM. Getting redness after waxing process is common problem but generally it remains for few hours only and for beyond two days. During waxing due to slight heat of the patch as well as due forceful plucking it causes redness or itching and bit pain for few hours but if the wax patch is slightly more hot or and the force applied is too harsh then can cause injury to superficial skin and deeper hair roots leading to inflammation of the area remaining for longer period of time. The very first thing you do is  to give cold compressions for multiple time a day, application of calamine lotion to soothen the skin, can take antihistaminic drugs to relieve the feeling of itching and burning and not to touch the area repeatedly. If the redness is very high or there are any sign of mild vesciculation or blistering then should apply mild topical steroid cream under medical guidance. Kindly avoid direct sunlight for at least 5-7 days after proper healing to prevent any pigmentation of the area. Be careful nest time when you are doing waxing of any area.

Wound management is very important and should be done properly. Dont wash with soap, plain water or normal saline is recommended for cleaning the wound. Avoid Neosporin, because it can lead to allergic contact dermatitis on adjoining areas. Hydrogen peroxide or Eusol dressing is ok, followed by application of antibacterial creams like Mupirocin or Fusidic acid etc. Change the antibiotic i.e. Bactrim DS to broad spectrum antibiotics like Cephalosorins etc because the former antibiotic sometimes causes drug allergy like itching etc. All needs to be done under supervision by a dermatologist."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 35 years old male, i ve been facing itching problem from last 6 months, Before the itching starts I feel acidity very badly. i ve been to several doctors so far nobody have had able to diagnosis my problem, i have done my full body test and all of them were normal.

It is important whether you are also suffering from any other problems like Upper respiratory infections, sore throat, cough or tonsillitis.Sometimes even dental infections can lead to such lymph node swellings. Such lymph node swellings usually occur as a protective response in our body in order to contain any such infections.. Also, if it is an acute swelling, as it is in your case, then it is relieved as the primary infection heals or is treated,, So you might need a course of oral antibiotics along with pain killers if the lymph node swelling and the pain persists.

I had the same problem a couple of year ago but it subsided in around 1 month (in autumn)I have been through many website and read about scabbies and other potential dermatological disorders but the systems seems to be different from what others have been describing and different from the pictures. please help.34 yr old male of indian origin living in South Africa","Doctor":"Hi thanks for writing here.You are having night time itching which is not relived by cetrizine,it may suggest scabies,but it has to be confirmed.Go through following points which will give you a clue for diagnosis. 1.See whether there is itching on your palms and soles because adult scabies never involves palms and soles.2.whether there is itching on your face ,adult scabies will never involve face.3.see for lesions in genitals,in almost all cases scabies have genital involment.4.ask other family members or household members for history of itching.From these clues you can find out whether it is scabies or not.If you have scabies then you can apply permite5% cream to whole body starting below the neck ,apply entire cream in a single application ,and continue with tab.atarax 10 mg at night.If you think it is not scabies then it might be allergic rash ,in that case you can continue with tab.allegra 180 mg at day ,and tab.zyrtec at night.if still no improvment then it will be better you consult a dermatologist."},{"Patient":"I'm Danielle.

You need to apply a topical steroid containing mometasone cream over the affected area atleast twice a day over the affected area inorder to decrease the inflammation.. And take some oral antihistamines like levocetrizine once a day. You should use a sunscreen (spf>26) everytime before you go out in the sun in future,.. Regarding a sunscreen, it is important that you should apply adequate amount of sunscreen over all the exposed areas before going out in the sun,,It should atleast be applied 30 minutes before any kind of sun exposure and it should be reapplied every 3-4 hours in you stay out in the sun... Hope it helps Dr Geetika Paul"},{"Patient":"Hello I've developed a rash of sorts. It started with a red bump on my abdomen that has now proceeded to become a flat dark dry patch (10mm x 20mm) that is still itchy. Other similar lesions have cropped up on my thighs and inner arms though smaller.The only thing that has changed recently is that I've cut out a lot of processed foods and am drinking green juice regularly (kale cucumber celery and raw plant protein powder). Im a vegetarian. I used a topical over the counter steroid cream which helped temporarily. The rashes have been there for two weeks now.","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to Healthcare Magic Forum Seems like you have developed Pityriasis Rosea(PR) PR manifests as an acute, self-limiting, papulosquamous eruption with a duration of 6-8 weeks. PR has been linked to upper tract respiratory infections. The disease typically begins with a solitary patch, usually salmon-colored, that heralds the eruption and thus is commonly referred to as the herald patch or spot. This initial lesion enlarges over a few days to become a patch with a collarette of fine scale just inside the well-demarcated border. Within the next 1-2 weeks, a generalized exanthem usually appears, although it may occur from hours to months after the herald patch. This secondary phase consists of bilateral and symmetric lesions with scales .This phase tends to resolve over the next 6 weeks, but variability is common. Pruritus is commonly evident in 25-75% of patients and usually of mild-to-moderate severity. The eruption is symmetric and most commonly involves the thorax, back, abdomen, and adjoining areas of the neck and extremities. As is a self-limited disease; treatment is supportive. Topical zinc oxide and calamine lotion are useful for pruritus. If the disease is severe or widespread, topical or oral steroids may be used. The skin rash may take 6-8 weeks to clear up completely..You can take oral antihistamines like levocetrizine for pruritus. Hope it helps Dr Geetika Paul"},{"Patient":"I have been scratching my legs because they felt really dry, but when I looked down after awhile I noticed that my legs had dark splotches all over them.  I'm not sure if I scratched so much that I created these splotches or if the splotches themselves are why my legs itch.  The splotches themselves don't itch, but the entire leg does.","Doctor":"Hi, you are having xerosis of legs,i.e. dry skin of legs. You are having severe itching. Blotchy patches may be ecchymosis due to severe scratching. Rule out anaemia, DM,thyroid dysfunction or other internal diseases by blood testing.

Bleeding from multiple sites, the skin and the nose should warrant exclusion of an associated medical condition. A complete blood count could be a good start t ascertain that the number of platelets are i sufficient numbers. Itchy skin lesions could be due to an allergic reaction. But persistence of these lesions on anti histaminics, without nay dominant classical allergy associated symptoms like itchiness and rapid spread should warrant considering other causes. Fungal infections, bacteria and viral sources could be at the origin. I suggest you consult an internist for a more comprehensive analysis of your health status and management. Thanks for the query and best regards, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"Hi,I have a medium sized oval patch on my lower leg. It is around 1.25 inches in diameter.

Or he might be a case of atopic dermatitis.This is yet another causing development of eczematous lesions and itching and is seen mostly in young children... You should start adequate moisturisation of the skin,,,apply oil like almond oil or olive oil over the body everytime after taking bath,,Use good moisturizing creams /lotions atleast 2-3 times over the body..He should wear cotton clothes as much as possible and use cleansers meant only for sensitive skin for taking bath... All these will reduce the amount of itching over the body. Now as far as the black marks and scars are concerned,some degree of improvement will occur with prolonged usage of moisturising creams, but if they still persist, then you can apply a mild lightening agent containing kojic acid and vitamin C over the affected areas twice a day.

Is there anything we can take or do to help us a lil? Please help","Doctor":"Hi, I think you should go for evaluation first.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries. Also a semen analysis of your husband should be done.  If everything is fine, you can take some medicines for growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  when follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after the ovulation.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 months.  Hope this helps.

I have had it on and off for about 3 weeks but it has gone away on its own until now when I have had it for about a week. I have recently been on Doxycycline and stopped taking them about a week ago. Not sure if this is related or not? Thanks","Doctor":"hi Going by your history,, you have itching and rash involving your face, chest and neck...Now there are two possibilities ...either it can be acne lesions(acne corporis meaning pimples of body) or it can be a photosensitive rash.. Acne vulgaris is a common human skin disease, characterized by areas of skin with seborrhea (scaly red skin), comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), papules (pinheads), pustules (pimples), nodules (large papules) and possibly scarring. Acne affects mostly skin with the densest population of sebaceous follicles; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back. Some people are sensitive to sunlight; this is known as photosensitivity. Photosensitivity may produce a rash, which is known by the general term, photodermatosis. Patients may not associate their skin complaint with exposure to light. It is not always the bright summer sun which is responsible; some people also react to sunlight in winter, and very sensitive subjects may even be affected by fluorescent lamps indoors. As in your case, only the exposed sites are involved, so you need to be sure if you have any degree of itching or burning sensation on exposure to sunlight,,,, And as far as doxycycline is concerned,,it is a commonly used drug for acne.....but at the same time this drug can lead to photosensitivity,,,so I would advise you to make note of both of these conditions,,,,and see what your symptoms resemble....and if you are still in doubt,then its always better to tale expert opinion,,,, Hope it helps..

It starts out with a tingling feeling and then gets extremely itchy. Once it gets to the itchy phase, little bumps will start to form and then eventually cause my forehead and sometimes entire face to swell . After the itchy phase, the area will turn to scabs. This only happens once a year (usually after the first major exposure to the sun) and then lasts for about 1 week from start to finish. The doctor doesn t know what it could be either. Do you have any ideas?","Doctor":"hi,, You seem to have a rare photodermatosis ie hydroa vacciniforme Hydroa vacciniforme is a skin condition, a very rare, chronic photodermatitis with onset in childhood. Mostly affects children aged 3-15 years. It is more commonly seen in females than in males. The cause of hydroa vacciniforme is usually unknown. Long wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA) is most often implicated. Sun-exposed areas are affected most and include the face( forehead, cheek) and ears. In most cases signs and symptoms usually start to occur about 30 minutes to 2 hours after sun exposure and present as: Mild burning, itching or stinging Development of tense, swollen bumps (papules) and blisters (vesicles); there may be facial swelling These turn into dimpled, pit-like papules with black scabs (necrosis) on a red and inflamed base Lesions heal to form pale depressed scars The rash usually first appears in spring with recurrences throughout the summer months. Some patients may have other symptoms, including mild inflammation of the eyes and swelling of face In most patients the condition disappears by the time they reach adolescence, although the scars are permanent. Patients with hydroa vacciniforme must take measures to avoid sun exposure by following sun protection strategies. This includes applying high SPF sunscreens with UVA blocking agents and wearing protective clothing. This may prevent or reduce the number of recurrences of the condition. Oral medication may be useful in reducing outbreaks but does not reliably prevent hydroa vacciniforme lesions.

This kind of allergy can develop to any cream, gel, ointment or lotion used during the procedure.

You are having fungal infection of the above mentioned areas known as Tinea cruris. You should take oral and topical treatment of antifungals for around 2-3weeks period under advice of your doctor. This problem aroused because of your occupation which I suppose is having exposure to heat and humidity. Both of these things increases the propensity of fungus to grow. So you should  maintain proper hygiene with twice daily bath, wearing loose cotton clothes, changing your undergarments and general garments two times a day and maintaining a dry environment to prevent growth of fungus which will prevent recurrent/ further infection.

As for the cause of the dry patch, it could be because of drooling saliva during your sleep. Avoid frequent usage of steroid creams like hydrocortisone on the face as in the long run they will cause thinning of your facial skin. Take care."},{"Patient":"I m a 79 year old man, wintering in Fl.

Thanks for calling H.C.M.Forum. You are having itchy skin, raised bumps, pimples, rash under arms, pimples on coller bone. You have used prednisolone, antihistamines, and permethrine cream, but in vain.You have allergy that is right, but there is associated super infection .

These patches start out as dry patches of skin....then the dry skin flakes off and the raised patch turns purplish red and somewhat shiny and is still somewhat itchy. This all started about a week ago. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi, it seems that you are having either lichen planus or psoriasis vulgaris. Both the condition are benign. Do not worry.

It is characterised by hypopigmented mild scaly patches  , with mild or no itching. It is harmless and self curable condition.

Still, you may consult the expert. ..ok"},{"Patient":"I have been running a fever for the last couple of days and am feeling better today but i woke up this morning with what looks to be acne all over my face but it also is on my arms. (I wash my face twice a day with acne cleanser followed by a toner and then i spot treat zits with benzoil peroxide ) I havnt been introduced to any new foods or products like shampoo bodywash or anything of that sort. They don t itch or bother me in any way other than my self esteem. Just wondering if there is a diagnosis.","Doctor":"Hello! Thanks for writing to HCM. As you were already having fever it seems that the rash you have developed can be due to fever due to some viral illness.Fever which is viral in origin, can be related with rashes all over the body. Acne does not cause such acute eruption of generalized rash. Possibilities that can be considered are rash with fever could be due to: -Dengue fever -scarlet fever, -measles, -other viral exanthems Viral exanthems need supportive treatment with paracetamol for fever and antihistaminics for itching and to decrease rash.It will subside gradually in 5-6 days. Rash can also occur due to the drugs and antibiotic like amoxicillin,sulfonamides, or other drugs like NSAIDs. I would like suggest to take dermatologist opinion for clinical correlation. Hope this could help you better."},{"Patient":"I have a rash that started on my left hip. Just red spots. Now it has spread and the spots look like dry red circles. It is on my inner thighs, both hips, and all over my back. Can you give me an idea of what it may be? It started a couple months ago and I ignored it because it wasn t bothering me and wasn t getting worse. It spread and got itchy today.","Doctor":"Hi ! It could be cushing disease or stop taking any steroid if you are taking apply calamine lotion and consult with dermatologist. Take care."},{"Patient":"Thanks Doc. My wife had what it appeared to us as an insect bite. But our primary Dr diagnosed as a ring worm case. He prescribed a topical cream and pills. It has been about 9 days and this reddish spot is now about 2 inches in diameter and it still itches and it is becoming painful. We will most than likely get to an specialist (a dermatologist?). Could this really be something else, worse? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi , The condition can be tick bite,tinea/fungal infection,insect bite, impetigo etc. A course of oral and topical antibiotic will help in case of impetigo or insect bite. As it has not responded to antifungal creams fungal infection is unlikely in this case. A visit to dermatologist will be helpful for determining the diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Hope this helps. I will be available for follow up. Regards. DrSudarshan"},{"Patient":"I have developed some sort of itchy rash on my penis .

Thanks , regards","Doctor":"Hi, I think progyluton alone will not help. As you over responded to clomid, I think you should go for a natural cycle tracking of follicles.  In natural cycle, only one follicle grows. When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  If follicles are growing naturally, you will not need clomid. If not, try with a low dose of clomid.  Discuss with your doctor.  Hope I have answered your question.
