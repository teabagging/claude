Such feelings of unfamiliarity with surroundings are also seen in other conditions (such as migraine, with use of recreational drugs, alcohol, during periods of stress, during an illness etc) or may happen on their own.In my practice, I often see these in patients of panic disorder and sometimes in migraineurs; treatment of these conditions gives relief from this symptom too.Zoloft is not likely to be the cause for this feeling.In my opinion, you should continue Zoloft and report the symptom, along with any other complaints you may have, to your doctor during your next appointment.I hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"I had an abortion last year in september and my boyfriend left me to deal with it,he even avoided me after it..whenever I talk I cant knock some sense into his mind,do you think he is going through what Iam going through?Now its like he owes me,I feel like Im going to end up killing him..","Doctor":"Hi dear,Abortion is a major life changes in you and that's why you anxiety features and after such event it is normal to have such features but as you have such symptoms persist since 1 year you must take treatment.consult psychiatrist for detail history and mental status examination.is there any other associated symptoms like sleep and appetite disturbance, sadness of mood, loss of interest etc..There are many medication by which you will be all right like SSRi , SNRI , benzodiazepins etc..also do meditation, yoga, exercise which also helps you to overcome anxiety.Thank you"},{"Patient":"hey i was curious about bumps the showed up on the side of my penisew thiere somewhat in a clump but then there one under my head of my penis and one by the hair area and its not herpes cause there no blisters there the same coler as my skin and cant pop i tried... any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi, The cause of such bumps depends on your age, pain and sexual activity.

Any thoughts on what this may be or feedback would be helpful","Doctor":"Depressive disorder is a medical condition that has psychological symptoms. 1. It may at times be precipitated by a stressor. However, often there is no psycho-social stressor.2. An episode of Depression may last from weeks to years. It is not possible to predict the length of episode unless there is a clear pattern in the past (even then one can't predict for sure).3. Episodes of Depression are often self-limiting. One recovers on one's own.4. It is possible that you may never have another episode all your life in future. However, if you do get the symptoms you describe in future, you should consult a psychiatrist.If Depression is treated, one can recover much earlier. Another reason, why one should treat Depression is that medicines that are successful in treating earlier episodes often work in the future episodes. The chances of future episodes being longer and more severe increase and the chances of response to medicines decrease if earlier episodes are not treated with antidepressants.Combination of antidepressants and therapy such as behavioral or cognitive behavioral therapy gives best results."},{"Patient":"Wife is bipolar and pregnant.

Can Oneirophrenia last this long without any relief?Which tests would determine this diagnosis?","Doctor":"Oneirophrenia is a clinical diagnosis that your doctor makes after reviewing your history. It is a diagnosis that is now RARELY made.You should consult a psychiatrist who will evaluate you in detail. Dream-like state is a symptom of several conditions. Depending your complaints and history, the doctor may or may not order some tests.You say that you have sugar problem. If you are diabetic, then follow guidance of your doctor regarding medicines, diet and exercise.I hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Hi,  I was just diagnosed with Vitiligo.

Am from Mauritius and am a female of 22 years old. I have OCD and Agoraphobia . I am scared to get on buses and flights since I get panic attacks. But this week I have to take a flight for Mumbai and it\`s a 6hr flight. Please can u suggest any medecine that I can take so that I don\`t experince those attacks on the flights? I am not following any treatment because my parents do not agree that I suffer from a problem. They say it\`s all in my mind . But am really nervous to get on this flight. Please help me. On doctor said to use clonazepam 0.5mg thrice daily and propranolol twice daily. Will this be fine? Can i get these medecines in the pharmacy without the doctor\`s prescription? And will it have any side effects? Please help me. I am really worried to get on this flight. Thanks a lot.","Doctor":"1. Clonazepam and propranolol will be helpful. You may experience drowsiness. If you are asthmatic, don't take propranolol. But otherwise, these are safe medicines.However, usually these medicines are not available without prescription. Ask your family doctor for a prescription. Another medicine that will give quick relief is Alprazolam (Restyl, Xanax, Alprax) 0.5 mg just before the flight. Be careful. Do not take Alprazolam for longer period without doctor's guidance. It is very habit forming. You will probably need a prescription for it.2. You should explain to your parents that your have a medical condition. It is not all just in mind. It will help a lot if you request your doctor to talk to them.3. If you take proper treatment for OCD and Agoraphobia, you will be able to live a productive and happier life. Therefore, you should see a psychiatrist. He/she will evaluate you, counsel you about your condition (also counsel your parents) and initiate proper treatment regime. Usually a combination of medicines and psychotherapy such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy gives best long term results.I hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"I am a 30 yr old female with severe anxiety and depression,am taking zoloft, and nuerontin.

I'm a manager for a helpdesk, handling team close to 40 staff. Out of which I've noticed one employee to be very poor in job. I'd paid close attention to this employee and my finding was bit disturbing. His analytical skills are poor. Any queries he handles would take a lot of time for his own understanding first and then addressing. I was under the impression that he's lazy or not interested in the role but my recent finding really shocking. There's a new frame work implemented and there's a bit of theory part to learn first on which assessments would happen. During a Q&A he turned out to be very knowledgeable and answered almost all answers. Why shocking for me is, he was found to be the bottom performer for past two consecutive years. We had tried to put him on training under several trainers but didn't find any improvement. Right now he's under a critical review failing which he might be asked to resign from the company.

You have mentioned that of late you are feeling more irritable, having sleep and appetite disturbances, etc. These symptoms could indeed be indicative of a depression. Also considering the fact that you have a family history of depression, it is more likely that you could be slipping into a depressive episode.Since this seems to be affecting you quite negatively, it is necessary that you seek professional help. Earlier the intervention, better will be the outcome and recovery. Treatment for depression is available in the form of medication to relax your mind and lift your mood (antidepressants) as well as counselling. So, I would suggest that you ask your doctor for  psychiatric consultation so that you can have a detailed evaluation and further treatment.Best wishes,Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar MRCPsych.(U.K)"},{"Patient":"Hi, My family member appears to have Borderline Personality Disorder since last 4-6 months.

This condition is called a Gender Identity Disorder. This is a condition where a person strongly feels that he or she should be the opposite sex. They often feel \\"trapped\\" in their bodies and experience a lot of discomfort with their present gender.You have mentioned that you want undergo sex change surgery. But, like your previous doctor has mentioned, this is a very major step and hence is a long drawn process. First you need to have a detailed psychological assessment and counselling from a psychiatrist. Then, if you are deemed to be a suitable candidate for sex change surgery, this has to be planned in stages. You may have to take long term hormonal medication.So, as you can see, this is a very complicated and long drawn purpose and moreover in India, it is quite expensive also. So I would suggest that you first meet a psychiatrist in person for a detailed evaluation and counselling.Regards,Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar MRCPsych.(U.K)"},{"Patient":"Hi, I ve been sick for the past week with a bad cough..

She is a heavier girl, and told me those were chafe marks. Of course I ve been freaking out tons. I should have known I would. For the most part reading other peoples stories online is freaking me out more. If I could find something to worry about it would probably be herpes.

All you need to do is to consult a local psychiatrist and request for some depo injections which could be given according to her clinical condition. depending up on the situation as necessary your psychiatrist may choose the option of ECT ( electro convulsive therapy) depending up on her clinical condition. depending up on the improvement and her compliance , she may be later switched to oral antipsychotics.

Thanks for consulting with health care magic.The symptoms which you have described in your post are consistent with a mood disorder.  This condition is characterized by a wide range of internal emotional states and loss of control over them.  It may include both depressive episodes as well as bipolar episodes.  To determine what is causing your mood swings and how best to treat them, please let me know if you are having any of the following symptoms and for how long - Depressive symptoms - sleep disturbances, loss of interest, guilty feelings, loss of energy, loss of concentration, appetite changes, suicidal thoughtsBipolar disorder symptoms (manic) - easily distracted, irresponsibility, racing thoughts, agitation, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, increased in goal-directed activities.   It is important to distinguish exactly which symptoms you are experiencing as the treatment for bipolar disorder is different from the treatment for depression.

Thanks for consulting with health care magic.The symptoms which you have described in your post are consistent with Grief/Bereavement after the loss of your mother.  Grief can commonly mimic symptoms of depressive episodes (sleep disturbances, guilt, loss of energy, concentration, and appetite changes), and may even progress to Major Depressive disorder if it lasts several more months.  Although it is normal to bereave up to 2 months, grief affects each person differently.  I would recommend undergoing grief counselling or seeing a psychiatrist if your symptoms persist; They will be able to help you cope with your loss.

He is a 19-year old athlete ... plays football & throws for track in small town college (about 2 hours away from home). He is 6 1 and weighs approximately 250 lbs. He had several black out episodes during his weight lifting this week. The trainers have been checking BP daily. Fairly normal when sitting ... 120/80, but spikes to 149/96 when standing. His pulse rate remains in the 60s. Trainers say no need to see doctor ... that he is just stressed. Does this sound like anything to be concerned about?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  His trainers could be right. When our body is in the influence of exercise, it is natural that the blood pressure reads on the upper side. You are concerned about your son's BP. At the same time, is your son worried? If so, that could be another case of anxiety induced hypertension. In both these cases, there is nothing to worry. Taking enough rest should clear the problem. Diagnosis of hypertension is made usually with every 2 hours readings over a period of at least three days.If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website.

I suggest you not to worry much. You must be able to distinguish between depression and disappointment (blues). Disappointment is common and you should overcome that shortly.If your cause of disappointment is panic attack, you should understand that panic attack is due to anxiety. Anxiety could be due to stress or due to some underlying thinking or developmental pattern. Please consult a psychologist to determine what is the source of your anxiety.

Approximately 3 years ago my ast & alt levels were very slightly raised & an unltrasound (they were checking source of upper right quadrant ache) showed mild fatty liver. I have since dramatically decreased my alcohol intake, and go through alcohol breaks. I still, overall though, drink WELL above the recommeded guides for women on vacation & on most wknds but nothing that seems to raise eyebrows of those around me (other wknds I abstain completely). My liver tests were normal after this up until one in 2/11 until one this past week which was done in conjunction w/ routine physical- at the time I had not had a drink in approx a wk but had a lot the holiday wknd prior. All bloodwork was good except my AST was 54 (alt was 35). I have been using marijuana from a vaporizor for a bit over a yr & also taking hydroxycut recently (I am actually very small but prefer to be about 3-5 lbs less than my current weight) and am wondering if I should have further testing/be excessively worried & also if the marijuana &/or hydroxycut can impact ast levels? Apparently the dr (not my regular) is not recommending further tests, but believes the ast is related to alcohol. I worry that after so many yrs of drinking it s to late for me & that the damage is irreversible (I know most liver tests come back normal when there is a problem & so feel must be something bad wrong if they are abnormal) which causes me to actually want to drink & just give up. Would an ultrasound be sufficient to tell me if I am past the pt of irreversible harm or is a biopsy necessary?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

You can talk to him in indirect way like what he wanted, how he feel in life, how things can be improved in his view. There are lot more that can be discussed at dining table and there is no reason that we should argue to get results.There is provision under law which states that a person can be get treated after permission/order form sub divisional magistrate or higher rank officer.

I have searched it on the internet and after a thorough research i found that I am having ADHD(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) .I am 100% sure about this thing.I am not diagnosed by any specialist but I am sure about this. I am trying hard to control my activities and behavior,but I feel that there is something in my mind which is resisting me to do that.Right now,I am writing this question,but there is something in my mind which is saying to me just leave it come on go do something else. The consequences which I am facing right now are : getting poor grades,feel highly depressed,becoming less socialized,poorer energy level and becoming poorer in physical and mental health also. Its not like that I am not having interest in studies,but whenever I start studying,some distraction comes in my mind and says leave it and when I start doing something else again I get distracted. I am enjoying dreaming the life.Even when I am talking to someone,there is something else going in my mind.This also leading to lack of sleep,because when I try to sleep I start doing imaginations which are very different from the reality.Sometimes when I am alone I start talking to myself in some imaginary picture.I am hating these activities because these are taking me far away from the realities.

What you are experiencing is not completely abnormal. Do not worry. It is quite common to have lack of concentration in adolescence. How is your relationship with your parents? Do you have any close friends? Try and speak to someone openly about it. Best would be one of your parents or next best choice a close friend or sibling. Since when are these problems occuring? Do you have specific interest in something or someone that you are aware of? Try concentration exercises by studying in a dark room with only the table lamp. Even if it takes longer than it used to ... get up only once you have finished a topic that you had aimed for. I am not prescribing any medication as of now as we should try without it to begin with.

It is normal to experience such behaviour and try different things in teenage and adolescence. It is definitely wrong of you to do such acts in front of your sister. Try and curb that habit.

Try and get involved in outdoor fun activities like sports and adventure games which are a much healthier hobby than your present one.

Mandy","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. The neck spasm, as your doctor correctly said, could definitely come due to stress. Prolonged stress naturally brings stiffness to the neck muscles. Then we start twisting and turning the head so as to alleviate the pain and stretch the neck muscles. That is a bad practice. Instead of releiving you off from pain, the actions give you more pain and results in spasm. Just ignore the soreness and do not move your neck muscles for three days or so.

I cry when someone gets upset at me, dissapointed in me, or even raises their voice at me. Im 16. I cry when i think of past events, when i get angry angry or frustrated, when i cant express myself well, when i cant say whats on my mind because im not sure where to start, and when i feel misunderstood. For example, i said something to my boyfriend and he took it the wrong way, i tried to explain it to him but i got choked up and just started crying and i couldnt stop. I try so hard not to cry but i just cant help it. i have been like this for as long as i can remember. One time when i was little, i had a necklace and i was flinging it around and i accidently hit him in the face with it. he told me to stop. i started uncontrolably crying. is there some kind of disorder where you excessively cry? im not depressed, ive very happy and content with my life. i just get so upset over the silliest things. what can i do about this?","Doctor":"hi, You appear to be emotionally oversensitive. This is a personality trait which could be seen in many persons. There I no need to treat it untill you are having intense discomfort or inability to function properly due to this problem.Usually you get good things to happen after crying, that might be carrying forward this for these many years.If you are strongly willing to charge this, you can control it. Introspecting yourself- try to answers the following questionsWhat all matters often triggers the cry?How long will it take after starting of the issue to crying?Infront of whom you can cry and whom you can't (won't) cry?What will others often do when you cry?Now try manipulating these factors and get control over your emotional expression.Often we feel that tears come immediately but if you recall properly it takes time.First you gets thought about certain issues.Different issues mingle up causing some emotional turmoil. Finally you start crying.So in the beginning start observing this pattern. Gradually you will be able to prolong these.There is no need to loose sensitivity but can increase the empathy by trying to understand others.Mediation and mindfulness will help you in this regard and they have scientifically accepted modes for handling ones' emotions.If this leads to more severe problems like feeling to harm yourself or punish yourself then contact a psychiatrist or psychologist."},{"Patient":"In March of 2014 I fell on the ice.

But she does not want take any medicine. Once she stopped the medicine she behave unusually and coral with all our family members. Should i feed the medicine without her knowledge? What are the side effect due to irregular consuption of medicine?","Doctor":"hi,I appreciate your caring towards your wife. Duration of use of the medicines will be told to you by the psychiatrist and usually it is for 5 years after she is living without any psychotic problems. Stopping medicines before that increases chances of relapse of symptoms. Added will be risk of complications like aggression, suicide and so on. Taking irregularly leads to development of resistance to medicines and need to go for medicines with higher cost and/or side effects. Laws of certain countries ban giving medicines without patients knowledge. It is always better to take her to confidence. Discuss the problems she has taking medicines. If she has any side effects that can be tackled. If she has any apprehension that can be resolved.If she jas problem tskig tablets, She can opt for alternative methods like syrup or depot. With depot injections she can have injections once in 2-4 weeks and gradually her oral medicine can be stopped.So my advice is to decide on the path by considering her wishes too."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

The symptoms that you have mentioned are suggestive of underlying depression and anxiety. Feeling nervous in public places can be a manifestation of social phobia. However, more details regarding your symptoms would be needed to make a confident diagnosis.I would suggest that you should consult a psychiatrist for complete evaluation and initiating treatment. Medications like escitalopram and paroxetine might be helpful. You can also opt for treatment with cognitive behavior therapy which will help you overcome your depression and anxiety, feel relaxed and change the negative thoughts that you harbor.I am sorry to note that your father died when your mother was pregnant. One of the reasons that you feel anxious might be the absence of your father while you were growing up. But to definitely say that is is the cause of what you are going through is difficult. Depression and anxiety usually results from multiple factors interplaying including chemical changes in brain, psychological factors and social factors.I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"After 3 years of my relationship i had a breakup with my boy friend. and now I don t know how to move on in life since last six months I ve been depressed like hell...

You seem to be depressed and if even after 6 months, the symptoms are persisting, you should consider starting treatment for the same.You should seek a psychiatric consultation for the same. Ant-depressants like escitalopram or sertraline will be highly helpful in your case. In addition, you should start exercising daily. It will help you relax and feel better. Additional option of treatment with supportive psychotherapy can also be considered. It will consists of multiple sessions focusing on letting out your emotions. You can discuss with your psychiatrist regarding the same.I do hope that I was able to answer your query.

If you 're using any drugs or certain long term medications can cause this. So stop taking illicit drugs. Contact your physician if taking any medicines. Certain seizures or epilepsy can present similarly. This will get relieved by medicines.Certain stressful situations can lead to these. So try handling stress properly or equip yourself with better coping skills by help of a psychologist.If you feel low, anxious with low energy and negative thoughts/worries, Depression or anxiety disorders could be a cause. Rarely these occur without any specific cause called as Depersonalisation-Derealisation disorder.Mediations like escitalopram fluvoxetine will help in all later cases.

You are telling you don't have much friends. What is the reason?Do you feel anxious on meeting or talking to strangers?Do you worry that people may make comments upon you?Do you fear and avoid-   Eating, Drinking Telephoning in public.  Talking to people in authority.  Acting, performing or giving a talk in front of an audience.                                          Throwing or attending a party.                                          Working or writing while being observed.  Urinating in a public bathroom.  Being the center of attention or entering a room when others are already seated.                                        Expressing a disagreement or disapproval to people you don't know very well.                                          Looking at people you don’t know very well in the eyes.                                          Returning goods to a store or Resisting a high pressure salesperson.So if many of these are the problems you are facing then you need to meet a psychiatrist/ psychologist. Few medicines and more importantly psychotherapy will help you. You will be developing skills to be assertive and to confidently engage in social situations during the therapy sessions.If there are any other causes for not making friendship, please revert back to us explaining the situations you are facing and I will be happy to help you out."},{"Patient":"Believe this is genetically passed on disorder. Would go to get professional assistance if a confident suggestion was brought up. I am not trying to self diagnose but the closest I could find online was Anhedonia.For the longest time I have dealing with issues pertaining to lack of interest in things, lack of finding any sort of pleasure, and generally getting no excitement from anything. This issue is getting worse and worse as I get older and with medicine advances nowadays I feel as though there is someone out there that can diagnose the problem and help me find some resolve. Until recently I thought it was just a problem of depression or anxiety and have been on different medications throughout the years which never ended up resolving the core issue. I believe anxiety and depression are a byproduct of the true issue. I recently had a real open conversation with my mother and found she has lived with this same issue her entire life (a couple other relatives on the same side have signs of this also). Both my mother and I are not lazy people, she got a degree from Ohio State University and after raising 3 kids she went back to school and got another degree in nursing but she told me it was hard to get going on it. I got an Electrical Engineering degree from a reputable university. I believe there is a solution out there and not only would I like to resolve the problem for myself but I would love it to be resolved for my mother, though she says she doesn't have many years left anyhow I would love her to live those happily without this issue.The only medication that seems to have a good affect on me is adderall. I hear all kinds of excuses about why of course I feel better and concentrate more when I am on it but Adderall seems to really work on whatever area the true chemical imbalance or affected areas are. Maybe not 100% better but I feel almost normal and functional.Every time she would try to explain to someone the issue she ended up with the same response I got when I tried to explain so we both just gave up. We both get \\"you worry too much\\", \\"do not be so negative\\", \\"just relax\\". Its not a state of mind, it would seem to me to be a chemical imbalance of sorts. Here I go trying to explain it:     * In the evening or early morning I am almost in a vegetative state (since the adderall is only working from about 9am - 2pm). I do not feel like doing anything, could genuinely care less too do anything, and stress out about the day passing me by.      * Nothing seems to interest me, nothing brings me enjoyment, or bring me pleasure. It's not like I do not try, I live in a big city for christ sake and I cannot find anything to grab my attention.     *           * I recently went to a hockey game (playoff) and could not get into it, NBA game, comedy shows, movies, sky diving, etc.; nothing          * I go out to nice restaurants, local clubs, and been watching the world cup at bars; nothing          * I do not have a extreme problem at making friends but keeping them and getting close friends is impossible. I stress about the next time everyone wants to go out and will I have time. (and I know; relax, take it easy. Much easier said than done)     * One other thing I loved to do was travel internationally and now the older I get the less enthusiastic I get. I start thinking about all the things that have to be done to get there and back instead of getting excited about the trip.       * Nothing wows me any more which makes me look unsociable and grouchy      * I am uncomfortable around people, but am a very friendly person and most everyone seems to like me but I feel pressure from this. I am an elevator talker (short conversations and goodbye). I actually like being around groups of people and have fun but constantly feel pressure to converse instead of just enjoying the time. I get depressed and cannot concentrate on anything because I am thinking about other things in the future I need to get done but I understand those things fo not need to get done immediately.      * I think about all the negative things but am not a negative person.      * I also get anxiety and panic attacks because I cannot live in the moment I am always thinking about each and every step that has to be done for example:      *           * Going to a restaurant I think about having to get there, getting a table, ordering, getting the food, paying for it, leaving, getting back home. I would rather just stay home.      * I am so quiet in group situations people think I am a grouch, unsociable, or even lazy.      * I am told I worry too much but I really cannot control it     * Even this entire statement it sounds like a big whine fest but it is sincerely not* I could answer or give more examples if asked. I have had this problem for years and have yet to be properly diagnosed. Others have attempted treatment such as bipolar (wrong in 1987), depression/anxiety (maybe but have been on multiple different medicine), even told when in High School I may have a learning disability but, come on, I got an Electrical Engineering degree from a ranked Engineering university. It's getting worse and I do not want to live a life of not enjoying things, not able to have friends, not getting excited like others when something great is happening. I have other feelings such as empathy, love, fear, nervousness, caring, etc.I force myself to exercise 3 to 5 days a week (weights and cardio), I eat healthy (vegetarian and sometimes just raw food diets), I make sure I get the protein and vitamins I need daily. I am 6' 1\\"; 165 lbs. No one in my family has a weight problem. There is no drug or alcohol abuse. I do not smoke. I was never a lazy person, I have tried and participated in almost every sport you can name (Jack of all trades, master of none). I have lived in different countries around the world (including Iraq in 2003 - 2004 as a civilian contractor). I have a very good job and am seen as the expert in my field but it too is starting to take a hit from this. When I was very little I had no problems making friends and having really close friends. I did find enjoyment in even the simplest things. I anticipated things like going to an amusement park and getting excited. I used to have passions for fishing, skiing, tennis, rocks, weather, learning, etc. I know what it is supposed to feel like but now the world, people, and everything is bland. I am NOT even close to any suicidal thoughts. I am very sane and rational. It is just driving me crazy because I remember and would love to enjoy things again, have close friends, volunteer and do things on the weekends for others. Would love to show what I believe to be my true self and not come off as whiny, negative or lazy. This is a serious issue and if others are being mis diagnosed and feeling this way I feel for them because it is not a fun way to live. There are so many lost opportunities.Any incite anyone could have about this would be so much appreciated.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

I have started masturbating for around last 10 years and that 3 to five times in a day and almost daily. Now I even discharge my semen in 20 second to 1 minutes. I want to quit the masturbation but do not know how, because it has become an addiction for me which is effecting my career and my life. Please suggest me how to quit.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  Masturbation is not a sin, unnatural or unhealthy. But anxiety about masturbation is unhealthy. If you masturbate 4 or 5 times a day, what is your career or occupation? Where do you get time and energy to masturbate this many times? That is the answer. Forget about masturbation and engage yourself in your career. Once you gain passion in your work, automatically your masturbation will stop.

I doubt if its his personality disorder that makes him think this way.Please help me sir.","Doctor":"hi,Your husband seems to be involved in activities without much regard to long term consequences. This kind of impulsive behaviour is seen in many psychiatric disorders including personality disorder. If this pattern of behaviour could be traced back to his childhood/adolescence and if it is seen in his other areas of life too, like in education, job, social relationship then chances of personality disorder are high.Presence of psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder may many a times masquerade with these behaviour. So I would advice you to have him a detailed evaluation by a psychiatrist.Medications and therapy may help many with such problems to a significant extent, with at times leading to complete relief. So do not loose hope and visit a psychiatrist with your husband."},{"Patient":"Im 16 I cry a lot. Adults of people my age when they try to help i cry when they talk about whats wrong with me i cry.

Your frequent crying can be related to underlying depression which results in low mood. In addition, you seem to be manifesting anxiety which results in feeling nervous in front of people and shaking.You should talk to your parents regarding your symptoms and consult a psychiatrist for complete evaluation.

I would have liked to know if she is on any treatment for selective mutism.The current set of symptoms of not being able to see for some time, even though her eye examination coming out to be normal might be due to another anxiety related disorder termed dissociative sensory loss. You should consult a psychiatrist for complete evaluation of her condition.  One of the possible reasons is that she is facing some kind of stress at present and not expressing it to anyone.

Have you done any investigations so far for this problem like endoscopy, barometric pressure studies of your esophagus (the food pipe)? Is the urge to vomit frequently followed by manual attempts of inducing vomit by fingering in mouth, retching etc. to relieve nausea? Do you have excessive craving, urges to gulp down food or have excess worries about your weight or fears of becoming obese? I would like to have this information from you. For the time being you can consult a doctor about chlorpromazine in 25-50mg/day or levosulpride in 50-100mg/day dose to relieve urge to vomit.

Is it safe to have 200 mg fluvoxamine per day ?Hi, at the age of 23 I was having Fluoxamine per day 175mg  to 200mg ( morning 1.5 (75mg), afternoon - 0 and night 2 ( 100mg) ) for Depression, OCD, ADD and social anxiety. In this dosage i was feeling very well and happy. Along with that i was also having Alzolam 0.25 mg per day. I was continuing this for 5 years. In between i sometimes stop medication completely and whenever i feel discomfort i restart the medication.  Later on i switched to Venlafaxine and then to Sertraline thinking that it could give me much better benefits however it didnt' work that well with me. I don't know whether it is because of lower dosage of what i am having.  Currently i am having sertraline 25mg per day however it gives me side effects like on interest in sex, feeling sleepy, etc. Around 9 months back i was having Crestor 10mg per day for cholesterol but now i have stopped it.Now i want to switch again to Fluvoxamine as i think this was working well with me than any other medicine but in a higher dosage.  Is it safe to have 200 mg or 175 mg per day ? I am a 30 yr old health male.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. First & foremost I would strongly urge you to NOT to change/switch any medication on your own & what ever are your issues with current set of medications should be discussed & dealt with only under supervision of a qualified medical doctor preferably a Psychiatrist. I am using strong words since all these aforementioned medications come under category of SSRI/SNRI & taking 2 SSRI together can cause a potentially dangerous condition named serotonin syndrome; while abruptly stopping any or all of these medications cause a flu like discontinuation syndrome; not to mention flaring up the symptoms of original illness (OCD; Depression in your case). Coming to your query; Fluvoxamine is a very good choice for controlling symptoms of both OCD & Depression & maximum permissible dose of Fluvoxamine is 300mg/day in a healthy person; so depending upon your symptom response; 175-200mg/day is perfectly fine. I would like to know your symptom profile of both OCD & depression so that I can advice whether we can plan for additional therapy in addition to medications for quicker response. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? i am a person suffering from social phobia. now a days i feel very nervous . i don't know how can i be cured . i am a resident of ranchi. could you please help me find a suitable doctor who can cure me.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. I would like to know your symptoms of social phobia. Usually social phobia is a disorder of excessive & unwarrented fears of unfavourable scrutiny by elders, seniors, strangers which causes avoidance of social situations. Are you suffering from any or all of these symptoms? If yes; You should consult a Psychiatrist (CIP Ranchi is a very good institute nearby you) for detailed evaluation & diagnosis. Social phobia is treated by combination of SSRI group medications (escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine etc.) along with anxiolytic medications like propranolol, clonazepam etc. on sos basis. In addition, there are various talk & behaviour modification therapies named as Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) where you will be taught how to control anxiety provoking thoughts; role plays, relaxation exercises etc. Though bit long; but treatment is very effective & long lasting.

He has asked us to do Neuropsychometric test. what this test is? how much duration does it take to complete this test?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. To put simply, a neuropsychologic assessment is a written cum verbal test which usually takes 1-2 hours depending upon a patients ability to complete the test. The test is meant to assess various domains like memory (immediate, short term, long term memory etc.); visuospatial ability (construction, dressing, alignment); intelligence, reasoning, abstract thinking, general awareness, executive function skills etc. to name a few. This test is usually done to chalk out degree of deficits incurred in a person after stroke, head injury, in a person of dementia (Alzheimer type & others) ; so that certain techniques to regain functional ability known as cognitive remediation can be attempted. If required, you can get back to me with test results so that cognitive remediation can be planned.

She was tested for Lyme s disease and the results were negative..but there can be false negatives.Trying to sort this out and find a new doctor who would dig deeper, but I am having trouble doing so.Any advice would be appreciated.Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. I would like to know what are the symptoms in your sister & how the symptoms/deficits have progressed (gradual/rapid) to ascertain whether or not she has a dementia process. Later on we can dig deeper by means of various investigations like MRI Brain, Neuropsychological assessment, test for Vitamin B12, folate levels, thiamine deficiency; test for neurosyphilis etc. to name a few causes of dementia 9Since you have already tested & ruled out Lyme's disease). If treatable; for example Vitamin B12 deficiency, neurosyphilis etc. we can use appropriate drugs to reverse these conditions & halt further damage to brain. But the damage already occured can not be reversed. Irrespective of all these causes; basic treatment modality of dementia is by drugs named cholinestrase inhibitors+ NMDA antagonist drugs (Donepezil+ memantine) which help to slow the dementia progress & allow more functional & fruitful life. In addition there are certain behavior techniques named as cognitive remediation taught by Psychologist & Psychiatrists to help these patients utilize their depleted brain reserves more effectively.

Since then she is extremely fragile, she can t do regular activities such as getting up off a chair or getting out of the car without help. During the last week, we have noticed her memory is also affected. Forgetting to turn off the oven, not knowing where an item came from, and even thanking my father for running the vacuum (which he had not). She has an appointment with a neurosurgeon at the end of August. Just wondering if this memory loss could be caused by her spine issue. Thanks","Doctor":"hello; thanks for the query. Simple answer NO. Spine injuries will not cause memory issues. But given her age 70+ years; these may easily be senility related memory issues or onset of a process known as dementia. You might have suddenly started noticing it as she has recently suffered a fall & hence you are taking her health issues more seriously than before; whereas there is a possibility that there might be very subtle signs of memory difficulties over last 6 months to 1 year which might have gone unnoticed. Your description of her problems seems more likely to be due to dementia (probably Alzeihmer's dementia). Hence get her evaluated by a Psychiatrist/Neurologist & start appropriate treatment. Hope this helps. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Hi, i am 28-year-old male, i got married 6 months ago, till now i am not able to ejaculate during intercourse, i had to finish it off by masturbating.

For what indications does your daughter has been prescribed Fluoxetine (Prodep) plus propranolol (Betacap). In general fluoxetine is a very safe drug to use in children & shows good symptomatic improvement over 2-4 weeks. But a few children may develop increased impulsivity, agitation, or irritability. These symptoms appear to be more likely to appear in children who are predisposed to develop, bipolar disorder. Hence, be sure to let your child's provider know if she has ever experienced similar symptoms before without drugs also before or if there is a family history of bipolar disorder. Also, is there any benzodizepine drug like clonazepam or etizolam prescribed by your doctor? Since fluoxetine & other similar drugs of SSRI group tend to cause anxiety, irritability in first week due to so called activating side effects of SSRI. These activating side effects are most troublesome with fluoxetine but they can be easily controlled by adding clonazepam, etizolam (Benzodizepines) etc. for first 1-2 weeks. In either case, consult your doctor immediately or revert back to me for further help. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"hi. i am 23 years old.

Im a 16 rising senior in highschool, and im considering going back on concerta for my ADHD. however, I ve been generally concerned with the side effects of the medication, specifically how it effects blood flow in the body. As an athlete, restricted blood flow can be a significant impairment, one that could cause me to pass out or become dizzy (only what ive read, im not prone to these symptoms otherwise). Also, I ve read that it negatively effects the penis, which is a concern of mine, since I am sexually active. Is there any thing I should know about going back on concerta? Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi, I suppose you are having are having some trouble with your ADHD symptoms and thus wishing to get back on Concerta (Methylphenidate). I assume you are currently not on any medication.The effect of concerta on pulse and blood pressure varies from person to person. Some may get to a higher level and some may get into lower level. Its difficult to predict before taking the medicines. But whatever it may cause, affecting your athletic performance because of blood pressure changes is unusually rare. drinking lots of water with minerals and salts would often be sufficient to manage low blood pressure.Even on sexual function its action varies. Some gets more libido and some lessened. Its effect on penis as such is minimal with rare incidents of prolonged and painful erection called as priapism. Medical community is not yet sure of this occurring due to concerta as it is always seen when used with some other drug. Also this side effect is much commoner with Atomoxetine (another ADHD drug) than concerta. If you develop erections lasting longer than 4 hours should seek immediate medical treatment to prevent long-term problems with the penis.Hope this will help you in taking a right decision and sustain activities without getting hampered by ADHD."},{"Patient":"My name is michelle i have panic attacks i was on meds for them a while back but they made me sick last sunday i felt bad i been like having hot flashes titness in chest felt like i couldnt breathe right i sometime get light headed and getery im only 18 years old and it scares me is it a panic attack or something elese","Doctor":"Hi Michelle,Panic attacks can be caused by many physical disorders like hormonal disturbances, heart ailments, respiratory problems, drugs and medicines among many other.

So the hematoma decreased significantly, although some of it is still detectable under the fingers - it is a hard area comparing to generaly soft penis when flaccid.

Diet: Ensure intake of an adequate quantity of fiber. 2. Servings of vegetable salad and two servings of fruits (One preferable citrus fruit). A proper diet does miracles and rejuvenates. Orange is a good source of anti-oxidants. Avoid junk food and fast food especially pizza, burgers and excessive sweets.2. Ensure adequate water intake: Follow the rule of one which I usually advise. one glass of water one hour before and one glass of water one hour after every meal will ensure adequate consumption of water. The recommended intake of water is two to three-liter in a day.3. Early morning Exercise: Brisk walking for 30 minutes at a stretch preferably in the garden will be very helpful. Walking is the best exercise, it also promotes the release of endorphins (naturally occurring pain killers released in the brain) which causes mood elevation and a generalized feeling of well being.4. Avoid tea or coffee or nicotine and alcoholic beverages5. Start your day with a glass of lemon water with two spoons of honey added.6. Don't take work so seriously: We all have the feeling to excel in our respective fields and don't spend adequate time with our self trying to understand our own needs. Spend time with your family and friends.7. While working takes frequent regular breaks: Taking regular breaks will not waste the time, but it will increase productivity, concentration, and reasoning.8. Avoid late-night socialization9. Avoid starring for a longer time at the computer screen or TV for a longer time10. Steam inhalation before going to sleep will be very refreshing.11. Multivitamin and calcium supplement.Hope I have answered your query.

There is no drug to treat learning disability. For relaxing, try relaxation techniques and yoga or meditation to help you sleep.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are concerned about your son's mental health problems. The symptoms that you have described in your son could be due to various causes such as a mood disorder or a psychotic disorder.

Sometimes, if the diagnosis is not clear, a short period of in-patient stay will help the doctors observe him closely and reach the correct diagnosis.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are concerned about the difficulty in writing that you have been experiencing. From the description of your symptoms like shivering when writing, applying too much pressure when writing and losing control while writing, you appear to be suffering from a problem called \\"Writer's cramp\\" or \\"Focal dystonia\\".This problem is often worsened by anxiety and this is why your problem seems to be more when writing in the presence of others. I would suggest that you have an EMG test to confirm the diagnosis. There are effective treatment strategies like medication and biofeedback techniques which can help you overcoming your problem.

Based on my impression; Your mother is suffering from a condition known as delirium which has occurred in her case due to fluid-electrolyte imbalance/hepatic damage/blood dyscrasis (in simple terms, some changes in body's balance/homeostasis). Delirium is characterized by altered sleep-wake schedule, intermittent bouts of suspiciousness, ill formed delusions, hallucinations, impaired activity or overt aggression alternating with periods of normalcy (known as lucid interval).

We do tend to feel isolated, at times unable to share, vent out feelings & find a sense of connect especially with elders. Hence, these emotional outbursts can occur often & may become disabling. A simple advice is create a support group of dedicated friends, family members to whom you feel close. Secondly consult a Psychologist/Psychiatrist where you can discuss your troubled areas of life, learn mindfulness techniques, cognitive behavior therapy sessions etc. which teach a person to learn to live in present, achieve greater mental stability, greater control over emotions. Lastly, too many times depressive illness in youngsters presents itself as increased irritability, crying spells, rebellious behaviors etc. hence a Psychiatric assessment & treatment if required shall help you get back to normal life soon.

Based on your description about your son, constant shaking hands, irritable behavior, unemployment, rebelliousness are a strong pointers towards addiction or illicit substance use. Hence, first & foremost you need to covertly keep a watch on him, his activities, his money spending habits etc. are there any unexplained thefts or financial loses at home? After ruling out substance use, we need to screen him for depressive illness or a psychotic illness like schizophrenia which can also manifest similar behavioral problems.

Shivering of hands is a concern, which can probably be due to the side effects of some drugs which will require a consultation.4 to 10 are abnormal behaviors which will have to be addressed by your consulting Psychiatrist in the very next visit. (Probably you can ask for an earlier appointment)My suggestions to you are:1. Is she suspicious towards others?2.Is she talking to unfamiliar people?3.Is her water intake poor?(If not you can make sure that she is properly hydrated)All the above drugs (Not sure about Kemdrin-is it spelled right) are psychiatric drugs in optimal doses, but they can sure be adjusted after seeing your psychiatrist.

However he was able to get admission in a local engineering college and started his studies under Electronics and Telecom Engineering around 1999. Since then he was somehow able to continue studies till 3rd year with off and on performance. But now he is unable to concentrate on any study though he will try to open a book but will start thinking something else; seems he pretends studying.Medication - He has been undergoing treatment and taking medicines indirectly for last 7 years – Oleanz 10 mg (and Lamitor); resperidone etc Observations on his behaviour:1. Lifestyle is irregular – He will get up in time and get ready for a day or two and then for next many days he will not shave/bath at all.  Similarly he will not take the main meal for the whole day till evening.Sometimes he used to get ready early in morning to go to his college; he would try to go to college but finally would not be able to do so .2. Sometimes laughing when alone 3. Talking to himself when alone 4. Writing the same points again and again. These are same objectives he wants to achieve like waking up early, completing his engineering degree course, getting a job and establishing a company. He will also narrate that he should keep himself safe from a particular neighbor. This insecurity must have some link with his college as well.5. He will not take medicines himself, so he is being given medicines without his knowledge.On the positive sides:1. Likes to meet known persons, and sit with them though he will not talk at length. And will go to market if somebody asks him to buy some household etc.2. He was good in his academics, won many awards in drawing both at city and state level.3.

These episodes described by you suggest hypomanic episodes and need detailed psychiatric consultation.

Incidentally her periods were also due and started same day evening. She has been prescribed 2 tablets per day of Encorate Chrono 300. I would like to know if this medication is required since reports were normal. What are side effects considering her autism?","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. I presume that your daughter is a diagnosed case of autism & if yes; is she going for any of social reintegration, speech, behavior therapy? These therapies are administered by Psychologists & are available at apex institutions like PGIMER Chandigarh, NIMHANS Bangalore etc. Coming to second query, can you describe her exact symptoms during epileptic fir? Was there tongue bite, blood from mouth, drooling of saliva, up-rolling of eyeballs, spontaneous urination in pants, falls or injuries during this epileptic fit? If any of these were present, we can say with certainty that it was a REAL EPILEPTIC FIT. As epilepsy & some brain lesions commonly occur in patients of autism; hence MRI & EEG were done. Both normal MRI & EEG do NOT RULE OUT A DIAGNOSIS OF SEIZURES!!  Lastly there is a condition called as catamenial epilepsy which includes women of whom their seizure exacerbation is aligned with their menstrual cycle. The medication encorate chrono seems a good choice; but may require dose hike depending upon your daughter response. Do revert back if you need any further help. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"hello. recently I have been doing and hearing and even seeing strange things. sometimes confusing things for what they really are. Like thinking a dog is a demon or a tree for a husky. I hear voices telling me to do things and if i dont they will kill me. and ive been taping my foot and staring at objects constantly just waiting for them to move without me touching them","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. May I know what is your age, gender & whether you have recently started using any substance like cannabis (marijuana), amphetamine, opiates, cocaine etc. or have you recently suffered any accident with head injury or loss of consciousness? At present, based on information provided, there are few possibilities including excessive fears or anxiety about some events which is making you act in aforementioned manner. Is it the case? have you been stressed out recently or are not able to sleep properly since last few days? last possibility is that of suffering from a Psychotic episode where hallucinatory experiences are known to occur. Hence I would first suggest you to talk about these experiences with a family member or a significant other followed by consultation with a Psychiatrist where based upon assessment & diagnosis medications &/or lifestyle changes can be prescribed to help you recover.

If i get excited or am in a stressfull situation it takes me longer to recover. what is going on,help please","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Can you kindly specify your age, gender, your current work profile & whether you are in habit of consuming alcohol, tea, coffee, smoking cigarettes etc. during evening hours usually post 8pm? Based on current information, I would say that many people after a certain age (50-60 years) tend to become light sleepers with frequent sleep disturbances with slightest changes in sleeping patterns, habits etc. Hence, to avoid this, we can practice some good sleeping tips known as sleep hygiene. These are 1. Waking & sleeping at a fixed time 2. Avoid over/under sleeping 3. Avoid daytime naps 4. Avoid cigarettes, tobacco, caffeine after 8pm 5.Use bed for sleeping only 6. Dont stay in bed for more than 20 minutes if you are unable to sleep after retiring to bed. Additionally there are drugs like melatonin (available over the counter); ramelteon, agomelatin (prescribed by doctor) which reset your circadian rhythm & help you sleep better. Lastly, I would like you to get back to me with what makes you excited or when do you feel stressed out, how is your mood, energy levels & since when do you find it hard to recover from stressful situations.

I've been sailing for about 3 months now and I'm still troubled with seasickness specially when bad weather comes. Somewhere in my zyphoid point, it hurts inside when I presses with my two fingers. Is this anything to do why I easily get the problem of sea motion sickness?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Motion sickness is indeed a troublesome aspect of prolonged voyage. It usually occurs due to failure of middle-ear equilibrium structures to adapt to constant state of motion.

I don t think about the consequences before I act and in turn most of my family and friends turn against cause I always feel like my point is right. And im living with this guy and im so worried about what hes doing behind my back but I don t even think hes doing anything. Why do I always feel like things are so wrong and why do I snap at the drop of a pen?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. What your current set problem is seemingly a tough middle phase of relationship. Usually during early part of any romantic involvement; physical attraction prevails & tends to hide every flaw mutually perceived by partners. As one starts to settle in a relationship & relationship matures; one starts finding many undesirable things in one's partner & then gets into overdrive to correct them. This leads to conflicts, frequent quarrels & the earlier perceived charm starts to vanish. Hence, to have a great relationship; first thing is accept your partner as he is & dont try to correct his perceived faults hastily. Secondly, trust him for a while at least till the time when you don't find 100% conclusive proof of cheating. Men are usually solution givers & women are usually fault finders. Hence, sit down with each other; talk things calmly. You can also read a book by John Grey (Men are from Mars Women are from Venus) or consult a Psychologist for marital therapy. Dont worry, try things differently & you ll settle down fine. Hope this helps. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"My husband is a sex addict. he disclosed his sex addiction about 6 weeks ago.

Trazodone, Paxil, Prazosin, Lithium, Prolixin, Provigil. My neice often goes off her medications so she can feel free to drink. My concern is for her safety and the safety of others when she is driving!","Doctor":"Hello; thanks for the query. Short answer is its absolutely safe to let her drive provided she is not engaging into drunk driving or driving under influence of some illegal drug!! What we need to understand is personality disorders(PD) can not be equated with serious mental illness like schizophrenia where a person while acutely ill may lose a certain judgement for a while but not always! On contrary, PD should be considered as an extreme form of behavior which defies common societal norms, brings significant distress to patient himself/herself & his/her near ones & hence needs modification. PD can not CURED by all the plethora of medications you have mentioned in question (I wonder why she is receiving so many of them for!!); rather there is a form of talk therapy known as dialectic behavior therapy (DBT) devised by Psychologist Marsha Linehan & colleagues. DBT is usually given by Psychologists & Psychiatrists. Hence find out a Psychologist qualified to give DBT & encourage your niece to enroll there. If she is willing for a change in her current state of life; I am sure DBT can work wonders for her! Hope this helps. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"I have taken extacy before 2 years ago for about 4years.

I am glad to know that you have given up using MDMA (Ecstacy). If you are sober for more than a year; then your current set of symptoms are unlikely to be related to use of MDMA. Are you using any other illicit substance or using alcohol/hypnotics? Because during withdrawal phase from these, one might get similar symptoms. After ruling out all of these, simple solution is consult your Psychiatrist who after taking your detailed history will make a formal diagnosis of which type of anxiety disorder you are suffering from. Afterwards, depending upon your profile; you will be prescribed one of the SSRI type drug (Escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine etc.) along with sos rapid relief anxiolytic drugs like clonazepam/etizolam to tide over the excessive anxiety episodes.

Presently, elevated creatinine levels & symptoms described appear unrelated. Though you should consult a Nephrologist for a detailed evaluation & treatment for elevated serum creatinine levels. The symptoms you are described can occur both in acute exacerbation of cardiac angina and during panic attacks. While panic attacks are relatively benign & easy to treat; angina misdiagnosed & ignored can be fatal. Hence, rule out any cardiac cause by doing blood cholesterol, ECG, Stress ECG testing (Bruce protocol) & other tests as relevant/advised by doctor. Once these are ruled out; we can do a detailed evaluation of her panic attacks. If these are indeed anxiety/panic attacks; then we can use SSRI drugs like sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram etc. along with rapid relief sos anxiolytics like clonazepam, etizolam etc. These along with certain relaxation techniques (deep breathing) can take care of her trobles very quickly.

Based on your description; your wife seems to have some set of personality disorder (PD) most probably cluster B (emotionally unstable, borderline type). PD per se not an illness cured by medications but a form of extreme behaviour defying societal norms, causing distress & dysfunction for patient himself/herself & family members.

Additionally, considering that your wife has endured a lot of adverse conditions at her parental home & with mother in law; family therapy (FT) was advised to you.

I feel like a shell of somebody i used to be. Around a year ago i was a regular user of the drug mkat, and now i really worry that this is a long term side effect. At the time i was using the drug i was suicidal and constantly upset; a common short term effect of a heavy user. I have no physical health problems and in a physical respect i have a clean bill of health. I feel that my anxiety/paranoia is gettin worse and that i cannot handle it by simply thinking of other things. It is always in the back of my mind. It is intensified not when i am drunk but the next day, i have crippling anxiety that i did something wrong that i cannot remember or that i said something to make the people around me think little of me. What do i do now? What is wrong with me? Do i need to go and see my gp?","Doctor":"Dear User,Thanks for using health care magic.From the available description it appears that you are either suffering with OCD or developing depression.

I am severely unhappy in my job hence have chosen to quit. But I know that even this will not 100 percent help I how I feel. Most days I feel unhappy and sad. Some days I start crying for no reason. I tend to suffer from mood swings on a regular basis. These usually occur many times during the week. I also seem to feel tired quite a lot. I have lost interest in many aspects of life that before I would have found enjoyable such as socialising with friends or even sex.  I feel that I would love to get away from everything and everyone around me sometimes. These feelings have been going on for about 2 years or so but have become worse in the last 6 to 8 months. A good thing though is that I have never thought about taking my own life as I know life is precious as a close relative of mine passed away a few years ago and I have been in a relationship with someone and this relationship has caused me a lot of stress. There are relatives of mine who suffer from depression and I am curious to find out if this is my problem also. I would appreciate any help so that I would be able to get hep. Many thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello & thanks for the query. Short answer is yes you are suffering from depression. Long answer is you are suffering from a chronic low grade depression known as dysthymia where one tends to feel low, tired, non energetic most of the times but not to the extent that it would severely hamper a persons work performance. In addition stress from a non helpful relationship, job etc. usually adds up the woes of a dysthymic person causing an episode of major depressive disorder superimposed on dysthymia known as double depression. Good news is this condition can be treated fairly easily by a multimodal treatment approach. There are drugs of SSRI group like escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine; one of which will be prescribed to you depending upon your clinical profile. Next up, a Psychiatrist or Psychologist will take up with you lifestyle mofication; how to manage job & relationship stress, doing daily physical exercise to keep mental as well as physical health at a premium & ;lastly factors unique to your personality, environment & possible stressors to avoid to prevent a relapse will also be dealt with. Do consult a Psychiatrist & if required; revert back to me for further help. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"I am a 31 yr old male I used to be healthy for almost over a month now. I had an anxiety attack (first time), I wasn t able to sleep, heart rate is high and blood pressure and eat a lot, lets say I became weak and lose weight, afterer that week I started eating right and probably slowly gaining my sleep from o,2,almost 6..I do feel okay with my issues behind my anxiety, however I was urinating a lot , I feel everything I drink is going out. My doctor gave me levaquin,Hystatin,medrol and benzonatate. I have vistaril and halcion at night, and wellbutrin durjng the day, for my anxiety 2 weeks earlier, means ive been urinating a lot for 2 weeks. I followed my additional instruction for the medroland others. I swear that probanly on the 1st day I took antiobiotics that I dont urinate frequently and im not dehydrated. However the following day I experience anxiety again kot worrying on past issues but now its my body km worrying I lost 10 lbs in a month and mu muscles were gone, I know I can make it for the weight but I feel a little electricity started on my feet all over the body and mu thrush went back again. I dont know what to do now if the electrixity and weakness of my leg is from anxiety or disease????","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query & I am sorry to hear about your current state of plight. All of your symptoms including electric shock like sensations, excessive urinating, feelings of increased blood pressure, heart rate etc. are manifestations of anxiety symptoms. When excessive, these symptoms increase suddenly to a crescendo causing Panic attacks where a person feels he/she is surely going to die.Assuming that organic conditions like heart disease. respiratory aliments have been ruled out; lets try & decipher your anxiety episodes. Are they situational (occurring in response to a particular situation/thought) or occur at any time? any aggravating or relieving factors for anxiety?? Your current drug regimen Welbutrin (Bupropion) is not a good choice to treat anxiety symptoms as it paradoxically increases/worsens anxiety. There are many effective drugs like Escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine (SSRI drugs) which shall help to reduce anxiety in long run while in short term; anxiolytics like clonazepam, etizolam etc. will help abort these anxiety attacks. Lastly do practice Yoga & Prananyama as these help to achieve a state of relaxation. Hope this helps. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, i have a habit of masterbutation for the past six years, now my sperm releases simply during night. and i am suffering this for the past seven years. what to do, is their any cure for it and i'm not married yetnow i'm 22 years old. Please help me","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. First you need to relax & not to think of nocturnal emissions or night falls as pathologic or some form of disease. Nocturnal emissions usually occur in unmarried males in response to dreams with sexual content, thoughts etc. They are simply manifestations of mind's desire to have a fruitful sexual intercourse. As you might be aware that masturbation or sexual intercourse causes release of endorphins or relaxing chemicals in brain which causes a sense of satisfaction & sleepiness/sluggishness. Hence, masturbation is considered as a taboo in society & in effect having night falls is also considered to be a sign of disease or weakness. Relax & dont worry. Do revert back if you need further help."},{"Patient":"I think my friend may have somethin wrong mentally. He talks about hearing voices that ask him to do bad things. He's distant. He cried when I toldhim a joke. He stayed up an entire 24 hours staring at the ceiling. Something isn't right. Please, help.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query & I must congratulate you for your vigilance. Based on your description, hearing voices commanding to do something bad, inappropriate emotional responses, social withdrawal & aloofness are suggestive of Psychosis/Schizophrenia. Since when are these symptoms emerging? Your friend needs emergency attention from a Psychiatrist as long duration of untreated Psychotic symptoms leads to worse long term disease outcome. He can be treated by antipsychotic drugs like Olanzapine, Risperidone, Aripirazole, Quetiapine etc. based on his clinical profile & physical health. Once treatment is started, he will start to get better in as early as 1-2 weeks period. He may need to take these drugs on a long term basis depending upon his clinical profile. One last thing is please rule out whether he is on any drugs like cannabis, ecstasy, heroin, cocaine, amphetamine etc. As these drugs may also cause Psychosis during intoxication phase. Do rever back for any further help.

If yes, what  you medications have received so far & how have you responded to medications? Based on your current symptom profile & considering you to be healthy, antidepressants of SNRI group like Duloxetine, Milnacipran can help you in rapid relief; alternatively a drug named Dotheipin (Prothiaden) can also help in rapid symptom relief. For anemia, we need to find cause of anemia e.g. excessive menstrual blood loss, inadequate diet, secondary to infections etc. & first treat that cause. This shall be followed by taking iron dietary supplements, improving diet (eating spinach, papaya, mango, green leafy vegetables etc.), blood transfusion (if required depending upon your Haemoglobin levels, clinical profile) etc. Do revert back for further help.

Any behavior which causes significant distress or impairment in a person's social, occupational, personal domains is usually characterized as a disorder. Similarly if a particular behavior (ripping toe nails) is causing significant distress to close ones, family members can also be termed as a disorder.

Depending on the initial response to the 1st medicine tried, further course like adding clomipramine or an atypical antipsychotic like risperidone, etc. can be tried.

CBT alone can also help you get rid of social phobia symptoms; but CBT alone takes too long for symptom relief; also CBT is very expensive & needs an expert Psychologist for teaching you the skills & supervise your progress. Hence for a rapid relief, do consider taking SSRI medications (escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine etc.) as they are side effect free, will help you boost your confidence, reduce your actual situation performance anxiety etc. Plus you can also use sos anxiolytics like etizolam, clonazepam which help you control on the spot distressing anxiety symptoms. You can start a crude form of CBT called as role play all by yourself; where you can volunteer to give short speech, story telling etc. in front of a small social gathering like party, family union etc. Do consult a Psychiatrist for medications & CBT referral. You can get back to me for any further help. Good luck"},{"Patient":"I have suffered from severe agoraphobia since I was 17. I am adhd and take adderall. I have PTSD which caused the agoraphobia to go out of remission and return , now I take 8 mg klonopin, 60 mg adderall, 600 mg seroquel. I am physically extremely healthy, my blood pressure is low, it s now 100/80. I was having severe panic to the point of things looking unreal, I was terrified to get off my bed, my brain was going a mile a minute. Out of desperation I took an extra 20 mg adderall, it worked so well I forgot my 4 mg nightly klonopin, and only needed half my dose of seroquel, I tried it the next day with same results, I m afraid to tell my psychiastrists, what do you think I should do","Doctor":"Hello; thanks for the query. Addrell (amphetamine+ dextroamphetamine combination) is a psychostimulant used in treatment of ADHD. It does NOT reduce the anxiety symptoms or panic attacks. By defination anxiety symptoms associated with panic attacks rise & fall rapidly within few minutes. Hence my guess is your anxiety symptoms reduced spontaneously. Also; I would like you to consult your Psychiatrist about medication named Trazodone which is an antideprssant with excellent anxiolytic properties & also helps in sleep induction. Alternately, also discuss about use of SSRI medication (like paroxetine) for agoraphobia & PTSD & use of propranolol/trazosin to reduce PTSD flashbacks. Also try doing yoga+ pranayama which are excellent relaxation tools. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"i been having this weird feeling all time for a couple of months now where it feels like the world is fake. it makes me want to think about life all the time and it makes me ask myself if life is real or not, along with messed up vision and sometimes feels as everything is going slow around me. it sometimes scares me and im not sure what to do. i want this to go away and not live like this for the rest of my life. i think the cause of this was the use of marijuana but im not too sure. any suggestions to get rid of this naturally and fast if possible?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Since when are you using cannabis (marijuana)? in what quantity & form? (smoked, chewing)? Yes you are right. Cannabis use especially cannabis intoxication is associated with experience of depresonalization-derealization (I am not real, world is not real etc.) Also, prolonged use of cannabis is associated with so called amotivational syndromw where world appears slow, lack of initiative etc. Hence best way is to quit cannabis use immediately. Cannabis being fat soluble takes some time (1-2 week) to clear from body (depending upon type of preparation used). Also, if needed, do consult a Psychiatrist for medications like SSRI which helps to alleviate some of the symptoms of amotivation & also for ways to keep yourself sober/clean.

It has Phenylethylamine, Glucomannan, Chromaxx (chromium picolinate), Raspberry Ketones, Evodiamine, Ginger Root, Caffeine Anhydrous,and vitamin B-12 in it. I was wondering if I could take 1mg of xanax to help me get to sleep as I am having unrelated anxiety. I just wanted to make sure they don t interact, please help.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Xanax (alprazolam) is a powerful anxiolytic & sleep inducer (hypnotic). Hence its useful in short term for a good sleep. But it is rapidly addiction forming & hence difficult to wean off in intermediate/long term. Hence, if you can tell your exact nature of sleep problems & anxiety symptoms; we can formulate a treatment plan accordingley. You can practice good sleep measures which are; doing daily 30 minutes physical exercise; fixed time of going to bed & getting up; avoiding day time naps; avoiding coffee/cigarettes after 7pm; using bed only for sleep & sex (nothing else). Also there are many novel drugs like agomelatin, ramelteon which help naturally improving your circadian rhythem & improve sleep without causing addiction. Other medications like mirtazapine, trazodone etc. are also very useful. Hence consult your Psychiatrist today for sleep probelms.

Please help...Kathy K","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. I would like to congratulate you for this brave decision to give up opioid addiction. Though NOT all authorities recommend cold turkey method as its very painful; but some schools of addiction medicine advocate cold turkey method. What you need to try is a combination of certain medications like Pregabalin (acts on alpha2 delta ligands) + ketorolac (NSAID/pain killer drug) + Chlorzozazone/baclofen (muscle relaxant). These drugs will reduce painful withdrawal symptoms; will help to keep your mood reasonably upbeat & thus increase your motivation. You should consult a Psychiatrist for getting these medications & also learning relapse prevention methods to stay clean/sober. Alternately, you can also revert back to me for any help.

Now three years after being on meds when i try to come off of them two or three weeks later i will be fine until something substancial sets me into a mode of being crazy","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Based on the symptoms you described; its not possible definitely rule in or rule out whether you are suffering from schizophrenia. Can you describe in detail what do you mean by feeling paranoid? As per ICD-10 (a diagnostic system to diagose & classify all diseases designed by WHO); a person is said to have a definitive diagnosis of schizophrenia when he has 1 months of continuous symptoms of 3rd person auditory hallucinations of commenting, discussing variety, delusions of thought insertion, withdrawal, broadcast, thought being spoken aloud (thought echo), bizarre delusions, persistent hallucinations coming from a body part/other modality; apathy, social withdrawal, severe difficulty articulating thoughts properly (formal thought disorder) etc. Some substance intoxication like amphetamine, cannabis etc. also mimic schizophrenia symptoms temporarily. Hence, we need to rule out these things before coming to any conclusions. What medications you are on? are there any side effects? Please revert back to me for a more definitive diagnosis & further management. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Last night I was electrocuted in my sleep and I shocked my friend.

It was not an actual electrocution as you already knew. During sleep, we do dream. Dreams are actually very short. Not even some minutes long. Such dreams create internal eletrical activities inside your brain. These electrical impulses are also very small, may be microvolts. Sometimes a sudden gush or so many impulses startle us during sleep and such startling could be perceived as shock. You had a normal shock.

Through process of elimination they think it is PLS, I am dessprete for HELP","Doctor":"Hello madam, thanks for the query & I am very sorry to hear your plight. First thing we need to rule out at age 61 years is any organic cause of difficulty in walking, imbalance etc. One of the common cause of this difficulty is Parkinson's disease which is usually diagnosed by history of trembling hands, rigidity, walking difficulties, imbalance, walking is short steps, psycho motor slowing, symptoms of depression etc. Many of your described symptoms are matching this profile. Hence we need to definitely rule out this possibility. Can you tell me your MRI findings or email me your MRI reports? Baclofen is a muscle relaxant & in some persons it may cause symptoms of depression. As such, baclofen is not a treatment for Parkinsons disease & drugs like L-Dopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, amantidine, trihexyphenidyl are used depending upon a persons clinical profile.

She was diagnosed as ADHD at about 7 yrs old. She struggles in school and social environments (common, I know). She is very impulsive and has a tense relationship with her siblings. She is currently being treated by a Psychiatrist and we have previously had her in counseling for her behavior. She has been on numerous medications (stimulants) and is now using a non-stimulant Strattera. We don t really see any change. Methylphenidate seemed to work best for the longest period of time in her life, but through puberty, it seems to have little affect now. We feel as if we are running out of options and we want her to be happy in her life. We re also afraid that her siblings will end up resenting or disliking her, due to her behavior. She has a 16 yr old sister and 3 x 11 yr old siblings (2 brothers and 1 sister--triplets). So there is plenty in our house to lose focus on. I also (Dad) have been diagnosed as ADHD, so I fully understand where that came from. I would like your opinion on other potential treatment options: medication (stimulant, non-stimulant, combination; non-medication, etc.)? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. It seems that you are having a lot of trouble with daughter right now. If ADHD remains incompletely treated, it does a toll on child's self esteem also & too many times, in a desire to get noticed, get some appreciation, child engages into undesirable behaviors which are at present your main concern. We need to formulate a multimodal treatment plan for her consisting of medications+ parent teacher management training (PTMT). If methylphenidate has worked for her & if there are no contraindications for methylphenidate, we can shift from atomoxetine (strattera) back to methylphenidate & hike the dose to maximum 60mg/day. As a part of parent teacher management, we can engage into token economy, contingency management, role plays, time out etc. which are taught by Psychologist to both the parents & teachers in school. Hence, do contact your Psychologist for PTMT; if need further help do revert back to me.

As per your description, there are 2 possibilities. 1. During process of putting a stent, small blood clots called as emboli may get dislodged & get inside blood vessels supplying the brain. If any such blood vessel supplying a particular area of brain gets blocked due to an embolus; symptoms specific to the particular area blocked appear (memory problems of sudden origin in case of your father). Alternatively second explanation is there is a post stent/post operative condition known as delirium or acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating state of consciousness, alertness, misidentification, sleep disturbances, extreme apathy or aggression etc. delirium is a medical emergency & we aggressively need to do certain blood investigations to ascertain electrolytes levels, blood parameters, ruling out infection etc. Depending upon his prominent symptoms, low dose antipsychotics like haloperidol, olanzapine etc. will treat his condition.

I know I have a problem, but I really do not want to go to therapy. My mom has an issue with OCD as well, and this issue is that she MUST move furniture to a different place at least 2-3 times a month. Each time, it gets on my nerves so bad that I begin mumbling curse words and I hit pillows and feel infuriated, and I cringe and if I ever have an instance to where I have to walk through the specific area where the furniture was moved, I can not look at it. Typing this right now is making me want to break every piece of furniture moved. The one that got me most was the Key holder, which was moved to the opposite wall, and I just want to punch it off and break it. Nobody understands how much I am trying to hold in curse words and moving things. My solution is not talking to anyone and staying in my room for days until the next rearrangement. It takes me a good week or if I am lucky a couple of days to give it a chance, or to even look at it. The reason why I don t want therapy is because when this happens, I don t cry, I don t usually move things (although I have), I mainly throw a fit, and my mother, having OCD as well doesn t understand my problem and just calls me mental. She says I am mental and sometimes that I am psycho. She doesn t comfort me, or even suggests therapy in a right way. I have other forms of OCD as well, but this is my main problem.

What do you mean by HOCD? do you mean to suggest you have obsessive compulsive disorder with predominantly sexual or blasphemous obsessions? Some Psychologists tend to call this type of OCD as HOCD; though as per available literature; this is also OCD. Can I know the exact nature of your symptoms? OCD is a waxing & waning illness with origins usually in adolescence or early adulthood. Usual symptoms are obsessions which are recurrent intrusive anxiety provoking thoughts, impulses or images which are recognized as originating from ones own mind by the subject. Obsessions frequently lead to compulsions which are repetitive acts or rituals done to avert anxiety arising due to obsessions. Obsessions can be of dust, dirt, contamination, sexual, blasphemous etc. OCD is treated by drugs named SSRI type drugs along with behavior therapy methods.

I am sorry to know your current state of difficulties. You said you had great initial improvement with medications lexapro (escitalopram) & xanax (alprazolam); then why did you stop these medications? Were there any side effects due to these medications? Secondly, I would like to know that what are your current set of symptoms which are so distressing & disabling? Please revert back with this information. Presently, based on information provided; I can broadly suggest a few points, If lexapro (escitalopram) has worked in past; restarting lexapro or some other drug of similar class (SSRI) along with xanax (alprazolam) or similar safer anxiolytics like (clonazepam, etizolam) should take care of your symptoms. Based on your clinical profile, there are many other medication options like TCA, SNRI type drugs are also available. In addition, you need to do certain lifestyle modifications like getting up early, doing 30 minutes physical exercise daily, sleeping at least 6 hours at night, avoiding alcohol & other substance of abuse. Lastly, in addition to these & based on your symptom profile, you can undergo talk therapy (known as cognitive behavior therapy, exposure & response prevention etc. depending upon your symptoms) for a rapid improvement. Do consult a Psychiatrist for these treatments & get back to me for further help. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor i am in the habbit of using this hans chaap khaini which i use to keep in betwwen by lips .i am using this for the past 10 years.

First thing you need to understand is tobacco is one of the EASIEST & one of the MOST DIFFICULT ADDICTION TO GIVE UP AT THE SAME TIME!! Its easy because quitting tobacco does not cause any significant side effect apart from some craving & irritability. Difficult as we tend to continue tobacco thinking lets have one more before we quit. One way of quitting tobacco is decide a quit date (usually 2 weeks from today) & start using nicotine replacement therapy (available as Nicotine 2 & 4mg chewing gums & pastilles) These are park & chew type gums similar to your khanini use & 1 chewing-gum can last 2-3 hours. Gradually replace khaini with these & you shall get used to them. Additionally you can visit a Psychiatrist & get yourself Tablet Bupropion or Amitryptiline which reduce the craving for tobacco along with these chew-gums during this 2 week quit date period. You will also get tobacco quitting counselling help from Psychiatrist. Do get back to me if you need further help.

May be the pain killers you take for joint pain lead to increase in gastritis as well. So, try taking physiotherapy.and use less pain killers.Most of patients of anxiety have increased acid production and this chronic acidity leads to indigestion and reflux.You should take medicine for anxiety.I have seen paroxetine :-12.5mg to 37.5mg showing very good response in similar patients. Along with this - you may take pantoperazole 40mg daily for quick response.Try to avoid tea/coffee/cold drinks compeltely. Better avoid spicy food items and excess of salt. This will help in improving digeation and early recovery.With paroxetine, I hope the response in  anxiety will start within a week. Please discuss the meds with your doctor and start them. As anxiety and acidity will improve you will be able to do more work, become more active and so, would loose excess weight.Wish you good health.Dr. Manisha GopalMD Neuropsychiatry"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor.

It is usual that such patients develop negative symptoms. You should try to start her on antidepressants for this. This drug will provide her motivation, give back her zeal for life, she would feel like doing things and concentration will improve. Drugs like sertraline or escitalopram are good choices as antidperessants. Also, try to tactfully involve her in talks and usual household chores, even if she does less but still make her do it. When some guests come-make her sit with yourself and guest. Donot leave her alone, this would help her come back to social life.Also, her dcotor should see if she is developing side effects to already prescribed drugs. If yes, then reducing the dosage or shifting to better molecules will help a lot.Wish you good healthDr. Manisha GopalMD Psychiatry"},{"Patient":"My mother whenever she goes to temple or puja or heard mantras, she behaves differently.

Can anyone clarify ?","Doctor":"Hi,I went through your query and from what you have mentioned, it seems your mother is suffering from a disorder termed as dissociative trance and possession disorder. It is a condition in which a person's behavior suddenly changes and acts as if he or she is being possessed by a god or even a devil and they speak in slightly different tone as if the god or devil was speaking. It usually happens due to some underlying unconscious conflict which goes on in a person's head and remains persistent due to the attention being received from others due to the episodes, which acts as maintaining factor. Most people in our cultural setting believe it to occur due to religious factors and hence, don't seek proper treatment.I would recommend that you seek psychiatric consultation for initiating treatment. Medications including anti-depressants might help. More importantly, it will be important to understand the underlying conflict. As family members, you can help her by reducing the attention given to her during the episodes. The praying and offering things by others must stop during the episodes.I do hope that I was able to answer your query.

However, your concern regarding it is mostly misplaced. It is a normal physiological process. Once a person becomes sexually mature, semen production starts which is a continuous process. A person then either has sex, or masturbates and has night falls. Masturbation doesn't lead to any physical or mental health problems. It also doesn't make anyone weak. You can masturbate as much a you want and it doesn't lead to any problems.Your problems of feeling weak and pains might be due to some other physical or psychological condition. Some blood investigations like complete blood counts, thyroid profile, vitamin D  levels might be required to rule out nutritional deficiencies or thyroid dysfunction. In no physical cause is found, treatment with medications like escitalopram or paroxetine for treating any underlying depression and anxiety will be helpful. Please do consult a psychiatrist for complete evaluation and initiating treatmentHope this information was helpful. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi I am a seemingly healthy 35 yr old woman. I am currently taking mercilon 20 mg which as I am nearly 100 kg is too low a dose. I have been having some very light spotting outside of menstruation for the past two months. I recently had a series of blood tests including thyroid, liver, kidney and general blood count levels. All cam back within normal limits except ers which was 50. I experience severe anxiety re: health issues and this is causing me a great deal of worry. I have also been getting some abdomen discomfort and what feels like ovulation pain. Please help!","Doctor":"I appreciate your concern and asking on health care magic. Based on your history i would suggest the following:1. There is need of evaluation to ascertain the details of anxiety. Has the anxiety started after the start of the mercilon? If yes, it may be a side effect of the drug and the dose you mentioned is 20 milligram or microgram? It is the microgram and i  hope you are taking the right dose.2. If it can be excluded that the anxiety was present before as well and not related to the medicine that you are taking, steps can be taken to reduce the anxiety.3. You may discuss with your doctor and consider changing mercilon to some other class of contraceptive pill, for reasons discussed above,if  present.4. For anxiety you need to work on your thinking and find out if there are some particular thoughts or events that are triggering them? Self help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or professional CBT are particularly helpful for anxiety.5. You can practice deep breathing exercises to reduce the symptoms of anxiety.6. Reduce caffeine intake as it promotes anxiety.7. If self help does not work, seek professional help and there are certain medicines to reduce anxiety as well.

I pace (and often run) up and down the hallway at my house, I constantly bite my nail cuticles and have tried to stop, but not even the bad tasting polish makes me stop. I cannot sit still for anything and I zone out in coversations A LOT. I have been dianoised with OCD and Anxiety Disorder, both of which run in my family, and I am on Zoloft, but it does not help with the pacing or nail biting. After doing research I came across psychomotor agitation and I wanted to get a professional opinion and possible treatment options if it does turn out to be psychomotor agitation. Thank you for your time!","Doctor":"I appreciate your concern and asking on health care magic. Based on your history i would suggest the following:1.  ''I constantly bite my nail cuticles'' is an expression of anxiety and one of the neurotic traits. It is not psychomotor agitation.2. ''I pace (and often run) up and down the hallway at my house''-- is it because you feel restless and particularly restlessness in legs and it improves on pacing? If yes it may be akathesia due to side effects of zoloft. Some people have this side effect and it can be controlled. If not it can be again due to anxiety.3.

He is now prescribed lonazep .25  half tablet in morning and 1/2 in evening along with rexipra 5mg. Dr. asked to leave the tablet when he feel ok. what can be effect once he discontinues the lonazep ? is there any chance he can get addicted to lonazep if same issue back again?","Doctor":"Hi,I do appreciate your concern for your brother. Panic disorder responds well to treatment if provided adequately. Rexipra (escitalopram) is a safe and effective treatment option for panic disorder. However, the current dose of 5 mg/day is sub-optimal. The dose range for escitalopram is between 10-20 mg/day. Lonazep is clonazepam which helps in reducing the anxiety on symptomatic basis. The anxiety remains controlled as long as it is taken, but will re emerge when it is stopped. The problem is, with time, there is a high chance for developing dependence on it. So, it is usually recommended only for a short period of time.In your brother's case, I would recommend that you discuss with his psychiatrist regarding increasing escitalopram further up (to 20 mg as required). It will help control his panic attacks and he won't need clonazepam. Moreover, the treatment with escitalopram should be continued even after the panic attacks has stopped completely (around 1-2 years), so as to prevent relapse.I do hope I was able to answer your query.

You don't need to worry or feel shy if you masturbate.The excess masturbation is not good because it can cause social anxiety and chronic fatigue.

I stopped celexa one day and started the wellbutrin the next. I was told to stop the wellbutrin and remeron the day I found out I was pregnant which was last week. I am so tired but when I go to bed in the evenings I seem to panic and get up and pace. I finally fall asleep on the couch in an upright position. Even then it is only for a few hours.

I have to stay busy during the day so that I am not crying all day and I panic when there is nothing to do.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for the query. As such no drug is entirely safe in pregnancy & both mirtazapine (rameron) & bupropion (welbutrin) are no exception. Both fall under FDA category C i.e. to be used only if benefit outweights the risk. Hence you should consult your Psychiatrist & your Ob/Gynac doctor before continuing these medications. Secondly, considering your symptom profile; welbutrin is not a good choice as welbutrin itself causes flare up of anxiety & panic attacks. Single drug use Mirtazapine between dose 15-45mg per day (all dose taken at night) is an excellent anxiolytic & will take care of all your symptoms. As you are preganant & wont be safe to use SOS anxiolytic like clonazepam, etizolam; hecne also consult a Psychologist to learn relaxation exercise, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) where you will learn exposure & response prevention (ERP), autogenic relaxation training etc. Supplement all of this with yoga & pranayam & you will soon get well.

I am currently at a loss on how to help him. As of last week he was taking Temazepam 45mg, Amtripliytine 50mg (sp?) for sleep, Paxil 40mg, Risperidone (?dosage). His current dr. is weaning him from the Paxil and trying Luvox, lowing his Temazepam and Amtripliytine and put him on Xanax. Since then, his moods have dramatically changed for the worse. His thoughts range from suicidal to anger in a matter of seconds. Is their any way you can help him?","Doctor":"I appreciate your concern and asking on health care magic. Based on your history i would suggest the following:1. Discuss with your doctor the present condition and the need for change of medication if he was doing well on them.2. Luvox is fluvoxamine and is better for OCD but dose of the other antidepressant can be increased for dealing with OCD and depression.3. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant(TCA) and there is another option of clomipramine, which is also TCA and deals well with OCD and Depression.4. The changes are possibly due to the change over of the medicines but it is important to discuss the suicidal tendencies with the doctor.5. Xanax can be added for sleep and risperidone is also fine for controlling unwanted thoughts and anger. 6. You can discuss with your husband the things that are distressing him and tell him that you understand his problems.

Smoking cannabis (pot/weed/marijuana) is sometimes associated with occurence of intense anxiety symptoms, pounding heart, trembling hands, sweating & intense fear of death. This syndrome in its intense form is known as run amock & has even resulted into unprovoked violence & homicide by the cannabis user. Also prolonged cannabis use can cause amotivational syndrome similar to depression, lack of initiative etc. Not to mention the risk of precipitating psychosis due to cannabis use. Hence best thing is stop cannabis use immediately. Cannabis slowly clears from body & within a few days of stopping cannabis your symptoms will remit.

Though it is difficult to diagnose your problem from the given description, I presume that you are stressed and anxious. You are disappointed due to some life events which you never expected to happen. Such a disappointment makes you lazy, intolerant, mildly depressed, tired, sleepy, low self esteem and low self confidence. Hallucinations are normally byproducts of obsessive negative thinking.

Whenever something I thought was seriously wrong I always confided in my mom, and she would always reassure me that I would be ok. She was right 100%. Now that she is no longer here, I have nobody to go to, so I appreciate you understanding where I m coming from. Four years ago I was diagnosed with a slight thing of anxiety. My doctor prescribed me alpralozam. The pills expired in 2012. They helped cause they just took the edge off. My grandmother, grandfather, uncle, and mom have passed away within these past 3 years. It s too much to handle all at once. They all went into the hospital, and never made it out, so that s the way my mind thinks. I think if I go into the hospital, that I ll never make it back out. Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but that s how I think. About a month ago I had this slight pain between my thumb and index finger. Again, nothing serious, probably just a bruise, but I took it to the extreme. First thing I did, was search up online if there are glands in your hands. Of course there are, so right away I think it s a swollen gland and something is wrong. I worried about that for a couple days, and must have tensed myself up so bad that my fingers started to ache and hurt. So, right away I start thinking the worse. Why are my hands and fingers hurting now. I worried about that for a week. Sure enough the pain between my thumb and finger, went away. This brings me up to now, where I must ve worried myself so much about my fingers and hands that it cause what I hope is anxiety. About a week after all of this happening, I woke up last Saturday and stood up and felt like I was off balance. Nothing serious, figured it was just allergies. It got better throughout the day, and would come and go. Again, thinking crazy, got it in my head that it was something serious, like a brain tumor, brain hemorage, etc. I would constantly search up symptoms of all those things and worry myself day in and day out. This past Monday, 2 days after this occurred I sucked it up and went to the doctor. She checked me out. My BP was 115/75, my lungs and heart both sounded good. I explained this situation and she said to just relax myself. Once I left that doctors office, I didn t feel a thing. I felt like myself. Sure enough, as time went on, that feeling came back. It sucks and I hate it. That s how this whole past week has been. I wake up, and im fine. As the day goes by, I start worrying that the feeling is going to come back. Because I worry, the feeling comes back. It s like a catch 22. During the week, Monday through Friday I woke from 2:30 to 11 at night. I stay busy at work, and for the most part I feel fine. Once we take a break, even though the people I work with talk to me, it s in the back of my head that what if it comes back, and sure enough iy does. It seems like once my mind starts to wander, it comes back. This past weekend it was tough too, especially yesterday. I was fine and then once I sat down with my girlfriend, my mind started going. I had the worst naseau, and I had minor little headaches. I honestly don t know what to do, and I worry myself everyday that I have something seriously wrong with me. I m so afraid of cancer and always think I have a brain tumor or something wrong inside my head that is going to kill me. What are the main symptoms of a brain tumor? Do you think it s anything to be concerned about? Or is it just all in my head? Like I said, it s more of a foggyness feeling. Thanks again doctor, hope to hear from you soon.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.

The dream is that the objects and people around me are shrinking and growing quickly. Usually in the dream, I ll be holding something, usually a toothpick or a stick, and it grows or shrinks right in front of me. The people around me are speaking to me but I do not understand. The people will grow and proportionally. I feel as if I can t breath in the dream because of what going on. Just thinking about the dream makes me feel like my throat is closing. I ve researched it and found that there is a condition called Micropsia. also known as Alice In Wonderland Syndrome. Those who have the condition have hallucinations that the things around them are growing and shrinking, or seeming far away or very close. I only have dreams about things growing and shrinking, but I do have horrible depth perception.

You are worried about that dream and that worry makes you to expect the dream. Once you expect something, body gives you (that is the essence of positive thinking). Once you get it you again start worrying and again expect it. Such cycle goes on and you become worried nd anxious. We call it obsessive thinking.

I have really bad social anxiety to the point where I do not like being around others at all because of it. I feel like the Lexapro is not helping.

Based on your symptom profile; your main underlying problem  is social anxiety or excessive unwarranted fears of unfavorable scrutiny by other people, superiors etc. The treatment of same is usually multipronged with SSRI type medications, anxiolytics (clonazepam, etizolam etc.) (escitalopram/lexapro is one of the type of SSRI) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). In CBT you will be taught various methods to cope & overcome your anxiety like exposure & response prevention (ERP), imaginal exposure, role playing, mindfulness based interventions, autogenic relaxation training etc. You need to consult a Psychologist or ask your current Psychiatrist for help. Try to relax, try to also practice yoga & pranayama in addition to all these to stay relax.

So long as you are not distressed by these fantasy images its not a problem. You should consult a Psychologist, or your school teacher, your parent or any senior figure whom you can trust about these problems.

When I get too cold, it just feels like I m becoming numb, thus thinking I m dying, thus causing crazy bad anxiety. I shake a lot as well. This never used to happen, and for a while, I would just get really depressed when I smoked, but now, it spirals into really bad anxiety, and a feeling that I m going to die.

One of the side effects of smoking cannabis (pot, weed, marijuana) is occurence of cannabis induced panic attacks or also known as bad trips cahracterised by symptoms of intense anxiety, palpitations, feeling weird, numbness, intense fears of death. People have acted crazy, even done homicides (run amock) under influence of cannabis induced panic attacks. As cannabis is fat soluble & slowly cleared from body; these attacks can occur for a few days even after stopping smoking. Hence best way is stopping cannabis smoking altogether. As there are other health hazards like Psychosis after cannabis use; its prudent to stop using cannabis. You can use sos etizolam, clonazepam (benzodizepines) as anxiolytics to control these distressing symptoms. Hope this helps.

She took the four one day and went out and ran some errands . She was fine for hours and then after she got into her car after loading groceries in her car, she pulled out of the parking lot and she was at a stop light and her blood pressure went down to 40/20 and her left lung colapsed . The hospital is saying that she Over Dosed on Benzodiazopines. and it was a Suicide attempt.

Your friend is prescribed a lot of medications (I am not sure for what plethora of conditions) & I need to understand the exact reasons that she is taking so many medications.

In overdose, geodon auses a condition called as QT prolongation which can manifest as lowering blood pressure & collapse (which your friend suffered). She is also taking clonidine which also decreases blood pressure & collapse due to syncope. Her other medications like topiramate are rarely associated with activation of suicidal ideas.

Depending upon the indication for which your daughter is prescribed seroquel; we can either change seroquel plain preparation to Seroquel-SR (sustained release preparation) which is longer acting, less sedating; or we can change seroquel to lesser sedating options like Aripiprazole, blonanserin, amisulpride etc. Hence, consult your Psychiatrist for the change.

The treatment for this condition usually requires a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and if requires a benzodiazepine.Among your medications, fludec is fluoxetine which is a SSRI and clonotril (Clonazepam) is a benzodiazepine. I am not sure why your doctor decided to put you on oleanz (olanzapine) which is an anti-psychotic. Ecospirin would be required only if you have an underlyig cardiac condition. Remylin-D contains alpha lipoic acid 100 mg, pyridoxine hydrochloride 3 mg, methylcobalamin 1500 mcg, folic acid 1.5 mg, vitamin D3 1000 IU.

Had I been your psychiatrist, considering the fact that you have only panic disorder and no other physical conditions, I would liked to keep you only on fluoxetine and gradually increase the dose (maximum 80 mg/day) till your symptoms improve.

Based on the symptoms you have described here; you are apparently suffering from depressive episode. Many a times, depressive illness masquerades under garb of anxiety, stress, too many vague body symptoms etc. & hence remains untreated; at present how is your mood, energy levels, enjoyment, sleep quality, appetite (rate out of 10 & compare with when you used to be better)? I guess you will know that you might be having depression after answering these questions. Celexa (citalopram) is SSRI type drug which is usually used to treat depression. If you are unable to tolerate celexa; there are many other safer options lke Escitalopram, setaline, fluoxetine, paroxetine; a novel drug called agomelatine, tyneptine etc. Based on your clinical profile; you can try one of these. Your doctor can add short term (2-4 weeks) clonazepam (benzodizepine) to help you tolerate potential side effects of these drugs. Also try doing 30 minutes daily physical exercise, yoga, pranayma to increase effectivness of these antidepressant medications & I am sure you shall overcome your problem very soon!!

When done in supervision; this type of talk therapy (Couple therapy) is successful & I am sure you can soon get back to your old ways of love & harmony.

She is very paranoid she thinks that everyone is out to get her and that we planted camera's in her body and vehicles. She will also run the streets for hours like a child thats running away from home. So my questions are, Is this normal for someone who has already detoxed? And how long will this all last? We want to help her but we are already getting tired. Please help!! We dont know what else to do","Doctor":"Hello,Usually we wait for few weeks (4-6) after detox and see if the pstchiatric symptom decrease or stop. If they increase or dont reduce, it is best to start antipsychotics. So, in her case please consult the doctor and get her treated. Waiting for more time will not serve any purpose.She can be given olanzapine or resperidone and she will show improvement in few days only.Wish you good health.Dr. Manisha GopalMD Neuropsychiatry."},{"Patient":"I look after a 47yr old man with profound retardation and is non verbal, his psychiatrist stopped Abilify almost 3wks ago due to it making him very restless.

He also has a sprained ankle, but it cannot heal because he cannot not sit down for more than 2 minutes.....Is the Propranool dosage too low? Please Help!!!!!","Doctor":"hello,You may increase the dosage of propanolol to 40mg, in form of 20mg in morning and then in afternoon. If that dosent help- start trihexphenidyl 2mg in morning and 2mg in afternoon. I hope by taking this his akathesia ( irresistable moving of legs) will reduce and stop.

I suffer from severe panic attacks and I m also on bupropion 150mg and and 100mg of sertraline for to help with both depression and anxiety. I have cut down on the klonopin to 2mg but I m scared it will harm the baby. I m only about three weeks along. Is there any options to look at as far as replacing the klonopin to something safer? Thank you do much!!! Ivy","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. I admit that your concerns about the baby are indeed well informed. Clonazepam (Klonopin) is a benzodizepine which is known to cause conditions like cleft palate in baby. Similarly though very low but sertraline can also cause some problems in baby like pulomnary hypertension. Though data on bupropion is not definitve; but all in all its safe to avoid all of these 3 drugs during pregnancy. Also bupropion exacerbates anxiety symptom & may not be a good option for your problem. Hence, you can switch to less riskier options like escitalopram which are relatively safer for your baby & you can consult a Psychologist to learn autogenic relaxation exercises, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), exposure & response prevention rituals (ERP), deep breathing exercises which are tad slow but proven to improve anxiety & panic attacks. Lastly, do try yoga, pranayam & 30 minute daily physical exercise in addition to all these. You can revert back to me for further help. Good luck"},{"Patient":"Started having migraines 1 year ago. MRI scan normal. After which started hearing voices saying negative things. Went to psychiatrists and got antipsychotics and antidepressants. 4 medicines and 1 jab in total. Blood pressure rises to140/85 this year but now dropped to 127/80. Started having jerky continuous movement after hearing voices now.No. of Voices increased. Have tremors now. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"hello, You are having movement disorders, a side effect common with older and sometimes with newer antipsychotics. You should, meet your doctor, request him to look into these side effects. The doctor would either reduce the number of drugs, or may be take out the offending agent/ or atleast reduce the dosage of the offending agent. There are some meds which can be given to reduce these side effects, (these movement problems are commonly known as - extra pyramidal side effects).So, it is not due to psychiatric diagnosis but due to the drugs which are given to you. Antidepressants generally don't cause these movement disorders ( jerky or tremors).this should be looked into at the earliest, as they increase with time if the offending agent is not removed.Also, the illness is relapsing in the form of increase in hearing of voices. Your doctor will have to increase the dosage of anti psychotics,  preffrably newer ones ( olanzapine, or amisulpride or quiteapine) or may be shift you on some depot antipsychotics ( newer ones).Wish you good health and speedy recovery Dr. Manisha Gopal MD neuropsychiatry"},{"Patient":"I have been using the nuva ring as a form of birth control for 2 years. Since, I have become so super emotional and depressed. ! minute happy and the next on the verge of tears for such rediculous reasons.  Am i imagining that it could be the nuva ring?","Doctor":"Hello, Please talk to your gynaecologist to shift you to some non-hormonal contraceptive choice, there are many in market nowadays days. The hormonal contraceptives are notorious of causing psychological disorders ( there are several studies available on them), or these may even increase the already existing psychiatric illness, or can lead to relapse in non otherwise stable patient.Your suspicions can be right about this device, though it is not possible to be sure ( as there may be other clauses like stress or family history, etc.) But this is an avoidable thing and can be replaced with other safer choices. If after removing this agent, your mood improves, this will be an indirect evidence that this was the causative factor behind mood changes.So, Best will be to shift to other contraceptive methods.Wish you good luck.Dr. Manisha GopalMD Neuropsychiatry"},{"Patient":"hi..good day,,may i know how spermatozoa possitive be cured?and is it a serious illness?is it HIV?my friends husband is suffering from this,,he got so many sores in the different parts of his body specially on the tigh part and neck is swelling..please help me find answers for my friend,,how did her husband get such illness?thank u so much!","Doctor":"Hello,The painful sore over penis shaft could be due to herpes or chancroid like sexually transmitted illness.

It is increasing your stress, you need to talk about your situation and stress with someone you are comfortable with. It can be your friend or a health care worker, counselor anyone. Simply ventilating will relieve a lot amount of stress from your mind.2. Learn about Emotional intelligence and how you can improve it.

However I've since suffered from stomach cramps and diarrhea afew times a week initially and for the past week I have had a few episodes every morning. Is lustral the cause of the probelm. I'm good for staying on gluten free diet and I eat well.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. Short answer Yes; Lustral (sertraline) is the cause of your abdominal cramps & diarrhoea. Srtraline is a SSRI type of drug which is commenly used for treatment of depression & anxiety. As such it is very safe but it does cause abdominal cramps, bloating, diarrhoea in a few patients. If you are having some relief in anxiety symptoms with Lustral; then you can either wait for 2 weeks for your body to adapt to lustral so that these symptoms will subside (side effects usually within first few weeks of starting medications).Otherwise you can be switched to other SSRI like Escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine etc. which are relatively free of abdominal side effects.

I suggest you not to worry much.  You are just 37. Memory loss at your age is supposed to be non existent until there is serious underlying problem. Busy and professional people do have some problem with their memory and therefore the always keep schedules and carry a pocket book. This does not mean that they have memory loss.  I think the same is applicable to you. On the contrary, everyone forgets so many things in their life and unless they can recall at a later stage, such forgetfulness cannot be called clinical memory problem. Don't worry.

I can t remember from my daughters grad. from high school-first week in June-and the rest of the year is like a DVD that has been overused (pixalating, skipping, freezing, etc).

I also have jerking of shoulders, legs and hands.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. What you are describing here is suggestive of tics, tics are either vocal or motor acts which are often involuntary, suden, jerky actions, blurting out obscene words, eye blinking, grunting etc. These acts worsen with anxiety & usually disappear during sleep. Tourette syndrome is more severe form of tics consisting of multiple motor & vocal tics. For treatment of tic disorder, there are various drugs available; of which clonidine is considered to be gold standard for treating tics, Other drugs are risperidone, haloperidol etc. Also there are certain techniques like habit reversal training which are also useful in combination with medications to get rid of these symptoms.

I am trying to stop this bad habit but i was not able to do that. Now I am having joint pain and swelling also. Is that because of this pica ? Is there any treatment to stop this habit?","Doctor":"Hi,I understand the distress you are going through. Pica can be a result of nutritional deficiency like iron deficiency anemia, zinc deficiency, etc., or can occur as part of impulse control disorder. In your case, your Hb level is low which might be the effect as well as cause of pica.Eating cement is definitely not healthy and can cause multiple gastrointestinal problems and other physical problems. Your joint pain and swelling can be due to toxic materials contained in cement being accumulated in your body.I would suggest that you seek a orthopedic consultation for evaluation of joint pain and swelling and get treated accordingly. In addition, your hemoglobin levels need to be corrected with iron, folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation.You should consult a psychiatrist as soon as possible for help in control in your behavior. In case the behavior continues even after correction of nutritional deficiencies, treatment with drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (like escitalopram/ sertraline) can be helpful. More importantly, behavior therapy (habit reversal therapy specifically) will be highly recommended. Behavior therapy generally offers better results than drugs per say. It will consist of sessions which will help in controlling the impulse of eating cement or resisting it.I do hope that I was able to answer your query.

I have spoken to my mum about it and I am booking an appointment with my GP but I just want to know what it could be and if it is dangerous. Obviously I know it could be cancer","Doctor":"Hello,It is difficult to diagnose that testis lump of pea sized without physical examination and ultrasonography help.

From what you have mentioned, you seem to be having Agoraphobia which included fear of closed spaces (claustrophobia), fear of crowds, fear of being alone. You seem to be having panic attacks if faced with these situations. In addition, the symptoms pf feeling that everyone else is laughing at you or judging you can also e due to social phobia.I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist for complete evaluation. You can get rid of your anxiety and fears with treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline or paroxetine. In addition, you can also opt for   behavior therapy which will help you in relaxing and gradually remove fears regarding the mentioned situations.I do hope that I was able to answer your query.

From what you have mentioned, your sister is having depressive symptoms. In addition, the episode that you have mentioned regarding her bending her neck and feeling that someone is pulling it can be a dissociative episode. It is highly likely that your sister is preoccupied about something or under some kind of stress.I am not sure if you are still continuing with the medications. I would suggest that you consult a local psychiatrist fro her as she would need regular follow ups unless you are ready to travel the distance every time. If she is still on treatment, it may be reviewed. If possible, the dose of the anti-depressant can be increased. If further increment is not possible, a change in medication can be instituted.More importantly, it will be necessary to understand what is going trough her mind. Someone who is close to her and whom she feels comfortable to should try to talk to her. This might take some time but will be important. Your psychiatrist can help in the same to. Regular supportive sessions will be extremely helpful.I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Best wishes for her speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"My father in law has had bladder cancer...they cut his bladder and prostrate out but now they have found it has spread and have found a tumor in his pelvis which they have treated with radio therapy...it has shrunk but not significantly.....they have advised that chemo will only have a 30% possibility of success......basically it would seem we have run out of treatment options....he is very weak and in much pain and is on morphine...are there any other options","Doctor":"Hello,The bladder cancer metastasis in his body according to provided history.So it seems that pain could be due to bony metastasis.

An anxious state leads to increased heart rate, dizziness, increased sweating, tremors, tightness in chest. Often such symptoms can suddenly exacerbate leading to a heightened state of anxiety which results in panic attacks.I would suggest that you discuss your symptoms with your parents and consult a psychiatrist for initiating treatment.

I know that he s been doing meth and that he started having seizures in November last year. 2 days ago he was running around the streets with delusions of being chased by men in white scrubs. I figured this was either the meth talking or that he was spun meaning he was crashing after a drug binge. I had to call the police due to a fear of him getting run over. The police came with an ambulance and took him away. When he got to the hospital he was acting very aggressive. He was sedated today and talks like normal but still swears that he was being chased by these people who wanted to lock him up in an assylum. The psychiatrist says this psychosis was not induced by the drug but that it was hereditary. Im not a psychiatrist, and i wont pretend to be... But im just very skeptical about this diagnosis... We found out that he started doing meth in November last year. This coincides with the onset of his seizures. Theyre telling me its backwards and that he started using meth to (subconsiously) self-medicate... I know my brother... He likes the street life; drinks too much, smokes weed too much, would huff glue, would do cocaine. Thats his life style. He s never hallucinated until after the meth use. What would make a doctor rule out a psychosis caused by stimulant use? Im concerned because i want him to get the proper treatment. And with that being said, is there a difference in treatment? i hope you could shed some light on this. Sincerely, Louie H.","Doctor":"Hi Louie,It is often difficult to distinguish between drug induced psychosis and primary psychosis. It is more likely to be drug induced if the symptoms start after a using drugs and stop within a few weeks of stopping drugs. Since most people do not stop drugs, it is usually not possible to confirm if the symptoms vanished on stopping drugs. You also need to know that cannabis is also likely to have contributed to his psychosis in addition to meth. Since the treatment for both kinds of psychosis is with anti-psychotics, you need not worry and let his doctor decide. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I have been suffering from anxiety and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) since childhood. I was diagnosed with depression a year back when I was having mood swings, feelings of low self-esteem, sleep and eating issues and most alarming thing for me was bloody stools which became unusually regular initially after regular bouts of constipation and then even without constipation. I didn t take any medication for the depression. A few months back I was prescribed Inderal for anxiety and breathlessness especially related to work. I noticed that my usual blood pressure (65-75) dropped further to around 60-65 after Inderal. I took the drastic decision of quitting my job and Inderal. While the bloody stools and anxiety have reduced due to the absence of work related issues, I think the depression is still there. I went to my former workplace the other day and had an argument. An hour or two later while trying to fill a form I noticed that the fingers in my right hand was trembling and I couldn t hold the pen. Do I need to go to a neurologist for the trembling thing or do I need to go to a psychiatrist?","Doctor":"Brief Answer: Go to a psychiatrist.Detailed Answer: I understand your concern and asking on HCM. As you have history of anxiety and depression and the i understand that the trembling was for sometime after the argument, it appears to be due to anxiety. If it is persistent with some other symptoms, any weakness or numbness then you can consider going to a neurologist. I hope you find this helpful."},{"Patient":"hello dr, i am 59 yrs old i am disabled now for 17 years. i always worked two jobs before i was disabled i had lots of energy and loved my jobs and was able to pay all my bills and keep roof over my head i did not have anyone to help me if ever i needed it. at 22 i got married and had to still make sure bills were paid i worked at the state house as a secretary. the marriage did not last he did not take care of our home and bills i did it all. i was mentally abused and toward the end pysically abused. all his attention was on drugs and party and loosing job after job. i was terribly traumatized because he was not who i beleived he was as a man when i first married him. so i went into factory work because it was more money than secretarial and went to pyschiatrists to help myself not fall to pieces every day to me from then on was very hard for me to not have the fright and feelin that a bomb was gonna fall on me. my dr. suggested self help books to me and i read and read every one i saw at the libary and practiced to be reborn again as a strong person. l995 i remarried to i thought was a wonderful man and the same happened again cheating mental abuse pysical abuse and i could not have a conversation with him because all he did was yell and terrize me i married a monster. i am separated now and on my own and it feels like i have gone to another planet. it feels so good not to be terrized and abused. i moved out of the state i lived in and back to the state my family lives at least here i have family around. but dr. it is hard finding a good pyschiatrist here so i have no pych. dr. now to give me my medicine. i am bipolar inside of me i feel i can t go anyway i take vey bad panic attacks it comes over me and i freeze and can t run out and at other times i am able to. my head feels so filled up with fright that i can not think and when i am able to try to concentate with all my heart bad thougts come in i try so hard to through it out of my mind. whether i can or not(it stays in my subconsious and come out another time even tho i go to my self help books and also tapes to calm me it does not work i pray to god i read inspirational books and quotes i look into you make life yourself you are the captain of your soul what you do is only my own doing being so depressed. when i was taking my medication i was able to concentrate on what i had to do but nights i feel like the booky man is coming to get me. i am very jumpy and i have a feelin in side like someone is hitting my heart with a hammer. sooner or later i will find a psys. dr, and my day will be much better with my medicine so i do have a primary dr she is nice but doe not want to prescribe me any of the medicine that i take she said the pysc. does it. night time come and i am so panicky can t do nothing i feel like a lump on a log. i have tried herbal medicines from a herbal dr my cousin told me about because i wanted to be physically ok. watch what i eat and i would appreciate any advice from you because maybe you know some thing i can think abou read or whatever to become a smiling person without constant migraine. dr. i thank you in advance for any advice or opinion. thank you again god bless","Doctor":"I can understand your feelings and appreciate your query on HCM. After going through your history i can see that anyone could have landed in the same situation that you are in and you are facing it bravely. Self help books and techniques are helpful but a time comes when professional help is needed. Now you need professional help. Combination of professional and self help will provide better results for you. I would suggest you to start antidepressant medicine and the one that has anti-anxiety effects as well.

If you are forgetting things you are not giving enough attention to those things. Give more attention to the things you want to remember and they will go and stay  in your memory.2. Wear vest underneath your shirt and prefer aerated cloth to manage sweating. Some people have increased tendency to sweat. Use body lotion to avoid sour feeling.I hope you find it helpful."},{"Patient":"Hello Good Afternoon Doctor, I am 44years old and recently lost my GOLD chain some 3 months back , My question to you is I was not even aware that I had lost my chain, only when my monther reminded me I realised I am not able to find it.

Unfortunately there is no medicine to improve such recollection of memory. You do not remember because you had reduced attention when to placed it and your mind actually did not register its location.

It appears that you are under stress these days due to which you have reduced attention to the work you are doing and thus you forget things and are unable to concentrate. 2. Mood changes can be due to response to stress or some mood disorder for which you need evaluation. Lack of interest in things and headache combined with the above symptoms may indicate depression but need evaluation on that.

To keep control over mind ,you have to engage your mind in your work, hobbies etc. Never stay idle , always think about productivity and postive thoughts and never think in negative way. Do some relaxation excercises and meditation such as yoga, dhyana, pranayam and anulom-vilom. Besides this maintain a regular daily routine and try to stick to the routine. Share your thoughts with your partner or close friends .  avoid taking  alcohol/smoking. take balanced diet with plenty of fluids. take some time to thank God, pray/ worship and maintain positive attitude. You may consult a psychiatrist  for medication if the above mentioned nonpharmacological  techniques do not offer much help.

OK i decided to buy an amp energy drink, first time i ever drank one just wanted to see what was so good about them. It was pretty good but then after a while i felt a SURGE of anger hit me and i felt really angry for some reason. I felt mad at the world, i hated everyone i saw and had nasty disturbing thoughts about people whom i didn t even know(strangers) i wished harm upon them which pretty much scared me. I talked to my girlfriend on my cell phone snapped on her and hung up in her face because she asked me to pick up bottles for my son. I murmured things about her calling her the b word and how bad i wanted to slap that B when i see her, of course i would never hurt my girlfriend i love her dearly but i became a different person. I was at walmart and a man stared at me for over 5 seconds i became disturbingly angry and was a few seconds away from punching him(wish i was joking but sadly im not). i felt like i was possessed or something and it freaked me out. i went home and punched my wall a few times till i was satisfied and went to sleep almost instantly, now that i have woken up i feel fine and decided to call my girlfriend and apologize to her. i looked it up on the internet and it seems i could have had a allergic reaction from the caffeine in my soda, but i want to confirm can caffeine really make you feel this way?","Doctor":"I appreciate your concerns and based on your history i would suggest the following:1. Energy drinks have ingredients that go into our brain can interplay with the brain chemistry. It is not necessary that it is caffeine there may be some other psychoactive ingredient as well. 2. You were previously not like this, you have no psychiatric disorder history and you are fine again after some time highly suggest that the mood change was induced by the drink and substances that changes brain chemicals ( neurotransmitters) can do this.

Do your hands shiver irrespective of any situation, don you notice hands trembling/shivering first thing in morning? Also whether there are any associated symptoms like sweating, pounding heart, frequent loose stools, weight loss or inability to gain weight despite a good diet? If yes, then your symptoms might be due to hypersecreation of thyroid hormone. Hence you should check your thyroid status by asking doctor for T3,T4,TSH levels. After ruling out hyperthyroidism, the remaining possibility is essential tremors which is usually a benign condition. A medication by name Propranolol helps to reduce severity of these tremors. hence kindly get in touch with your primary care doctor. Hope this helps. Good luck"},{"Patient":"I have rapid heart rate and am dizzy lately.  My heart rate goes up to 132 when I am walking around.  I am dizzy when I sit.  I went to Meijer and it happened there my blood pressure was 146/93.  108 heart rate.  I have never had high blood pressure.  I have had the same thing before and went to the E..R. where they said I was fine.  I am under a ton of stress right now, could that be the reason","Doctor":"hi..thanks for the query. May I know what is your age & whether you are on any long term medications or received a short course of medications recently? Assuming you have neither of these, first thing we need is to conclusively rule out a condition named arrhythmia which occurs due to dysregulated firing of hearts rhythm generator or pace maker resulting in symptoms of sudden onset pounding heart, lightheadedness or dizziness. This can be ruled out by a ecg. Once arrhythmia is ruled out; what we are seeing is essentially anxiety either situational or occurring suddenly. This can be easily taken care of by giving sos clonazepam/etizolam (benzodizepines) and depending upon cause of your anxiety SSRI group drug like sertraline, escitalram which will take care of your anxiety symptoms altogether. Hence dont worry, consult your primary care doctor & I am sure you will be fine in no time!! good luck"},{"Patient":"my son 16 years old studieng in 10th is not concentrating in study at all . when he comes home from schoool, he is not talking with any one familly member and he is scraching and cutting his arm writing  some alpha bets and when we ask him for this he says that just simply iam doing this.schools teachers are very much worried about this .understand that he was having affair with one girl","Doctor":"hi..thanks for the query. it is indeed disconcerting to see behavioural changes in a previously healthy child.

Or this may be start of syndrome of Psychosis/schizophrenia. Lastly this may be also because of use of drugs like cannabis (easily available & relatively cheap) How is his academic performance of late? does he take interest in conversing, going out, socializing etc. with family & friends?

Anxiety often leads to weird sensations and this seems to be on of them.I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist for complete evaluation of your problems.

It is a condition in which a person becomes anxious in presence of anything that reminds him of the trauma and avoids it.

Im working in Dubai. Please help me to find out my issue.I am very much interested in IT so I could learn my profession. But my social life becoming worse. Because I am unable to think about my life, future.

Next prblm is over sleep. Unable to wake up early ( sleeps at 2 o clock) please tell me whats happening on my mind","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query & I feel sorry for your troubles. Well I guess your between 20-30 yrs & you have faced these problems since your early teens. Please correct me if I am wrong. Prima facie what you are describing is suggestive of having anxious-avoidant type traits of your personality. So long as one does not face distress or lands up in trouble due to a particular personality trait, there is nothing wrong in having some anxiety, some avoidance behavior. But seemingly you are facing a lot of difficulty in your workplace & home. Thus its time for you to step up & seek help. Anxious-avoidant traits usually develop in settings of adverse childhood experiences, harsh discipline etc. but these are not the only reasons & some people may have them de novo also. Hence rather than blaming past events, we shall try to sort out this problem. You need to consult a Psychiatrist/Psychologist where you shall learn ''Assertiveness training'' which simply put is a behaviour modification technique which teaches you how to say NO, how to express discordant opinions, how to assert yourself, your opinions etc. without creating bitterness, how to handle a situation with confidence without appearing arrogant etc. Plus for your irregular sleeping habits, you shall be taught daily activity scheduling, sleep hygiene measures. If required you shall be also prescribed medications like SSRI group drugs, propranolol for better anxiety control. Dont worry, take the next step & seek help. You can also revert back to me if you need extra help.

SHE HAS HAD A QUADRUPLE BYPASS IN 1997, DUE TO A DOUBLE HEART ATTACK ??????????? I HAVE NO MONEY, AND NO CREDIT CARD, BUT AM EXTREMELY WORRIED","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query. Is your mom a diagnosed case of dementia? If yes, which type of dementia? Since she is receiving Remeron (Mirtazapine); she seems to be suffering from some form of depression or anxiety or both. As such Mirtazapine is fairly safe except for issues of weight gain & deranged lipid profile & hence may not be that good option considering your mothers history cardiac surgery. There are other safer options like escitalopram, sertraline, tineptine for control of depressive-anxiety symptoms. Similarly, risperidone is probably prescribed to your mother to control agitation or other behavioral manifestations which can occur in dementia. Though not entirely safe but if given in low doses & under constant medical supervision, risperidone seems to be OK choice. Other possible alternatives to risperidone which you can ask your doctor are Quetiapine, haloperidol (post your mothers current cardiac status evaluation) or a drug name Trazodone which can take care of depression, anxiety, agitation & all other behavioral problems arising due to dementia. Hope this helps. Good luck"},{"Patient":"my brother is suffering from obsession compulsive disorder. He is suffering of lack of confidence & insecurity.

It is due to the obsessions he is not venturing outside.You haven't provided the details of medications used for him. But I am sure that more with adequate treatment, his condition will respond to treatment. NIMHANS would be good place to seek treatment for your husband's obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), if you stay in Bangalore.I would suggest a combination of medications and cognitive behavior therapy in form of exposure and response prevention (ERP). ERP will consist of multiple sessions focusing on overcoming the obsessions and learning to control them. It is a highly effective treatment option for obsessive compulsive disorder. You can discuss regarding this when you visit a psychiatrist next. This form of treatment will be available at NIMHANS too.I do hope that I was able to answer your query.

Since when have you started having these difficulties? Also do you also have similar difficulties at heights, closed spaces like elevators, crowded places etc.? Your symptoms are suggestive of situational anxiety or situational phobias. Though you know that this fear of yours is irrational, but you are unable to control it when exposed to that particular situation hence called as PHOBIA. If untreated, this leads to gradual avoidance of problem causing situation. Thankfully, this condition is easily treatable by certain behavior modification techniques known as exposure & response prevention, guided imagery techniques etc. These are taught by Psychologist. Additionally there are medications like etizolam, clonazepam for rapid control of anxiety when exposed to problem situations & drugs like sertraline, escitalopram (SSRI) to help you alleviate the chemical imbalance in brain which is the root cause of this excessive irrational anxiety. You should consult a Psychiatrist for this problem. You can always revert back to me in case of additional queries.

We call these symptoms as apprehensive and obsessive thinking. You talk to any one and you shall find the dots and movements in front of their eyes. Instead of ignoring them you took them seriously and started pondering. Health anxiety overwhelmed and everything felt as if you have some health problem. Even an experienced and knowledgeable person like your doctor could not convince you. That is the problem with health anxiety and apprehension. Consider that your doctor is right and ignore the symptoms. Within a week you shall be alright. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further.Hope this answers your query.

I dont really know who else to ask about this kind of thing...but, I digress. My problem, briefly, is that I believe that my brain may be functioning at a less active (or more efficient) level than the people around me. By observation of said people, I have come to the conclusion that I have far less desire to socialize, bond, or even engage in casual conversation than other people. I become quite unsure of myself and feel like I m not doing the right things right when I actually do have to converse with someone. I feel like they re looking at me like I m from another planet alot of the times. I m not particularly concerned about others opinions of me necessarily, but I find it disconcerting that I cannot engage socially with others with any sense of ease or comfort. Quite the opposite.

You might well be having a depression - or one of its varieties called Dysthymia. Please check with a qualified mental health professional. However, trying to see what do you ACTUALLY want from your life and where do you stand now could an important exercise. Having a goal that sufficiently motivates you would help you build a purpose for your life, which would help you combat your perfectionism.

He's a physician working on an HIV database in the Congo in Africa.  Since he's returned he's not the same person.  We (the family) have been chalking it up to sleep depravation but I believe it's far worse than that.   He has turned from a man who carefully manages his bipolar to someone who appears to be autistic within a week.  I'm scared to take him to a hospital because they will label him mental and not look into the deeper problems that have surfaced due to the malaria.   His psychiatrist is useless.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for the query & I am sorry to hear all your troubles. Briefly, can you tell me what medications he is on for bipolar disorder? considering the change in behavior from cheerful to aloof which is labelled as autistic by you; this might be a new episode of depression triggered due to irregular drug compliance, stress of illness (malaria) or de novo. So we will need to adjust the dose of his mood stabilizer medications for prompt relief from depressive symptoms; Secondly when was he diagnosed as malaria? is there any any documented fever or other symptoms? and whether he is receiving any treatment for same? Considering his recent trip & return from a malaria & other infectious disease endemic area; it will be a good option for a peripheral blood smear (PBS) to identify malaria parasite & start treatment with artesunate, lumefantrine or other appropriate group of antimalaria drug. Lastly, as some of mood stabilizer medications like divalproate sodium, carbamazepine etc. tend to react with medications resulting in change in blood drug levels; your primary health care doctor should be informed about your friends medications of bipolar disorder. If you need any extra help, kindly revert back. Dont worry; act promptly...good luck"},{"Patient":"I AM 72 YEARS OLD.I AM 5 7 .I WEIGH 198 LBS.I HAVE A FIB,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,HIGH CHOLESTRAL AND HAD PROSTATE CANCER AND WAS TREATED WITH HARMONE SHOTS AND CYBER KNIFE TREATMENT.MY MD.

Thanks for the query. Brief answer is NO. Detailed answer is based on your age (72 years), associated illness (hypertension, dislipidemia etc.) presence of hallucinatory experiences might occur due to dementia which is a condition characterised by gradual onset memory difficulties, difficulties in carrying out previously learned activities, restlessness (anxiety symptoms), mood fluctuations (sadness-irritability), difficulty sleeping, vague suspiciousness, hallucinations etc. Similar symptoms may also occur in a rapidly developing condition known as Delirium also. But in case of delirium the symptoms fluctuate over hours. In dementia the symptoms usually persist.

Brief answer: Yes  antiphospholipid antibody (APA) can cause depression. Detailed answer is APA can cause depression with psychotic symptoms, frank psychosis, bipolar disorder like presentations ( your sons anger issues may infact be one of these) etc. Zyprexa (olanzapine) is an antipsychotic & not an antidepressant. Hence I shall need more information about his exact symptoms prior to being prescribed olanzapine.

Going by your description, you do not appear to be suffering from seizure disorder but rather from symptoms of incontrollable anxiety characterised by feeling funny, repetitive flashbacks of seizure event along with host of other symptoms.

For finding an effective & long lasting cure to your problems I need to know that what set of symptoms you had which were diagnosed as OCD & at present what medications you are receiving. It is true that allmost all Psychiatric illness including OCD are because of some neurotransmitter abnormalities in brain. For effective treatment I usually advocate medicines plus certain lifestyle changes like sleeping min 6-7 hrs every night, doing at least 30 minutes daily physical exercises like cardio, resistance training along with Yoga, pranayama which promote mental health. Depending upon your symptoms of anxiety & their triggers, we can plan out certain behaviour modification techniques known as exposure & response prevention which are known to increase medication effectiveness & hasten cure.

And it drains out my energy and health . ADVICE PLEASE Rita Bose","Doctor":"Hello Rita, thanks for your query; there are many reasons for lack of non fulfilling   sleep quality (insomnia) including anxiety, depression, poor lifestyle, poor sleeping patterns etc. Considering you are on multiple medications at present including T. Mirnite (mirtazapine), T. Paxidep (paroxetine), T. Quetan (Quetiapine) & T. LONAZEP (Clonazepam); I would like to know your exact set of symptoms & sequence of addition of these medications. For your ongoing sleep problems, lets start from basic measures; 1. Try to sleep & get up at fixed times 2. If you dont feel sleepy within 20 minutes of going to bed, get out of bed & pace around, read a book, soothing music till you feel sleepy again & then go back to bed 3. Use bed only for sleeping & sleeping only!! 4. Avoid tea/coffee after 6pm 5. Avoid daytime naps 6. Do 30 minutes daily physical exercise including cardio, resistance training, yoga & pranayama. If problem is only sleep; consult your Psychiatrist about medications like Agomelatine (agoprex), Ramelteon (rametax), Trazodone (Trazonil) or optimising T. Mirtazapine (Mirnite) alone & tapering off all other medications. You can get back to me for any further assistance. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"I have suffered from severe agoraphobia since I was 17.

Brief answer NO. Detailed answer, adderall (mixture of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine) is not going to help you for symptoms of panic & agoraphobia. Usually panic attacks by definition are episodes of severe anxiety which occur rapidly & decrease in intensity over few minutes. Hence there is a possibility that your panic episode most probably subsided by itself & not due to extra dose of adderall. You can consult your doctor for other effective anxiolytic  drugs like etizolam (for sos use); buspirone, trazodone, opipramol etc. along with certain relaxation techniques viz autogenic relaxation teaching, behavior modification techniques like exposure & response prevention etc. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Due to my energy levels my doctor presribed testosterone injections.

He submitted to blood and urine tests. He swears this will prove he was not using drugs. He did however fail the field sobriety test, the blood tests results are not back and judge has decided to suppress results if not back by July 1. My question is, can his bipolar cause him to fail the sobriety tests and cause him to have problems following officers directions?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query & I am sorry to hear all your troubles. Brief answer NO. Detailed answer, I need to know what medications your son is on at present. Usually mood stabilizer type drugs are prescribed for Bipolar disorder which are also used to treat  seizure disorders. These drugs are usually Divalproate sodium, carbamzepine, lamotrigine etc. Side effect of all of these drugs is drowsiness or sedation. But these drugs do not cause someone to fail a drug test. If a person has consumed alcohol or other sedating type of drug (intentionally or accidentally) in addition to these drugs; then there might be excessive sedation. Hence kindly recheck with your son about any such occurrence. Hope this helps.

I dont know why i dont go out i just cant get myself to do it and its just hard that everyone just thinks i cancel for the hell of it but i cant explain it to anyone","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for the query. This tendency of skipping things at the last moment due to some ''second thought/second guess/self doubts'' etc. is termed as ambivalence. I am sure apart from social gatherings, there might be other things also in your life when you get these doubts or second thoughts. Generally speaking, taking a second guess or ambivalence is NOT harmful per se until it causes significant distress or dysfunction. Hence a simple advice is whenever you do get such second thoughts about cancelling pre-planned events, make a 2 column chart & write down points in favor & points against abrupt cancellation to help you make a clear decision. You can get back to me if needed. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"hi, just over 2 years ago whilst pregnant at 27 weeks my blood pressure plummeted and i ended up in hdu, and in hospital for over 2 weeks until my blood pressure began to increase. It stayed at 70/30, and then increased to 80/40. Originally they tested me for Addisons Disease, but this came back normal. This gave me vertigo symptoms and what i called a skippy heart. An ECG was carried out as well as an ultrasound of my heart and despite a slight irregular beat, nothing was seen as significant. During childbirth I had electric shock feeling down both arms and legs to my hands and feet and then it was gone. After this I have had constant tingling and burning in my hands and feet. I have been to the doctors and had a nerve conduction test but to no avail. The doctor has told me to except it as one of those things that nobody knows. Until now I have but the burning and tingling sensation in the hands and feet are getting worse, as is my fingers are clicking and feel like they need to crack or are in the wrong place. This i can handle to a degree, but I keep getting the skippy heart feeling which makes me feel panicky and weak. What should I do next? I ve made an appointment at the docs for next monday but do not know really what to say apart from the above. Please help, as I am now beginning to get anxiety about going out without someone in case anything happens. I am a professional with a good job, social life etc but frightened of this sensation. I had gestational diabetes when pregnant, although high ketones and low sugars mainly. My mum is type 1 and dad type 2.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the query.

I also take venlafaxine, (anti dpepressant) . I have been under a lot of stress recently and have suffered with nodular acne which is very painful. I am using Differin medication at night and have tried lots of products, including oxytetracycline anti biotics. Can the Hrt be adding to this vey painful chin and nose scene? Any ideas would be very much appreciated . Thank you x.","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query. May I know what dose of venlafaxine you are receiving & how much of beneficial effects you are perceiving at present? You are taking Premarin as HRT as you mentioned. One of the side effects of taking synthetic estrogen (premarin) is flaring up of acne due to hormonal imbalance & also there is a risk of developing ovarian, breast cancers with unchecked use of HRT. Considering that you have already exhausted many different options for painful acne; you should recheck with your doctor about continuing premarin as gradual withdrawal of premarin tablets can help in resolving your acne flare up. Also check with your doctor about use of isotretinoin cream to alleviate acne especially in backdrop of taking venlafaxine as antidepressant. Good luck"},{"Patient":"when situations get extremely formal,i start stammerring...when i fear i start stammering...i always set my mind that i wont stammer,ill be confident when i speak to an unknown person or a person holding a lot of importance...but most of the times i stay fumbling over words unable to make a fluent speech. can you suggest me something by which i can get rid of this problem?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query. Do you fear the possible scrutiny by people in authority in formal situations? Do you become too much cautious about how you look, dress, talk etc. in these formal situations? If answers to these questions are yes then you are suffering from social anxiety disorder or social phobia. That is your real problem is NOT stammering but excessive fears of unwanted scrutiny by strangers, superiors etc. in formal situations. The treatment for social anxiety consist of behaviour modifications, cognitive behaviour therapy, role play, guided imagery techniques which are taught by psychologist & anxiolytic drugs like etizolam, clonazepam in combination with SSRI group of drugs. You can consult a Psychiatrist for both set of treatments & I am sure you will do very well in these formal situations!

My mum is very obsessive when it comes to cleaning and being very judgemental. Everyday she is moaning about cleaning whether I have done this or not, even at about 6:30 every morning she is constantly asking me to do something which has cleaning involved she will even finish work earlier just so she can do extra cleaning or preparing food. She was raised in a very strict home with parents who are strict, my mother is a bit like my grandmother who believes the women should do all the cleaning and cooking while men just do nothing. However this cleaning disorder has been having a huge effect on me as she thinks I have not been doing enough every day and therefore she is constantly having arguements with me. I have tried not to be at home so often because of this and when I am she never asks me how have I been or how my day has been the first thing is an arguement about cleaning yet again. At home I try my best to help by washing dishes, moping, hoovering, cleaning the garden, maintaing a clean bedroom, dusting and etc... What more could I do? I am to the point where I can t deal with this anymore and I am only 19, my mother doesn t spend any time with me even though I ask to go to the cinema or come out for dinner with me (my treat)... but chooses to clean. Since starting my new job at a Bank I haven t been able to do as much cleaning as I could before, but I still help and because I am finding it quite difficult I have brought up the subject of getting a cleaner and I would pay, however I got laughed at. My dad who isn t together with my mum said that she went to his house and started inspecting it to see if his cleaner had done a good job. I know my mum so well that if I was to get a cleaner to come home she would just do it herself again as she does the same to me after I cleaned the day after or 2 she will go back to cleaning the same spot again. My step dad has not even bothered saying anything as in my view I think he enjoys that she does all the work... and says we do not need a cleaner, but basically my main question is do you think she has a disorder? I have even offered kindly to pay for therapy and she declined saying she does not need it. Not to mention my mum has been on anti depresants before and now I am having to suffer with her cleaning habit and on going arguements with me. Help please?????!!!!","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I understand your emotions. In my opinion naming a disorder for your mothers behavior or obsession is quite easy. It can be called OCD. But is there any requirement to name it? Who is not obsessed? Everyone are with something of other. As long as the obsessions go out of hand and become a behavioral hazard, better not to address it. Your mother is doing well and finding her own satisfaction level with her current behavior. Let her enjoy. You can pacify her when she gets enraged. Please understand. Starting a psychiatric treatment for OCD may cripple her self confidence and self esteem. She does a good job, enjoys it, and never negative about it and is satisfied. What else do you want? Put her in trouble of psychiatric treatment? I shall oppose. Do according to your conscience. God bless you.

Simply putting depressive episode or a syndromal diagnosis of depression in Psychiatry requires a minimum of 2 weeks period of persistent sadness, decreased energy levels, decreased self confidence/esteem which remain irrespective of positive/negative events.

Based on the history I would suggest the following:1. I presume that potpouri is a mixture of some drugs,drugs tend to interfere with our mood and it is vice versa as well. Once one is depressed it can lead to use of drugs. However the symptoms you have mentioned appear to be a combination of anxiety and depression and you need further evaluation to ascertain some diagnosis.2. You can involve yourself in activities that interest you like any hobby.3. Take out time and practice progressive muscular relaxation exercises they help to ease out the stress/4.

I  would advise that do not worry xanax addiciton does not result in pakinson disease. Addiction to xanax may occur in 6 weeks but not necessary. Evaluation is needed to ascertain if you have become dependent on xanax. Combining it with alcohol increases the sedation so needs to be careful.

Since then, my mental health has seemingly gone downhill fast, and it has worried me so incredibly much. Every time I hear a noise that I don t know the source of, I have gotten really scared. But, I figured I was just being paranoid about it. But, recently, particularly in the last few days, I ve had random thoughts just pop into my head. I don t know how to explain it, but they re soft, and they re not mine, at all. For instance, I was reading a article a few hours ago, and the word communists just popped into my head. Just the word, nothing else, and it seems as if I didnt think of it. It s like having auditory hallucinations, but you don t hear them, you think them. In the last few weeks, I occasionally would have one of those random thoughts once or twice a day. But today, I ve had countless. At the same time, I ve had ringing ears. I ll turn my head, and the ringing will stop. It scares me, and I think I m going crazy. Today, I also heard beeping in my ears, and what sounded like construction. And, whenever I think or reflect on the ringing in my ears, it comes back again. So, am I developing schizophrenia, have I gone completely insane?","Doctor":"Hi dear,for diagnosis of schizophrenia there are certain criteria must be fulfilled and for diagnosis detail history and mental status examination patient is very important.form your history you might have schizophrenia but some other illness you have to exclude like any substance addiction , medical illness, any chronic medication etc.for diagnosis best to consult psychiatrist.not to worry much about your symptoms even if you have schizophrenia it is treatable.Thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi , I am a 19 year old female.

I ve had a history of amphetamine/coke use prior to this but the symptoms always seemed to be gone after a couple days.. A few days after trying meth for the first time I felt like my blood circulation was off and my legs/feet were Tingly/Sweaty/Numb . Then 2 months later, I had to go see a doctor because my feet were so red, almost purple that It was unbearable for me to manage the pain. Excessive sweating in my feet, hands, depression. I can still feel my feet, had multiple tests done of doctors poking them with a tooth pick. It s just the tingling sensation, the sweating and the urge of not having any desire to wake up in the morning. I feel like all these symptoms are related to REALLY poor blood circulation. I know I don t have diabetes, had a series of blood tests done which all came back negative. I m 100% sure that these symptoms came from meth. My question to you is what should I do to finally get rid of the pain? I know that cayenne, garlic helps with the blood flow. I also started to exercise recently, but that doesn t seem to be helping. My muscles used to twitch a lot all over my body for no apparent reason, and my heart rate was really high for the longest time, but it seemed to gotten a lot better.

The dose ranges from 25 mg to 250 mg/day. You should consult a psychiatrist for the same. In addition, it will be useful to continue with the behavioral measures that you've  tried earlier like avoiding fluids in evening, waking up periodically, etc.Hope that the information was helpful.

Thank you, Monica","Doctor":"hello Monica thanks for using healthcaremagic.I can understand after 9 surgeries how much stress under you are.Xanax(alprazolam) is anti anxiety benzodizepiens drug. However it is potent and cause dependence so gradually it is less effective and you need to increase the dose.

Pls assist me in my understanding","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Low attention in children aged 6 to 10 is normal. This can be attributable to their attention span which is very much limited and is around 2 to 3 minutes. If they are not entertained properly, their attention wanders. Curriculum experts know this and design the method of teaching interesting to the children. Therefore, making the child attentive, is the duty of the teacher.Secondly, the problem may be really due to ADD. For which you should consult a psychologist to assess your son's condition. There are psychometric tests to know whether your son is ADD. If he has ADD, extreme care should be taken from your side as well as from school side. There are laid down methods to handle a child with ADD. There are lot of websites which teaches you these. Look into them.

He takes rivotril to reduce his anxiety as there is no medication that treats OCD directly. I'd like to know if you think his stammering is related to his condition (OCD) and if there is a medicine that can cure it. Also is this hereditery?","Doctor":"Hi,OCD (Obsessive compulsive Disorder) is a condition where a person has repeated thoughts regarding anything and does various acts trying to stop the thoughts, e.g, washing repeatedly in response to thoughts about contamination. OCD is a treatable condition and there are various medication available to treat OCD. In addition, stammering can be related to anxiety. With adequate management, your boyfriend can get rid of his symptoms.There is a amount of genetic component in OCD and anxiety. But that doesn't mean that if a person has OCD, his son/daughter will definitely have it too. It merely increases the chance to develop it. There is no way currently to predict who will develop it and who won't.I would suggest that your boy friend should seek a psychiatric consultation for initiating proper treatment. Medications like sertraline or fluvoxamine are highly effective. Rivotril (clonazepam) will only reduce the anxiety temporarily and long term intake may lead to development of dependence over it. In addition to medication, he can also opt for cognitive behavior therapy consisting of exposure and response prevention. This is another effective means of treating OCD.Hope this information was helpful.

This has just been the way I am for some reason. I mean seriously you could blow someones head off in front of me an my response would be that sucks and walk away, my father always told me i would make the perfect soldier in the military.. I m not crazy, depressed or any of that dumb stuff. Just empty/emotionless inside. But the one day my friend hands me this pill, well it was a pain killer that changed me like no other. I loved my job, my friends, was very open, caring, had emotions, I was a completely different person, i felt......human. Well it lasted a month an was like forget this i m not gonna be a junkie. So back to the blah me, month later another friend hands me a Valium. Well, it didn t make me as happy/outgoing as the painkillers but little things wouldn t bother me, controlled my temper, i was very relaxed and easy going. Gave up on that for same reason then maybe 2 months later a friend said try this, it was Xanax. Well it gave me some feelings/emotions, was pretty happy, relaxed, could hold conversations and hang out with friends again. So once again i said screw this now almost 2 months later i m back to the same emotionless asshole. Out of all 3, the painkillers worked the best, they made me feel a lot more amazing versus the other 2. Oh also, when not on any of those i am a very quite person, i try to avoid conversation and when hanging out with friends i usually just sit there, all 3 meds made me pretty talkative. And one other thing, this one could be because ive done it for a few years now, but i can not fall asleep unless i smoke about half a bowl of weed before bed, which is fine. About me a little bit, I have a very good job, im actually quite happy with my life, I have done quite well for myself, so why am I like this, what is wrong me. Like i said im not depressed or anything, im just a quite person that doesn t really care about much of anything or want to do much of anything unless im on some kind of drugs (i was this way before the drugs).

Anand"},{"Patient":"I dont know where to begin. But I think that to describe my problems You need to know the facts that I have been molested by my father in my childhood, I reflected it in my plays, these plays really took the stress off me. I usually took the doll, undressed her and I pretended that someone other than my father, but still somebody adult wanted to see her naked and to touch her, I always did it on myself, I mean I took off my underpants and cried that I didn t want somebody to touch me, but still they told me they have to. In the role of somebody were my teachers, actors, adult people I had known. I felt psychological relief. I still continue it (I am adult so I imagine situation where I am dependent on somebody)but only in my thoughts. Simultaneously when I was about four I started masturbating by crossing my legs, my mom saw it and hated it, she admitted that throughout the childhood she didn t like me at all. It was very compulsive, I even counted it and it could be even 40 per once ( I don t know if they were orgasm, but it was definietely the climax of sth, usually after one time when I imagined myself very dependant on somebody touching me I started feeling angry and sad but my body still had the pleasure and some climaxes throughout the other 39 times). When I was 14 I started to feel pressure on my bladder, an urge to urine, nothing else, no pain or pinching just an urge and I urined in droplets, I still do. It s very annoying but I got used to. But know I see it gets worse after orgasm ( I never get orgasm through touching my clittoris but only through squeezing my legs, but now it s usually 2 to 3 times). My questions are : 1.Are the problems with urining connected to my psychology or it may be something wrong with me inside me, physically? 2. Is it wrong that I don t get climax when I touch my clittoris even when I am aroused, it sometimes gets even not pleasant, and may be painful although I am not violent in it? 3. May these problems mentioned above be connected with the fact that when I was 11 my father violently put me on ground in the way I was lying and then kicked me, mostly in the lower parts of body, and the next day I had the bleeding from the vagina. I thought I got my period then, but lately I started thinking that it could have been because of this kicking, especially that next bleeding was after a year when I was 12, then I had maybe 2 periods and a gap year. I read somewhere that it s normal to have a year gap after two periods so now I think I didn t have 2 gaps, but the 1 st bleeding was because of kicking. I have a problem with going to a gynaecologist because in some way I want to, to feel the pleasure I have from imagining, and in the dependency the situation makes I feel aroused, it s very embarrasing. Unfortunately so far I met gynaecologist who were rather brittle, and for instance told me Come when You start your sexual life , moreover I am so embarrased that some man/woman it doesn t make difference may see I am aroused. It s very uncomfortable, and most importantly I would use her/him by going to gynaecologist. Would You feel used knowing that your patient feels sexual arousement because of the situation?","Doctor":"DearWelcome to HMWe understnd your concernsI went through your details.

This makes me think I must be worth something and I must have a purpose in life which is keeping me alive, but I dont know what it is. I just feel like I'm a failure and like I'm worthless and if I died the world would be no different without me. It's hard to explain how I feel really, especially without actually speaking to you. I haven't told anyone about this. I've wrote down how I feel and things but never talked to anyone about it. I don't know whats wrong with me. At first I thought I was depressed but I dont  know anymore because this time last year my mum was depressed and I'm not completely the same as her. But maybe thats partly why I'm like this. If my mum was like this last year maybe I'm remembering it all and I feel like it's happening all over again, except this time to me. I wasnt really looking forward to the summer holidays this year because it just makes me think of my last one when I should of been having fun and instead I was taking care of my depressed mum. I could say so much more but I've already wrote enough I think. Thank you for taking the time to read this. xx","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

You don t just feel like you have down syndrome or feel like you have bulimia. And I told them how when you re depressed, that that s it. You re depressed all the time, you just have days where you feel better than normal or days where you feel worse than ever before. I simply told them that what they re saying makes no sense and that they just get sad sometimes and they need to stop diagnosing themselves because just because you show some symptoms from the internet doesn t mean anything unless its been diagnosed by an actual doctor. Is what I m saying true? Or do they have a point?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. You are 100% right and you should stick to it. But that is for others. You must learn to see depression positively. Depression is a disorder and not a disease. Depression is caused when we think (due to some negative happenings in our life) negatively and change our neural network. Positive thinking can bring the neural network back to square one. But depending on medicines is new trend. You should bring change into your life through these friends who are ready to accept you as you are. Being with them relaxes you and you shall think positive whenever you are with them. slowly your neural network changes. Try positive thinking and attitude.
