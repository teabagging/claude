Starts with involuntary swallowing during sleep followed by odd turns following day with v. short durations. Has a psychic component /deja vu Not as intense as early days now. These turns happen once every 4-6 weeks for 1 day only...Neorologist washed his hands told me to return if symptoms worsen!","Doctor":"Hi, I'm not quite certain what you are saying with the phrase, \\"involuntary swallowing during sleep.\\"  Perhaps, you are using this instead of something like subconscious, automatic, reflex. As opposed to involuntary.  Swallowing can be voluntary and REFLEX. Meaning not under direct conscious control.  This happens both while being awake as well as being asleep.  Therefore, everyone who has a normal swallowing reflex will perform swallowing \\"involuntarily\\" during sleep.  That is normal.  However, your neurologist is likely accurate in not looking to be actively aggressive with your symptoms since they are neither classic for TLE nor any other type of specific neurological syndrome (epileptic or otherwise).  With incidents that occur on what appears to be a cycle of time which are transient (1 day in duration), it is more likely than not that they are driven by the psychological rather than organic/neurological phenomenon.  If you've had the proper EEG and MRI studies of the brain and these are unremarkable then, I believe this is convincing evidence that there is no need for worrying about any type of epileptic or other neurological phenomena.

However, there's no good way to PREDICT before a person receives the treatment whether these symptoms may present or if they do what their severity or longevity may be. In some cases, symptoms do turn out to be prolonged and even permanent. What you can ask your doctor to also do (aside from stopping the medication) is to check you metabolically for several things. Such as Vitamin B12, folate, TSH, FT4, and Vitamin D since if these are low in levels they will exacerbate symptoms of neuropathy induced by other agents and make it difficult to reverse.

Your posture would only be expected to nominally affect bowel movement issues (in terms of peristalsis) if your scoliosis involves a significant curvature affecting the autonomic ganglion of the sympathetic chain that has is intertwined with the parasympathetic system (generally not AS affected by something like scoliosis but still possible if the C-spine is involved in the condition).

You should consult an endocrinologist regarding your symptoms since you may have either adrenal, thyroid, or pituitary failures causing your symptoms.

I was involved in a serious car accident 4 months ago and they only performed a c-scan which showed a hemarage in the brain. Hospital never followed up with an MRI. Please note, after the accident I was unconscious for a period of time. I feel the microvascular ischemic disease is related to the head trauma of accident. How do I prove this to my doctor. I have no other health issues. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Actually, the microvascular ischemia (synonym WHITE MATTER DEGENERATIVE DISEASE) is the one thing in your picture NOT ASSOCIATED with the trauma.  Everything else you mentioned certainly could be.  MICROVASCULAR ISCHEMIA occurs as a NORMAL PROCESS of aging and can be seen in MRI's of people over the age of 35-40.  It is even more likely to be seen in the brains of people who are hypertensive, diabetic, hypercholesterolemic, smokers (ongoing or previous), kidney disease. And there are other conditions.  Trauma is NOT associated with the development of this process. Hope I have answered your query.

Any ideas on what’s causing this? I’m much better than when I first woke up and it’s not nonstop, but I’m definitely still dizzy if I move the wrong way.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are very nearly giving a description of what is called BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO (BPPV). Medications are poor at treating this type of problem. Find a neurologist who will explain the details of what this condition is all about (or write to me at: www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi) and then, show you how to do what are called the BRANDT-DAROFF EXERCISES. If you do these exercises you will feel a huge difference in your condition in a matter of days. But you need to do them very diligently at least twice daily for a couple of weeks then, see how things go after that without the exercises. If the condition returns, BACK TO THE EXERCISES. There are other treatment approaches. But PLEASE avoid the use of anything called MECLIZINE or ANTIVERT.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your symptoms sound very PARKINSONIAN and if your tremors are the type that occur when you are at rest with the hands MORE than when the hands engaged in doing things. Then, the diagnosis may very well be that of PARKINSON'S DISEASE.  You should ask your doctor to refer you please to a neurologist who can diagnose the tremor and your other symptoms (which I believe are related) and place you on appropriate treatment.

I have been taking in a lot of fluids and feel better for about 1 hour then worse again. What is this and how do I get it to stop. I have also been having what I would describe as gallops. With my heart beats. And when I get excited or worked up it becomes much more pronounced.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I must point out that if you have that large of a PFO you really must get that closed.  You are at a significant risk for embolic stroke in the future.  Other symptoms likely due to the mixing and shunting of deoxygenated blood into your arterial system which means your brain (and other organs) are running at suboptimal oxygenation. Something doesn't quite make sense in terms of the cardiologist telling you to just \\"go back to your PCP.\\"  Whatever the other details are in your case. Your focus should be on getting that PFO repaired.  Do that and you can look forward to many of your symptoms extinguishing. If not, then, as you get older things will likely accelerate and other complications may begin to happen. Such as stroke as I said before. Hope I have answered your query.

The 2 symptoms have no obvious relationship.  If you are singing in a choral group and standing for long periods of time then, the numbness in the shin could be due to nerve compression at the level of the crural sheath at the hip which could be affecting certain nerves that eventually serve the shin area.

The only way I can describe it is that it s like an electrical current that comes and goes in my head. Such an odd feeling. I remember having this feeling when I was beginning to take Prozac many years ago. I guess my question is, is this sensation normal? I can deal with it if I know it is a normal side effect. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. GEODON has many side effects.  The answer to whether it is from the medication is to analyze the timing between WHEN exactly your funny feeling in the head seems to come on, how long it lasts, and WHEN exactly was the last dose of GEODON. If Geodon was taken anywhere within 1-2 hrs. of when you get the feelings in your head. And this is happening consistently to the point of being able to document when you take your medication and when you get the zaps in your head. Then, that's your answer.  If there are no firm time correlations then, the feeling you're having may not have anything to do with the medication itself.  The other way to figure this out is to read the long list of side effects that the pharmacist gave you when you first had the medication prescribed. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Unfortunately, PSP is not a curable condition and there is really no known medication to even treat the deterioration that occurs. It is part of a constellation of diseases known as PARKINSON'S PLUS SYNDROMES. Although PARKINSON'S DISEASE is treatable none of the PARKINSON'S PLUS diseases even carry known treatments. We tend to use the same medications used to treat Parkinson's Disease. Therefore, in the setting of your husband showing some improvement I would recommend sticking with that treatment plan.  I would defer to the expertise of your doctor and not do anything that contradicts your doctor's recommendations.  If your doctor is the type that encourages dialogue with his/her patients or family members then, by all means bring up your ideas.

Vertine is a bronchodilator which is used as a PREVENTATIVE medication to interfere with asthmatic or COPD attacks.  If he is suffering side effects in his eyes he should immediately advise his doctor about this who will give him further instructions on the medication.

None of her other joints hurt. She was able to walk downstairs and get in a tub of water, but is crying with pain when she has to turn or move her neck. She has had the first meningitis vaccine, but not the second. I just gave her 4 advil to help with the headache. Should I be concerned about the neck pain?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Dizziness upon standing could be poor oral intake of food and water (i.e. dehydration) and this is corrected by making sure she OVERDOES it with the water and juice while she avoids pop, cafeine, etc. The neck pain making her cry I would be mildly concerned of if this is like nothing she's ever had before and espeically if she recently got any type of vaccine for meningitis.  Although, the chances are extremely small this could related to any type of meningeal complication. If she were to be seen by her PMD or taken to an Urgent Care center. It certainly wouldn't hurt and they may even have a CT scan of the head/neck that can be done.

Very unusual for kidney problems such as an infection or stone cause the pain you describe.

Scheurmans kyphosis due to incresed angle in thoracic vertebrae and bulging of the disc and compression of the nerve roots may cause weakness in limbs with tingling sensation.

Use Milwaukee brace, which is made of molded plastic that conforms to the waist and is designed to hold the shoulders back and gradually straighten the thoracic curve.  On the back, two upright, padded bars line up along the sides of the spine. Pressure from the upright bars straightens the spine.

Without a full history, I understand it is impossible to respond with confident specificity; still, I have dealt with sporadic lower back pains for about 7 years, and around the first of last May, the pain returned and was crippling; the worst it had been, without a particular, immediately precipitating injury. After a week, the lower back pain transitioned into sciatica in my left leg, although it is faintly present too in my right thigh and right ankle. The pain is now worst on my left ankle, but present too in my left shin, my left index toe is numb most of the time, and sometimes feels as though jammed. I have the burning patch on my left thigh, and the hallmark symptom of sciatic too--but I am now dealing with nerve tingling and soreness in my left arm, at times right arm, and in both hands--which also slightly tremor, my leg too if crossed--but these tremors are not new to this recent onset. I feel tenderness and pain at times in my neck/shoulder, left side. My stomach is constantly spasming, its persistent contractions distinctly visible. I am dealing also at times with jerky movements of my legs and arms, and sometimes my head. I seem now to frequently urinate with great pressure, but I do not feel urgency to micturate beforehand, and my bowel movements are now often difficult. It very much seems to be a comprehensive and progressing thing, and now rapidly so, affecting certain peripheral and motor nerves primarily.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

Three skull fractures, two brain bleeds, one internal, one external. Along with other leftover symptoms I have severe pain in the upper left quadrant of the brain, upon bending,coughing, even moving at times. In the last few days, it has been terribly often. It s not like a headache, Just severe short-termed pain. Also, this area of the brain is where the brain damage is. My Internist said I should go back on the Gabapentin. It seemed to help before. I hope it does now. Is gabentin just for pain or, hopefully, to calm this issue down?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Gabapentin would help you with the neurological pain. If you have sustained brain injury, the damaged cells cannot be healed. You may get better if there is associated bleeding. But that is because this bleeding slowly resolves. The damaged tissue cannot be repaired. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Feel free to contact me for further information as needed.

She has Parkinsons Disease and for the last couple of years has experienced wide fluctuations in blood pressure, from very low to very high. When pressure goes very high she is given a spray (once or twice) and this reduces the pressure. Her neurologist would like her to use less spray and gave her some suggestions about how to get up gradually, not making sudden movements. She can t remember the other suggestions (simple exercises and life style stuff) he gave to help her use less medication. Can you suggest a website or videos that might help? Many thanks.

I also had difficulty completely emptying my bowel. Around mid-December, after running a 5K, I had pain in on the right side in my pelvic area which lasted for a week. I also had pain and pressure under my right rib cage. The pain in the pelvic area increased and I had abdominal swelling (a pelvic MRI showed nothing). When the swelling and pain did not subside, I ended up going to the ER in January of 2104 . All they found after a CAT scan was excess abdominal fluid; they said this was possibly from an ovarian cyst that had ruptured. My GI woes continued and I felt like I was emptying too much from my bowels whenever I went in the morning. The stools would often stick to the toilet bowl. I also continued to have incomplete evacuation. This continued on and off for months. In April and May, I had two days where my stomach felt so bloated and full that I had to throw up to relieve the pressure. In May, I ran the Broad Street run and had stomach pain the entire race. All throughout the summer, I still had problems with emptying my bowels and emptying what looked like too much. In August, I took my migraine meds (Immitrex, which always gave me abdominal pain, but I continued to take it as it took away my migraines) one night and went for a 16 mile run the next day. When I finished, I had bad pain under my right ribcage and the pain descended down to my stomach. I ate chili that night and this worsened my pain to the point where I considered going to the ER. This triggered two months of my stomach feeling unsettled and my stools looked like sludge (again, I was emptying too much and still could not completely empty my bowel). After this “GI attack” I lost 7 pounds. I finally went to a GI doctor in October who discovered after doing an endoscopy that I had severe esophogitis (even though I never had any symptoms of GERD—no acid reflux, esophageal burning, etc). There was also a small, benign nodule that had formed under my right rib cage (where I had the pain). After this diagnosis, I changed my diet (I eliminated acidic foods) and my stomach settled down, even though I still had stomach discomfort off and on. I also continued to have pressure under my right rib cage. In December of 2014, I had a hysterectomy (I had multiple issues with my uterus). I recovered well and I felt like my GI tract was “back on track.” I was on a good routine where my system emptied at the same time every day and it was emptying what seemed to be a normal amount and it looked like “healthy” stool. I had also put on the weight I had lost from the previous GI attack. In February of 2015, after reading about the dangers of esophogitis, I decided to take the PPI my doctor prescribed in October of 2014. I then started having acid reflux—burning in my esophagus, burps that were stuck in my throat, etc. So, I returned to my GI doc who then told me to take 60 mg of Dexilant. I did so for a week and 4 days and then I developed severe abdominal pain. I immediately went off of the Dexilant and what ensued was two months of GI hell—I had cramping pain in stomach that was relieved somewhat with taking different laxatives to empty my system. I also was not able to eat most evenings because of the pain in my stomach. As a result, I lost 9 pounds. One doctor said that stopping the acid production in my stomach caused bad bacteria to grow/caused a leaky gut and this seems like a likely theory as different foods that I ate seemed to worsen the pain. Mid April I also ate salmon and asparagus one day and this resulted in awful pain in my stomach in the middle of the night and into the next day. I had to throw up to try and relieve the pain—what came out was full pieces of the asparagus that I had eaten. I had an abdominal MRI to rule out anything going on in my stomach. It came back negative. Now in May, the abdominal pain has stopped, but I have abdominal discomfort most evenings—my stomach feels full and bloated and my gas feels trapped. The pressure is not relieved until I go to the bathroom the next day. I am back to not being able to completely empty my bowels—there seems to always be a little more that I need to strain to get out (what comes out is normally flat and/or thin or a small “nugget” when the “extra” does come out). To rule out anything serious going on with my colon, I had a colonoscopy on May 4; I also had a repeat endoscopy. My colon looked great, but I still have a little scarring on my esophagus. I don’t know if the PPI incident reveals that I may have low stomach acid and not high stomach acidity. Or, did it exacerbate an existing condition with SIBO. Do I have motility issues where food is either moving too quickly or not quickly enough through my system? If so, what creates this problem? Is it possible my gallbladder is not working correctly and breaking down my food even though the abdominal MRI did not show anything? If you are able to lend any insight as to what my going on with my GI track, I would greatly appreciate it!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to health care magic,I have read all your long query and understand the concern.Your main problem is stomach bloating and delayed emptying or fullness in stomach.This all symptoms could be due to dyspepsia, constipation,gastroenteritis,IBS orinflammatory bowel disease,parasitic infestation(giardiasis) etc.You should undergo certain routine blood investigations with urine and stool examination for R/M and ova or ultrasound of abdomen or upper GI scopy if required.Treatment is mainly depend on the underlying cause but symptomatic treatment can be given.You may require antibiotics (quinolones, antiprotozoals or amoxycillin derivatives)and anti helminthic (albendazole) with proton pump inhibitors and prebiotics and probiotics.You must consult your gastroenterologist for detailed medical history and thoroughly clinical examination and get it diagnosed first.Regards,"},{"Patient":"For the past two day I've been experiencing abdominal pain, and some bloating.

I am extremely dizzy taking Simenet medication and I get up alowly and it is not related to blood pressure. How can I prevent being so dizzy. Any advice you can give me is much appreciated. Thanks, Beth","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Your physician is going to be the resource for advice since I am not privy to the details of your clinical history, the dose of medication you're taking, other medications you may be taking, or any laboratory or other data about you to know exactly the reason for your dizziness and how best to fix the problem.  However, this is a common problem with Sinemet.  Often, it IS question of BP, except not as you perceive it. Simply taking the blood pressure doesn't tell the whole story. As a side effect sinemet can cause something called ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION to occur.  This will cause blood pressure to drastically drop whenever standing from either a lying or seated position.  There could be also be a DRUG TO DRUG interaction going on causing this problem (though less likely since you're only reporting something wrong upon standing).  Again, I emphasize the utility in speaking with your doctor to say what they say first before making any changes to your regimen or deciding on not taking the medication.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The brainstem and the C1 levels are pretty close, the C1 is the last spinal cord level before it joins the brainstem.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Well, a T12 compression fracture is not fracture of the spinal CORD. Your cord is intact. It's the vertebral body that has been damaged.  How you get back into sexual activity is by slowly experimenting with different positions in which the back and hips would be minimally involved in movement.  Everyone is different and so there is no one answer that works for all.  Typically, being on one's back takes away motion and mobility but it also tends to increase the amount of sheer weight against the spine and this may be painful. Sitting may also be an option on a chair with a high back for support. Hope I have answered your query.

I advise you (and your lady friend) get appointments for a full battery of tests including serum, urine, and likely brain imaging studies.  It sounds as if you could be suffering from the early stages of some type of cognitive dysfunction such as Alzheimer's dementia, however, this can only be diagnosed after making sure that you have no reversible causes for mental in capacities such as thyroid or other glandular abnormalities, Vitamin B12, Vit. D, electrolyte, or infectious types of disturbances.  Seek out a neurologist who is interested in performing a comprehensive set of studies and analyses before coming up with a diagnosis.

Went to the er and they just treat the migraine, have an appt with Neuro but was wondering if anyone had any ideas or tests that I should ensure I get done or any possible ideas on what could be happening. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You should have an imaging study performed of the head (which I'm sure the ER probably did: CAT scan, likely in order to rule out a bleed or mass lesion).  Now, what might be helpful would be an MRI of the brain to look for other types of structural abnormalities such as elevated intracranial pressure or a  Chiari malformation. Unfortunately, until you see the neurologist and have a full neurological workup you will be wondering what is going on.  The fact that the ER felt it was ok for you to go home tells us that in their opinion there was nothing seriously going on in the head requiring hospitalization.  Now, the trick is to get a rapid appointment with a neurologist.  If you were in the Cleveland, Ohio region of the United States we could make that happen. Hope I have answered your query.

Your description is consistent with some form of viral encephalitide and not with a diagnosis of senile dementia (if that is what the doctor suggested).  However, my recommendation (if you believe the doctor to be in error) is to get your friend to an academic or teaching hospital to be seen by the neurology service (ER visit if necessary) and tested thoroughly with blood, CSF, urine, and imaging studies to make the diagnosis.

Metoprolol is a beta blocker and typically not very robust as a 1st line medication for Essential Tremors (ET) though it is written to be so.  Gabapentin is poor at best at controlling ET and causes more side effects than gains. You may be able to bring the tremors under very good control on less dose than what you're taking with the Metoprolol and get rid of the Gabapentin entirely.

You may have a condition known as BENIGN PARLOXYSMAL VERTIGO (BPV).  Easy to diagnose but a neurologist or neuro-otologist and easy to treat with what are called BRANT-DAROFF Exercises.

Therefore, be prepared to feel dizzy spells whenever going from a lying to standing/sitting position, going from a STANDING to a LYING position, flipping or rolling over in bed, bending down to pick up something from the floor, etc.   Changes in head position should be done slowly and when you get into a new position, just close your eyes and wait for the dizziness to stop before moving or opening your eyes.

We went to ENT Specialist and he said, Everything is ok and prescribed ETOVA-MR for 3 days twice a day, the tablet worked effectively but the little pain was still there, so we went to our family doctor who suggested to take Escitalopram 5mg once at night for 6 days, after taking two tablets of it my mother has the side effects like Dry mouth , body pain , loss of appetite and lose motions . Now we have stopped the latter medicine, but the side effects are not cured. Kindly consider the whole case and prescribe medicines for these side effects.?? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I have gone through the whole symptoms you have described. I understood that your mother is suffering from a new onset of an episodic headache. To my knowledge, it looks like a condition called occipital neuralgia. It is a rare type of primary benign headache. Benign means not a serious condition. So don't get worried. I like to share more about occipital neuralgia.The term “neuralgia” refers to pain in the distribution of a nerve, in this case, the occipital nerves. Attacks are episodic and last a few seconds to minutes. Pain is piercing, stabbing, or sharp in quality, and severe in intensity. Sometimes it can be mistaken for a migraine, but a migraine headache is usually last longer. Occipital neuralgia usually diagnosed based on a thorough history and physical exam. The neurological exam will often be normal.  By diagnostic criteria, the pain will be eased temporarily by injection of a local anesthetic along the affected nerve, but not always necessary. MRI or CT scan brain seldom required to rule out other harmful causes. I will suggest for your mother a conservative treatment including rest, periodic warm or cold compress, massage and physical therapy, directed at alleviating secondary muscle tension. If medications are necessary I recommend anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant for temporary relief. In severe cases, we use Carbamazepine, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, and Tricyclic antidepressants which tend to decrease the frequency and severity of attacks. Refractory cases some required nerve block or surgery. Regarding side effects you inquired, Yes Escitalopram can cause Dry mouth, body pain, loss of appetite. But diarrhea is not a side effect of Escitalopram. I suggest you discontinue the medication.On a cautious note, I like to say that as she is 60 yrs old, and new onset headache, if she is persisting with new bothersome symptoms doing brain imaging (MRI) is worth. Hope I have answered your doubts. If anything else I will be happy to help.

I agree with you on the fact that your symptoms could be related to a viral infection. Coming to this point, I recommend having some rest, taking acetaminophen for the pain and plenty of water. It is also important to closely monitor your blood pressure values in order to exclude possible low blood pressure. If your symptoms persist in the next days, I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests (complete blood count, a sinus X ray study for sinus infection, PCR, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes).

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I understand your concern and would explain that Amitriptyline as well as Gabapentine may lead to withdrawal syndrome. But, if you gradually taper the dose, you can avoid withdrawal syndrome. Other possible treatment options would be Duloxetine and Pregabaline, which have less adverse effects compared to Amitriptyline. You should discuss with your doctor on the above treatment options.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that difficulty sleeping is not a typical sign of Prion Disease. You should know that Prion Disease is a serious medical disorder, which main initial symptoms are rapid cognitive deterioration and seizures. Difficulty sleeping is usually related to daily stress, depression or a poor sleeping hygiene. So, just don't worry about it! It does not seem to be anything serious. Hope to have been helpful!

From the time he wakes up until the time he sleeps he is in pain. He has had the nerves burned once and fixing to go to the Dr. again to see if it will help him again, even if it is for a few months like before. He has started walking arched over and it s hard for him to straighten up. Please if there is any way to help him not be in as much pain we would appreciate any information that you can give us. Thank you and have a great night.","Doctor":"Since Parkinson's disease patients typically assume a HUNCHED posture I believe any back pain he is experiencing may be at least partially from this abnormal position of the spine.  At the same time it is also the case that a condition known as DYSTONIA occurs and that can contribute to lumbar muscle pain.  I would not be in favor of \\"burning\\" nerves....the procedure has a poor overall long term outcome and the more destruction of good tissue that it is done...the more likely he is to develop even more pain in the future from the development of scar tissue.  Very similar things happen in vein stripping procedures....and women who get it done will tell you that initially, it is wonderful and they're happy...but as time goes on they need to get the procedure done more frequently and veins that are taken out are even deeper and the whole picture becomes complicated as it's a never ending chase with more and more veins having to be taken out or sclerosed due to pain and/or cosmetic issues...until there are no more to take out and then, really bad things can happen.  The same goes for \\"burning nerves\\" as a way of dealing with pain....I would absolutely avoid that procedure.  It is a poor remedy for a problem which unfortunately has few options.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Heat ablation may do well in the short run but over the course of time it is not uncommon for pain to return and in some cases it can be worse than before.  I typically do not recommend RFA procedures to my patients based on the relatively long term outcomes I've seen over the years.  I would consider alternative therapy or another opinion altogether for pain management purposes.  Once the ablation is done and the nerve is destroyed, scar tissue will form and you can't go backwards. Thanks"},{"Patient":"My daughter has jaw popping, facial tightness on right side of face/jaw.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Judging from your description you probably mean that he has suffered a subdural hematoma. The answer to how much time he will need to recover depends on how much blood has leaked. Severity may vary from mild with a thin layer of blood which will be absorbed gradually over a few weeks to very severe forms with brain compression which may lead to death or severe disability (needs surgery). So the answer depends on brain imaging reports, how much blood there is. Furthermore you mention having a heart attack?! If that is correct things are much more complicated as that is a life-threatening condition in itself and in addition to that blood thinners are needed which may increase the blood leak. So if indeed there is a heart attack it would be a very complicated situation with a difficult prognosis to make. Hope I have answered your query.

Haven t started it yet and do not intend to until we can talk to his Doctor just wanted your opinion on if it safe to dissolve.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. It is clearly not advisable to alter the capsule in any way before swallowing whole.  Dissolving can cause unpredictable serum plasma concentrations resulting in toxic levels of medication designed to be time released.  You also did not explain the rationale for switching to Trokendi.  It doesn't sound like your son is having any seizure control problems with the Topiramate he's on AND he could have the option of  sprinkle tablets with that drug.  So why the switch to a drug he really can't comfortably take unless the capsule's altered which is not advisable? Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I am 17 years old. I began my period at 11, I was diagnosed with chronic daily migraine at 13, I've never had good vision, and lately I have lost my balance.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The answer to your question is yes, there may be osteosyntesis of the broken metatarse with plates, but it requires an open surgery.

Those values ( especially diastolic blood pressure ) require medical attention and treatment, so, you should not wait for further increase of blood pressure because of associated risk of stroke, miocardial infarction.

She has been in ICU for a month and all vitals are now stable but a VP Shunt was just done 4 days ago. She opens her eyes and slightly tracks movements or sounds. How much damage is done and what are the chances of recovery?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I need more information than what you're giving for the purpose of discussing what you are looking to understand.  You could start with speaking with the neurologist taking care of her, if not her PMD. You could then, ask the neurosurgeons about things.  Of course, being in the ICU for 1 month following a brain bleed is a long time but it is an encouraging sign that she opened her eyes and seems to be doing some tracking of objects both by sight and sound.  That means that about 2/3 of the brainstem is probably intact.   I cannot say what damage has been done to the brain without being able to examine her and examine the imaging studies and labs.  However, again, opening the eyes and tracking is a very good sign in terms of prognosticating at least an acceptable neurological outcome. Hope I have answered your query.

Lightheadedness after childbirth is common and highly likely from low blood pressure (hypotension). But low blood sugar, anemia, dehydration, thyroid gland disorders (hypothyroidism) and inner ear disorders may also cause lightheadedness. Caffeine has a stimulant effect to the brain. It may cause dizziness if you are consuming too much of it.Initial investigation of lightheadedness should include physical exam (including checking blood pressure), complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry test and blood sugar.

If it's causing too many side effects there are other antiepileptics which may be tried.

Painkillers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) can help improve your situation. If your situation does not improve or even gets worse (severe headache, nausea, gait imbalance, confusion), I would recommend going to the ER for a physical exam and a brain CT scan to exclude possible delayed intracranial hemorrhage due to the head trauma.

I would explain that your symptoms could be related to a chronic infection or a metabolic disorder. An autoimmune disorder like arthritis can not be excluded either.

Without knowing more details about your daughter and where/who is evaluating her and making decisions to add/increase meds it is difficult to give you a definite answer.  However, so long as someone with knowledge and expertise is taking care of her taking the meds you describe can be safely done though it is a fair amount to be sure.  Still her seizures need to be controlled.  There is a surgery for Refractory seizures that can be done but this should only be considered after it is clear that no reasonable option exists. For example, there is something called a VAGAL STIMULATOR that can be highly successful.  Has that been considered.  There are a number of other newer medications on the market for Generalized Tonic Clonic seizures (we don't really say GMS any more), have all possible sources of infection been looked for as cause to her sudden increase?

Pulsed electromagnetic field is a recently introduced treatment. For the moment there is not much evidence to support it, no studies to show any benefit in spinal stenosis. Perhaps in the future as new studies are done it might show benefit, but for now I can't recommend it based on any scientific proof, particularly considering costs. Chiropractics is not a branch of traditional medicine, it belongs to alternative medicine, so I am afraid many of the claims are unsupported by medical studies and it is hard to assess whether claimed benefits are real or a method to increase earnings.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. \\"A nervous breakdown\\" is not a very precise term and can be different things to different people.  Can you be a bit more specific in what you're feeling in terms of psychological/psychiatric states of mind (i.e. anxiety, depression, fear, stress, being overwhelmed, irritable, constant headaches that don't stop, etc.)  It is clearly best to try and take a step back and \\"regroup\\" if possible when encountering multiple road blocks in getting daily tasks done.  But if a person is having trouble knowing exactly how to do things or even may think they are successfully doing progressing but not sure whether it's working or not then, one needs to seek the counsel of an expert such as a therapist, counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist.  You are right in the assessment that good outcomes when finding yourself in this sort of \\"confusion of sorts\\" can take a long time and trying to tackling the whole ball of wax at once is likely to result in more complications.

I would rather have surgery than continue this way. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Surgical procedures are usually only contemplated for issues of sciatica or canal stenosis after a good course of physical therapy or exercise therapy have been tried along with conservative medical treatments with medication. I would caution you against the surgical solutions since they can lead to more pain and more problems than what you currently have.  Be very careful with those who say they can \\"cure\\" sciatica surgically. Once things are cut and sewn, they really can't be taken back, and the consequences of developing scarring in the area of the surgery itself may cause more pain and discomfort than what you already have. I had in patient in my practice who finally stopped getting a surgery for his sciatica after operation. Simply because his entire lumbar spine had essentially been fused and manipulated so that there was nothing left to cut and remove.  His pain was decidedly more intense and difficult to control than it ever was in the beginning and he actually said that the 1st procedure was a mistake.  I always tell my patients to think long and hard before wishing they could get a quick outpatient \\"laser\\" treatment for their backs and get out in 1 day (as many clinics will advertise).  If you are able to ride the bus and do the long walk, then in my opinion, no matter how much the pain may be at this point, the surgery is not necessary at this time though it may seem appealing.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The biopsy for diagnosing temporal arteritis (TA) is done by a surgeon.  Careful that they do not do both sides at once. They should only do one side but they should take a long enough piece of the artery, to really make sure the pathology lab has a solid piece of material to work with.

However, the answer is a little difficult because such paralysis may be cause by many different causes, simply knowing there is weakness is by no means enough and tests are needed to identify the cause before we start discussing treatment which varies according to the cause.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If by cure you mean reversing the degenerative process, taking your spine back to as it was I am afraid that that is not possible. Spinal degeneration is a chronic issue happening over the years due to the wear and tear the spine has to endure. As you age your spine isn't going to get younger, such degenerative changes are bound to happen, in some faster than others. So what is aimed is to slow down the process and control the symptoms. Medication is not aimed at reversing the degenerative process there is no medication for that. It is aimed at alleviating the pain giving time for the local inflammation to subside. So the length of treatment depends on symptoms, if pain persists they may be continued indefinitely keeping an eye on side effects. As for what can be done to slow down degeneration, to prevent recurrences in the future, physical therapy is the best choice. It is the only thing offering long term benefit as it strengthens spinal muscles enabling them to lessen the load on the spine. It should be continued even if pain subsides as otherwise there might be pain recurrences in the future since as I told you it is a chronic issue. I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"epidural landed in wrong place spine..now having tingling sensations throughout head and body what is the cause and what is 2 cc's the amount the dr. said he put in...at any rate it went in my spine I literally passed out and thought I was going to die..is this causing those tingling sensations?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

Contrast: 10 ml Multihance IV. FINDINGS: Brain: Intracranially, there is no pathologic mass effect, hemorrhage by gradient susceptibility, or acute infarct by DWI. No pathologic intraparenchymal, leptomeningeal, or dural enhancement. Several punctate, non-specific periventricular and subcortical white matter signal abnormalities on T2/FLAIR are identified and likely relate to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Ventricles and extra-axial fluid spaces: Ventriculomegaly out of proportion to central brain atrophy. Sella, suprasellar cistern, and orbits: Within normal limits. Major vascular flow voids: Normal intracranial vasculature MR appearance. Calvarium and extracranial soft tissues: Within normal limits. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells: Largely clear.

I was recently charged with a DUI (no alcohol) after a minor car accident, fell and injured after exiting car and experienced balance problems. A police officer ordered a blood draw and there is concern from a toxicologist and a drug and alcohol assessment center suggested by my attorney. I recently experienced an extreme difficulty in balance holding on to walls and furniture lasting 5 minutes after arising from bed--worse but similar to after the car accident. I drink a lot of coffee and always feel alert. This is very serious and I could have my driving license pulled. What do you suggest is safe?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. However I do not agree at all with the treatment you have been taking. Valium is not a medication which is to be used for long term, only for a few weeks. It causes drowsiness and over time creates tolerance and dependence as well as affecting cognitive functions and balance. The fact that you have been combining it with butalbital makes things even worse. It too is a drug which causes drowsiness and dependence. So it is only natural that the police, toxicologist and attorney find it serious. You should withdraw at least Valium (both would be better). Since you've been taking them for a long time it won't be easy, should be gradual and under the guidance of the toxicologist. Hope I have answered your query.

I was involved in a car accident about 6 months ago. I was at a complete stop, and rear ended by another vehicle going approximately 30-40mph. I began having lower back pain immediately after impact, and went to the emergency room. The initial x-ray and CT scan showed nothing abnormal. I got home the same day, and when I sat down on the couch, it felt as if somebody had hidden a knife in the cushion, and it went directly into my tailbone. I purchased a donut pillow for home and office immediately. The pain has has been present constantly, and I have yet to feel relief. It has increased in severity over the last 6 months, and in the last month or two, I noticed that my left leg goes completely numb almost immediately when I sit to use the restroom. I still cannot sit on a flat surface without my pillow, sitting for long periods of time leaves me in tears because the pain becomes so severe, and I have trouble with bowel movements because of the pain. I have seen a spinal specialist who told me that I should google somebody else, because I don t have time for this kind of low level case and I am at a loss. This week, I noticed that the numbness is coming a lot more frequently and lingers longer, my thigh muscle feels tight, and the numbness has gone down to my left foot. Once my leg goes numb, my foot begins to feel so cold that I often have to soak it in warm water to gain feeling again. When it goes numb, the bottom of my foot turns extremely white. I have always had a protruding tailbone, but it has never been painful, until the accident. As I was showering this week, I noticed that it is protruding far more than it used to. I have not lost a significant amount of weight, or started any kind of treatment. Any suggestions on what may be happening, and what type of doctor I need to visit? I would greatly appreciate your help. (All numbness and pain is in my left leg and foot. Has not bothered my right at all) Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I think that you have pain and numbness due to the compression of nerve.

Tubal blockage do not cause this.Then go for ultrasonography and / CT scan whatever is felt necessary by your Doctor.Get a full course of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines to get a cure.

I have been on Nortriptyline 10mg cap #60 for 17 days,(three a day) I was perscripe this medicine for pain, (I was told that I have Permanent Nerve damage in my left knee). I had fluid drawn off my left knee on Feb. 5th. three weeks prior to this I had fluid taken off my right knee, but later found out that I should have waited at least 3 months before fluids should have been taken off of my other knee. I have been having chronic pain every since Feb. 5th this year. I gone to see several different specialist to try and figure out what is going on. The pain started in my left knee and moved downwards, my left foot is numb only under the bottom, I was told by a neurogist and was told by this dr. that he could not do anything for me, so now I am been sent to a surgeon to see if that can figure out what is going on. I know I drifted off of my question, but I have gained about 30 pounds since this incident on Feb 5th. I believe that the medicines that I been taking has a lot to do with this. I still have serve pain under my left foot all day long, I also have serve swelling of the left leg from the knee down. I am also taking Tramadol 50mg tablets (two at bed time) and Ibuprofen 800mg Tablets ( three or four a day). I have been walking with crutches since Feb. 5th. Ihave no useage of my left ankle and left side is getting weaker.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Medication like Nortriptyline, Tramadol, Ibuprofen are medications which function is merely to alleviate symptoms, soothe the pain. They do not have any effect on nerve damage, if there is a nerve compression or some other cause damaging the nerve these drugs do not do much about it. So if the nerve is suffering it is predictable that the weakness might worsen.You are not very clear about the cause, about why you were sent to a surgeon, what procedure was suggested, so hard to express an opinion about that.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. No masturbation daily will not result in \\"nerve\\" exhaustion.  I'm not quite certain what you're referring to as \\"nervous exhaustion\\", however, I'm assuming it has something to do with generalized anxiety and nervousness. Depending on the cause of your symptoms there are very effective treatments or better yet. Addressing the underlying causes, not just take something to cover the symptoms. However, I repeat, MASTURBATION should have nothing to do with your symptoms. With your son's diagnosis of oligodendrolioma already being known in the left occipital lobe. What I can tell you is that I can virtually guarantee that your son's left hand symptom is NOT from that tumor. However, if your son were in my care I would immediately obtain an MRI with gadolinium contrast looking for something (possibly related to this oligo as a 2nd lesion) in the left fronto-parietal region.

I plan to call my internist tomorrow but I m in Florida and she s in Idaho so I thought I d get some ideas of what s going on.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The most common cause of head tremor in an otherwise, healthy individual with probable arthritic degenerative disease in the shoulders and neck would be something called BENIGN ESSENTIAL TREMOR.  Though hand tremors generally manifest prior to the noticing of head tremors or even bobbing when it becomes more noticeable...this does not have to always be the case.  There are ways of detecting very subtle tremor of the hands though no one else seems to be aware of its presence.  It is a very common condition and can be easily treated OR IN THIS CASE...I'd probably recommend IGNORING IT in trade for some watchful waiting until it becomes NECESSARY to treat since you don't seem to be having any disabling features occurring.  P.S.  I would not let anyone make a convincing argument to you that this is the beginning of PARKINSON'S DISEASE since that is the most common misdiagnosis I get from both patients and physicians alike when sending folks with mild head movements....UNLESS- UNLESS, that person is willing to pay next month's mortgage to you on your Florida condo.  If not, then, don't buy their opinion.  Your description of the problem puts PD so far down the list of possibilities that I would have to say it more likely for Oranges to go out of style in Florida before you ever get diagnosed by a reputable neurologist with PD given a presenting symptom of subtle head tremor before everything else.

While there are not studies directly looking at relationship between hookah smoking and seizures, heavy prolonged hookah smoking can be associated with increased carbon monoxide levels which in turn can cause neurological manifestations including seizures.

She indicated that i have a concussion, whip lash and possible pinched nerve or herniated disk. The ER doc gave me cyclobenzaprine.....it seems to me all these together may not be a good idea","Doctor":"I concur with your concerns on combining these drugs.....you will be sleeping for as long as it takes for either Prince Charming or Princess Charmaine to come and awaken you out of your Rhoncorous slumber if you've never had these drugs before.  We generally treat concussions very conservatively with ES Tylenol and not even Motrin since the latter can irritate the stomach and if there are any baseline symptoms of nausea/vomiting from the accident/concussion then, the Motrin will just make that worse.  Tramadol as a pain medication has both addictive properties and can lower seizure threshold and it's not even that great an analgesic.  It can also worsen nausea/vomiting following a concussion so I wouldn't advise for that reason as well.  A whiplash injury will respond well to thermal interventions and some ES Tylenol...nothing is really going to stop the stiffness from occurring.  I've not found cyclobenzaprine or any common anti-spasmodic to be overly helpful compared to crushed ice 3x/day for 20-30 minutes at a time and gentle ROM movements in the first 24-48 hrs. changing to heat afterward along with AQUATHERAPY for improving cervical ROM...little by little.

What are the possible meanings for an MRI finding to show that the brain is positioned low.

Any thoughts??","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Of course it would be useful to have the report, but my guess would be that it refers to a malformation in the brain called the Chiari malformation, in which the brain stem or cerebellum are placed lower than normally, in the foramen magnum which is the canal connecting the skull to the spine. It is a very common malformation. In many cases it causes no symptoms and one can lead a normal life. In some cases though when the displacement is too severe there can be headaches or neurological deficits from brain stem compression. As I said without the report one can't say how many millimeters the displacement is. If it's not marked and the neurologist doesn't find any neurological deficit than it is a coincidental finding and nothing needs to be done about it. Hope I have answered your query.

The reason for your pain are the herniated discs.While cervical disc cause pain in upper limb extremities lumbar discs are responsible for lower limb extremities pain.

Although there are side effects of long term steroids such as osteoporosis,easy bruising ,decreased immunity but you need not to worry much as these are being given to your mother as replacement and in low doses.In Sheehan's syndrome as u must be knowing there is necrosis of pituitary leading to the deficiency of hormones secreted by pituitary.Therefore replacement of thyroid and corticosteroids are mandatory.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You may be suffering from something referred to as Vertiginous Migraine which is a form of headache that is a migraine but with symptoms associated of vertigo. The interesting thing about this disorder is that the vertigo and headache are not necessarily present at the same time and can be separated by as much as 24 or even 48 hours, depending upon the frequency of the headaches. In other words, a person could have a severe headache with migraine symptoms, resolve the episode and then, 1 to 2 days later have significant vertigo without the headache component. Or the headache could be present again. The trick is to recognize it more as a form of headache rather than a form of vertigo and to treat the symptoms accordingly. You may wish to consult a headache specialist for this as a possibility or at least a Neurologist. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. It sounds like you've suffered a significant injury with the tip still present which probably cannot be surgically removed.  4 months is not a long time to remain disabled after an injury like this and so as long as you are undergoing active rehabilitation and trying to retrain the muscles I see no reason why SOME IMPROVEMENT cannot be expected.  In fact, there are biomechanical devices available that could potentially assist with your walking so that you are not limping as much.  BOTOX injections could also be a possible alternative to assist with chronic pain of spasmed back or leg muscles though one must remember that BOTOX also weakens muscle to some extent so one needs to be careful as to how much is applied and how often it is reapplied.

Good evening. i am Dr Shareef answering your query. With your history, it seems that you are suffering from colitis which gives rise to such symptoms. Depending on the area you stay, amebiasis should be kept in mind and a course of metronidazole after a routine stool test would relieve you of your problem. Add to it a proton pump inhibitor drug and a probiotic. Consider modifying your dietary habit toward more of roughage, and enough liquids.

If so, is this something that I should be concerned about, or is it something that will go away with time?","Doctor":"Numbness in the big toe is not generally related to the L1 area.It is related more often to the L5 area.However, in rare cases, the L1 compression fracture could be worsening and hitting the end of the spinal cord (conus) which could theoretically cause numbness in the toe.Regardless, I would ask your doctor for a MRI of the lumbar spine."},{"Patient":"I am 62 yr old post menopausal woman who is experiencing occasional sharp pain in the lower right abdomen without rebound tenderness, or fever or vomiting or diarrhea.

Yesterday they informed us that he's been vomiting but there's no need for concern.  Should we be concerned?  The family knows someone that had a similar situation and was told he started vomiting and then a few days later, she lost him?","Doctor":"Vomiting can be a symptom of raised intracranial pressure, and so in someone who has had a stroke, we will worry about the possibility that this is a sign of increasing pressure in the brain.Often times we will order brain imaging just to make sure.However, if it is clearly related to another issue (feeding tube, slow stomach emptying, etc) then a scan may not be necessary."},{"Patient":"I have had this (sudden) tingling feeling on my left side for about 3 hours (and counting).

Primary pathology (haemorrhage or direct brain injury) as they can irritate the brain and cause seizure activity.2. Is scarring in the brain which happens during recovery of your injured brain. So, it is always advisable to take antiepileptic medications after these surgeries.Now the second part of your query is when you can stop the medications.

She also has fibromyalgia & all of her trigger points in her neck & back are flared up right now.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Fuchs dystrophy is an eye disease in which the innermost layer of cells in the cornea undergoes degenerative changes. This cell layer, called the endothelium, is responsible for maintaining proper amount of fluid in the cornea.The endothelium keeps the cornea clear for good vision by pumping out excess fluid that could cause corneal swelling. Fuchs dystrophy symptoms include:- Glare and sensitivity to light- Eye pain- Foggy or blurred vision- Seeing colored halos around lights- Difficulty seeing at night- Poor vision upon awakening that may improve later in the day- A feeling that something is in your eye (foreign body sensation)(source-  I do not think that she has the suspected condition.However, I think she may be facing fibromyalgia, a nerve condition associated with severe myalgia and pains and headaches. And all the tests are considerably normal in this condition. So, I think you are dealing with fibromyalgia. This may be a flare-up of the existing fibromyalgia that you have already said she has.

Is my new back problem related to the PD or is it likely to be spinal stenosis problem again","Doctor":"Hello, Both of the conditions lumbar spinal stenosis and Parkinson's disease (PD) may cause a pinched nerve in the lower back and cause pain. Spinal stenosis may lead to curvature or bending of the spine by degenerative processes (e.g. degenerative scoliosis) and result in pressure on nerve roots. On the other hand Parkinson's disease patients also commonly have bending of the spine which result in pinched nerve with radical pain (sharp and travels along the nerve route). Furthermore, pain syndrome is experienced two times more in PD patients compared to the general population. MRI may be helpful to diagnose and distinguish pinched nerve from these conditions. Regardless of the cause, you should always try an exercise program before starting medications.

Otherwise, the sinuses have nothing to do with brain tissue or anatomy.The two entities are entirely separate.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With this kind of history, most likely you have got an intestinal infection possibly due to accidentally eating stale food from outside. If I were your doctor, after a general physical examination  I would advise you for a routine stool test for ova and cyst and give you an anti emetic and an anti spasmodic depending on the severity of the pain you have. Depending on the result of the investigations, I would consider prescribing for you a broad spectrum antibiotic effective against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms including flagellets. I would also add a probiotic and a proton pump inhibitor to it. Also avoid eating from outside.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

The CT head/brain without contrast reads...Moderate white matter hypodensities are seen in the deep, periventricular and subcortical white matter with volume loss and old lacunar type infarcts in the basal ganglia. There is mild global volume loss. Chronic microangiopathic changes in the old lacunar type infarcts and mild global volume loss.","Doctor":"Hello,In relation to the fall that she took the CT scan doesn't show any damage due to the hit, none of those findings are related to the trauma, they were already present before she fell and hit her head. The findings are due to chronic changes in the brain matter and its blood vessels. Chronic microangiopathic changes are changes to the small blood vessels. To a point, they are genetically determined and are found in many people as they age. They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and addressing them when present.As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain. Again that is part of aging, all of us start to lose brain cells after our thirties, so as we age volume loss accumulates. So that finding depends a little on her age which you do not mention, the older she is the more such volume loss is expected.

After that period the damage due to the obstruction of the blood flow is established, there is no treatment to reverse that.At this stage, management consists of preventing other strokes from happening and in preventing complications (such as infections, deep vein thrombosis, hemorrhagic transformation etcetera).

Did you lose the weight voluntarily? If not, there might be an infective cause that may have caused the loss of weight and also the backache. An example would be tuberculosis.2.

So, I think the symptoms are related to ongoing problem, not LP.As for the cause of the symptoms, it would be inappropriate to comment on the diagnosis without clinical details and other investigations. One of the reasons why LP is done is infection and severe infection- called meningoencephalitis- can cause the symptoms.As for the excess fluid drained, it was probably hydrocephalus (which itself can happen due to brain infection), in which condition also, there is a possibility of the symptoms mentioned.As for the treatment, I need to know the ongoing treatment and LP report to be able to comment. However, there is a possibility that treatment was not changed after LP because the patient is already on antibiotics.

Brain imaging, EEG and some blood tests are needed in all patients with epilepsy in order to characterize seizures and determine best treatment.Furthermore you mention the drugs you have taken but not the dosage (how many tablets per day). It might be that the drug was appropriate but the dosage too low.

Often this occurs in the setting of an upper airway infection involving the nose, throat and ear so the fact there are hearing symptoms is compatible with it. So I would see your primary physician or an ENT specialist to confirm the diagnosis through direct exam and imaging, if confirmed treatment with decongestants and antibiotics may be needed.I hope you get better soon."},{"Patient":"Hello, I m 60 yrs old, Italian live in NC. right index finger does not feel right. using cell phone is getting difficult.

Such peripheral weakness may be due to different causes like trauma or compression of the peripheral nerves, compression of peripheral nerves in the nec or even neuromuscular conditions like ALS.

EEG showed slow brain activity and was same as last one done in 2012. Very confused. Took her off HCT ans to let pressure increase. What happens when this seizure comes on is her body goes stiff and her head jolts back with some shake and goes unresponsive. Latest episode she didn t come to for at least 20 minutes. She just stayed sleepy and groggy. In hospital for 3 days. She has been having a lot of jerking as well and has increased over past few months with heavy tiredness. Overall she is healthy and vibrant other than Alzheimer s issue. Only meds taking are levothyroxine and simvastatin. Aspirin and vitamin as well as potassium. HCT out since 1/9/15.","Doctor":"Hello,Judging from that description those episodes do indeed seem to be seizures. EEG may not necessarily show epileptiform activity between seizures. It is important that a CT has been done to exclude causes like stroke or tumors. So, at this point there is not a clear cause for seizures, but that is not uncommon especially in the elderly.The low blood pressure may be a possible cause, but not at those values. If doctor thinks that to be the cause a prolonged monitoring through a portable device called Holter should be done to check if there are episodes of very low blood pressure and if confirmed the cause should be searched.If no lower values are found though then treatment to prevent seizures should be started, at that age lamotrigine or levetiracetem are the most common medications.Hope I have answered your query.

I didn t get them very often, but when I did, my right side would tingle and then go numb. Like, the whole side from the shoulder to my feet. After 2, I had a urine test, which came back normal. I had only 2 up until 1 month and a half ago. I was getting migraines everyday, always numb, and would frequently vomit. 3 weeks ago, my mom took me to the doctor who immediately got me to get a blood test, which almost made me pass out. I was recommended to a neurologist who said my symptoms were typical for a migraine patient, but that my numbness was abnormal. She got me an MRI/MRA. The radiologist sent a man to the waiting room with a phone, and gave it to my mom. There was a nurse on the other end who told her they were starting an IV on me. She took more pictures, and then sent me out. My mom sent me away, and later told me that they found something on my brain, but by policy, she couldn t say what it was. She took the second set of pictures because she and someone she consulted wanted to be sure they saw something. That was Friday, and tomorrow (Monday) the neurologist will call and we will make a plan. What could it be? I get nauseous as well.. And I don t know if this is related, but lately, I cannot breath right. Like, I ll be breathing fine, but out of nowhere will feel like I m not getting enough Oxygen. It s become more frequent that I feel like I don t have enough air. I m athletic, and eat healthy (for the most part). Should I be worried about what it could be? Oh, and she put me on anti-depressants (a fraction of the actual dose) because it should help my headaches go away and help me sleep. It does help me feel a bit refreshed when I wake up.

So yes, changes are there and you need not worry- they are basically signs of what has been happening.As for the medicine, if you have too many headaches, neurologists start a medicine that reduces the frequency of headaches. In your case that is also needed because everytime you develop the sensory features or other neurological symptoms, the MRI gets affected.This in log term can affect you wrong.So the attempts are to reduce the frequency of headaches.And sometimes, if taken sincerely, it can work wonders.I hope this informs you about everything you need to know.Once you know what exactly is happening, I am sure you will be able to understand what is going on.That should help you relax.And it should help you manage your migraines more easily.I have tried my best to make it simple for you to understand.Do understand that there is a lot more to the subject than just this.In case you ant to know more about it or if you want to clear any doubts about what I have mentioned, feel free to ask a follow up query.Best wishes, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"my left leg suddenly goes kinda knumb after I stand on it for about 20 minutes especially if I am holding my baby , when I go shopping if I am moving its ok my toes are sometimes have like needles and pins also but not that often I am 5ft 10 ad weigh 196 lbs","Doctor":"Hello!My name is Dr. Aida and I am glad to attend you on Healthcaremagic!Your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve or a bulging lumbar intervertebral disk, leading to sciatic nerve compression.

When you have a pain in abdomen, you should have consulted the operating team and the team which gives you the medicines for not allowing rejection to find out that these medicines are not causing this problem.Check for your Blood counts, particularly urea and creatinine.

My symptoms improved until one year ago when I began having slight dizziness every time I move my head or lay down. The only remarkable thing found on my MRI w/ & w/o contrast was the following:Ventricles - The fourth ventricle has increased in size since the previous examination (1.5 years apart). This is likely related to volume loss and ex vacuo enlargement. Clinical correlation is recommended.Should I see a neurologist about this? My neurosurgeon said nothing was wrong with my shunt and didn t understand why/or cared about my daily dizziness. What do you think is causing this?","Doctor":"Hello!My name is Dr. Aida and I am glad to attend you on Healthcaremagic!The fact that there is increased size of ventricles, could be a sing of shunt dysfunction. That is why, it is necessary to compare your previous CT scan finding with the last one. The dizziness could also be related to other causes : an inner ear disorder, chronic degeneration of the cervical spine, etc.. For this reason, it is necessary consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam and discuss on the above issues. Best wishes!"},{"Patient":"My son was receiving timador for gbm grade 4.

Anxiety or a peripheral nerve disorder can mimic this clinical situation (besides the tingling in the tongue). A metabolic disorder can not be excluded either. For this reason, I recommend consulting with your GP and performing some tests: - a nerve conduction study for possible neuropathy- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes- complete blood count- vitamin D and vitamin B12 plasma levels for possible deficiency.

They lasted a little over 4 minutes and he turned purple the first time and the second time his lips turned blue and he urinated. When someone urinates is this a sign that there body is shutting down? This is still so new to us and we are question ourselves. We were on the verge of calling 911 and he started coming out of it. Should we have called being that he urinated?","Doctor":"Hello!My name is Dr. Aida and I am glad to attend you on Healthcaremagic!You should know that uncontrolled urination is a common feature of epilepsy seizures. It is not a sign that his body is shutting down. But it is related to the release of the urethral sphincter during the seizure, as the patient is not conscientious. If the seizures persist, despite the anti-epileptic therapy, I recommend discussing with his doctor on the possibility of making some changes to his therapy, in order to have a better control of seizures.

I ve been having these episodes since 2011 (when I was 20). There s always some degree of familiarity to the dreams. Kinda like deja vu.

For this reason, I recommend taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen, which will help also for the pain in other parts of the body. All you need is some rest and a balanced diet.

If it persists in spite of treatment, I would refer you to a gastro-enterologist who might go for a colonoscopy for you to arrive at a possible diagnosis for further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

It went away late that morning but then in the middle of the night, Monday, she woke up with the tremors again (she woke up to get water and noticed the tremor was back). It has been constant since that time. We were first told TMJ. All of the blood tests that have been run by a family doctor and neurologist have been normal except her Vitamin D was low (20). She s periodically nauseas throughout the day, doesn t eat much and takes small cat naps, which she hasn t done for years, even when she s been up late with friends. The tremor of her jaw is constant unless she clamps her teeth together and it is less if she opens her mouth really wide.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!I read carefully your question and understand your concern.

I have listed down a few clinically proven beneficial therapies for the same.1. Botulinum toxin — Injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTX A) into affected muscles decreases tone by limiting muscle contraction. It is injected into several areas of the muscle. Injections must be repeated every three to eight months to maintain the effect2. Oral antispastic drugs — Benzodiazepines (diazepam), dantrolene, and baclofen have been used by some clinicians to treat spasticity in CP but are generally less useful than BTX. . 3. Intrathecal Baclofen - It involves giving the drug directly in the spine (CSF) to achieve higher drug levels and better response.4. Selective dorsal rhizotomy and deep brain stimulation are some of the surgical therapies that have been tried with limited success. Remember, I have given you an overview of the available treatment options. Final decision can be taken by your neurologist after assessing the functional limitations and extent of disease. The pain will also subside once his muscles relax and stiffness is decreased."},{"Patient":"Yes I have been experiencing severe calf and off and on knee pain, whether walking or running.

Yes - ovarian cyst if you have a history of one might be the cause.

Further management would depend on the results of clinical examination and investigation reports.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I would not recommend taking this drug for a long time, because it can cause several problems in your body : osteoporosis, skin changes, weight gain, etc.. Its interruption after a long time can lead to adrenal gland insufficiency. For this reason, I would recommend taking it for a short time and consulting with your doctor.

If this is acquired and even if it's from a stroke or other known cause I would first get a NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL evaluation in order to comprehensively understand the nature of the verbal, written, and memory problems you are experiecing.  This testing will help clearly localize the problem within the brain itself.

The treatment therefore, of LEVETIRACETAM (Brand name KEPPRA in the US) is used for seizure control which can occur with these types of lesions due to their bleeding.

I have lost 25 lbs. It all started one day when I was walking around having a good time at a casino (no alcohol). I had a terrible cramping feeling on my right side under my rib that went all the way through my back. I broke out into a sweat. This lasted about 30 minutes. I was weak and just felt like laying down. I had eggs and sausage and pancakes for breakfast that morning. I went to the restroom, and urinated an odd orangish color. I let it go until about a week later I noticed that i was passing undigested food through my bowels and having nausea. I felt terrible like I was going to die. I then went to the E.R. 3 times in 4 days. No answers. Now my pain is pretty much constant under the right rib. If I take a pain killer like hydrocodone it actually makes the area cramp more. So.....at one of my E.R. visits they checked my urine, and it showed high bilirubin level. A blood test did not show high bilirubin. I have belching (not normal for me), diarrhea, tongue coating is usually white or yellow, passing undigested foods, especially items like beans, yellow stool color, nausea, and bloating. I also have tenderness to the touch under the right rib area. Tests I have had.....CT no dye, upper abdominal ultrasound, Hida Scan with CCK, blood tests, urine tests. The only thing that ever showed anything it shouldn t was the urine have bilirubin. The rest of the tests are showing normal. The gallbladder hida scan showed ejection fraction of 59%.

This followed after 1 week with undigested food in the stools and nausea, 3 ER visits, Hydrocodone increases pain, Urine shows raised bilirubin, coated tongue, all other tests are normal,.All the history together shows that there may be a problem of hepatitis or cholangitis or Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sometimes you need to undergo repeat tests as sometimes the tests may not show the problem. I would advise the following:Get the full liver profile including GGT, this may give a clue. Therapeutic trial with an antibiotic and metronidazole may help to get well. Avoid food rich in fat and oil. Get an opinion of hepatobiliary Specialist."},{"Patient":"greetings!

Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods.2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration.3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5.

If that is certain then, treatment can begin.  If it's not totally convincing to you or the doctor that the MRI correlates with the symptoms or location of pain then, an EMG study should be performed.

If however, there is associated WEAKNESS in the foot or leg because of this compression and/or if she is experiencing falls from sudden loss of muscle tone in the leg, ankle, etc. then, surgery should be contemplated.....but see if you can't find someone who is good at MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES....or what is also referred to as KEYHOLE surgery for the lumbar spine."},{"Patient":"When my mother passed away, she had been diagnosed with \\"water on the brain\\".

A CT scan is sometimes able to pick this condition up but not always and even if it does rarely does it ever lead to surgery and rarely SHOULD it lead to surgery.

Also, can you secure any of the consultation reports from any of the neurosurgeons you've seen thus far?  There is no way you can obligate any doctor to offer a specific type of treatment...even if it seems justified and reasonable to the patient or another doctor.  It is the responsibility and liability of the doctor undertaking the procedure therefore, it has to be their decision.  Arachnoid cysts are typically felt to be benign and present since childbirth.  For that reason most neurologists and neurosurgeons are very hands off doing anything when they are found in the brain or spinal cord.  However, in this situation, if there are significant numbers of lesions, and if they are causing visible or measurable mass effect in the brain and can be shown to be actually compressing or squeezing important brain structures or obstructing the flow of CSF then, a very compelling circumstance can be argued to exist which would invoke surgical intervention.

You could also be suffering from a mild urinary tract infection which may seem almost absurd for the symptoms but one thing I've learned long ago as a doctor....and that is....there is always a reason why the MEDICAL TV programs always talk about getting urine tests on everyone......and that's because you'd be absolutely floored by the variety of conditions, symptoms, and sensations people can very quickly get rid of once they treat a mild urinary tract infection that they never suspected they had if not for their doctor just following the same recipe guide as the guys Grays Anatomy do!

Three days ago I had a bout of what I believe was food poisoning, as five others who attended the same event as me got severe nausea two days later. I recovered almost completely within 24 hours but ever since I have had a weird intracranial pressure-type sensation that turns painful when I move my head up from a lower point (stand upright after bending down, stand up from a seated position etc.) I have been drinking LOTS water and electrolyte drinks and don't feel dehydrated. Is this a normal symptom or should I go to a doctor? I worry a bit as I did have a brain abscess from an infection many years ago and while I know I am no more likely to get a reoccurrence  than anyone else, the similar pressure sensation makes me nervous! However I don't want to rush off to the doctor if it is a common part of recovery from food poisoning.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!Your symptoms could be related to orthostatic hypotension, which is a common complication of dehydration during food poisoning. For this reason, I recommend monitoring your blood pressure in sitting and standing up position. In case your blood pressure values drop more than 20mm Hg during standing up position, compared to sitting position, it would indicate possible orthostatic hypotension. In such case, I would recommend taking plenty of fluids and have some rest. Increasing salt intake would also help. If these symptoms persist and your blood pressure doesn't drop during standing up position, I would recommend consulting with your neurologist and performing a brain MRI to check for intracranial hypotension.

His right pupil was smaller than the left and his right eye started to swell. When I finally got him to go to Ergent Care on Friday his neck was very painful and is was hurting in his muscles when he swallowed, his eyes were still the same. The doctor said he had strep throat. He gave him a zpak and sent him home. That next morning he started throwing up and he just kept getting worse. He went back to Ergent Care on Sunday morning because he couldn t stop throwing up and his ear was killing him. This is a young man that has had 3 back surgeries he can deal with pain. They gave him a different antibiotic and said he had an ear infection. They also gave him a shoot of antibiotic some medication for vomiing and pain medication. He started feeling better last night and early this morning, but tonight he is feeling awful again and he says his head is hurting now but his ear feels better. What should we do?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!I read carefully your question and would recommend bringing him to the ER for a brain CT scan, in order to exclude possible stroke. The fact that his right pupil is smaller than the left and he has neck pain, could indicate an arterial dissection. From the other hand, an inner ear infection, may lead to a sinus thrombosis, which is associated to headache and vomiting. For this reason, the main thing to do is going to the ER for a brain CT scan or MRI.

Is 20 mg too high a dose?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on Healthcaremagic!You should know that if epilepsy was rulet out, this means that she has non-epileptic seizures.These types of seizures are related to depression and anxiety. Prozac is an antidepressant which helps prevent these types of seizures and also improve the way she feels.
