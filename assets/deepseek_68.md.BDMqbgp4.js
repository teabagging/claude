Recently Im experiencing big problems with concentration and with my memory. Also my ability to communicate cleary is getting worse. I did an IQ test few years ago where the result was 130 and today my result is 80...I feel like my head is empty... Im young (31). Can this be a brain tumour?","Doctor":"Hello Gabriela!Your symptoms could be related to depression. Anyway, I would recommend consulting with your family doctor for a physical check up and some tests: - complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for possible dysfunction- vitamin B12 plasma levels- blood electrolytes. Do you feel anxious or depressed? Consulting with a neurologist for some cognitive tests may be needed. A brain MRI would help exclude possible degenerative changes in the brain compatible with dementia. Further tests may be needed. If all the above tests result normal, especially if you have other symptom of depression or anxiety, you should consult with a psychiatrist, because these psychiatric disorders can mimic your symptoms. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I am a 56 year old exceptionally fit male. I hit my head hard to unconciousness on the ice yesterday. the CT scan showed a closed concussion. I am having cognitive issues, mainly getting my speech out as usual and stuttering, I do not have control of this. I am gernerally well read but can not read aloud properly as usual. My verbal communication skills are affected seriously in my opinon. Do you recommend further testing or will this go away over time?","Doctor":"I absolutely recommend further testing, with a definitive consultation with a Neurologist to do the specialized testing and recommended treatment. I also recommend immediate treatment with occupational, physical and speech therapist as to maintain if not improve the deficits you describe early. Your Primary Care Physician and or Neurologist will be able to refer you to these forms of therapy, and such may indeed be covered by insurance or your carrier based on what you described to me; but I would look into it nonetheless. In summary, the symptoms you are experiencing can be temporary and you can indeed 'possibly' return to normalcy with no intervention; depending on the particulars of the situation, which sitting here responding to your case I cannot access at the moment. Nevertheless, I personally would not risk patiently waiting, and would want to get such symptoms checked out and dealt with early as to not ensure permanent issues. Therefore my recommendation is to stay healthy, keep practicing your speech, and challenge your cognition with mental tests as self therapy (the more you challenge your brain the quicker it heals), and at earliest convenience schedule an appointment with a Neurologist. :)   I hope my recommendation has helped."},{"Patient":"I have 3 three things going on at any given time. My left eye jumps and at times I get this type of sensation on the right side top of my head along with a numbness on the left or right side. My regular physcian said that I may need to see a neurologist...I just don't want to be running down this path aimlessly!","Doctor":"I agree with the suggestion that you see a neurologist, absolutely. I would suggest you ask him/her about conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis and or Neuropathy; use those words and ask your physician to rule these potential conditions out. I will not definitively say you have either of these conditions, nonetheless, when it comes to our brains, and vision, and nervous system, it never hurts to be extra careful!"},{"Patient":"Hi, My left hand is getting numb only during night time and few months back my wrist was hurting.I am lefty. Also little overweight.But do regular exercise pretty much 5 days a week.Also, sometimes I feel my heart palpatation is high. Please let me know what can I do.","Doctor":"Good day! The most common answer to the symptoms you are experiencing is Carpal Tunnel. It is compression of a main nerve in your hand that comes from repeated movement and compression of the wrist. The symptoms can occur often at night due to accumulated tension throughout the day. As for the palpation's, how high is your heart-rate? Common causes can be coffee, dehydration and or stress. If you experience any other symptoms certainly see a physician for a Cardiac Check-up. As for the wrist, try taking breaks from repetitive tasks involving your hands. There are wrist splints that can be bought over the counter, they are very useful. Stretching exercises may also help: make a fist and then spread your fingers out. I hope this advise can be helpful, and leads you in the correct direction. You have my warm regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 37-year-old female having very bad pain in my lower left abdomen started last night progressively getting worse it hurts when I stand straight up can't really walk with out pain it hurts more if I go from lining down to sitting up I have a shooting pain through my rectum","Doctor":"urinary tract infection appendicitis reproductive system infection like cervicitis uterine infections can cause thisneed to have ultrasound to find the cause in my opinion and treat accordingly"},{"Patient":"I am a 65 year old male. 5 7 185lbs.

What is happening?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, your symptoms seem to be related to nerve compression. A bulging disk (diskal herniation) in the cervical spine may be responsible for this symptomatology. I recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical check up and some tests: - a cervical spine CT scan- a nerve conduction study (electroneurography). Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"I have lei protein a. My count was 80 when the blood test was done . I had a Small TIA two weeks prior. Had many tests, and Doc put me on a statin drug, niacin,a blood thinner and aspirin. Determining I had arteriorsclorosis. Many of the statins do not agree with me and now trying Livalo which des not agree with me (muscle weakness and cramps). Question: I have been having bad pain in left side of neck where apparently as lordosis is located, Doc out of town no one else to ask if important, Thank you","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I carefully read your question and would explain that the neck pain seems to be related to the chronic degenerations on your cervical spine. A bulging disk can not be excluded. So, I would recommend holding a cervical collar until consulting with your doctor. It will help relieve the pain. A cervical spine CT scan may be needed. I would recommend taking acetaminophen for the pain. It has no interactions with your current therapy. Regarding statins, I would recommend checking your liver and muscular enzymes periodically. Stopping for a short time (a month) and restarting in low doses and increasing slowly may help avoid these adverse effects related to statins. Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aid"},{"Patient":"I have been prescribed Paxil 40 mg at us. In addition I was placed on Cymbalta in an attempt to try to control pain from a spinal cord injury & tumor that is invading the Cord. I had to stop the Cymbalta due to the cost and was placed on Effexor ER 75 mg. if I take it in the morning as I did the Cymbalta, I am sluggish with no motivation. If I take it at night I m concerned about interaction with the Paxil. The Dr nor his FNP have been little help. I am unsure how to take the two safely. I am sorry, I was unaware there is a charge for this. I am unable to make payment due to 0 income. SSD pending. Thank you for your time","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I would explain that it is not recommended to take both Paxil and Cymbalta or Paxil and Effexor. You should know that Paxil and Cymbalta are part of the same pharmacological class (SSRI). When combined together they increase the risk for possible serotoninergic syndrome, which is a serious medical condition. From the other hand Effexor is a different pharmacological class, but can increase serotonin levels and when combined with Paxil, it can lead to increased risk for serotoninergic syndrome. From the other hand both Effexor and Paxil prolong QTs interval, leading to increased risk for cardiac arrhythmia. So, to conclude, I would not recommend taking concomitantly Effexor and Paxil. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. You can switch to an antiepilepsy drug instead like gabapentine or pregabaline to help you manage the chronic pain.

From the other hand Oxetol can improve these mood changes. So, I would recommend follow your doctor advise to gradually switch from Keppra to Oxetol. Regarding his normal EEG and MRI, I would recommend performing a 24 hours EEG (prolonged EEG) in order to be able to register any possible epileptic activity. Sleep deprivation can help in this regard. You should discuss with his doctor on the above issues.

I'm sorry you are experiencing such symptoms. I will be honest, and say that based upon my medical experience I suggest you seek medical consultation immediately. Are there any other symptoms other than the pain? When you do go to the bathroom, are there any red or black tinges and or evidence of bleeding? Do you have fever's, chills? Is there any vomiting? If none of these symptoms are present, you can potentially be confident that your pain it is something less dangerous or emergent, as it makes the more serious diagnoses less likely. Nonetheless, sharp pain around the umbilicus for me as a physician is always concerning sign, with possibilities being numerous (Appendicitis, Diverticulitis, Bowel Ischemia etc). Have you been in contact with a Gastroenterologist (G.I Doctor) since losing bowel function? If not I suggest you call the physicians involved in your tumor removal and speak to them of such symptoms, and furthermore do to ongoing incontinence, ask for further referral to a GI physician. In the meantime, I highly suggest you seek medical attention as early as possible as to ensure this is nothing serious.I'm sorry for your symptoms and difficult course of treatment.

This must be a very hard experience to have and go through. Unfortunately brain damage is very difficult if not often times impossible to reverse. Nonetheless there are options to seek improvement. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and comprehensive brain injury rehabilitation services can be utilized to help increase the activity and function of your sister's brain; and as a result, this therapy may recruit more areas of the brain which are active to take over the portions of the brain which have been damaged beyond repair. In some cases with this therapy, some portions of the brain damaged, but still with adequate blood flow and or some semblance of remaining function can be brought back to higher if not near-normal to normal function. Nonetheless, there are no medications or surgeries which can reverse portions of the brain with definitive damage. If your sister experiences symptoms that result from this brain damage (pain, loss of function, spasms, seizures, neurological changes), there are of course medications and targeted therapies which can be used to help; but the damage itself, as stated above, is more difficult to treat, and I recommend seeking the above listed therapies. I wish you and your sister the warmest and happiest of holidays; and trust even with such difficulties, that there will be happiness and things that can give you comfort and enjoyment. Family, friends, conversation and of course therapy will all in my professional experience lead you in the right direction. I hope my experiences and advise matches well to your personal case; and will lead you in the correct direction.

The patient may present a deformation of the scalp with numerous longitudinal and transverse folds with social and aesthetic discomfort. A surgical resection of the cutaneous excess in a transverse and longitudinal plane is carried out. The treatment of this disease is surgical, by the excision of the skin folds and re-tensioning of the scalp.

As your neurologist said it may be due to psychiatric disorders.I came across with several depressed or anxious patients with these types of symptoms. Commonly any major stressful life events or stress in life , burnout can cause these symptoms.  Be relaxed , it's not a stigmatized illness, instead a minor illness related to mind.Try some relaxation techniques like yoga, deep breathing exercise. Consult a psychiatrist as early as possible.He will prescribe some antianxiety medications like clonazepam."},{"Patient":"We are weaning our son off Vimpat right now, I just decreased his dose from 2cc BID to 1 cc BID today. He is complaining of a really bad headache right now. I am wondering if this is a side effect of weaning him off the medication. The only time he ever had head aches was right before he had his seizure 3.5 months ago, and he has also been seizure free since then.","Doctor":"Hi, Weaning from Vimpat rarely cause some discontinuation symptoms like headache. If you want to tapper the dose ,do it very gradually. Abrupt reduction from 2ccBD to 1ccBD is not advisable. Tapper 0.5 cc every week until reaching the desired dose. One more thing i would like to stress is about your son's last seizure episode. If any of my patients consult me with similar situation, i will suggest them to continue the drug or change to another anti-seizure drug with less problems. As your son had last episode of seizure 3.5 months ago, it's not advisable to discontinue or give inadequate doses. For any person to stop the antiepilesy drugs, he should have seizure free period of at least 1-2 years. So i request you to consult your neurologist before weaning. If you feel discomfort in continuing Vampat, he will suggest alternate drugs. If the headache persists for long, better to take a CT brain. I hope this measure will be enough to take care of your son."},{"Patient":"hello good morning doctor,my self i am abhilash a student aged 23yrs, height 5.7inches, weight 62kg. i have been affected by seizure disorder from past 3 yrs and has pshychological problems and memory impariment. as per the doctor consult i have been advised to take tab encorate chrono 500mg (1-0-1) after breakfast and dinner every day.but due to this i have been facing many problems like weakness, memory loss depressions. please help me in overcoming these difficulties.","Doctor":"Hello, Encorate chrono is a very good drug for seizure control. Your memory loss and depressive symptoms may be due to one of the following1 Encorate chrono itself can cause memory disturbance in long run2.Seizure patients are more prone for depression than others due to the disease itself or drugsWe have 3 options in this situation1. If your last episode of seizure was more than 2 years, ask your neurologist to reduce the dose2. If you have seizure recently, ask your neurologist to change other drugs with less memory disturbance like Levitiracetum.3. If above options are not possible ,consult a psychiatrist . he will prescribe you some antidepressants which will improve both depression and memory disturbance too. Cognitive behavior therapy also will be much useful to overcome the problem."},{"Patient":"Hello my husband has glioblastoma grade 4 two year ago we went to the following procedures,surgery of the tumor in the frontal lobe, radiation and temodar for 2months, then 5days cycle monthly also on temodar , six months later he had a progression of the tumor , we stopped temodar and started on avastin every two weeks, he did well until two months ago he had a recurrent again, so we gave him one cycle of avastin and camptozar combination, his motor function is getting worse, what should I expect now?","Doctor":"HI, I can understand how much hardship you are facing this time due to cancer of your husband. I had a patient few months ago with similar kind of complaints. He is a young adult of 35years, had glioblastoma in frontal region. In spite of surgical resection and chemotherapy we could not make him alive for more than 6 months. What i mean from this scenario is ,glioblastoma is an aggressive cancer type with high rate of recurrence even after vigorous treatments. Even with good treatment options the life span is less than two years. Than God for giving more years of life to your husband. More the recurrence , less the duration of survival.Regarding the motor dysfunction, frontal lobe is the main motor area of brain. Any persisting disturbance in that area definitely cause worsening of functioning.I suggest you to give enough nutrition and physiotherapy for him. I am really sorry to say that the prognosis of this type of cancer is worse. Anyhow continue the chemotherapy for better results."},{"Patient":"Since last night I have a dull ache on the middle of my stomach I don't feel sick I'm going toilet normally but this gas been constant it can't be period as I have the implant in but every month gets worse and this is worse than its been help no painkillers help at all haven't eaten I'm hungry but can't eat cause of my stomach","Doctor":"Hi !

During the \\"window\\" from Diagnosis of brain aneurysm to the actual surgery, you need to take extreme care. High blood pressure, severe pain, even emotional stress can cause it to rupture. I suggest, you make an appointment with the neurosurgeon at the earliest. An unruptured brain aneursym without neurological deficits has excellent results as compared to an already ruptured one. Your diabetes is not a problem, that will be controlled anyways during and after the surgery. I reiterate, your aneurysm is of paramount importance. Make an appointment as soon as possible.

She sent us to see a Rhuemetologist, and because my daughter is 17 we had to go to a Pediatric doctor who dismissed the elevation as being because she was a teenage girl and sent us on our way. Here it is June 2014 and she has gone through multiple tests, did get another ANA result which was the same titer 1:80 but a different shape . My daughter has lost 18 pounds since this all started and can not seem to gain weight and just keeps loosing.

And I recommend you take her to a Rheumatologist when she turns 18. ANA titre is very sensitive. According to the history you have given it seems like Lupus. To confirm lupus, I recommend an Anti-Sm titre. The treatment is usually steroids during these acute attacks and will taper it off slowly.

Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5. Keep away stress, think positive.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Gastroenterologist for proper clinical examination.An Ultrasound scan of Abdomen will be helpful.There is no need to worry, you will be fine.Wishing a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a very bad back and trying to get my health better as it seems to have gone downhill the past several years.

Effexor and Bupropion are both antidepressants but they use different mechanism of actions. Both inhibit the reuptake of neurotrasmitters. Effexor(velafaxine) inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. The production of serotonin is not affected, but the reuptake inhibition increases the level of serotonin to be used by the receptors, so in easy words effexor increases serotonin action.

Indeed, there is not any relation between his symptoms and the bulging veins. Anyway, it is important performing a comprehensive differential diagnosis between different causes that may lead to this clinical scenario: - a metabolic disorder like thyroid dyfunction, adrenal gland dysfunction, vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, an electrolyte disorder- a chronic infection or inflammatory disorder- heart failure- a cervical disc disorder could lead to numbness in the limbs and gait problems, but would not explain the changes in vein visibility. So, I would recommend consulting with his attending physician and performing some tests to investigate for the possible causes: - a chest X ray study- a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone plasma levels, cortisol plasma levels, vitamin D and vitamin B12 plasma levels, fasting glucose)If all the above tests result normal, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical exam.

Regarding the treatment, I would recommend trying acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Some tips would help relieve or prevent the pain: -Use a specially-designed coccyx cushion – these can be bought online and from some shops; they help reduce the pressure on your tailbone while you're sitting down.-Avoid prolonged sitting whenever possible – try to stand up and walk around regularly; leaning forward while seated may also help.-Wear loose-fitting clothes – avoid clothing such as tight jeans or trousers that may put pressure on your tailbone.- Apply warm and cold packs to your tailbone – warm packs include hot water bottles and microwaveable heating pads; cold packs are available as freezable gel-filled pads from pharmacies, or you can use a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel.-Try laxatives (medicines to treat constipation) if the pain is worse when you open your bowels – many laxatives are available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.Physiotherapy may also be useful.

In my opinion, since your complaints are sensory and symmetrical,  you might have polyneuropathy. Polyneuropathy is a condition that affects peripheral nerves symmetrically,  It is charachterized by weakness an sensory complaints wich are more pronounced distally (the most distant part suffers first and more), and in the feet before the hands. Although you're not that clear from how long you're suffering, i can exclude the acute forms. The polyneuropathy in your case is probable subacute or chronic. The subacute forms are most frequently caused by diabetes, use fo alcohol, vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic gastrointestinal disease that affect vit B12 absorption, poisoning with heavy metals and other substances (like lead, arsenic, mercury, organophosphates, acrylamide, some drugs), some paraneoplastic states (lymphoma, carcinom), some infections like HIV, Lyme disease, some inflamatory disease (like vasculitis, rheumatoid artrits, Lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome etc) Chronic neuropathies can be aquired and accompany other conditions like uremia, praproteinemia, diabetes, amyloidosis, hypothyroidism)Another form of polyneuropathy is the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy CIDP. This last conditions evolve slowly for some months and it may involve arms predominantly. Chronic Chronic polyneuropathies can be hereditary. If you have relatives with motor or sensory abnormalities you should tell your doctor.You need to realize nerve conduction testing and electromyography to diagnose polyneuropathy.I hope i have been of help"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Neurofibromatosis is a disorder that refers to genetically inherited conditions. There are two types Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Type 2 The most common condition is NF1, which is a multisystemic genetic disorder. It is characterized by some brownish spots in the skin (which are knwon as cafe-au-lait spots because of their color), axillar freckling, skeletal abnormalities, and growth of, tumors wich are  called neurofibromas which are benign, or gliomas of the optiv nerve. The diagnosis is usually made clinically and the confirmation is made by a genetic examination (molecular testing). The patient usually have a first -degree relative affected. In many cases even if the child doesn't have visual loss an MRI is required to find out if optic gliomas, but routine examinations are focused in usually complications chech of blood pressure, growth and learning development evaluation, eye exam, skeletal changes,  There isn't any cure, for this conditions, but based on complicatios and eventualities some measure can be taken (like removal of neurofibromas, surgery and chemiotherapi for gliomas etc)Neurofibromatosis 2 is also genetic inherited, but it is characterized by the development of central nervous system differnt tumors (shchwanoma, meningioma, glioma) The diagnosi is made by genetic testing, MRI and eye and hearin exams. A neurological evaluation, Mria and eye&ear exams have to be annual controls.I would suggest for you to wait for the appointment and i'm sure that they will arrange the examinations and follow-up.I hope i have been of help."},{"Patient":"my father had a crainatomy to remove the abcess formed due to infection.

That is why, they have made lab tests for these biological materials in order to find out the possible infectious agent and the proper antibiotic therapy.Seizures are related to the inflammation of the brain covering layers and the brain cortex (the most outer layer of the brain), which can cause abnormal electric discharges through the brain cells, leading to seizures. The recovering period may be long, depending on the type of infection and the affected region of the brain. Antiepileptic drugs, coupled with antibiotics are needed for a long time.

Tegercef 200 twice daily is good for intestinal infections. You may need additional metronidazole, anti-spasmodics and supportive medicines.As it is taking so late for a recovery I would advise such patients to go for investigaions of blood related to typhoid and so on, urine and stool tests, Ultrasonography of abdomen to rule out something like appendicitis and other causes."},{"Patient":"i am expeirencing what seems to be anemia. my blood shows low hemoglobin. my entire chest, feet, and hands have been numb for about 2 weeks now. about once a week i have terrible episodes where i become confused, all my senses go numb, i have closed eye hallucinations and my vision goes a little off. i just go some sort of whacko. i cant seem to find and answers anywhere, and its important thati note that im a very very heavy electronic cigarrette user. is there any link to cigs and my symptoms? any other advice?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that anemia is not related to electronic cigarrete use.

So reversing them is unfortunately not possible. What is aimed is pain control and physical therapy to stop progression. Pain control is achieved through over the counter anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen as a first step. If that doesn't work then medication for chronic pain such as anticonvulsants (Gabapentin, Pregabalin) or antidepressants (Amitriptylin, Duloxetine) are used. Narcotics are used only as a very last resort.Local steroid injections or surgery may be done only when there is one particular site which is the source of the symptoms, like a bulging disc or bony spur compressing a nerve root or the cord.I hope to have been of help."},{"Patient":"I am scheduled for an MRI lumbar.

I have been having trouble with pain and swelling in my upper stomach area and my Gastro Dr. said it felt like the Mesh slipped and he could feel the hernia, then he sent me to another Specialist and that Dr. said I have Muscle Fascia Laxity and never explained it to me...I have been having a harder time digesting foods more lately.  What is Muscle Fascia Laxity in my upper stomach area?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Muscle fascia laxity is otherwise known as diverication of recti which is not infrequently seen in obese persons, post delivery ladies, and emaciated persons. This is not a hernia, but clinically feels like one. The pain in the upper abdomen could be due to the hernia, or due to many other causes like a gall stone disease, peptic ulcer disease, etc. If I were your doctor, I would have advised you for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out few intra abdominal conditions. Till then, you can go for a proton pump inhibitor drug, a liquid antacid. Avoid alcoholic beverages, and smoking. Further management would depend on the report of the ultrasound. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

Long history of migraines, back and neck pain. Physio, traction, neck crunching in past. 63 yrs female. Take half 25 mg Endep, Imigran and Panadol Osteo. Slow loss of fine motor skills in right hand affecting writing. Hand seizes after 3 letters. FM pain worsened by physical activity (when aching), stress, especially weather changes. Presently have neck pain worsened by tilting head back. Pain worsened by laying on neck in bed at night. At times find that Imigran (Sumatriptan) eases neck pain - does this indicate blood vessel entrapment as action of Imigran seems to ease pain in neck at times, when other medication doesn t do anything. Work in school, which requires twisting, turning etc. Cold winter at present in Adelaide, South Aust which exacerbates pain, although I find repeatedly that my best health and least pain occurs in Autumn every year. Get light-headed and dizzy at times. Fell off a low platform onto knees and fainted 2 years ago + excruciating calf pain at night - got up screaming and fainted. Ultrasound revealed clot, suggested Warfarin immediately. I didn t take, sought further advice, saw Vascular Surg, more bloods taken, then just aspirin at night. Took for a while, but not now - bad press recently. Do not have regular gp. See when need scripts. Medical clinic situation rather than family gp. FM mainly self-management. Was secretary of Arthritis Foundation support group initially and learnt a lot about FM but haven t kept up with latest for a while now. Just push on, but neck pain is very restrictive and has been constant for a month now, with just occasional relief - probably due to pills rather than abating of problem. Don t know whether to ignore and hope it gets better, or get some massage, or go down gp line and seek specialist assessment. Am not one who rushes to doctor as over time fm patients usually learn to not expect any answers for pain. Think I ve got to a point of head in the sand self treatment now. Seem to be conflicting attitudes to value of MRI as a friend had for neck probs. I keep looking at barometer hoping it s the reason for pain - perhaps foolish, but when people have conditions for which there is no magic answer or treatment or reasons one becomes complacent I guess. Just wondering whether I should be seeking some answers to this neck problem as it s starting to concern me re: pain and constrictions. Have irregular heart rhythms also which were considered by Cardio to have contributed to faints and dizziness. Still trying to work in a primary school setting but becoming difficult, although it does force activity and movement. Cope with back pain but this neck pain is a bit more concerning when any slight backwards tilt causes compression and more pain flare-up. Daughter aged 38 yrs also has had pain in arms and legs, with hand tingling and heavy aching for many years. No-one has ever really investigated this or given any reasons to her. She had dysgerminoma ovarian cancer with ovary removed at just 13 yrs. 12 mths later another laparotomy to remove other ovary. Turned out to be a haemorrhage of ovary, so it was left. Due to abdominal surgery, she got lypodaemia. Probably more related reason is surgery re: arm pain, but thought I d mention also. Basically, how much should one be concerned re: neck pain??

Here is why- 1. they come in night- seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. Of course they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. I assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is.I think you should both take it very seriously. There is a high possibility that there is a intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist.I think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request a MRI brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video EEG. If he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. I suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. It may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. Yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible.Ideally, I would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? Does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? You may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. There is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it.I have tried my best to help you.

What does it mean?","Doctor":"Hi,I am Dr Mittal.I have read your message. I think I can help you.However, you have not told me the clinical details/symptoms.And any report has to be judged as per the symptoms. The report suggests that you have a disc problem that is compressing the nerves that comes out of your spine and supplies the nerve signals to your arm, and a bit of your forearm.The brain sends signals to the body eg arm to do some work. This is carried by spinal cord to the area, from where nerves come out and go to the specific area. Mother Nature has provided bones like skull and vertebral column to protect the brain and spinal cord (respectively). To allow our backs to bend, soft bags called discs are present between bones. Sometimes these discs come out of their allotted space and compress the nerves that come out of the spinal cord and cause the symptoms. The symptoms that you should be having include-neck pain,arm pain more on left side,sensory symptoms like tingling and numbness on the left arm, wasting/thinning of the muscles on one side compared to the other side,reduced reflexes in arm- a doctor will need to test these for you.These symptoms may be present in any combination, and all the symptoms need not be present. However, sometimes, people do have atypical symptoms that I cannot predict. So if you do not have the above symptoms, you need to tell me exactly what your symptoms are and I may be able to tell you if the report is significant in your case. If however the symptoms are present, the report is very relevant and I have already told you what it means.So you need to meet a spine surgeon (if you have the symptom combinations) and plan further medication (and/or surgery at a later date- if needed).I have tried to make it as simple as possible.I hope that the information helps you find the best solution for your problem. Feel free to contact me further for a related issue.Best of luck. Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"I have bulging disks in my neck and lower back.

Dizziness needs to be distinguish between vertigo, presyncope (people feels like they are going to black out; vision and hearing may become obscured), disequilibrium (off balance), and light-headedness (no rotational component, no movement). There are many different diseases and many different medications that can cause veritgo. Unfortunately, this is a symptom that is going to need further work up from your primary care physician. 90% of the time it is a condition called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It is essentially a dysfunction of the inner ear. Occasionally, people will also get ear or sinus fullness.I would recommend seeing your primary care doctor very soon. In the meantime:-go to a local grocery store and have your blood pressure checked-Limit salt intake-try not to make sudden head movements-if you develop weakness, numbness, tingling, vision changes, speak difficulties, facial droop, or stroke symptoms, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. -caffeine and alcohol can worsen vertigo"},{"Patient":"Hi t has been 1 month and 1 day since I took a blow to the head and received a concussion.

Much later my son set me down to tell me what he thought was some psychological disorder I had. I remember saying Whoa wait a minute, this is way over my head. Then I remember nothing. He called his wife in to ask why I didn t like her, as far as I understand because I cannot remember her exact moment of arrival. Later after saying things I don t remember she began to cry. I left to have a cigarette and my son went with me. He was yelling at me, telling me I was embarrassing him but all I could reply was what did I say? Went back to the table and the rest is blank until my daughter in law told me to get out of her house. So I did...came back to some distant reality and found a hotel I could stay at. I drove right to it with no problem finding it. A few years later I went to live in KC with them. Apparently I called my daughter in law said some things I guess were bad. I remember nothing about it...dialing the phone or anything. Another blackout occurred at my sisters house when I was helping her put up the siding. I was on a six foot ladder, my knees began to tremble. I blackout and fell on the cement. I remember nothing about the fall. My sister said I just fell flat on my back with no attempt to protect my self. I suffered broken ribs and mild head condition that was addressed for dizziness. It worked well. During the head and rib exam (gp) I began to get so dizzy the nurse was having a hard time keeping me on the exam table. I m 59. I ve been diagnosed with epilepsy. I just don t think I have it.","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.The episodes that you have mentioned are definite episodes of seizures the way you have described them.There is no other possible cause.A seizure comes suddenly- so a person cannot protect self- hence the fall from the ladder. There is no way one can protect oneself.The patient has no consciousness of self and that explains why you don't remember the episodes, despite even speaking in the episodes. Most convincing of all, people think there is a psychological effect. This is because they do not know that seizures are not just the shaking of limbs - a version of seizures which is widely known.So, I am quite convinced that you had seizures- most likely focal seizures with generalization (that is to say that you develop just a part of the seizure first and this becomes more extensive as the episode progresses- hence you could remember your daughter in law walk in, but not the rest of the episode).From your last line, I surmise that your neurologist has told you the same thing. From the same line, I feel that you have been initiated on medicines that you are not taking.I should tell you that you need to take the medicines, to avoid further episodes.In case there are episodes despite the medicines, you need to meet your neurologist to get the dose modified and to change the medicine if needed.If it persists, a scan, preferably MRI Brain will be needed.I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Please feel free to contact me for clarification on any particular point if needed. Please do start your medications.

My mother had to help him sit in his wheelchair and put him to bed. His hands were twitching constantly and he was unable to hold anything. He has been unable to chew or swallow his food however he did drink when a cup was held to his lips. My father has experienced bouts of this over the last 3 months,the last one being 9 days ago. My Mother has told me that usually after a few hours my Fathers motor skills and speech become normal. However todays attack was longer than normal. He has suffered with severe ulcers on both his legs over the last 4 years and has been hospitabilised a number of times with bad infections. My Mother has consulted the GP and they have refered my Father to a neurologist however we are still waiting to see the consultant. Can you give us some understanding of what could be wrong with my Father please","Doctor":"Hi,I am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.The symptoms of the query are quite suggestive of a stroke. The sudden onset of the symptoms, the motor weakness, the swallowing and speaking difficulty, the shaking of hands. All symptoms are suggestive of the diagnosis of stroke. The fact that he had been having similar episodes over the last 3 months is suggestive of mini strokes that we call TIA medically. These are usually warning signs of an impending stroke.I am unaware from the query about the duration of the symptoms. Within 4 to 8 hours onset should be treated urgently and should be visiting an EMR as soon as possible. He will need urgent treatment.If it is more than that, he needs to meet a neurologist who will probably perform a CAT scan of the brain with or without the angiogram (depending on the protocol of the hospital).As per the report of the CAT scan, medicines may be initiated. I think a low dose statin and antiplatelets should help. I would suggest a scan prior to the initiation of the medicines because the closest differential is a possible cerebral hemorrhage (less likely in view of the mini strokes) where these medicines are not to be given. Meanwhile, i think you should start him on physiotherapy for the motor weakness.Another possibility I want to consider here is possible diabetes and hypoglycemia attacks. If the GP has thought about this as a possibility and tested sugars, there is probably nothing to worry about. Otherwise hypoglycemia in a diabetic patient would explain the brief episodes. And a hypoglycemia can also explain the prolonged symptoms. In such a case, sugars need to be well monitored.The third possibility I need to consider is a vasculitis. This is a common cause of stroke, but usually is thought of in young patients. The last 2 causes I have considered in the view of preexisting foot ulcers which cannot be explained by TIA or current stroke as the ulcers predate the stroke. I think you need to get the scan and meet up with a neurologist. Unfortunately, as explained, I cannot suggest medications without the scan.I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Please feel free to contact me for any further clarification. Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"Hi. Im a 33 yr old male previously healthy.

I am 24, and female. Ive had a poor memory since I can remember, but it seems to be getting worse. I also struggle to concentrate and often need to be shown new things and few times before i remember what to do, often forgetting them if i don t repeat them regularly. sometimes if i am talking i and i hear someone else talking, the distraction causes me to forget what im saying, i zone out when im driving, and i find it very hard to learn anything without physically doing it; (so to read or hear what i should do, doesn t go into me head properly). Im not stupid, i got really good grades in primary and secondary school, however by the time i got to a-levels id started to notice my difficulty in remembering things and by the time i was doing my degree i struggled to learn. its only in the past year that i have noticed how bad it is as it effects my performance at work and when im driving. i also don t notice things such as if theres a road sign or traffic light i didn t know was there i might drive through it before i realise. and i struggle with facial recognition and to remember important things such as lock up procedure at work, and obvious things such as my friends jobs or family situations. I am also really tired all of the time, lethargic and drained. what could be causing this?","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.I think I should tell you that I feel the basic problem in your case is the lack of ATTENTION. And this I say not in the usual sense, but as a medical term- there is a subtle difference. As a medical term, Attention is the process where one can perform an activity without any significant problem in exclusion to all the possible diversions.Basically, if you are not paying attention, you cannot form a memory simply because you were not paying enough attention to the subject. And so your grades fall. Similarly, when you are driving, you know you need to look for signs and signals, but you are not paying attention to it unless it is too late. You have yourself said that you get distracted easily when talking. And that again means that you are not paying enough attention to the matter. If it was a memory problem, you would not have remembered the incident at all. So, in other words, you remember (and that's memory) to get good grades or to look at signs or signals but you are not paying attention to it. Now, you were a good student initially. That means you were born with a normal brain. So that brings us to 2 possibilities. 1, there is some metabolic/genetic defect in your system, and therefore, the brain isslowly getting clouded. However, in such cases we can usually get a similar family history. Now in my experience, when one is so distressed by his/her symptom, one always tells us that the problem is there in a family member. So, I am assuming from your query that there is no similar family history. Having said that, very frequently these symptoms come up sporadically in individuals, the family remains largely normal because their symptoms are either sub clinical, or because most people simply feel ashamed to talk about it.So, I suggest testing a MRI brain, and meeting a neurologist so that one can perform a lobar function test for you. In the 2, if there is a problem in even one, we can think of the above possibility and a further workup will be needed accordingly.However, the above possibility does not fully explain why you feel lethargic, or drained all the time. Yes, some metabolic conditions can cause the issue, but it is very rare to come without medical weakness and loss of muscle mass- which again you have not mentioned, and thus I assume its not there.In such a case, the possibility is that one may be depressed or too anxious. So one will need treatment for the same.A last possibility I would like to consider is Attention Deficit Syndrome. Now this explains almost all your symptoms, except that people usually ahve the symptoms since childhood, and not later in life. So that is another thing you will need to discuss with your neurologist there.As you can understand from the above discussion, the treatment will vary as per the diagnosis. So please get back to me with the MRI report and after meeting the neurologist and I will try my best to help you further.Please feel free to contact me for any further information or details on any aspect of your query.Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"I have an indentation on my skull to the right side of the middle, suffer from headaches on a daily basis and also pinsn kneedles in my arms and fingers.

Seems like I have to keep increasing the generic med. what does the brand name have in it that the generic doesn t have. Perhaps the ingredients of the generic that are missing is what I need? Problem is the real brand is so expensive.","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.While I cannot really comment on the quality of the generic medicines in my current position, considering your opinion that you need to increase the dose of generic kepra continuously, I would suggest avoiding the generic version.Kepra is an anti epileptic medicine that contains levetiracetam. This is a very important drug and you should not miss the dose or take an inadequate dose because you may develop seizures and this may be devastating depending on the circumstances when you develop the seizures. Besides, brain cells die with every seizure that you develop.So if you feel that the generic version is inadequate, avoid it.I agree with the fact that Kepra is expensive. Again, I would like to withhold the reasons why that is so since that will not gain us anything in the current discussion. However, there are many other brands that are now marketing levetiracetam at a much more affordable prices. The brands will depend on your location (that I am unaware about from your current query). A few brands in INDIA are Levipil, Levefree, Levepsy, Levera, Torleva etc. You can look into your pharmacy as to the other options available and buy a medicine that suits your affordability.If all the brands remain expensive for you and you are not satisfied with the generic drug, I suggest meeting your doctor and discuss starting cheaper antiepileptics like phenytoin, phenobarbitone etc. Of course, every antiepileptic has a fixed use, and so you cannot take any random medicine. So you need to meet your treating doctor and discuss the other options with him/her, so an alternative medication can be started as per the type of seizures you have.I have tried to make it as simple and as useful for you as possible. Please feel free to contact us for more information as per your further specific query to my response. Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"I have diabetics 2 , and take a lot meds, or highblood pressure, chosteral,, nerve medication and menopause. the last little while I have been forgetting things. for example was doing a ladies perm and for the life of me I cannot remember if I was the neutralizer out of her hair. I have tried to visualize back to what I did. and can t remember . just like to today drove to my mothers a hour away and for got to take my wallet.","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your  message.I think I can help you.First, the symptoms of the query are quite suggestive of early dementia.Dementia is a condition of gradual loss of memory and other mental functions.Now, I would have liked to know your age. The only clue I get from the query about your age is that you are post menopausal. So you must be at least above 45 - 50 years of age, which is the age where some forms of dementia start manifesting.I would, in my office, have preferred to do a full mental status examination. That however, is not possible on this query. This is important. Because forgetting things can be a part of normal day to day activity- I mean lot of people forget things at home daily, and lots of people go through a practiced activity without remembering the details. This is not dementia. One may even be concentrating on some other work whereby a practiced activity is performed perfectly but the patient does not remember the details because the attention was not paid to the activity. A simple example from daily routine- when driving, people tend to enjoy music because the driving is a part of the practice and so they can use their higher mental faculties to enjoy some music. During such activities the driver may not recollect how many times the gear was changed. However, if something comes up suddenly, the music is forgotten and your attention switches to the control of the car immediately. During such a phase, the music played in background is not remembered by the driver but every step taken to avoid a possible disaster is remembered in minutest details. So, if you are thinking about something when you are about to drive, you may forget the wallet. Same for the perm and neutralizer.What I am trying to tell you is that just because you do not remember 2 particular activities does not mean that you have dementia. You need a full formal testing to be done by a trained neurologist before one can diagnose dementia. If however you do have dementia, it is very likely that taking multiple drugs can increase the dementia, in other words, it may affect the memory. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Please feel free to contact me for a full mental status examination. However, you will need 3-4 response cycles when I give you the questionnaire and assess your response. So please enter a query accordingly. Alternatively, as suggested, meet a neurologist in your local area for the evaluation and a MRI brain study.Best of luck,Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"For the past few weeks I have experienced loss of power and mild discomfort in my left hand.

Mt dr. didn t even say anything about this until one year later. The past year or so, i have had trouble thinking of the right words to say...I know what I am thinking but can t find the word. I am retired, 71, don t have any hobbies really. I have been frustrated about this. a neurologist did a CT scan and eeg, which came back normal. He though it was related to depression/anxiety. My new pcp gave me wellbutrin and celexa to help. However, I haven t noticed much improvement. Could this have been caused by that mini stroke? I smoke a bit, don t exercise either. But have some language problems, not forgetfulness. My drs don t think it is dementia, but I worry. Do you have any advice?","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.First, I do not think that your prior stroke is involved. What you have described is a type of aphasia neurologically speaking. And aphasia is usually caused by a left sided brain problem- not right like you state in your query. Second, if it was truly due to the stroke, the problem would have been since 2009. Brain problems in stroke don't get delayed.So, I don't think that your prior stroke has anything to do with the issue.Second, the main causes of aphasia are stroke and dementia. It is not a stroke as per prior CT scan, and not dementia- dementia is memory loss, and from the query, your memory is pretty good- you remember the year 2009 clearly (suggests long term memory is good), and you remember the medicines (suggests short term memory is good as well). So like your doctors, I don't think its dementia either.However, I disagree with the choice of investigations- the CT has clearly missed your pre existing stroke as well. So I cannot be sure whether it has missed a newer stroke as well. So , I would have ideally suggested another MRI brain (a more sensitive study than CAT Scan) and a CV Doppler. However, I still don't think it is a stroke. A stroke starts suddenly. And you have definitely not said that there was a sudden onset of symptoms. If however you have forgotten to mention this in the query, you should definitely think about stroke and plan a MRI and CV Doppler as suggested before.Third, a significant history that you have given is the loss of work and lack of hobbies and physical exercises. I wont call it depression or anxiety. And therefore I don't think your medicines will work either. In your case, the age old adage- all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy- is probably most appropriate. So my suggestion is that you need to stop smoking and get some company and daily activities. It may sound odd to you but inactivity does take its toll. I don't think medicines are needed in your case. You just need to fill in your time with more activities so that your mind is active again.I have tried to make it as simple as possible for you to understand. Feel free to ask another query with a specific doubt based on the information I have given you. I would be happy to help you further.

My mother has high blood pressure, she s been very worried about her family due to personal reasons, thus she has been going through a tough time these past two years. I am curious to know if her blood pressure is causing her headaches, which lead to her brain spots. My mother recently went though another MRI this month to be sure that she is healthy and safe. Since we are waiting for the results, I would like to know most-likely outcomes and possibilities with this issue. Thank You.","Doctor":"Hi, the white spots on brain MRI could be due to lacunar infarcts or ischemic demyelination.Nothing to worry .These MRI changes are not matter of concern .

The pain was getting unbearable each time.......after a few days of that discomfort when i pooped it stopped.  This led me to believe i was passing a kidney stone after investigating the symptons.  i was pooping regularly before this, sometimes twice a day. After the pain stopped, i started getting constipated having to use over the counter laxatives and other measures.  This last episode was very uncomfortable but i finally had a move after an overnight battle.  I'm wanting to know is this normal? or any suggestion as to what may be happening?","Doctor":"HI. This is not normal for sure. This may not have been related to the stones as you are thinking. The constipation without an obvious reason should be investigated . Continue taking your laxative for a few more days and then take it on alternate days. Avoid diet causing constipation .If the problem does not get relived , please see a Gastro Specialist , you may need a colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"My son has been diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis.

We are willing to pay for this, we just want to make sure we have exhausted every option and know 1000% that we are making the right decision.

Now these are treatable conditions. But sometimes, it does leave a damage behind, and therefore the seizure medicines need to continue.Your wide is taking 100 mg tablets thrice a day. The most like medicine should be phenytoin. If not, please let me know. My advise will concentrate the precautions based on phenytoin (of course, some of them are generalized precautions and can be followed irrespective of the medicine in use).Precautions are as follows-1. Avoid flickering lights.2. Avoid sign boards.3. Avoid blinking lights.4. Avoid driving.5. Avoid swimming.6. Avoid skipping medicines without medical advice.7. Avoid triggers of seizures (these are individual, and only a patient can know them).8. Take adequate sleep.9. Avoid stress.10. Avoid sleeping too late, or getting up too early.11. Take a tablet of folate regularly. A dose of 5 mg is usually sufficient (if  on phenytoin).12. Eat a regular diet- avoid fast foods.13. Check drug levels in blood regularly.14. Meet your neurologist regularly.I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Please feel free to contact us for more information if you need clarification on any specific issue.

I have been having severe bone pain and worsening joint pain (I have lupus sle) ANd I have always had back problems but recently my back pain has gotten SEVERE to the point it hurts to laydown or lean back on it. I am wondering why he ordered these test and what he may be looking for? He ordered my usual test for my Lupus sle for baseline info and he ordered these without telling me why I found out after I got home on my paper work.Now I am concerned.","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.First, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. CPK and SPE can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. The symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending- in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure.Now SLE itself can cause the symptoms. The muscles and bone problems can arise in SLE itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do.However, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. So, I think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre existing diagnosis of SLE and continued to look for other causes of backache.A severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. The cause of myopathy may be SLE itself. The test commonly done to test myopathy is CPK or creatine phosphokinase. This is a test done from blood. The idea is if the CPK is raised, it suggests myopathy. In this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. I am unaware of your medication from the query. So I cannot really comment upon it. But some medicines themselves cause myopathy. And sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy.So I presume your doctor wanted to check that.Second test was SPE or serum protein electrophoresis. This is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. This is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down.If the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. If it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. So again you need not worry since the treatment is available. Why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something I can only speculate about. I guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have SLE- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. Having said that, its a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre existing condition.I think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. So there should be nothing to worry about- the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. Possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it.I have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details.Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"i have alot of pain in my lower abdomen. i am post menapause, but started bleeding. the dr tried to biopsy my cervix but was not able to get to it, pap came back good. also i feel like i have to urinate all the time. i also get dizzy when i urinate, i'm scared.","Doctor":"Hi.All the symptoms make me think of a few things you should take decision about faster.You need a CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen to rule out malignancy/ UTI or any other problem which may be diagnosed and t get the treatment according to the diagnosis made.Dizziness can be due to weakness. also this happens as a disorder called syncope, please discuss this with  your Doctor."},{"Patient":"I had surgery to remove bone fragments on my brain 3 years ago.

Two weeks ago my 62 year old husband had a TIA; only symptoms were confusion & loss of short term memory for a few hours. Every test possible was conducted & all came back normal. His total cholesterol is 207 but since he has good blood pressure, not diabetic, not overweight, walks briskly daily, etc. the doctor did not prescribe a statin. The bottom line is that they have no idea what caused it. The only thing different he has been doing is putting a piece of ginseng root in his green tea which he drinks in the afternoon. After the tea he then chews & swallows the root. He has been doing this for the past month. Are there side effects to ginseng? Thank you. Jeanie","Doctor":"Hi ,Ginseng is very good drug for memory loss after TIA.It causes no side effects if taken for short term use."},{"Patient":"I woke up this morning filling good about 2 hours into the day i was cleaning house when all of a sudden I got real dizzy light headed an then the hole room started spenning I went an layed down but it continued for about 2 hours finally started letting up i still get light headed when i stand up for a little bit now my kneck up to the bottom of my head acks and I have bad head acks","Doctor":"Hi,I am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.A per the query, you have reported a sudden onset of vertigo that was started when you were cleaning the house that reduced but persisted when you lie down and gets more as soon as you get up. Now, sudden onset of any neurological symptom suggests a possible stroke. And therefore I suggest that you go to a Emergency room as soon as possible and request an MRI of the brain to make sure that there is no stroke. If there is a stroke, you will need to be initiated for the appropriate medications depending on the type of stroke and also the duration after which you manage to reach the hospital.However, you have not reported any other feature like weakness or imbalance. So there is a possibility that instead of having a central cause of vertigo like stroke, you may actually have a peripheral vertigo like benign positional paroxysmal vertigo.  There are simple medicine like betahistine that will need to be initiated. There will also be exercises like Brandt Daroff exercises that the doctors/neurologist will need to teach you.However, since stroke is a more serious condition, and a condition in whose management time is a very crucial factor, I think you should get to a emergency service in a hospital that boasts of a neurologist as soon as possible. Once the stroke is ruled out, then the peripheral causes can be considered and treated.I have tried to make it as simple as possible. I hope that you benefit from the suggestion. Please get to a emergency as soon as possible. In the meantime, try to remain still and in bed so that the episodes of vertigo do not worsen. Avoid sudden jerky head movements.Please note, I have assumed that you have no cardiac issues, no diabetes, no hypertension or any other significant past history, as this has not been mentioned in the query.Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"my 16 month old daughter is suffering from tubersclerosis (subependymal nodules) symtoms seems to be mild.she had seziures only once though very mild. lasted for about approximately 45 to 50 secs. can she be cured by any ayurvedic treatment or pranayam when she will grow up? let me kindly know the long term prognosis also","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your query.First, I would like you to clarify whether the diagnosis in question is tuberous sclerosis, or tuberculosis. They are two very different conditions with different set of investigations and treatment. Having read the symptoms, I think it is most likely tuberculosis and I will respond as such. Why I feel that this may not be tuberous sclerosis is because this disease is a genetic disease with mental retardation and other affects eg effects on kidneys. Besides, I would like to know how was the child diagnosed to have the tuberous sclerosis. Since your question does not specify any of these additional factors that are present in a patient with tuberous sclerosis, I would like to consider a treatable cause like tuberculosis also. The cortical lesions that you have mentioned could be tuberculomas as well. For tuberculosis, ayurveda, yoga, pranayam, homeopathy and naturopathy are not going to help. She needs to be initiated on antitubercular therapy such as isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrizinamide, and ethambutol. These medicines need to be initiated by a allopathic pediatrician in a 16 month old child. The drugs and the blood reports will be needed to be checked regularly.Again, she will also need antiepileptic medicines temporarily since those nodules are causing her to have seizures. Again, the other systems of medicines are unlikely to help her. Again, she needs to meet a allopathic pediatrician to initiate the medicines and monitor the drug levels and the blood variation that may follow these medicines. If the child indeed has tuberous sclerosis, the prognosis is not too good as there is no definitive treatment in any system of medicine. A few medicines like everolimus have now been recommended, but very few doctors are trained enough to give the medicine. You will need to meet a rheumatologist as well as a pediatrician in such a case so that they can moderate the dose oth the medicine and give it a try if you like.  Over long term, if treated in time, the child may be cured and therefore I request you to take the child to a pediatrician as soon as possible for consideration of treatment of at least seizures and if possible the 2 possible diagnosis that we have discussed above. Please note, that I have no access to the scans that have been done for the child. Seizures should be treated urgently, whether due to tuberous sclerosis or due to tuberculosis or any other problem. So visiting a pediatrician is essential. Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"I d love you to try and answer it!My 20 year old daughter has had EXTREME nausea without emesis for a week now. Sharp pain on her left side so bad that we went to the ER almost a week ago. Did the whole work up with blood tests that showed nothing elevated but gave her IV saline, morphine for the severe pain and Compazine for the nausea. By the time we left the ER she was somewhat more comfortable but not pain free and was told to follow up with her PCP (who is still her pediatrician). It s now a week later..all she has eaten is some dry toast, tried to eat a grilled cheese sandwich, and some crackers-also a little water but she cannot stand the thought of food or drink with this nausea. She doesn t have an appointment with her dr. until October 10th and doesn t know what to do until then. ANY ideas?","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.Having read your message, 3 possibilities come to my mind.1. A severe gastritis. This comes, as you said, with extreme nausea and abdominal pain, often on the left side. Since it is a gastritis, a blood work up will be normal, and the only thing that can actually help diagnose this condition is the test of endoscopy that needs to be performed by a gastroenterologist. The scans, ultrasounds and the blood works would appear normal.In such a case, Tab Omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, should help her gradually regain her appetite. The tablet will need to be taken half hour prior to any meals.2. Gastric or Abdominal seizures. This rare entity comes with the symptoms of gastritis- nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and sometimes headache. The patient will not loose consciousness and will not have convulsions like the traditional seizures. However, this is a diagnosis that needs to be made after examination by a neurologist, and no treatment should be started till confirmed as the antiepileptic drugs do have serious side effects. Of course, all blood works would be normal in this case as well.3. Lastly, severe anxiety can present with a combination of any symptom. And is always a diagnosis made when other possible diagnosis have been ruled out. However, medically speaking this is always a possibility that needs to be considered in a young lady presenting with the symptoms you have mentioned, after all the causes have been ruled out. I would suggest observing her with her friends and see if she is more comfortable during this period- which may possibly suggest the diagnosis. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. I understand your concern, and seriously feel that the antacid should be tried. If it does not work, at least that will be one thing that your primary physician will not waste time on, since many authorities consider that giving antacids in a case of severe gastritis is diagnostic- depending on the response. In other words, if she improves, she has gastritis, if she does not improve, most likely gastritis is ruled out. If it does work, she should start to feel better within 15 days.Best of luck, Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"My friend has had a large brain bleed due to a birth defect that required three surgeries to stop. Her pupils are reactive and she still shows brain activity. It s been 48 hours and they have said she will not improve and will remove the ventilator tomorrow morning. she is breathing on her own but not enough to continue living. Why are they so quick to remove the vent? They said she is retaining the fluid instead of absorbing it.","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I empathize with you.The decision of removal of ventilator is always a difficult one. And the only thing that can make it easier to decide is the information. Still, all the information cannot balance the emotional aspect of the decision.There are few things that I notice when I read your query- 1. the patient is breathing on her own. So I would hereby like to draw your attention to the fact that why was the ventilator initiated? In this case, the ventilator must have been initiated for edema, not for breathing. The patient's in cases of intracerebral hemorrhage or simply put brain hemorrhages have lot of fluid that collects in the brain. This increases the pressure on the brain which cause problems. The ventilator is put to try to reduce the edema. But beyond the 48 hours, it is considered to be ineffective. In other words, the ventilator is not useful for edema measures for more than 48 hours. So, if the doctors put the ventilator for edema purposes and not for breathing difficulty, it would not help your friend after 48 hours. So you need to know why the ventilator was initiated in the first place. As you say that the patient is still breathing spontaneously, I think it is unlikely to be due to breathing difficulty. You need to discuss that with your treating doctors.2. You have mentioned that the patient is retaining fluid instead of absorbing it. That is what I have been trying to tell you. It seems that she has more edema production than the capacity of the body with assistance of the ventilator to absorb the same. In such cases, I am sure they would have initiated other measures like mannitol and this is another thing you need to find out from your treating doctors. The medicines will also help in reducing the edema, but sometimes the edema is so extensive that the combined effort of medicine and the ventilator is not enough.3. Her pupils are reactive and the brain activity signs are there as per you. I would like to know why you felt that there are signs of brain activity- your doctors seem to think that she has reduced chances of survival. So, its possible that the signs are there but there is a deterioration in the signs. These would have to be checked by someone trained in the art of checking the signs. It would not be possible for you to check them. I am not contesting your observations- merely pointing out that what you presume to be brain activity sign may actually be a deteriorated sign by which your doctors are saying the prognosis is bad. So that is another thing you need to discuss with your treating doctor.4. Mostly, in the hospitals there is a policy for such situations. And most of these policies are governed by the state and the government. Still, most doctors and hospitals take the opinion of next of kin before taking the decision. I feel that you may have been told this bit of information to judge and take the decision. I think the closest relatives of the patient will be in close discussion with the doctor regarding this decision. So that is another thing you need to discuss with the treating doctor as well as her family.Please do note, that I have no chance of examining the patient, nor do I have the exact details of the patients scans and history. So all of the above is just information that you need to discuss with your doctors. I hope that your friend's family and doctors will be able to take the best decision for her. Best of luck.

Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for query Several studies have shown that Clonidine, an α (2)-adreno-ceptor agonist, is effective in relieving tics, and the mechanism of action is thought to be linked to clonidine's effect on inhibitory effect resulting from reduced noradrenergic activity.Tourette Syndrome affects around one child in every 100 and usually begins in early childhood. During adolescence, there is a period of “pruning back” in which redundant brain connections are removed and other structural and functional brain changes occur.During this time, around one-third of children with Tourette Syndrome will find that their tics disappear and another third are able to more effectively control their tics. The remaining third, however, will experience little or no change in their tics and are likely to remain troubled by their Tourette Syndrome symptoms into adulthood.This phenomenon suggests that there are mechanisms in the brain that are involved in controlling tics and undergo development or re-organization in the teen years.So clonidine has a good role in TS , ADHD and sleep onset disorder."},{"Patient":"I hav a pain in my right side of my abdoman and I hav teribble back pain I hav had it since feb 2013 I wake up with blood on my tounge everyday it gets worse wen i eat certai.

I m afraid she could have a stroke but the doctor said that a stroke comes from the top chamber of her heart. Is there still a chance of a stroke?","Doctor":"Brief answer : Yes irregular heart beat may lead to stroke.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.The skipping beats from the bottom part of the heart, so called premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), when happen frequently, are associated with risk of incident stroke even in patients free of hypertension and diabetes. Frequent PVCs are associated with impaired ventricular relaxation that leads to remodelation of the heart increasing the risk of clot formation and embolization.Even though there are not to many studies about the relationship of ventricular rhythm abnormalities with stroke, in contrast to the established association of atrial fibrillation(irregular heart beat by the upper part of the heart) with incident stroke. That's why your doctor told you that strokes comes from the top chambers of the heart. To rule out a possible stroke your mother should undergo a head CT scan or MRI.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have slight shoulder and neck pains with a somewhat sore feeling.

The Facets are intact. Some prominence of the Ligamentum Flavum noted, and a combination of Ligamentum Flavum prominence and Broad-Based bulging contribute to some relative narrowing of the Dural Canal. It should be noted that visually the Dural Canal is to the small end of normal in it s AP Diameter. Again no severe stenosis is seen but some relative narrowing of the overall dural canal is noted for the above mentioned reasons.","Doctor":"Brief Answer: Lumbar spine disc herniation with mild spinal canal narrowing.You should see a neurosurgeon.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.It suggests there is a lumbar spine (L3-L4) disc herniation with degenerative changes resulting in narrowing of the intervertebral disc space and disc bulging (broad-based posterior disc protrusion). These findings, associated with flavum ligamentum prominence, contribute in spinal canal narrowing, although only a mild stenosis is noticed, indicating no severe radicular compression or severe pain.This means that may be you don't need to repair it surgically for the moment, even though you should see a neurosurgeon to explain you the follow up plan and the physiotherapy exercises that may relief your symptoms and which movements should be avoided.In case of pain you may use non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen tab 400 mg, at max 4 tab per day after meals.

At L3-L4, a tiny circumferential disc bulge is present which, in conjunction with mild facet arthropathy, contributes to mild right-sided and minimal left-sided neural foramen narrowing. At L4-L5, a tiny circumferential disc bulge is present which, in conjunction with mild to moderate bilateral facet arthropathy contributes to mild right and minimal left neural foramen narrowing. Central canal is patent. At L5-S1, a tiny circumferential disc bulge is present secondary to severe disc base height loss. Mild to moderate facet arthropathy is present. These findings contribute to mild bilateral neural foramen narrowing. IMPRESSION:Multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar spine with multilevel neural foramen narrowing but without severe central canal stenosis as described above.","Doctor":"Hi, treatment options should bring a holistic approach to the issue. Diet and weight loss are essential for reducing the pressure on the discs and nerves. Strengthening the back muscles can help too. Medically conservative therapy like NSAIDS is essential not only in pain reduction but also in reducing edema around the bulging discs due to chronic inflammatory state, which will release some pressure over the nerves.

THANKS SANDY","Doctor":"hello there.. welcome to health care magic , thanks for your query, 1st thing i like to emphasise is that you are not supposed to do driving in your 5th post op weeks.. you have to avoid such activities which increases stress on your cervical spine.. like driving for atleast 12 weeks post op, secondly if you are having bony spurs also called osteophytes  indicates soft tissues inflammation around the cervical spine, so your symptoms and history suggest that your are having a radicular pain in shoulder  due to bony spur and herniated discs are contributing to the symptoms.  may be your doctor didnt remove the spurs and didnt operate on herniated discs cause may be they are not severe enough,, i think you should start doing round the clock physiotherapy for neck like short wave diathermy and interferential therapy. along with tab prelogic 75 mg once at night and not neurotin. and get a test done called nerve conduction study of left upper limb. follow this for about a month and let me know. thank you.."},{"Patient":"My daughter will be 15 years old on the 22nd. On Feb 21, she had a grand mal seizure. She has never had a seizure before that date. However, over the past year and a half, she has had sudden jerking motions in her arms and head. She was on med for Primary inattentive disorder (ADD) and her doctor was aware of these movements but did not testing. Right before she had the seizure the jerking movements with her arms were worse then they have ever been especially in her left are. Could this have been some type of seizure all along. Her neurologist had me take her for an eeg but ordered no lab work or anything else. I have called the neurologist many times because I am concerned about what I need to do for my daughter and she has never returned my calls.

The burning feelings on the left side of the face from ear to chin along with numbness suggests presence of possible facial nerve paralysis or Bell's Palsy. It could be due to viral infection, presence of trauma, tumor or other lesion in the facial area where it may compress the facial nerve and have such effects on the branches of the nerve that supply the cheek, chin and ear. You should visit an oral & maxillofacial surgeon or neurologist for the examination and further investigations regarding the problem. If some lesion is present, it will have to be removed for the recovery of the sensations. In absence of any lesions, you will have to wait for some months for the sensations to come back.The leg pain on the right side may be due to muscle spasm in the area. You can take muscle relaxant such as Paracetamol 500 Mg + Diclofenac Sodium 50 mg + Chlorzoxazone 250 mg (Dan-MR) twice a day for 5 days. You can also apply heat and local Diclofenac gel (Volini) over the area. Give rest to knee for some time and it will be fine.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM. I wish you feel better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hi goodday, my sister sumtime last week said she was getting blurred vision in her right eye, also she felt numbness in the right side of her face. She spent a night in the hospital under observation and she did CAT scans and blood tests and still they found nothing wrong. She was given some meds to take, and after a visit today, she said the doctor told her that she has Bilpulsey . I m not sure if its spelt correctly, but this is what she said. Can you shed some light on this situation please.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. We all have facial nerve on both sides of the face that has branches that run from temple, cheek, towards jaw and then to the neck. If this facial nerve s paralyzed due to some reason, then all the branches and the muscles they supply get affected and face loses sensations on that side. Usually, this nerve paralyzes when there is some lesion like tumor or trauma which compresses or injures the nerve. However, if your sister had one of these reasons, it would have been diagnosed in the investigations at the hospital. Thus, she is either suffering from viral infection or idiopathic reason (the cause that is not yet deermined).Symptoms of this palsy include loss of sensation and numb areas on the side of the face that is affected, dry eyes due to loss of tone of eye muscles, dropping of lips and drooling of saliva from that side of mouth, loss of saliva causing dry mouth etc. Treatment usually involves supportive therapy for dry eyes, dry mouth and facial massage is advised to regenerate the nerve sensations. Usually, the situation is healed on its own in absence of any obvious reason and the nerves will regain the sensation. If you consult a neurologist, he/she can she more light on the disorder by doing in-depth examination and investigations.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM. I wish your sister feels better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"I had a bad vertigo attack almost one year ago. I have gone thru MRI s , neck xrays, inner ear test, et - all come back showing nothing wrong. I continue to experience dizziness especially if I turn too fast or get up too fast. It has affected my eyes. One day my head jerked violently as the movement in my eyes were affected and it thru me off. Since then, depending on the position of my head, I get a neurological feeling that runs from the to of my eyes, down my left jaw line. My eyes sometimes get watery and sometime dry but makes me off balance. Can someone give me an idea if this is inner ear or a TMJ problem as my jaws do crack and pop. I am just tired of feeling wierd and out of it .","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. TMJ problems can sometimes contribute to the vertigo problems a patient may experience. In addition, as your jaw is making cracking and popping sounds every time you open the jaw, it adds to the diagnosis of the TMJ problems. However, the watery and dry eyes problems you are experiencing is not associated with the TMJ problem. It might be an effect of the vertigo you are experiencing. Regarding TMJ, the problems may include subluxation of the TMJ, degenerative joint disease or infection in relation with the joint.As you do not have any ear or neck related problem, I would recommend you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for examination of the TMJ. You might have to go through x-ray and CT Scan of the joint for diagnosis of the problem. Based on the results, confirmed diagnosis and treatment can be suggested.I hope this information helps you.

Tired of all the pills and finally approved for surgery.

I want to know if my jaw dropping over the years could have caused Trigeminal Nueralgia, and did I make a mistake not getting a second opinion. I have been in severe pain and with electrical current like pain that is like no other. Makes labor seem like a cake walk :(","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. I would like to make it clear that the jaw bone and jaw bone loss has no connection with your trigeminal neuralgia as you are having this nerve problem for 7 years. Usually, lower jaw is not associated with the trigeminal nerve. If you have consulted an oral surgeon and a general dentist both regarding this situation, I would advise you to go with the opinion of the oral surgeon as they have higher knowledge regarding the bone height, density and disorders regarding trigeminal neuralgia.It is really difficult to answer you without seeing your condition physically and the description of your case is little confusing, but thisis the best advise I can give for your situation.I hope this information helps you.

Its goung on 48 hours now the numbness. I also feel the gum around my wisdom tooth on left side might have a minor infection and there is slight soreness in my left ear. What do youbthink is wrong?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you are feeling that gum around your wisdom tooth is sore, it is possible that your wisdom tooth on lower left side is impacted, meaning it wants to erupt into oral cavity but lack of physical space is not allowing its eruption. In such situations, the food you are eating gets lodged into the fold of the gum around that tooth making the area infectious and painful. This pain can be felt up to the ear as referred pain.However, this condition is not associated with the tingling of the hand, which might be related to deficiency of calcium, Vitamin D or Viramin B12.I would advise you to start antibiotic Cefadroxyl 500 mg (Droxyl) twice a day for 5 days. You can combine this with analgesic such as Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg when you are having pain. Doing warm salted water gargles and using Chlorhexidine mouthwash will help to clear the infection faster. For the tingling sensation, you should start with vitamin supplements after taking advise of your physician.If the soreness around tooth and ear does not go away after 5 days, you should consult the dentist for disimpaction/extraction of the wisdom tooth for permanent relief.I hope this information helps you.

I am worried about facial nerve paralysis following this and would like to know would it be possible to use a EMS device which exercises the facial muscles following this surgery to help the facial nerve get back to normal?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you are going for patial parotidectomy, there is a chance that facial nerve can be saved by the surgeon if it is not involved by the tumor. In that case, you will not face any symptoms of facial nerve paralysis.However, if the nerve is involved in the tumor, then it will have to be removed by the surgeon. Even if it will not be removed, there is a chance that the tumor may press on the nerve in future and may cause facial nerve paralysis.If the nerve is damaged, you can give it about 6 months to regenerate on its own. Sometimes it takes about a year or longer to get the sensation back. In any case, facial massage will sure help to regenerate the nerve faster. You can use EMS device after the initial healing of the surgical site (about 3 weeks) and consulting with your surgeon in the follow up appointment with the surgeon.If the tumor reappears, as that is the case with partial parotidectomy, you may have to go for total parotidectomy in future to remove the entire parotid gland to eliminate the chances of recurrence.

Is this a normal reaction to the lumbar puncture and the attempt to remove fluid ?","Doctor":"Brief Answer:Fatigue and pain is a normal reaction to lumbar puncture.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern.After the lumbar puncture, you may feel pain or tenderness in your lower back. The pain might radiate down the back of your legs. In most cases, the pain will ease after a few days and it can be treated with painkillers, such as paracetamol.Fatigue, does fit with performing of the procedure. You may develop a headache, nausea, fatigue afterward due to a leak of fluid into nearby tissues. A pain-relieving medication that contains acetaminophen can help you reduce headache too.Try to rest and don't participate in strenuous activities. Regarding the results of the cerebrospinal fluid taken by lumbar puncture, is important to evaluate his appearance, WBC count, Glucose level, Protein level, beside the opening pressure (that in your case is elevated), in way to be focused into a possible diagnosis. It can be considered additional tests such as CSF culture, depending on clinical findings.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

It s been happening for about 2 weeks now and hasn t been slowing down. I do have allergies but get good treatment for that already so I do not believe this is caused by my allergies.","Doctor":"Hi there! Dizziness and Nausea can be caused by a number of factors. Let's look at the most common one - Vertigo.Usually due to an inner ear problem and is usually the most common cause of dizziness with nausea or vomiting especially aggravated by movement of head to a particular side (different in each patient) and on getting up from bed etc.If you have had a flu like episode recently or have a ringing sensation in your ear it is most likely to be Vertigo and since symptoms are increased with a change in position, it is called Positional Vertigo. I would recommend you to start one of the 2 following medicines and see how you feel. BetaHistine 16mg thrice a day(Brand name Vertin)or Cinnirazine 25 mg twice a day(Stugeron)or Meclizine 12.5 mg twice daily (Diligan).These drugs may make you a bit drowsy initially and so i would advice you to stop Driving or operating heavy machinery till your symptoms subside. These medications are only till the time you can see your Physician and undergo a full physical evaluation so that other causes may be ruled out. Hopefully this helps.

He is bedridden from last 19 to 20 years due to paralysis. before 2 weeks he get loose motion and vomiting but this all was stopped before 4 days and he were talking strangely. We admitted him in hospital but he is still drowsy and unconscious and now he is not saying anything and can t recognize any relative. He has excess nitrite in urine and heumoglobin I am very upset please tell me if he is fine or something is there to be worried? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi there.I hope to help you with the following information.Bedridden patients are prone to a number of problems,  including increased chances of a Urinary tract infection and other infections. Increased Nitrites in urine are usually suggestive of that. Also when there is a bad Urinary Infection, it can spill over to the blood - called Urosepsis and when this happens it affects the mental status also either due to fever or due to a number of other causes. With age, the brain starts to shrink and on top of this when they have another problem like a infection, they go into altered consciousness or even unconscious state. One other problem commonly seen which can cause similar symptoms is Low Sodium content, Hyponatremia. Especially more common in the elderly, kidney disease and those with another co-existing disease.So Serum Sodium levels also need to be checked into and corrected if necessary. A CT scan or an MRI of the brain will tell us if he has had a Stroke or a bleed. So these are the few things you need to look for as a possible cause for your father's current condition. Wishing him a speedy recovery. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi! have been having lower lumbar issues. my right leg has been tingleing with a little numbness. at night there is a little pain which wakes me up at night until I reposition it. I brought it to the attention of my diabetes specialist. with my age(53) she said possibly calcium buildup around one of my nerves that run through my spinal cord and when inflamed causes the lower lumbar pain and leg pains? she says that the ibprofan that I was taking can raise my numbers of my kidneys. and to take tylonal for the inflammation? your thoughts Thanks Alan","Doctor":"Hi there!Yes your Diabetes specialist is absolutely right in that Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs are not recommended in Diabetics. Your symptoms since they're on 1 side is most likely to arise from one of your Spinal nerve roots impinged by a part of your Spine, commonly known as a slipped disc. It is mostly seen in people above 50yrs of age and is fairly common. The problem is that the pain is worse and more difficult to control in Diabetics.Start with an Xray of the LumboSacral spine - of it shows anything then you can consult a Physiotherapist and take appropriate measures.If Xray doesn't pick up anything,  MRI of the Spinal cord helps. For the pain , if not controlled by Tylenol -  Pregabalin 75 mg twice a day for the first 2 weeks and then once a day at night should help. Needs a week to start showing effects. This can cause drowsiness and so i would advice you to avoid driving and operating heavy machinery for the first few days. If it doesnt work - small doses of Amitryptiline or Nortrytilline is helpful. Avoid lifting heavy weights. Take care.

Had root canal a d dentist said the tooth was dead and full of black unhealthy stuff. The tooth had 3 cracks in it. Am on antibiotics and now 2 days later still numbness. Have to have crown now and am afraid to have one put on if still numb.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. As you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it,I am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. Other possibility is that that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas.Alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. In any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. Usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. If you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. You can get the crown after the numbness is solved.I would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. He/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. Crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

It felt numb, but I m not really sure about other symptoms because my stomach was hurting from a few hours before. I continued to play Does getting hit in the temple cause brain damage","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you got hit on the temple, you may have injured the temporal bone or zygomatic arch in the area.If either of these bones gets injured, it is usual to feel the numbness in the area due to injury to the branches of the facial nerve in the area. The eye may feel the impact too.I advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for examination of the injured area and x-ray of the area to locate any bony injury present. If any injury is present, based on the extent and exact location of the injury, treatment can be advised. Do not worry about brain damage as it is not possible to damage hurt by having tennis ball injury to temple area.

From the description of blow and the symptoms you are suffering from, it seems that you might have fractured one of the facial bones, either temporal or zygomatic bone. When one of these bones are hurt, feelings related to nerve like numbness etc., difficulty in opening mouth and swelling in the ear area are usual symptoms.I would advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon without any delay. You will have to go through x-ray and possibly CT Scan. Based on the test results, diagnosis of the fractured bone can be confirmed and treatment can be advised. If you are in too much pain, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to thrice a day for relief in pain. Please do not massage the area or apply heat without consultation with the surgeon.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

She has no insurance, but if needed to go to the er, she will. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. If the feeling is more like the twitching of muscles, then it can be related to bell's palsy as this condition causes weakness and involuntary movements of the muscles. In addition, if she is feeling like fluid is moving inside her face, then she could be suffering from sinusitis. Sinusitis causes movements of fluids in the sinus when the head moves and causes this sensation. If she is having cold and congestion, then this is more likely to be the possibility. You can visit an ENT surgeon if the symptoms do not resolve within a week. He/she can also diagnose symptoms regarding bell's palsy.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

It is true that Cambia is given for migraine headaches, but do not worry about the one dose that you have given to your son as it is less likely to cause severe side effects with just that one dose.As your son is 14 years old, you can safely give him Acetaminophen 500 mg (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen 400 mg (Brufen) up to 3 times a day (8 hourly). This will give better relief in concussion related headache. If he does not feel any relief in pain in 3 days or if the pain worsens, you should consult a physician to examine the injured area.I hope this information helps.

Many thanks.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You should start treatment when symptoms will interfere with your quality of life, when you will have functional disabilities.Based to your symptoms at the time of initiation of the therapy, and you age, the neurologist will help you to make the right therapeutic choice.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern. As you have seen lots of neurologists, I will try to give you an internist point of view. 1- Regarding the time of initiation of the treatment and the type of treatment in Parkinson disease there are not right and wrong choices, but appropriate choices based to the stage of the disease, the age of the patient and other preexisting diseases. It is recommended to start therapy when symptoms interfere with quality of life, when functional disabilities begin. As the Parkinson disease consists of a progressive, and irreversible loss of dopamine sensitive brain cells, at one point of your disease development you will need to be treated , but the doctors goal is to delay treatment as much as your clinical situation allows it, in way to avoid drug- induced complications. Even though there is a trend toward initiating therapy at the time of the diagnosis or early on the course of the disease , because patients may have some disabilities at an early stage, and there is a possibility that early treatment may preserve beneficial compensatory mechanisms. 2- What therapy to initiate ?Many experts favor starting with an MAO-B inhibitor in mildly affected patients because of the potential for a disease modifying effect.Meanwhile, dopamine agonists can be used for younger patients, with functionally significant disability to reduce the risk for motor complications (involuntary movements known as dyskinesias).And Levodopa for patients with more advanced disease, the ederly, or those with cognitive impairment.Combined therapy, is used in patients with motor complications.Meanwhile exercise, education and support should be considered throughout the course of the disease. Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"My husband , aged 58 has been getting headaches of late and an M R I has revealed that he has leucomalacia!

Several months passed between episodes. Doctor says it is vertigo and prescribed Meclizine. I recognize now that the trigger is doing activities that make me look up in an awkward position (installing tile under the upper kitchen cabinets, relocating some wiring near the ceiling of the basement). The Meclizine made the last episode a one-day ordeal instead of the 5 days of the previous episode. Since then, half of a 25 MG tablet prevented onset.

I have been to the chiropractor and have an issue with scoliosis (sorry about the spelling)","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. If you are having severe backspin on lying down on right side, it might be due to paraspinal muscle injury on right side. Such muscle injury usually manifests as dull pain on same side on standing, pain becomes severe on stretching like bending/lateral bending towards left side or pressure on muscle while lying down/direct pressure. Tenderness can be felt at pain site. There is one close differential diagnosis of it - Lumbar disc disease. It can present as pain on either side, pain is sharp/current like/radiates upto same side thigh-calf-foot. Pain becomes severe on forward bending/standing/sitting and some relief on lying down. Your backpain is more like of muscular type. It is not getting relieved due to continuous exertion. You can follow few tips : Avoid prolonged physical exertion: Avoid weight lifting: Ask some family member to massage your back. Apply hot fomentation over back thrice a day.: Apply painkiller gel like Diclofenac thrice-four times a day after proper prescription.: You can take Tab Thiocolchicoside-Diclofenac combination after proper prescription. : Avoid pressure at pain site.: Continue Chiropractor assistance.If still no relief, consult doctor for examination of back. If there will be doubt of disc disease, he will advise MRI of lumbar spine.Hope it will help you. Thanks. Take care."},{"Patient":"My mother is 82 years old.

I don t even have a car. can t afford one. just pass this on to Dr. Phil please. thank you Gwen Ramsey spencer,oh","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history.As you have RSD I feel you need a neurologist to perform a clinical examination. Post which there might be a need of the EMG and NCV test.Since RSD is a painful conditon with severe contracture deformity there is a way which in my clinical practice is helpful to them.Like, usually RSD is recommended to a physical therapist for the release of contractures if they can be mobilized in about say 4-6 weeks of time. Most cases have been mobilised in that period and many have got some mobility of the muscles as well. The physical therapist will use hot water therapy before providing the mobilization of the bones and stretch to the muscles. It will be a painful but has helped regain he normal muscle length. This is a little longer procedure and may give pain but with results. Also TENS therapeutic ultrasound are used to reduce inflammation and pain in this cases.In some cases were the contraction deformity is severe there the Neurologist may recommend botox injection which will losen the muscle fibres and post which conscious physical therapy and splints are used to maintain the muscle length. post which the mobility of the joints is expected and worked for couple of patients in my clinical practice.I will advice you to discuss the same with a neurologist as RSD is a treatable condition and you an get out of this pain and disability factor. Need little patience and understanding about the case and things will work fine.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My friend is 78years old .she called tonight and said she has been dizzy and so nauseous she can t even drink her coffee.

Could this be an early sign of Parkenson disease and what tests can be conducted to rule this out? Kathy","Doctor":"Brief Answer:Your symptoms are not typical for Parkinson disease.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.Your symptoms are not typical for Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease consists of a progressive and irreversible loss of dopamine sensitive brain cells. Its symtoms vary, depending on the stage of the disease, but are always manifested symetrically. Tremor (trembling of arms and fingers) especially increases when trying to approach the target (a glass of water toward the mouth), rigidity (slow movements of the upper and lower limbs), speaking and swallowing difficulties due to impaired laryngeal and esophageal muscles function, etc... The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is mainly made by clinical symptoms. The diagnostic imaging exams serve only to exclude other diseases. Treatment consists of dopamine restoring medications such as: Levodopa or Sinemet (a dual combiantion of Levodopa with Carbidopa in a single tablet). Amantadine (an antiviral drug which has been shown effective in improving Parkinson symtoms) may be included into the treatment. Deprenyl (Selegiline) is a MAO-Inhibitor which is also a possible choice to be added to Parkinson treatment.So what to do next ?Try not to get stressed because it may be related to your symptoms or may aggravate them.Try to have a balanced life, not to work with extended hours and to sleep well.In case of increasing tremor or development of any new symptom , please consult a neurologist.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 15 years old and for the past year I ve had emotional ups and downs.

I read carefully your question, and i will try to help you.The suggested treatment for cyclothymia is a combination of Sertraline (Actizer) with Valproic acid (Develpine). Sertraline is an antidepressant drug, which is implicated into the serotonine activity, trying to increase its levels in the brain, helping you getting out of the depression periods. It is recommended to start taking 25 mg of sertraline once a day (each morning) for two weeks. After the  first two weeks, you should raise its dosage to 50 mg once a day (each morning). Together with Sertraline you should take Valproic acid to reduce your over excitement states.  You should begin taking it for 250 mg twice a day (in the morning and before sleep). After 1 month you can raise it's dosage to 500 mg twice a day, but if you get better with 250mg twice a day, you just stay with that dosage .Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

Since that surgery I have extreme muscle stiffness and lots and lots of pain in my thighs, knees, groin (of course I suppose), upper arms and shoulders. I WAS in good physical shape. I exercise by walking at the gym and used to do weight training. I describe it as feeling like I m turning into petrified wood. I am not running a fever. My primary care doctor ran blood tests of different sorts. They all came back normal. Yesterday I went for a medical massage therapist. This morning I couldn t even get out of bed I was in so much pain. I have type II diabetes and because I have had bad reactions to Crestor and Lipitor for high cholesterol - muscle stiffness and cramping - my Primary put me on simvastatin but has taken me off that for now (about a week ago). We believe that I am having an allergic reaction to the Succinylcholine that was administered during my surgery. I didn t know it at the time, but now I believe that my mother who passed away 9 years ago had this reaction after knee surgery when she was exactly my age - 62. I have a call into a neuromuscular neurologist but their office is closed today. It was suggested to me by the massage therapist to discontinue massage. She also was wondering if maybe I should have a muscle biopsy. I of course think I m headed to a wheelchair - and in my lifestyle, that is NOT an option. Some comforting words of advice before the weekend starts would be gratefully appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi, I am Dr.Bruno.  I have read your question with care and understand your concerns.

This system enables our voluntary control of muscles, as well as our reception of sights, sounds, sensations, tastes and smells.- The somatic nervous system controls functions that are under conscious voluntary control such as skeletal muscles and sensory neurons of the skin. The autonomic nervous system, mostly motor nerves, controls functions of involuntary smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, and glands- Somatic (biology), referring to the cells of the body in contrast to the germ line cells. Somatic nervous system, the portion of the vertebrate nervous system which regulates voluntary movements of the bodynow since you have surgery for the cervical spine I will advice you to undergo the physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the neck.

You should take some calcium supplements in order to prevent recurrence of seizures.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. There are several reasons of such seizures. Your poor diet during these last weeks, may have caused low blood calcium levels which stimulates parathyroid gland to produce more PTH (parathormon), stimulating the kidneys to eliminate more phosphates. This leads to low blood phosphates levels, which in your case developed the HCC seizure. I suggest that you take some calcium supplements in order to prevent recurrence of seizures. This will help to correct not only calcium level in blood , but also to raise up your blood phosphate. In a month , you can have another blood check up of calcemia, phosphates and PTH.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern and your question is well done, but at this case the factor that causes the Ankilosing Spondylitis is not known . It does have a genetic predisposition and the role of infection in developing the pathology is controversial . Its ok for you to take the medication prescribed by the doctor , but the main treatment of Ankilosis Spondylitis remains the fisical activity. It would be better to begin the exercises after a shower with warm water which will help you with the stiffness. Swimming, volleyball, etc are the main activities which help decreasing the pain level and conserving the normal posture of your body. Is recommended to stay overthrown for 15-20 minutes for several times a day. If the symptoms does not improve with the fisical activity and the antiinflammatory drugs (CO-DICLO-MISO 75MG), then you have to see a reumatologist for more specific treatment.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

BPPV is the most common cause of the symptoms of vertigoSymptomsEmesis (vomiting) is common, depending on the strength of the vertigo itself and the causes for this illness.Nausea is often associated.Paroxysmal — Sudden onset of episodes with a short duration: lasts only seconds to minutes.Positional in onset: Can only be induced by a change in position.Pre-syncope (feeling faint) or syncope (fainting) is unusual but possible.Rotatory (torsional) nystagmus, where the top of the eye rotates towards the affected ear in a beating or twitching fashion, which has a latency and can be fatigued (the vertigo should lessen with deliberate repetition of the provoking maneuver). Nystagmus should only last for 30 seconds to one minute.Visual disturbance: It may be difficult to read or see during an attack due to associated nystagmus.Vertigo — Spinning dizziness, which must have a rotational component.Many patients will report a history of vertigo as a result of fast head movements. Many patients are also capable of describing the exact head movements that provoke their vertigo. Purely horizontal nystagmus and symptoms of vertigo lasting more than one minute can also indicate BPPV occurring in the horizontal semicircular canal.Patients do not experience other neurological deficits such as numbness or weakness, and if these symptoms are present, a more serious etiology, such as posterior circulation stroke or ischemia, must be considered.The spinning sensation experienced from BPPV is usually triggered by movement of the head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. The most common movements patients report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their heads upwards in order to look at something, and rolling over in bed.the causes are - Within the labyrinth of the inner ear lie collections of calcium crystals known as otoconia or otoliths. In patients with BPPV, the otoconia are dislodged from their usual position within the utricle, and migrate over time into one of the semicircular canals (the posterior canal is most commonly affected due to its anatomical position). When the head is reoriented relative to gravity, the gravity-dependent movement of the heavier otoconial debris (colloquially \\"ear rocks\\") within the affected semicircular canal causes abnormal (pathological) endolymph fluid displacement and a resultant sensation of vertigo. This more common condition is known as canalithiasis.In rare cases, the crystals themselves can adhere to a semicircular canal cupula, rendering it heavier than the surrounding endolymph. Upon reorientation of the head relative to gravity, the cupula is weighted down by the dense particles, thereby inducing an immediate and sustained excitation of semicircular canal afferent nerves. This condition is termed cupulolithiasis.There is evidence in the dental literature that malleting of an osteotome during closed sinus floor elevation, otherwise known as osteotome sinus elevation or lift, transmits percussive and vibratory forces capable of detaching otoliths from their normal location and thereby leading to the symptoms of BPPV.TreatmentRepositioning maneuversA number of maneuvers have been found to be effective including: the Epley maneuver, the Semont maneuver, and to a lesser degree Brandt-Daroff exercises. Both the Epley and the Semont maneuver are equally effective.Usually a physical therapist may help you learn the exercises and helps to recover from symptoms.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My husband has been feeling slightly fatigued, has had some dizziness, and has been experiencing some sweating from the head down through his neck, shoulders and half way down his back for no apparent reason.

The front surgeon said it would save damage over time disrupting other discs I already have and may need fusion down the road.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.Since you have herniated disc at L5 - S1 level and you have been advised for surgery? I wonder if you have tried physical therapy . As it is non invasive and can help recover if proper therapy is applied. Also, surgery is made to choice by surgeon is you have severe neurological symptoms of controling the lowerrl limbs during movement .In my clinical practice most patients don't need surgery and all recovered well almost 99% with physical therapy. Also, the area L5-S1 is a crucial area as it is a weight bearing joint, so as u have the maximum mobility and weight bearing at that area, dealing with a proper surgical procedure is needed.Depending upon how your muscles are before and after the surgery by the help of a physical therapy.Also, I had a case with 3 levels disc protrusion and a old fracture of 4 vertebrae but surgery was not needed. with proper assessment and guided physical therapy patient responded well and surgery was never done till date..RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have spodylosis in my lower back and also a bulging disc.

The neurocysticercosis is a curable disease. It is intestinal tapeworm infection which involves brain or spinal cord. It is treated by: Anti tapeworm medication - Albendazole or Ivermectin-Albendazole or Paraziquantel therapy  is given for 1 to 3 months. Dose is prescribed according to body weight. There is no set duration of treatment: Anti-inflammatory - Steroids like Dexamethasone is given to control edema and severe inflammatory reaction caused by parasite. Painkiller like Diclofenac sodium can also be given to control headache and inflammation.: Anti-epileptics - Medication like Phenytoin or Levetiracetam is given to control seizures. It commonly causes seizures. CT brain is done after completion of treatment to evaluate the response. Decrease in edema, presence of calcification suggest death of parasite. However despite all this, seizures or focal deficit may persist throughout life.Surgery is not considered as a good option as it can cause spread of parasite due to rupture. But cysts in ventricle or paraventricular location, large size with mass effect may need surgery.Regarding precautions after full treatment: Wait for subsidence of seizures. If it persist, continue medication as advised by doctor till full recovery. Seizure patient needs attention, full compliance to drugs, should do work which does not precipitate seizure attack. Supervision of patient is always needed: Ask him to carry a card mentioning about his name, disease name, treatment and what to do in case of acute seizure attack.: Always carry seizure medication whenever travelling outside or alone.Hope it will help you. Thanks. Take care.If still doubt, consult doctor or ask another question.Dr Ishu Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"I have cyst on spinal cord so went to neurologist and he has ordered more mri with contrast, also of my brain.

I have read your question with care and understand your concerns about the brain swelling. Let me try to help you I understand that your wife continues to have a lot of swelling after the last surgery which was done in 15 april 2014After a stroke, the brain swells and this increases the pressure inside the skull. This increased pressure decreases the blood circulation. So we have to reduce the pressure immediately. For this the surgeon take a part of the skull so that the brain is able to swell freely. Once the swelling of the brain reduces , the part of the skull can be replaced. Or instead of the part of skull, a titanium mesh can be kept Now How long it takes for the swollen brain to Come back to normal size ?

I was unconscious and did not know my mother from my grandmother. I was fed antibiotics through my ankle and was fortunate to live through this devastating illness. I do remember a couple of snippets from my illness when I was 2. I have no outward repercussions, however I was wondering if, at the age of 2 it could have affected my nervous system. I seem to be very emotionally sensitive and have been on anti depressants for over 10 years. These help very much and i am glad i live in an age when these are available. I don t seem to be able to make mental connections as quickly as most seem to do. My IQ is very average and in school I was almost always the last one to finish a test. i read rather poorly and slow even at this age 62 and do not enjoy reading that much (neither here nor there i guess) I don t mind but I had always tried real hard to study and work on my school work .I always took more time than most in school. I do not seem to catch on as quickly as most. I do not mind as I am 62 years old and am retired. Life is pretty great really although hard, it is for most i beleive. I am good at artwork and conceptual thinking. I know you can not tell me anything definitive but I was wondering what sort of internal brain damage there could have been - I was very very athletic and that was another thing (with my artwork) that i was quite strong in. Can you tell me anything about nerve connections that could have been slightly damaged at the age of 2 - I have heard that at 2 your nervous system is finishing it s development.

I have seen doctors and had lots of tests, but so far no diagnosis. The pain was sporadic until December 2013. Then it became more intense - more painful and more often. Now it s almost constant. I have had issues with constipation for years due to my need to take narcotic medication for chronic pain (reflex sympathetic dystrophy, lymphedema, arthritis, etc.) In 12/13 my medication was changed and the pain in my abdomen became my new chronic pain, overtaking the other pain, which while still there, is not as prominent. My pain medication has been adjusted, but the pain remains. While I was being tested to find what was causing the stomach/abdomen pain I was diagnosed with leukemia (CCL) which apparently is not related. The question is what is causing my pain? Stress makes it worse, and while constipation may be an issue, the pain became worse after my colonoscopy & endoscopy. I have also had a CT Scan, PET Scan, intestine scan, can t have a MRI due to a spinal cord implant. So far these things have also been ruled out, IBS, hernia, no vaginal issues, gastritis.

About four weeks ago I was diagnosed with viral meningitis after a CT Scan, MRI (with and without contrast) and a lumbar puncture. I never had a fever or stiff neck - only a headache that would not go away and vomiting on several occasions. I also developed double vision about 10 days after the headache started. The day before the double vision started I had received a clean MRI; however, once my vision was affected (on a Friday afternoon) my primary doctor suggested I may need to go to the ER. The next morning on Saturday I felt worse and experienced more vomiting so I headed to the ER. They admitted me and after 5 days in the neuro ICU and a round of every test they could run, the final diagnosis was (or it seemed like their best guess) was viral meningitis. I ve now been home from the hospital for three weeks and still do not feel well. Additionally, I have seen a neuro-opthalmologist specialist that agrees with the diagnosis. She reviewed the results of the lumbar puncture as well as conducted a round of tests, and she did not find any permanent damage and believes the double vision is post-viral. I still have headaches and feel like I am slightly dizzy and like I am in a bit of a fog. My neurologist says to rest, drink plenty of fluids and be patient; however, I am very depressed and worried that I am never going to feel well again. Also, the double vision is terrible...although the opthalmologist says it is normal for this to take up to several months to go away. Additionally, the neurologist says you are fortunate that you did not suffer a stroke, seizures, memory loss...and that you are walking and talking . While I am greatful that I did not suffer those things, I have not worked in 5 weeks and have no quality of life. The feeling of being in a fog is worse than the headaches. As soon as I get up and start moving around, I feel strange and feel like I should sit down. I am eating and drinking the fluids as the doctor suggested and resting all the time. Because I m not getting any real clear answers from the doctor, I have spent a lot of time reading articles on the Internet and I am very scared now. Most documentation out there says I should have been better in 7-10 days with Viral Meningitis; however, there are numerous stories of people that say their lives have never been the same and they were sick for months (some years)! At this point I don t know what to do. If I go to another Neurologist for a second opinion, I am pretty sure that my insurance will not cover an additional round of the same tests. The current Neurologist is at a loss other than doing a 3rd MRI - and the insurance company has not yet authorized.","Doctor":"Hi, I am Dr.Bruno.  I have read your question and understand your concerns. Let me try to help you Question : What causes dizziness and double vision after suffering from viral meningitis?Answer : Meningitis Causes Scarring (damage) of Sub arachnoid spaces. It is through these spaces blood vessels that carry blood to your brain stem travel Assume the Blood vessels as flexible pipes (or hoses) that carry water. What will happen if some stones are thrown over them. They will compress the flexible pipes. Isn' tit Same way Due to Meningitis, the areas around the blood vessels (Sub Arachnoid Spaces) are damaged. Hence they interfere with Blood Circulation to your brain stemThis causes dizziness and Double Vision Some Times, The Nerves can also be directly involved by the scarring (That is electric lines running along the pipes) Most of these cases will heal completely Anyhow, I would advise you to do another MRI after 4 weeks and compare both Hope you found the answer helpful.If you need any clarification / have doubts / have additional questions / have follow up questions, then please do not hesitate in asking again.

After reaching hospital for 15-20 mins he behaved very normally. Suddenly he got seizures, which lated for 30 seconds. The Doc immediatly gave him two shots and told us to sponging to reduce the tab. He further told us this kind of Febril seizure is common duing high fever. My question. 1. Earlier also my Son had high fever with 104 F temp but never had febril seizure. Was that due to any durg infection (as we gave him para the whole night and suddnely in the morning gave Meftal-P). 2. What could be the reason for sudden fever. Also note today morning we notice that a new teeth was comming. I am confused. Also advise on how to proceed further to know more about by Son s seizure. Many Thanks Gopinath M E-mail id: YYYY@YYYY and YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi, I am Dr.Bruno.  I have read your question and understand your concerns. Let me try to help you Question 1 : Earlier also my Son had high fever with 104 F temp but never had febril seizure. Was that due to any durg infection (as we gave him para the whole night and suddnely in the morning gave Meftal-P).Answer 1 : There are lots of factors which determine febrile seizures other than the temperature. So please don't get confused. Even with Temperature, the Rate of increase of temperature is more important than the actual temperature at the time of seizure. Question 2 : What could be the reason for sudden fever. Also note today morning we notice that a new teeth was comming. I am confused. Answer 2 : It can be a simple viral fever. If the fever has settled by now, you need not worry. If the fever is continuing, you have to do some investigations Question 3 : Also advise on how to proceed further to know more about by Son s seizure. Answer 3 : Just give him Sponging with Ice Water and keep few cubes of Ice in his Axilla when he gets fever. Please don't hear to your parents of other seniors saying that Ice Water or Ice cubes will produce Cold. Seizures are more harmful than cold. You have to prevent them. So Always Ice Cold Water and Ice Cubes even when the temperature rises a bit Hope you found the answer helpful.If you need any clarification / have doubts / have additional questions / have follow up questions, then please do not hesitate in asking again.

Is Ponstan better that meftal SPAS ?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. These are called pre-menstrual / menstrual tensions, and this is very rare at the age of 50 years. To me it looks to be more of pre-menopausal changes wherein the patient's response to hormonal changes is severe. Rarely this can be due to increase in congestion in pelvic area, suggestive of pelvis inflammatory disease.I would suggest to have recheck of thyroid status , may be we need to modulate the dose of thyroid medicine which may help to improve the symptoms. Also to go for female hormone estimations on day one of pain.Another suggestion would be to reduce salt intake just before the anticipated days of pain and/ or to take diuretic to flush out extra salt. May be there is a need to add an anxiolytic medicine. HRT if  your Gynecologist feels so. Meftal Spas has an additional medicine of dicyclomin (antispamodic). Taking Ponstan forte for a long time is not going to have any problem as I suppose she takes these only during the pains.There are some rare problems of inflammation of the muscles of the uterus, not easily diagnosed. Even you can think of Hysterectomy as a permanent treatment for this problem.Hope I have answered your query.

What s more, a load of muscular tension tends to be centered around that point, as well as a minor amount of swelling near the greater occipital nerves. (I ll add that I don t have all of the symptoms of occipital neuralgia--no burning or tingling.) My question is this: could an external occipital protuberance that s grown in such a way cause any amount of stress on the occipital nerves, therefore triggering a 24/7 low level headache? If you could please give your opinion, I m 21 and I m miserable--it was just an idea I ve had.","Doctor":"Hi, I am Dr.Bruno.  I have read your question and understand your concerns. Let me try to help you Question 1 : could an external occipital protuberance that s grown in such a way cause any amount of stress on the occipital nerves, therefore triggering a 24/7 low level headache?Answer 1 : No Hope you found the answer helpful.Now There is something that can cause a big External Occipital Protuberance as well as the headache you have mentioned It is constant stress and over action of your neck muscles The pain also will be relieved by nerve block So, From What You have told me, I think you are suffering from neck muscle fatigue I suggest you to 1. stop driving 2 wheelers 2.

First I will advise to take an MRI of the spine as to understand the soft tissue status. mentioning this is because you haven't mentioned in your history about this. As MRI of the lumbar spine plays a key role in understanding the status of the soft tissue.Also, on a later stages to talk further you were treated with symptomatic relief medicines , which will act to an extent. There need to undergo a physical therapy  as well. As the physical therapy is a non invasive by use of the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy for pain and inflammation. Also, the later stages will be to put you on exercises to strengthen the core muscles , spinal muscles, pelvic floor muscles and lower limbs as a whole. As the exercises are implemented as day to day basis the symptom of the pain subsides and later stages you can perform the exercises at home .In my clinical practice I have seen patients with similar complaints. After understanding the Neuromuscular assessment and MRI scan the physical therapy prescription is made to a single case to get the optimum results. by undergoing 12 weeks of proper physical therapy we are able to manage 99% of the strength.I recommend you the same.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have had back pain and been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease as well as stenosis of the spine. I am 37 and my pain began when I was 19. That s when i decided to get help the first time. The remedy and news were depressing that it won t get better. I have had a discectomy about 8 years ago and during rehab fractured a pedicule in the spine causing what honestly felt like lava flowing through the veins in my legs. It was extremely painful. After time that pain subsided as I healed but I have always had back pain. I haven t felt my left thigh for over 15 years now. I should also mention that I have also had recurring pilonidal cysts below my tailbone and I had the last surgery roughly 3 years ago and thankfully have not had one of those monsters since. However along with the normal (my normal) back pain and numbness in my left thigh I have been experiencing a sensation as if I were sitting on a cell phone on vibrate. It is fairly consistent for the past couple of weeks and there is no additional pain. I am currently prescribed zubsolv as it helps to keep my mind off the pain I have and does not give me the bad side effects of pain killers like oxymorphone. I am more active than I was from age 25 to 35 but I am still overweight even after losing 85lbs. Is my degeneration or stenosis getting worse now that I am more active? I am a delivery driver for the past year and in addition to carrying 20-30lbs I also am in and out of a car 30-40 times a day. Any advice you can give me would be most appreciated! Thank you for your time and compassion. I hope you are well.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As mentioned you still have pain, tingling and numbness in the thigh which is troubling you, also further you have a spinal stenosis and disc degeneration, it is sad to hear you had it as a very early age.a thoroguh neuromuscular assessment is advised.Also, in your case what I feel is the weakness of the muscles which are not able to stabilize the spine. You need a thorough and deep assessment of the muscles of the spine as by which how to handle your case will assist us further. Also, may be your hip muscles will be weaker as, the hip muscles act as a base of support to the spinal column the strength in the hip muscles is of due importance. Also, stabilizing the spine with cores stability is of due importance. Also to understand that only spinal muscles strengthening is not the concern here, here the concern is to see the body as one unit and rehabilitate as a whole. Also, the Strengthening of the pelvic floor , hip muscles, core muscles , lower limb muscles and on later stages the spinal muscles will surely make the body as one unit.I have seen cases of lumbar disc degenerative disease when patient was 16 years old. but applying the correct exercise prescription helped him back to action without aches and pain.I will recommend you to undergo a proper assessment and then a physcial therapy as working out behind you will be a tough task but not an impossible one. Slow and steady wins the race.I hope to see you recover soon.regardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My friend had a massive stroke 3 weeks and 1 day ago.

Today I ve felt a few of the same sensations on my upper lip on the right side. My ankles feel tight and my right hand feels heavy. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to different causes: - a cervico-thoracic column disorder, leading to nerve and radicular compression. - electrolytes imbalances (calcium, potassium, magnesium)- anxiety could also mimic all  this clinical situation- multiple sclerosisI would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a careful physical examination. Depending on the physical exam further tests may be needed: -a brain MRI study in case of suspicions of central neurvous system disorders.- a nerve conduction study in case of suspicion of peripheral nerve disease, including nerve compression and neuropathy.- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, fasting glucose, PCR, sedimentation rate, thyroid hormone levels)  would also help exclude other causes.

I feel like we re close to figuring something out, but I think she needs an impartial opinion. For years, she has been weak and shaky, nauseated often and has had pain in joints and ribs which has been treated successfully sometimes with a prednisone taper. She spends most of her time in bed or in a recliner Lately the pain in the ribs (front and back) has been pretty steady and her upper legs have been achy and sore to the point that she can t do anything and is sensitive to the touch. The other thing that has come up recently is that she has fainted a minute or two after getting up and moving around. She has other problems but all of these seem connected and come and go somewhat cyclically together. She was previously treated for Arnold Chiari syndrome and currently takes Cymbalta, Neurontin, a small amount of time release morphine for some of these pains. She is currently wearing a heart monitor to see if that is related to her fainting but she has fainted with it on and hasn t had any calls for concern from the monitor company.

Pn has progressively worsened over last 4 mo. First onset of pn (4 mo) only occurred upon orgasm. Assumed I had some sort of orgasm induced neuralgia, but it continued to worsen in severity and began happening with other types of movements. Went to PCP and ruled out any heart issues. Currently, I am experiencing constant burning and achy (more so) L sided, but overall unilateral neck and occipital pn. That, I can manage with NSAID’s. Any movement type activity requiring pushing, pulling, lifting (straining) immediately triggers heavy, vise grip, pressurized, spasming, and throbbing type pn; simultaneously which cannot be managed with NSAID’s. I am able to keep the pn from worsening by quickly grabbing an ice cube and vigorously rubbing it on my neck and base of skull, but this does not reduce pn. I have also discovered that applying pressure between spinous processes in same area as HNP alleviates the pn by over half, but only while applying pressure. My L cervical region ROM has decreased and muscle soreness with burning has significantly increased during this time despite stretching, massage, stem, physical therapy, accupuncture, trigger point injections, heat/ice rotation, etc. These modalities do not help even though I ve used them frequently and some make symptoms worse. There is no significant arm or hand pn, numbness/tingling, or weakness, although, R trap is partially numb and R medial scapula (dermatome) tingles almost constantly. Assuming this is from hypertonic muscles reacting to the continued pn cycle? The neurosurgeon I saw on 08/08/14 stated he was not impressed by my symptoms based on MRI and referred me to a pn clinic for epidural steroid injection. I elected to forego that procedure. I do not want Sx or any invasive Tx unless absolutely necessary. I do want to get some answers so I can get my life back and return to work. I appreciate any thoughts and/or advice on options for me to seek.","Doctor":"Hi, I am Dr.Bruno and Let me answer your query.Based on the symptoms you have narrated 1. worsen in severity and began happening with other types of movements2. constant burning and achy (more so) L sided, but overall unilateral neck and occipital pn. 3.

I will recommend to undergo physical therapy like - Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. This will help to reduce the pain. Also, you will be put into the exercises for the lumbar spine and cervical spine. The overall body conditioning will also be performed. Based on the improvements you will be assessed and moved further for the exercises which will be focus on strengthening. As to understand here is - your age is 71 and the ageing process is on. So there will be a wear and tear of the tissues. also, by taking medication or the cortisone the symptomatic relief will be good but also, post the symptomatic relief you need to undergo physical therapy.In my personal practice of dealing with geriatrics we induce protocol only taking to rest, medication and physical therapy. We found a 99% success rate.Also, to confirm the extent of the soft tissue Injury which is compressing the nerve roots , an MRI can be performed which will help further the physician for the medical prescription.Your indulgence in the exercises will be of importance as the muscles at this age needs strength for the propulsion of the body.with physical therapy the patients which I see are benefitted. and I expect same from you.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have lower back pain mostly only on lower left side .I have had hip pain the last week and now fence noticed a 6 once cluster of ti y broken capillaries in middle of lower back .the back pain is very bothersome a 6 or so on pain scale I am on methadone and have been for 4 yrs.

Once medicine is induced in the body, the physical therapist role come into existence. On which by application of the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the pain is still taken into control. After that the major role comes is to strengthen the muscles. as muscles are the supporting structures of the spinal bones, the need to strengthen them is of due importance.Once the muscles of the core, pelvic Floor, spinal muscles and hip muscles become stronger the pain is under control. You can perform the exercises at home as it is needed in chronic stages to control the pain in longer run.In my clinical practice I assist patient with three step therapy.- rest- Medication- physical therapy.Apparanlty we have 100% success rate of controlling the back pain and avoid future recurrence.I wish the good health for you.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"hello sir,how can i get rid of disease like FITS.. is their is any permanent cure for this................ it keeps with me last 5 yrs.. n fits attack happens on wen i used to sleep...... plz advice wat to do........... i prefer all medical consideration","Doctor":"Thank you for asking Healthcare majic.

They are often accompanied beforehand as a cold leg pain which moves up her spinal cord to the head just before she enters these sleeping phases. They are more likely to happen during the afternoon/evening, but not in the morning. At other times she appears normal. Tests so far have ruled out a heart or blood pressure, or ear and nose problem, and many blood tests have not found anything. She has yet to see a Neurologist.Can you possibly advise what the problem may be as we are (and our own GPs) are running out of ideas.","Doctor":"HelloI am Dr Mittal.I have read your query.I think I can help you.The symptoms of your daughter are quite suggestive of 2 possibilities. I would feel that she has either a Complex partial seizure with secondary generalization. Another possibility is restless leg syndrome.Considering the information given in the query, I am more inclined to the former.Now this is quite a specific information that the symptoms start in the leg and gradually progress up the body. It seems to indicate the involvement of what is known as the homunculus, or representation of the body in the brain.I therefore feel that a MRI of the brain, and an EEG would help her significantly in getting to the diagnosis. A video EEG would be more helpful than a plain EEG.In case it does turn out to be seizure disorder, good medicines are now available for seizures.However, since the medicines do have side effects, I would not suggest tsarting them till a complete evaluation by a neurologist and the completion of the above tests.I have tried my best to make it as simple as possible.Please feel free to contact us for more information.Best of luck,Dr Mittal"},{"Patient":"Be been having pains around my belly for like a week and a half, my last bleed was a few weeks ago but it had a brown discharge with little bleeding, but when I would put a tampon in the bleeding would get worse.

Almost 3 weeks ago I felt an odd sensation on my left shoulder and after poking it a little I realized it was numb. It felt weird but didn t affect my day. The next day it was still there with no change until about 8:00pm where it started radiating from the patch on my shoulder, feeling like ice water was being poured over me. My entire left side was numb from head to toe, mouth and tongue included. Went to an ER and they ruled out stroke. But my whole body was going numb still. My reflexes and vision and strength are fine. The numbness gets worse after I fall asleep at night and wakes me frequently.

He has been recently discharged from hospital and brought home and is bedridden. He was walking and doing his chores some 30 days back when he suddenly started hallucinating and falling. During hospital admission he was found to have some delirium, acute constipation, lack of orientation but had no tremors. His heart, blood, urine , X-ray, MRI and USG (Abdomen) reports were okay and doctors were very hopeful that with physiotherapy he will walk again. Accordingly, after discharge, I am giving him care, prescribed medication and physiotherapy at home. He has now following problems:- (a) Passing green stools, (b) Unable to walk and has to be assisted by two persons. His left leg seems weeker and accordingly right step wobbles left and front of left leg, (c) Orientation has returned and irrelevant talks have reduced. He had a brief episode of non-physical aggression (unlike before when he was physical and longer lasting). I want to know how can I help him to walk again and if it is correct that he can walk? His medication is Syndopa 110 TDS, Fludrocortisone 1mg OD, Metoprolol XL 50 mg OD, Urimax 0.4mg OD, Shelcal 500mg OD, Pantocid 40mg OD, Amantidine 100mg BD, Donepezil 5mg OD, Pramipexole 0.25 mg HS, Folic Acid OD, Capsule Autrin BD, TAb Escitalopram 10mg HS, Losartan 50mg BD and Quetiaprine 25mg + 50mg BD.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your father.As you mentioned he is having idiopathic Parkinson disease it is possible that the reason is unknown. But as per my knowledge of understanding, since you mentioned his age as 80 years, it is ageing related process which is stopping him from being comfortable. I have seen Parkinson cases and been providing physical therapy to them at doorsteps. Focussing on each and every aspect of the patient is very important and I was able to cope up well with recovery of them.Usually, medication and physical therapy are The support system to the patients. For my patients I use to provide the oxygen therapy as to help their metabolic function to be at optimum. Oxygen is the primary source of energy required for the cells to recover and function normally.Along with exercise the use of oxygen has added an advantage of the physical therapy I provided since the oxygen helps the neural tissues to be functioning well. Also, exercises are a must to improve the metabolism and the drug absorption.as continued reading the history , I could understand that the condition is progressive, so as to control the progression the absorption of the drug along with the physcial therapy has to be on the coordinated. I usually discuss with the physician and discuss about the dosages from time to time. Keeping an close connection between the patient, physical therapist and the physician helps to plan the rehabilitation process.Also, as you mentioned in the history of the green stools, it is possible of having any bacterial infection which needs correction.Helping the patient walk as much as possible with support if required will help to induce the cardio workout as well. Never means that patient has to walk longer distance. walk short distances with increased frequency helps alot.I have a descent success in the ageing patients who have suffered with Parkinson. I am sure your dad will recover once the bodys physiological system takes the role above all. once the physiology supports the absorption of the drug and confidence is created within the self, then walking will come faster. Needs only a patience and a humble care.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am a 60 year old female who has been having trouble feeling unbalanced. This has resulted in me having a concussion. On the most recent fall I broke two ribs and a third one has a hairline fracture. I can tell when these episodes are coming on so I have been able to hide it. I don t want to hide this I want to know why this is happening.","Doctor":"hi,as you mentioned you are 60 and having frequent falls due to balance issue. Then consulting a neurologist will be help, also he may ask for an MRI of the brain, as there needs to be checked out something if going pathologically dysfunctional.As most patients when fall into ageing there will be cerebellum dysfunction. As the demand of the body is high in maintaining the coordination and balance. also , with the help of the Neurological assessment it will come close to the actual cause of the balance and coordination problems.Once you are done with an MRI and Neurological assessment, you may be onto some medicine and also on a physical therapist.the physical therapist will teach how to learn the balancing activity and also to avoid falls.Also with age there is mass reduction in the strength of the Musculoskeletal system which needs an attention as falls might be dangerous at this age due to degenerative changes in the bone.Fracture are not good at this age , as the pain bearing capacity gets reduced and also the recovery time is delayed.by doing physical therapy the brain again learns the balance and coordination functions which allows to reduce the number of falls and also improve the overall health at this age.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recoveryregardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My husband has chronic MM and CIDP.

I will say, that initially the metabolism of the system allowed the flow of the plasmapheresis. From third onwards it made it little difficult for time being.

Like, physical exercise which are in general performed to help imporve the cellular mechanism. exercises improve the metabolic activity of the cellular system and allows the optimum absorption of the drug. Also while having a good absorption of the drug , there is a chance of having optimum improvements.I will advice to look for performing regular breathing exercises and general body exercises to boost the metabolism and immune system for the better absorption of the drug.I hope that your husband will surely respond to the exercises and drug later-on. you can discuss the same with the physician.with the grace of God I wish your husband a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"I had surgery on my right wrist to remove a burning cyst, the Dr. said that because my thumb and fore finger were numb that removing it would not give me back my feeling in my thumb and fore finger.

I am wondered that why haven't you tried physical therapy. as physical therapist have something called the sensory integration techniques which adds on some improvements in patients with sensory dysfunction. also to mention, that sensory system is a complex system to under stand treat with. It is totally depending upon how the body's cellular mechanism is formed and moving. also, by undergoing the sensory integration techniques followed by physical therapist will possibly help you further. but the formation of the network between the sensory system and the brain is totally depending upon how the body is reacting to the sensory input.Also, you have a spinal disc degenerative changes, for which the strengthening the muscles of the cervical spine needs an alert. Also by doing simple neck exercises the compression from the nerve is released. Also to make use of breathing exercises helps for strengthening the accessory muscles of respiration, as these muscles also provide support to the neck to hold the head onto it.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"I am having tingly arms and legs which sometimes become aching.

And I keep getting horrible headaches, earaches, toothaches which the dentist hasn t found anything, are they related to the cord compression?","Doctor":"hi,as you mentioned about the C5 & C6 disc degeneration disc disease, the muscles supplied by them usually gets involved. Also due to continuously stress applied onto the muscles of the neck, the muscles of the neck are always in a state of tension which leads to the disturbed blood flow to the brain and there by leads to headache and other symptoms. Getting treated for the pain and spam in the neck region will help you ease of the symptoms like headache, earaches and toothaches. Also getting checked by a dentist for the toothache will clear any doubt about the pathology of the oral cavity. for the disc degeneration in the C & C6 region I advice to take therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy which will alter the pain and spasm. Also performing regular strengthening exercises for the neck, upper limb and shoulder will help you ease of sysmotoms. Usually along with the medicine, physical therapy plays a good benefits. I have personal experience of cases with such symptoms and 99% of patients recover. I am hoping the same with you.

My cases with similar cases have responded well as the implementation of the therapy was divided into short term and long term goals . it is ofcourse time consuming but if the patient indulges 100% then the results are excellent.Also you should do regular breathing exercises and meditation. with the combination of these two an added feature of control of the mind and good oxygen in the body helps to heal most of the pains and aches. oxygen is the primary fuel for the functioning of the cellular mechanism.For more details you can ask me a direct question.With the grace of God I wish you a good health.Regards.Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Good morning, my father was admitted in Care hospital, Hyderabad on Saturday evening for stroke like symptoms and has been there in ICU since then.

I would ask the doctor to refer you to a neurologist with experience in sleep medicine in order to do a good thorough workup.  Your weight alone is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea which is a strong risk factor toward insomnia.  What if that were the problem?  Or at least 1 of the problems?  Secondly, I would get a set of laboratory studies to rule out other potential issues that could lead to your not being able to get to sleep or stay asleep.  These things I would do ahead of any medication which has already proven not to be the ultimate solution.

I am sorry to hear that at this age she had to undergo so much pain and aches. without wasting time, as you told she had a fall, and post that only this blackness on her forehead though it is a month old injury. I think she had a fall and internal bleeding , that is the reason of the black spot and swelling. Usually any swelling should come by a maximum of week or so.

Radiology and laboratory helps us to come close to the tissue abnormality. but there are certain things which are not under the control of the control of human limits.let's try to see if something you can compensate by doing exercises.exercises will helo regain the strength in the body and improve your metabolism. Exercises can help you get rid of the symptoms and also, you can learn more about the coordination exercises as it will help you improve alot in your functionality.since CT and MRI are not able to trace what is the problem it can be the balancing the neuromuscular functioning. which can be made by performing exercises.you can try doing certain thingsmeditationbreathing exercisesyogaphysical therapy (exercises)I had a case where this things have worked for my patients and now it's all fine and healthy life.for more questions you can ask me directlywith the grace of God I wish you a good health.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Last menstrual period start January first having abdominal pain and lower rob pain went to ER yesterday, hcg level of 276 had vaginal and abdominal ultrasound that showed cysts on ovaries and small amount of fluid in cul de sac no intrauterine pregnancy I have had no bleeding should I be concerned that it is ectopic still?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCm. Thanks for the query. This is very unlikely since hcg leveles would be much higher and embyo would already be detectable with ultarsound. Your pain can be caused by cysts and especially ruptured cyst which could explain fluid in cul de sac. so this is the first thing to think of. but if pain persist you should visit gynaecologist again.Wish you good health.

Please help me just so I know what direction to go,.","Doctor":"hi,thanks for providing the brief history of your son.since you mentioned he had anemia issue and later he had lot of Respiratory issues as well.I think from my end this might have disrupted the metabolism and immune system which is giving him skim irritation over the spinal region. since the skin tissue near the spinal region is a bit thin and can get trouble easily.I can recommend that you could get your son do regular breathing exercises and physical activities. usually at certain times exercise can help improve the metabolism and immune system. once the immune system and metabolic system is balanced the chances for the skin bruises will be reduced. as for the betterment of the tissue functioning the oxygen is the major source as well.whatever medical could do with all things they are already trying. now you can focus in the natural way of improving the internal metabolism of body.certain times medical is directed towards the symptomatic and they help the best but at the end of every thing the human body is its own boss. and for making the body function better only need is to improve the metabolism and cellular functioning which can be developed by doing regular physcial activity.if any more information on metabolic exercises you can ask me.regardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am 83 year old male .

The pain itself is note gone, neither before surgery of course, but nor after it (totally gone). Could you please tell me if I can send you my MRI result? To know,it is a right diagnosis or not?

Any comparative study at this point will be of great help.along with pain killer if your Surgeon wish to prescribe you can go ahead with it. also you need to now totally focus onto the physical therapy only. As reoperating the same level again as per my thinking will not give any benefit.the physical therapist will help you firs with therapeutic ultrasound therapy which will lose the scar tissue in the back.later on the use of TENS will be symptomatic and as per the need.the physical therapist may apply the myofascial release of the spinal muscle spasm. which will help to get some mobility of the spine.now moving ahead you need to under go a strong rehabilitation plan. as you core should become like 8 packs but over a period of time and with the limits of you physiological pain.you will even need to strengthen the spinal muscles to get the intervertebral disc space back to release the compression on the nerves.post that strength conditioning has to be planned as the body functions as a unit. Strength conditioning will help the unit to function in equilibrium which will be of great input.I have seen the cases like this and all have responded well with pre planned and graded rehabilitation process.also to mention that it is slow and steady but gradually you may get to see the difference.I have myself treated cases with 99% of success rate. now Its my luck or the effort of the patient that he recovered but I have 99% scorecard.the one who kept patience all recovered even with an abnormal MRI my patient can climb 13 floos in 100 seconds without a pause.well to cut down the story and come to help you, please organize physical therapy and get treated.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"Hello, my daughter just had a thoracic peritoneal shunt inserted in her spine due to a spinal cord tumor she was diagnosed back in 2011. she now does not after any feeling to her left leg although she can move her toes she has no feeling whatsoever.

Don't take me wrong but I am just trying to figure out if any viral infection from the animal bad led to a sudden pain in the back and abdomen.also you have mentioned that he was cycling 15kms, BP, HR etc was all normal, it is never a sure that how a humam body reacts and behaves from time to time. so if the parameters are normal that doesnt mean always that the person may not have other symptoms. don't take me wrong on this statement of mine. I spend more time with geriatric patients aged between 60-100 so I have little understanding of the physical status and fluctuations of parameters which can misguide.since now the patient is paralyzed as per you mentioned in the history. is he totally paralyzed or half? what is the disability score of the patient?now looking to the treatment plan with the scenario to keep in mind I will request you to first make an arrangement of a physiotherapist who can help him by regular exercises ofcourse it will be passive and may help him to recover. also you should see that there is no formation of pressure sores of any infection to the patient. because that will directly affect the  metabolism and immune system of the body.if you can provide more inputs or give a detailed history of the patient from the time of arising of symptoms and till date I will be able to comment something. my mail and number will be available in the forum for which you can contact me.

Thanks","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.since you mentioned this all aches started after going to gym then the mechanism of injury is the impact to the spinal muscles.first let me begin with this. for going to gym many people avoid the 3 basic steps as per me.1. clearance from a cardiologist2. clearnace from a Orthopedic3. clearance from a neurologist.now many people wonder why I say to meet three people before going to gym .well, the answer is here and common for all irrespective of the age.1. the cardiologist has to give cardiac clearance for undergoing cardiac training as anything unknown can be traced and help the individual perform better in a gym.2. the orthopedic has to check the bony or muscular issues if any is present. Once he asseses he will be able to say what should be done and what should be avoided. since most injuries in gym are muscular, soft tissue and bony. he may even guide to an physical therapist for rehabilitation exercise plan to undergo in gym.3. The role of a neurologist is to check your motor and sensory behaviour. if there is a lack of concentration and coordination there might be a chances of fall and landing the individual in a hospital.now coming to your case. as per the symptoms you mentioned it looks like you have a nerve entrapment. it may have occurred due to running on a treadmill as when you run on a treadmill you hit your heal hard to the hard surface beneath and that's where the Newton's third law comes - ever action has equal and opposite reaction. so the harder you hit your heal the harder the hit comes back. it will straight away travel upto the spine.This was just a simple example..coming to focus on your issue, I will request you to meet an orthopedic and get an MRI done to check any soft tissue or bony injuries in the lower back and neck region. as mentioned by you, it appears that you have a radiating symptoms of pain which is a appearing to be a soft tissue Damage and nerve entrapment. your orthopedic may advice you to undergo physical therapy sessions for the same. for which you should definitely try out. as the physcial therapist will re-asses you and figure out your physical capacity to undergo the stress and strain in future.also to mention , that you should first stop the gym and not ignore this symptoms.

May be the exercises you did till date was not specific or didn't turn to stabilize the spine.you have tried stretching, walking, pool exercises etc. since this have not work well you are getting more of the frustration.I will recommend you to meet a physical therapist and take some therapeutic ultrasound therapy along with it TENS therapy which will help to am extent. Also there needs to be a focused plan of rehabilitation by the physical therapist to break the pain pattern reception by the brain which can be done by modifying exercises at regular intervals with use of TENS therapy. As the medicine are symptomatic, and work only on the symptoms to an extent. but to increase the efficiency of the medicines you need to improve you metabolism. as based on the individual the metabolism varies alot. So your body has to produce the natural medicine to reduce  the pain.I have myself seen many patients with neuralgia and I have faced a good number of question and much more. But the rehabilitation plan was made with a great effort which suits patient to patient.also to mention, that once they pain turns into chronic the pain barrier has to be broken , until the pain barrier breaks it is tough to think further.for which I will recommend you to visit a physical therapist and take his opinion of helping you.also do regular breathing exercises and meditation as well.breathing exercises increases the blood carrying capacity of blood tissue and improves metabolism of the tissues and the body as a whole.meditation helps to control the mind and anytime when the brain is calm it takes a better decision and focus harder to any form of treatment and take best outcome.with the grace of God I wish you a good health."},{"Patient":"My husband is in the moderate stages of Alzheimers , and is having pain, numbness in his c-spine.

I forgot to mention the Physical therapist noticed while trying to work with me on the vestibular issues that I have a limited range of motion in my neck and the neck tends to want to pull back to the front when I try to turn it sideways, it also has a tremor when it does this. Hope this is enough information.","Doctor":"hi,thanks for providing the brief history of you.since you have symptoms like balance issues, pain, numbness,  restless etc we need to focus here on two aspects.one is the brain and the second is the spinal column.brain works on its own and the input of medicine is symptomatic to get help for the symptoms. also the MRI of the brain and spine will play a key role to your diagnosis and help for further.medicinal part will be played by consulting a specialist and then the non invasive was of dealing is the physical therapy.you can always meet a physcial therapist who will assess and guide the next course of plan by using TENS and exercises.why exercise again is to help boost the metabolism and come closer to the requirements of the tissue. it will even help for balance disorders, pain,  spondylosis etc.with the grace of God is wish you a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor Hope this email finds you well. I have an issue which is making me worry as I see no solution todate.I had an accident 2 years ago and injured T8.We went to india to have it repaired and according to the doctor it was successful.The doctor assured us that the spinal code was not damaged only inflammation which they decompressed. They told me that the nerves will take time to grow and might take 18-24 months.Its now 2yrs since the operation and the best result I have is feeling my stomach. I still have no bladder control.My legs tend to move involuntarily as I have no feeling of them and sometimes they really jump when my nails are cut.Due to this I had to see a neurologist last week. In our town its very difficult to get a neurologist. This one comes once in a month.He examined my belly and legs and said the growth is now upto T12. He gave me some muscle relaxers and when I informed him if there is any nerve growth medicines he said its better if it heels by itself instead of interfering with the normal body mechanism. No other test was done to me.As you know this is a worrying situation for me and its getting me worried Would like some advice from your goodself if there is any thing can be done. Thanking you in advance and hope am not a bother. Msellem Hamoud","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing a brief history of your illness.Since you mentioned you have met an accident and injured the T8 level spinal column area and the neurosurgeon have decompressed it. Understanding the scene here is you are a bit annoyed by the bladder control, movement of legs and abnormal sensation. Now since its been 2 years and a much done onto for your good till date by all specialists. Help is always an inch away and doctors are always here to help.I wish to know if you have tried doing physiotherapy, if not than you should start it again. As the surgery was successful the later part was to take the regular medicines and regular physiotherapy.Bladder control exercises are known to a physiotherapist which he can teach you and brain always tends to keep learning. Now since you are looking here with some remedy for you, i would say that the doctors have done a great job till date, now you have to put a conscious effort to undergo a physiotherapy session and get yourself helped. Physiotherapy is not only about exercise but even about the deeper science behind it. All things done till now by doctors was excellent, now the body has to produce some internal medicine which has to make a help. Symptomatic help was done at the best. Now its the body turn to produce the requirements.I have seen many patients with such injuries and on the later side of the years are helped by a physiotherapist and things have turn on a positive side for many.Kindly try to undergo physiotherapy and make the body metabolic system to take the next charge. Its never easy to get back on but its never impossible to become better again.with the grace of almighty i wish you a positive outcome soon."},{"Patient":"There are numerous cerebral white matter lesions with a configuration consistent with demyelination.

Could these outburst be seizure related? He does not remember the outburst or what he was mad at. He has ADHD,PPD-nos, ptsd.","Doctor":"The party line about neurologists/epileptologists has always been that directed aggressive or violent behavior with the intent to intent or hurt someone was NEVER seizure related and was assumed psychiatric.  However, now there is ample evidence that such events do happen as a result of massive aberrant electrical discharges in the Frontotemporal regions of the brain and patients can do very specific bizarre, complex, and even violent acts with the intent to hurt or destroy property.  Amnesia for the event is virtually universal in the patient and is usually a clue to its validity or not.  Multidisciplinary approaches must be used in such cases otherwise the patient will never gain any trust in anybody at school and in fact, could develop fears and anxiety syndromes if they cannot be made to be feel welcome in the midst of teachers of classmates.

One afternoon he also experienced light-headedness, slurred speech and mildly impaired motor function on his right side. One of his colleagues rushed him to the emergency room of a nearby hospital where blood pressure, blood gases, electrolytes, and an ECG were run. His blood pressure was 195/100 mm Hg, which he said was typical of what he had experienced during the past two years. Blood gases and electrolytes were normal. The ECG showed no arrhythmias but did demonstrate a left axis deviation. The gentleman was admitted to the hospital and a cerebral angiogram was performed which showed left cerebral hemorrhaging. 1. What is the diagnosis of this individual s disorder? 2. What are the major contributing factors to this disorder? 3. What could have been done to prevent this problem? 4. What are the early warning symptoms prior to the complication? 5. Why did the ECG show a left axis deviation? 6. Why was there impaired motor function on the right side from cerebral hemorrhaging on the left side?","Doctor":"hi,as you mentioned the symptoms it looks like the patient had an early stroke. During the brain stroke every single minute is important. Stroke can be assessed by experiencing the slurred speech, slowing of Motor functions, unable to respond to commands. the first thing need is to get admit to a near by hospital with a CT or an MRI facility. If the brain stroke is on the left side on the CT or MRI scan than the symptoms will be on the opposite side due to the pyramidal tracts of the nervous system. The design of the human body and it's control system by nature is made such that left side of the brain support the right side of the body. once stroke comes rushing into and emergency room is always advised. within 3 hours of the first symptom noticed is of priority and importance. Any delay in every minute will damage the brain more. as the blood supply to the brain is restricted by the clot and the damage to the neural tissues keeps continuing. So as soon as one notices the symptoms the earliest you should reach to the emergency room and start the treatment. Well, what could have lead to stroke will be the high blood pressure findings are in common. ECG can be normal can be abnormal . ECG is done to rule out certain factors and focus the whole treatment plan on the brain stroke. that is the reason the ECG is always taken. Brain Stoke can be confined by symptoms and later my MRI or a CT scan. post stroke if the physical disability is found then a physical therapist is taken into consideration Alon with the medication prescribed by the neurologist and the cardiologist. if patient has diabetes than a diabetologist should be contacted for the medical part.

I carefully passed through your medical history and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to fibromyalgia. Vertigo in your situation can be related an inner ear disorder, or a low blood flow to the brain (possibly caused by narrowing of the posterior circulation or vertebral arteries). Your actual symptoms do not seem to be related to the past episode of vertigo. A metabolic disorder or depression could be related to your actual symptomatology. I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a resting ECG- Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries- some blood lab tests (complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction, cortisol plasma levels, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, blood lipid profile). A electromyography would help exclude possible myastenic syndrome as your symptoms seem to worsen during the night. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Meanwhile, I would recommend performing a lot of physical activity (walking, yoga, swimming), which can be helpful in case of depression.

Yes it is possible for the vaccines to have side effects for upto 5 to 7days after the shot (depending on the type of meningitis gites vaccine).

This does not rule out the possibility of the shot causing these symptoms. It is,  however,  better to have it looked at especially if it worries you and continues for more than 2 days. Try to keep her head slightly elevated with a pillow. Change is posture (lying down to standing) should be done gradually to avoid sudden pressure changes to the head which cause headaches.

Dehydration can cause you inner ear fluid to thicken (induces vertigo)  can increase the concentration of your stomach fluids (gastritis, nausea), can concentrate urine (stones, infection). As you are on medications,  added effect or side effects also need to be considered. Blood pressure medications work either by removing water from your body, or by relaxing the muscles in your blood vessels that cause dilation. When this occurs in the presence of dehydration, symptoms occur or may be worse. Please check with your physician before taking any new medications. Atosol (if I understand right) contains caffeine and codeine both of which can counteract the effect of your blood pressure medication. It is important to find do out the cause of your symptoms. You may require. Some dose adjustment.  If it turns out to be dehydration,  increased water intake (amount as suggested by your doctor) as sips throughout the day will help. Avoid going out when it is too hot,  wear breathable material clothes. Have fresh juice and take cool baths. Dizziness is always better to be examined and the exact cause found. Hope this helps.

For 6 weeks I had half a skull because they took the other half because my head got so swollen. There was alott of blood from my brain an I am now home doing better every day. I was wondering if I could smoke healthily so I helps the pain. I did great in therapy and can do everything I used to do please answer this for me most doctors never give me a actual answer .. Thank you","Doctor":"Thank you for your query. No Smoking please! Smoking has harmful effects and more harmful effects. It does not cure the pain. It just masks it up. There are healthy optiosn to relieve pain. Medications, yoga, meditation, and alternative medicine. If pain is severe/acute, non addictive medications are advised for a long term use I  additional  to other methods mentioned above. All of it is worth trying as these are healthy and side effects free methods (except for pain  medication). Smoking has a harmful effect and sometimes irreversible effect on many organs and body functions. I appreciate that you sought advice before acting on it.  I would greatly appreciate it if you sought other ways (as mentioned above) to get pain relief.  The fact that you almost back to your usual self is excellent news.

Would you please clarify a few things for me? 1)how old are you -  above 40yrs? Are you overweight? Are you male? 2)do you smoke? Any history of heart disease,  diabetes hypertension, hyperlipidemia? 3)any family history of heart disease? 4)have you had any surgeries or injury to your chest, shoulder or neck? 5)sedentary lifestyle or any heavy weight training? Your symptoms indicate underlying cardiac (heart) pathology. When there is reduced/compromised blood flow to the heart, it can lead to a variety of symptoms like chest pain/discomfort,  sweating,  palpitations (the feeling of your heart racing or pounding), numbness/pain  along the jaw,  left side of neck, left arm and if the flow is compromised outside the heart (like the vessel that supplies blood to the legs)., these symptoms can occur in your  leg as well. Cervical (neck area) vertebrae spondylosis (narrowing of disc space between two adjacent vertebrae that cause pressure to the nerves exiting the area) can result in numbness along one side of the body (commonly). I recommend you see your physician. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment  will enable quick recovery and prevent complications. Bloating basically occurs when there is excessive gas formation in the stomach,  bowels, and can occur due to improper dietary habits, poor circulation and certain medicines. Hope this helps..

He seems to experience slight dissorientation, and slight issues with answering basic questions. This has happened only twice, about a year apart in occurence. Both times he was slightly sick with a common cold about 2 weeks prior to the occurence. We have contacted a nurse who suggested that it may be his way of reacting to stress, however he claims that he was not at all stressed before the event. She has told us not to take him to the hospital but instead to simply try breathing exercises. It takes 10-20 minutes or so for the paralysis and numbness to fade. He seems perfectly healthy and energetic all the rest of the time, and has had no past injuries that may have led to brain or spinal cord damage. He now claims he had a headache before the event and it has continued. He also shows aggrivation and fustration, however I m not sure if he would be acting like that anyway or if it has something to do with whatever this is.

Some changes of this kind happen to all of us over the years, the older you are the most likely to be found. In some people these changes can be more pronounced due to genetic factors, trauma, heavy physical work etc.As for what needs to be done, for the moment only physical therapy and over the counter antiinflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen are recommended.

I have read your question and understand your concerns.A ruptured brain aneurysm should be treated by surgery ( clipping) or by endovascular embolisation (coiling), because re-bleeding could be catastrophic.If the aneurysm is closed by these measures there is no risk of re-bleeding.Since there was infection (Pseudomonas right?), first there is need to treat it by using antibiotics according to antibogram culture results.If your mother is allergic to penicillin, she could not use it or other penicillin related antibiotics.The treatment of the aneurysm should be done after the infection is treated successfully and confirmed by blood tests.Till then, control of blood pressure between normal ranges is necessary to avoid re-bleeding.Hope you found the answer helpful.Greetings."},{"Patient":"My wife experienced profuse sweating, tingling in arms, hands and feet along with the fingers contracting to themselves. Massaging gave some relief but when I elevated her arms above her head for several minutes, she had major relief. Can you help us understand what is happening?","Doctor":"Brief Answer:Most likely cervical Radiculopathy causing compression of nerves of neck spine and require MRI scan.Detailed Answer:Warm Welcome. I appreciate your trust in HCM and assure you are on best portal on the globe for expert online medical services.I have thoroughly reviewed health query you raised, and well realize all of those concerns. Being your physician, I will take care all of them today and will extend my expertise to solve the problems.There are some deficiencies in your information regarding your age and occupation but I shall be able to throw some light on the condition your wife might be experiencing.She is most likely experiencing a condition known as cervical radiculopathy. This affect the nerves of neck spine (also called cervical spine)Based on age of your wife, she might have herniated disc in cervical spine (young) or degenerative osteoarthritis where spur is compressing the nerve. Patient usually does heavy labour and lifting. Due to compression of nerves, your wife is experiencing tingling and numbness in arms which typically improve by raising the arm. This worsen at night and usually hand is placed on head to relief.If I were your treating physician, I would first order an MRI can to look for the cause. MRI can show in detail look of spine and help in managing the patient. We regularly prescribe medications that improve the symptoms. Diclofenac K 50mg two times per day and pregabalin 75mg two times per day can be helpful in tingling and pain. These should be used for 10 days. Your wife also requires physiotherapy which will aid in improving condition.Hope I addressed all the concerns you have. Let me know if you have further questions. I will be more than happy to clear any doubts. For any disease you have, a timely follow-up is necessary regarding the treatment efficacy and to see if there is a need to change treatment options. So keep a follow up to see how you doing.Regards!Dr. Ali Raza"},{"Patient":"I was hit several times on the right side of my head.

I told the doctor but she didn t say what is causing it","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!It is common to have noise in the ears after a head concussion. But sometimes this noise, especially when mimics the heart rhythm (pulsatile tinitus) can be caused by an intracranial arterio-venous communication also called dural fistula. I would recommend performing a brain MRI to exclude this possibility. If the brain MRI results normal, there is nothing to worry about. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"10 weeks ago I had a concussion. First MRI showed normal while 2nd MRI showed a spot on the putuitary gland which I was told possible benign tumor. I am confused why the first report is normal while the 2nd is now showing this spot. I am still having the dizziness and headaches while starting to feel a little muscle weakness in my upper body with a lot of fatigue. What would be my options?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern.I imagine you are a little irritated of it not having been diagnosed on first MRI. One explanation might be that the 2nd MRI unlike the 1st included contrast administration and that evidenced the tumor. Contrast sequences aren't always done, not considered necessary for a concussion. Also there are some special sequences for pituitary gland and they are done only when there is a clinical suspicion not for concussion evaluation.Another explanation may be simply that it was missed. When the radiologist evaluates the MRI he pays more attention to certain things depending on indication and pituitary gland is not an area commonly involved by trauma, so small things may have been missed if one doesn't look specifically for them.As for what to do that depends on whatt effect does that tumor have. Pituitary gland produces many hormones so now lab test for hormonal levels is necessary. Afterwards depending on hormonal level alterations and whether the tumor causes any compression to surrounding structures a decision will be made whether to consider surgery or follow up and medication.I remain at your disposal for other questions."},{"Patient":"had a acdf 10 weeks ago having pretty much the same symptoms i began with. numbness and tingling down left arm also left ear ringing and buzzing feeling down legs to feet mostly left side also travels burning sensations down chest to thighs and calves . call dr going to schedule mri again","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. As you have had ACDF 10 weeks before and similar symptoms have recurred, it might be due to compression at same level. This has happened due to: Displacement of graft or cage - It can happen after ACDF if proper fusion and compression over graft are not present. It leads to displacement of graft or cage and compression over cord/nerve.It can be confirmed by CT cervical spine and MRI of cervical spine. CT is advised to look for bony anatomy and MRI for cord status. After confirmation, you might need another surgery to fix it and relieve compression. Rescue screws may be used to fix plate.: Another cause could be vertebral collapse due to osteoporosis/osteomalacia leading to displacement of graft and collapse of bone in canal.Management will be similar to above mentioned condition. Bone cement may be used to fix screws in bone. At home, you can follow few tips to avoid further deterioration: Avoid neck movement specifically flexion: Use rigid neck collar: You can take B12 supplements with other nerve specific elements like chromium, Folic acid, Thiamine : For tingling, you might take Pregabaline after proper prescription: Avoid weight lifting: Get your Vitamin D3 level checked. If it is low, start Vit D3 supplements after proper prescription Hope it will help you. Thanks.

I was on klonopin 4mg for twelve years, I came off last year and developed the neuropathy. What could be causing it?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. It is good that you are no having symptomatic disc disease. Presence of disc on MRI is not considered significant if it does not cause any symptom. Disc bulge or protrusion occurs normally after 35 years age and by 60 years age, around 60% humans have positive disc bulge on MRI spine. It is not symptomatic in all. So do not worry about disc if you are not having any symptoms due to it. To avoid further disc bulge, you can follow few tips: Avoid forward bending: Avoid weight lifting more than 5 kilogram: Avoid prolonged sitting or strain over back: You can consult physiotherapist and learn back strengthening exercise.Regarding polyneuropathy, I am not able to find out the cause of polyneuropathy in your case. It could be due to:Diabetes Melitus: Thiamine deficiency: Vitamin B 12 deficiency: Genetic causeIt can only be confirmed by blood tests like Vitamin B 12/Thiamine level, chromosomal evaluation, Blood sugar (fasting and post eating) and evaluation of symptomatology. Further treatment will be given after confirming diagnosis.Meanwhile, you can take some precaution: If you are having numbness of extremities, you should wear gloves/soft shoes while doing work/touching hot or cold objects. : Maintain hygiene to prevent any fungal infection: Daily examine your extremities to rule out any painless cut/wound: Start exercise to increase muscle strength if there is motor weakness: You can take multivitamin capsules/decrease sugar intake and increase green leafy vegetables intake/curd/cod liver oil to get better nutrition.Hope it will help you.

I m very worried since these symptoms showed up all of a sudden. However, I fell on top of my head about 4 years ago and I was wondering if this is related to my current symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. The painless bump over skull without recent history of trauma can be due to: Degenerative changes - With age, our bone degenerate and it leads to sclerosis and bone lysis. It can sometime form bony bump. It is asymptomatic, painless and noticed incidentally. Treatment is observation only. Ct head can confirm diagnosis, but it is needed only if there is any kind of doubt.: Bony mass - Sometimes bony lesions like fibrous dysplasia or osteoma can cause bony swelling. The swelling may be mildly painful, hard, immobile, appears as bump like with stretched skin over it, skin free over it.To confirm it, you have to correlate your features and consult doctor. The doctor will feel it and may advise CT head to rule out it. Diagnosis is confirmed by excising it and sending biopsy. Small swelling less than 1cm size may be observed even patient does not want surgery. Both above swellings are benign.: Calcified hepatoma - It usually occurs after trauma. Blood collects in skin layers and then its covering gets calcified. It presents as hard lump, mobile over skull bone, painless or may be mild pain, skin free, with history of trauma.Again CT head is needed for confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment is surgical excision if painful, large size, cosmetically unacceptable. You can correlate your features and reach upto some conclusion. Skull flattening could be age related degeneration or bony changes associated with above mentioned pathology.Hope it will help you. Thanks Take care.Dr Ishu Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"Hi I am about to get the angiography done thru my groin for my cerebral aneurysm treatment… I am just wondering that if I can go back to work in a couple of days-running a small business with my wife and usually standing up all day(10-12 hours long except quick lunch break). Please tell me what I can expect to have after the procedure such as pain, swelling or bruising, etc… Thanks","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. Best of wishes for your treatment. As you are going to be operated by endovascular approach, most probably doctor will either do coiling with/without stunting or flow diversion therapy. You are having some basic knowledge about it which is good.Endovascular approach has few advantages over open surgery like: Rapid recovery and return to work. You will be able to return to work after 7 to 10 days. But mental and physical stress should be avoided. As first 3 to 6 months are required for complete thrombosis and occlusion of aneurysm, so be careful.: No scar over scalp which means no complications of scarring/headache due to it/wound infection or suture problems.: No handling of brain which means no direct brain damage.Few side effects and important points should be kept in mind and should be taken care: Puncture site over femoral artery in thigh needs proper attention. Whenever visit to doctor, show it to rule out any occurrence of pseudoaneurysm or hepatoma: If stent or flow diverter will be placed, then you may require blood thinner tablets for long time. Do not stop tablets on your own.: Get repeat angiography done after 6 months to look for any residual aneurysm or recurrence.: During procedure, few side effects like damage to major arteries can occur like dissection. Thrombus formation which a clot can occur. It can migrate and block supply to specific area of brain. Aneurysm rupture can happen which may require open surgery. Dye allergy or kidney damage from dye can occur. Hope it will help you. Thanks.Take care.Dr Ishu Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"I had a cervical spine MRI.

I had my blood tested and everything came back negative. I noticed about a month ago which was the week after I saw my eye doctor that I was getting headaches daily. All of the sudden last week my ears have begun to ring then a couple days after that I have felt shaky and when I lay down I feel my heart beating faster and sometimes feel twitching in my arms and legs.

Parathyroid gland removal refers to a type of surgery done to remove these glands. It’s also known as a parathyroidectomy. This surgery might be used if your body is producing too much calcium. This is a condition known as hypercalcemia.Due to the surgery, the only effect on your body will be, low production of calcium, which has nothing to do with anxiety, panic attacks and muscle aches.Either you are really anxious about the surgery procedure and after effects which caused the panic attacks, or some of the given medicines created such a scenario.

An allergic reaction can not be excluded too. Do you have any other symptoms like running nose, sneezing, itchiness in other parts of your body?Have you tried any new hair product lately (shampoo, hairstyler,etc.)?I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical exam and some tests: -complete blood count-inflammation tests-allergy tests-blood electrolytes. A brain MRI may be needed in case that abnormal neurological signs are encountered during physical exam.

I am a 61-year-old woman, with Diabetes II, hypertension and am being treated for depression. Last year, a neurologist diagnosed me with Parkinson s Disease. I had retired after experiencing some mental and physical difficulties in my teaching job. He did motor and vision tests. I presented with tremors felt both externally and internally, some language-related memory problems, dropping things and falling, gait and balance problems. I had some muscle slowness, but not severe. In addition, I had Restless Leg Syndrome, which kept me from resting. The doctor prescribed accordingly. Recently I moved to another town and the new neurologist felt my tremors were not from Parkinson s. After a few unrevealing motor tests, she sent me for an MRI, which revealed microvascular ischemic disease.Is this MRI sufficient to negate the PD diagnosis? Her only message to me was that the MRI was okay. Can you suggest some questions I might take to my appointment with her next week?","Doctor":"Hello!I read carefully your question and understand your concern. Your MRI finding have revealed chronic changes of the small vessels in the brain, leading to small repeated brain strokes. It is related to uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes. From the other hand this MRI findings can exclude Parkinson disease, but can not exclude Parkinson syndrome, which means that you have the clinical features of Parkinson, but they are related to damage to the basal ganglia caused by small vessel disease. Parkinson's Syndrome is diagnosed based on the physical examination. Further tests to consider would be DAT scan, which could examine better the damage to the basal ganglia. Levo-Dopa trial can be performed to examine your response to this drug. If it is positive, Parkinson's syndrome would be likely and treatment with dopa agonist drugs or levo-dopa should be considered. Meanwhile, I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure and fasting glucose, and take aspirin and a statin to prevent further progression of small vessel disease, leading to further aggravation of your situation.Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida"},{"Patient":"Possible brain tumor, clot, sinus infection or tooth infection S/S?

Doctors are saying surgery was needed to stop the bleeding of the brain. She is not responsive, pressure goes up and down. Tracheotomy was suppose to take place today to make her more comfortable from the breathing tube but blood pressure is too low. What causes the pressure to remain low? is there danger? Please email me. Thank you for your response.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. I am sorry to hear about your mother's condition.The decompressive surgery, to stop brain bleeding and relieve pressure effect on brain, outcomes are not very good because patients are mostly in very bad condition. Most patients require prolonged ventilatory support in ICU (intensive care unit). Thats why tracheostomy is done frequently in such patients The low blood pressure could be due to shock (neurogenic or hypovolumic or septic). It can only be confirmed by blood culture, cardiac status, checking brain reflexes and response, measuring blood volume. It requires expertise and investigations. You can confirm it with her treating doctor or you can provide all these details by asking another question, only then we can reach upto some conclusion.Low blood pressure in a brain damage patient is a bad sign. It means blood supply to brain has decreased. It will further damage and stop the healing process. Tracheostomy will be delayed as sometimes it can cause damage to major blood vessels. This damage can further lower the BP and thus can lead to grave consequences. Ask doctor what medication and fluid is going on? For low BP, she can be given: Intravenous fluids like normal saline after prescription : Intravenous ionotropes like Dopamine/Adrenaline after proper prescription; Intravenous antibiotics like Penicllins, Amikacin etc. to treat infection.; Keep her head at lower level than chest; Rule out deep venous thrombosis by doing D-Dimer assay and USG (ultrasound doppler) along with above causes.Hope it will help you.Thanks.

What could this be ... muscle strain, lipoma, disc problem, something else?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. It is good that you have already searched about your swelling and you know about lipoma/disc. Now to make some diagnosis about your swelling, we have to evaluate it and relate it with common swellings of neck: If it has appeared with in 48 hours and it was never there before it, it could be reactive lymph node or inflammatory/infected swelling like abscess/cellulitis/boil. These swellings are painful, tender to touch, skin temperature over it is raised, skin usually becomes red (except lymph node). You might develop fever and sometimes swelling ruptures and release pus. If your features are resembling above features, you should ; Not touch it; you can take painkiller like Diclofenac sodium after proper prescription; avoid pressure over it; you can take antibiotic course like Co-amoxyclav after proper prescription; Consult doctor to drain pus or if no relief.: Another possibility could be that swelling was there for long time but you noticed it 48 hours before only. It usually happens. This type of swelling could be lipoma, lymph node due to chronic disease (TB, chronic osteomyelitis), chronic abscess like cold access (TB), muscular lesion. These swellings are painless, usually round, firm, no fever, no redness.For confirmation, you have to consult doctor. He might take biopsy (tissue sample) to confirm or get some blood tests. Further treatment will be decided after confirming swelling.Neck pain with shoulder tightness could be due to muscle strain or disc problem. In muscular pain, it is dull, local tenderness on pressing neck, no sharp shooting sensation, no numbness, pain on stretching muscle. While disc pain is sharp shooting pain which starts in neck and radiates to shoulder, needle like sensations, no tenderness, numbness present.Treatment includes: Bed rest: Massaging neck if muscular pain: Avoid neck flexion : Avoid lifting weight: Take painkiller like Diclofenac sodium after proper prescription: For disc pain, you can take Pregabaline or Gabapentine or Amitryptiline after proper prescription: You can consult physiotherapist for both pain: IF still no relief, you can consult doctor.Hope it will help you.

Severe headachces -no quality of life-they overdrsined her brain 2 years ago and she has dearly suffered. they did ct after ct and always said shunt is working fine. Even with her head sunken in-finally she gave up with the debilitating pain and just went to bed. About 4 weeks ago they did a icp test and she had numbers that went from -13 and - 22. They put in a shunt assist devise and it is still killing her when she stands up. she wishes everyday GOD would take her. Please help and advise what we need to do. They are doing a partial shunt revision tomorrow and putting it in her chest...will this help her? if not does she have the right to ask them to take it out and let her go?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. It is very sad that your daughter has suffered so much. From your history it is clear that she is having \\"Shunt overdarinage syndrome\\" and her intracranial pressure (ICP) is very low. One good point in your daughter case is that she is conscious and oriented.Shunt over drainage is a managable condition. Usually it resolves on its own with some time. But it did not happen in your daughter's case. She has already taken painkiller and bed rest for last 2 years and it has failed. Ask her to take plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and low pressure. We have to give her next line of treatment.  I am giving you few options which we do at our hospital: Shunt ligation trial - It is a little bit crude method. We tie shunt just above clavicle and observe patient. You can ask it from your doctor. If her symptoms progressively improve and she does not develop signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), it can be left as such. No further treatment will be needed except regular follow up. But if it fails and she develop features of raised ICP, then other options should be considered: High pressure shunt - It is a type of shunt device in which brain fluid (CSF) is drained only if pressure is high (usually more than 100mm H2O). Thus it prevents oevrdrainage of CSF and relieves pain. : Programmable ventricle-peritoneal shunt - This type of shunt has the advantage of adjustment of opening pressure according to intracranial pressure (low or high) using external magnetic device. According to your question, it appears that this device has been used in your daughter. If not, you can ask for it. : Endoscopic third ventriculostomy - In this procedure, surgeon makes an opening in third ventricle (natural CSF reservoir) and establishes communication between it and CSF draining region of brain. But it can only be done in case of dilated ventricles. While in case of over drainage, ventricles are very narrow. To attempt this procedure, shunt ligation and dilatation of ventricle can be done if patient can safely tolerate. Advantage is complete disappearance of over drainage symptoms.: Lastly change VP shunt into ventricle-cardiac shunt - It leads to shortening of shunt length and thus \\"siphon effect\\" or negative suction pressure. It leads to less overdrainage. But ventricle-cardiac shunt has more chances of other complications like blockade/cardiac complications/infection. You can discuss all these possibilities with doctor. Hope it will help you. Don't be disappointed. Thanks. Take care."},{"Patient":"I recently noticed I had a dent in the top front of my skull. I thought it was caused by my sunglasses sitting on my head too long but I ve suddenly realized that it isn t caused by my sunglasses. Today I have felt another one. Should I be alarmed and what could be causing this? Cyndie","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. The dent in skull could be due to various reasons: Bone moulding - It is a normal process which shapes skull and occurs during first 7 years age. During this, skull bone is formed from soft membrane cover and sutures between different skull bones fuse. No need to do anything for it. The dent due to it will be painless and present for long time.: Age related change - It is due to age causing bone sclerosis and areas of lysis which lead to irregular bone. It usually occurs after 45-55 years. It is also a normal process>No need to do anything for it. The dent is painless.: Post traumatic - Head injury can cause dent at impact site. It may be dent or depressed fracture. For confirmation, CT head is required. If there is any history of significant head injury before noticing dent, it could be the reason. You have to consult doctor for evaluation.Treatment will be decided after CT report. Depressed fracture may require surgery. Otherwise, normal dent is usually managed conservatively.: Bony lesion - it could be due to bony lesion like dermoid cyst/osetoma/fibrous dysplasia. It can be suspected if at dent site, you are feeling some kind of swelling. For confirmation, you have to consult doctor. He might take tissue from it to confirm diagnosis. Treatment usually requires surgical excision.Hope it will help you.Thanks.

Is there information you can provide to me regarding the symptoms and diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCMI have gone thru your query regarding  symptoms of Asperger syndrome which you & your children you feel, haveThe onset commonly occurs after the age of 3.It is An autistic disorder most notable , the often great discrepancy between the intellectual and social abilities of those who have it.Typical features also may include clumsy and uncoordinated motor movements, social impairment with extreme egocentricity, limited interests and unusual preoccupations, repetitive routines or rituals, speech and language peculiarities, and non-verbal communication problems.People with Asperger syndrome generally have few facial expressions apart from anger or misery. Most have excellent rote memory and musical ability, and become intensely interested in one or two subjects (sometimes to the exclusion of other topics). They may talk at length about a favorite subject or repeat a word or phrase many times. Such People  tend to be \\"in their own world\\" and preoccupied with their own agenda. Some individuals who exhibit features of autism but who have well-developed language skills may be diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.There is also an increased risk for development of psychosis (a mental disorder) and/or mood problems such as depression and anxiety in the later years.Treatment is based on your child's unique symptoms. It may change often so that it's most useful for your child and strives to improve your child's abilities to interact with other people and thus to function effectively in society and be self-sufficientSchool programs, job training, and counseling can help too . Doctors, teachers, and mental health counselors can help your child improve his or her behavior and build social and learning skills .At home, you can help build your child's confidence and skills. Use rules and daily routines, visual aids, and role-playing. Activity-oriented groups and focused counseling can also be helpful.Right now, there is no cure for Asperger's syndrome, but therapy may improve functioning and reduce undesirable behaviors.

This has been going in for 2days now on and off. Have i coursed some damage or is it am inner ear issue? Never had anything like this before and never get motion sickness. Thanks for your help","Doctor":"Dear, Welcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Equilibrioception or sense of balance is one of the physiological senses. It helps prevent humans and animals from falling over when walking or standing still. Balance is the result of a number of body systems working together. The eyes (visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the body's sense of where it is in space (proprioception) ideally need to be intact. The vestibular system, the region of the inner ear where three semicircular canals converge, works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex. I don't think there is anything to worry. it is just your new hobby. The ups and downs in trampoline definitely affects your balance because it affects the vestibulo-ocular reflex. This habitual reflex stays there till it gets used to it. Could take a week or more of continuous habitual practice. Don't worry.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute detail possible.

I have headaches and ringing/fullness in my ears. I have always been physical. I can no longer carry usual weighted items in my left arm as I could before. The dr requested a second opinion. What else wo uld cause this?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. The neuroma occurs after nerve damage to heal the damaged area. So whenever neuroma occurs, it means some nerve damage. It can cause severe burning pain due to abnormal nerve regeneration. Weakness of muscle and sensory loss occurs due to nerve damage. The management of neuroma is either conservative or surgical excision and repair of nerve. Conservative management is indicated: If there is no or mild symptoms: Symptom of burning pain only which is responsive to painkillers like Pregabaline/Gabapentine/Amitryptiline  : Old neuroma of more than 2 years old with complete functional loss. Surgery at this stage usually does not cause any functional recovery.Surgery is indicated if: Intractable pain not responding to painkillers: Neuroma of less than 2 years with functional loss - Excising neuroma and joining nerve ends may lead to some functional recovery. But before deciding for surgery, nerve studies are done to find out the degree of damage, site of neuroma, affected muscle. You can correlate your features and consult neurosurgeon for further management.For headache and fullness in ear, it could be due to ear infection/upper respiratory tract infection, you should consult ENT specialist. After evaluation, he might prescribe painkillers, antibiotic therapy, decongestant, ear drops for 7-10 days.Hope it will help you. Thanks.

Adult ADHD is also almost certainly lack concentration but without notable hyperactivity.The symptoms you gave here do points towards ADHD but these cannot be taken into consideration fully. Mainly because there could be a bias in your symptom list.

Ninety percent of Asperger diagnoses are for boys. Not because girls don’t have Asperger’s, but because it’s so much harder to identify in girls that they go largely undiagnosed. Asperger’s is a developmental disorder that’s almost impossible to self-identify because central to the dysfunction is very poor social skills. But poor social skills means that you are missing social cues which means that you don’t know you’re missing social cues.The following four symptoms, if you have, you can be sure of your Asperger.1. You are out of step socially in terms of grooming or sex.2. You are disorganized in surprising ways3. You are unpredictably detail oriented4.

Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. As you are having cervical region fracture, it can cause involvement of all limbs. But first we have to evaluate C4 and C7 fracture whether they are causing spinal cord or nerve compression. If it is present, then decompression of canal/cord is needed. It will prevent further damage, relieves swelling and if damage is temporary, it will reverse it. Decompression can be achieved by surgery. Sometimes stabilisation of spine with instrumentation is also done to prevent further damage.Drugs are not very effective. Only steroid like methylprednisolone can help to some extent, if it is given in high dose and within 8 hours of injury. After that, there is no use. There are few drugs like methylcobalamine, free radical neutralisers but role is not established. But if you are having stiffness, then: Baclofen tablet can relieve it. Usual dose is 10mg thrice a day what I prescribe.: Tizanidine.: Clonazepam: Botulinum injection in muscle: Baclofen pump implantation.You can discuss it with doctor and take medication after proper prescription. Do not self medicate.Physiotherapy which involves strengthening of muscles and stretching to relieve spasm. It involves moving all joints' there complete range. You can take help of physiotherapist. It can only be started after neck stabilisation. Thanks. Hope it will help you.

She got out of bed two nights ago, greeted her son who had just arrived home, went to the fridge to get a drink, turned out the kitchen light and fainted. She said that she had only fainted once before (during her second pregnancy) and she felt it coming but this time she had absolutely no warning at all. She went straight back to bed and noted that she was sweating profusely all over her body from head to toe. She did remark to me a few days prior, that she has been tired of late. My mother (my nieces maternal grandmother) died from a brain tumour at the age of 35 and my brother and father (her uncle and grandfather) both died from massive heart attacks.

I have gone thru  the history of sufferings of your family .  I don't think sufferings of your niece have any concern with their sufferings  .  For your info , Her own  multiple troubles  are sufficient for her weak immunity  leading to further sufferings  as any one's  weak  immune system is responsible for one's health problem . For your info , Fainting is  caused by multiple factors HBP/LOW BP ,Low /high Sugar in blood ,Worry , Anxiety , Heat exhastion , Dehydration , side effects of medication , anemia are few factors which can cause fainting . Fainting results from inadequate energy substrate delivery to the brain. The major energy substrates are oxygen and glucose.

At the moment there are frequent sharp spasms of pain. This began 3 hours ago and has gradually become more severe. The spasms are currently occurring about every 20-30 seconds. The pain just came on. No physical jarring or turning etc.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.There are many causes of a shooting pain in the back of the head. Commonly a neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve can cause such a condition. It has branches which supplies the back of the head. This can trigger sharp pains to the area. However a clinical examination is required to confirm the condition.Other causes of such pains can be from nerve pinching in the cervical spine. The nerves leave the spinal cord through small foramina and if there is cervical spine disc disease then the nerves are under pressure and can cause a sensation of sharp pain in the back of the head and neck regions.Pain below the ear can also happen due to inflammation of blood vessels called arteritis, usually temporal arteritis is a common cause of pain on the side of head and around the ear.

I have also been feeling some pressure on that side of my face which runs around to my upper neck or lower part of the back of my head on the same side. I went to the doctor and she said it is probably a cyst or maybe something sinus related, but it doesn t feel like it is going away. I had an MRI about 6-8 months ago because I have hormonal migraines and the MRI was normal. What could be causing these strange symptoms??? Thanks! Jill Berman","Doctor":"Hello. thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. This lump over left side of head could be : swelling in scalp like sebaceous cyst, lymph node, dermoid cyst. These all are non traumatic in origin.: If swelling is hard and feels like attached to bone, it could be bony lesion like osteoma, fibrous dysplasia.From your history, it is not clear whether it is soft/firm/hard, exact location and size. But by relating your lump with above swellings, you can reach unto some conclusion. All these swellings are benign. Do not worry. Surgery is required only if large size, pus in it, looking ugly or you want to get rid of it. Usually, these do not cause such large area pain. Sometimes pain may occur in swelling only. You can leave it as such. Exact diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue sample. Hemicranial headache on left side could be due to migraine/neuralgia. But if your headache is also occurring in neck and radiating to limbs also, it could be cervical spondylosis. You can reach unto some conclusion based on few points: Pain sharp shooting, radiating to neck and left hand, occurring more on neck flexion, coughing, sneezing, not related to light at all, it could be cervical spondylosis. For it you have to avoid neck flexion, weight lifting of any kind, take bed rest, show it to doctor who may advise MRI cervical spine. Some painkiller medication may be prescribed.: Pain on left side, pulsatile, increases in light, fear from light, not related with posture, similar to previous episodes of migraine, it could be Migraine. It can be treated by taking painkiller like Diclofenac sodium after prescription, avoiding bright light, controlling stress.Hope it will help you. thanks. take care."},{"Patient":"Hi there, Today I was working at my school and in my last class of the day I started to feel very faint, get the chills, began to sweat, and I thought I was going to vomit.

The reason behind this may be due to: Nature of pain may be different like neuropathic/musculoskeletal pain/complex regional pain syndrome.

Now that I want to improve my learning skills and get an MBA degree to move ahead in life as well as in career , I am facing this strange concentration problem . Everytime I sit to study for the exam I start to feel as if some thing is moving ( slowly ) just behind my back . I do not feel any physical sensation ,but I get a feeling as if there is some kind on line behind the back , and this feeling in turn makes it difficult for me to concentrate on the subject . I used to have this problem since I was in school ;this happens only when I am trying to concentrate on the subject in hand . I have not encountered such sensation when at work ,where I do lot of reading . my studying has become a pain now . I can’t comprehend the nuances of the texts on the exam because of this problem . I lose my concentration easily and start to feel irritated . I have another problem that I cannot focus after 40-50 mins . I start to become restless and start to shake my leg vigorously( I do shake my leg in general very often ) . If i force my self to sit any longer , I feel difficulty in breathing . This is hampering my preparation for a crucial 4 hours exam . Its been one year I have been trying to over come this problem , but I have failed in every attempt . I started to believe it s a neorological problem . I have tried everything from deep breathing to meditation . I have also tried L-tyrosine , 5HTP , fish oil , phosphotidyl serine , Brahmi , nothing seems to give any result . I don t know if visiting a psychiatric or neurologist is going to help. Kindly let me know if I can try any safe medication for few weeks to see if these symptoms subside ? I am thinking of trying Sulbutiamine, but I am not sure if that is the right move . I am here to get some professional advise on the condition . Kindly suggest .

You sleep well, exercise regularly and have good diet. That is really good. I appreciate. I understand your problem. You should understand, for anyone, attention span is less than 10 minutes in a given task or job. Beyond that, it is possible only if the task is creative or entertaining. If you are able to watch a movie for 2 hours, if you are able to play a game for one hour, then you do not have any concentration or attention problems.Students like you are compelled to study from boring books continuously. Because of the boring subject, your attention span lessens and mind wanders. In your case this started even when you were a child. But you started obsessing with the problem and illusion of ''something moving behind the head'' happened. This illusion started troubling and you always tried to blame the concentration problem. You tried to relate every problem with concentration and therefore you were more obsessed with your brain.I suggest you to consult a psychiatrist for treatment in obsession and illusion.

I can understand. To understand your problem, you should know what is memory. Memory is perception, storage and recollection. memory is complete on when all three of these aspects are fulfilled. If you are not interested in perceiving or storage, you will not be able to recollect anything. This is never short term memory loss.You can talk to anyone. Just ask them, how many days they can remember from their childhood days? How many days from teen age or adult hood or college days or school days? Always any given person will be able to remember a handful of days. That is natural and is happening because there is no need to remember at all. But, important events very few people forget.In your case too, you never forgot those important days of your childhood. You just forgot those unnecessary memory. That is fine. Selective memory is a cliche term. You can be a selective thinker and selective memorizer. Whatever you want to memorize, you are able to. Just talk to a psychologist, who will prove you with all these facts. Stop worrying and please go ahead with your education.If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link.

Alzheimers cannot make you forget internal maps all of a sudden. That is a long process. Once that happens, you will not even know. Let me clarify to you. You were working and you could recall you were stressed. Naturally stress leads to disorientation. Disorientation is a scary sensation and naturally, because of disorientation, you got scared or got anxious. Naturally because of that the disorientation symptom worsened. You got back your orientation within a minute too. I don't think there is anything to worry with the current episode.You should be active, indulge in physical exercise and activities, socialize, do brain games and creative hobbies so as to keep dementia or alzheimers at bay.

Once had to call 911 due to her inability to breath. Suggestions, recommendations, or any pre-pre diagnosis thoughts?","Doctor":"Severe compression between sternum and throat, and vomiting contents from throat, not her stomach may suggest some esophageal motility disorder (either primary or secondary). Few esophageal motility disorders are: 1. Achalasia2. Spastic esophageal motility disorders, including diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), nutcracker esophagus, and hypertensive LES3. Nonspecific esophageal motility disorder (inefficient esophageal motility disorder)4.

I need to go back to driving as my life is very active and I am helping to take care of family members. Do these seizures stop after I finally finish menopause?","Doctor":"Catamenial epilepsy is a subset of epilepsy, which includes women whose seizures are exacerbated by their menstrual cycle.

I am 3 weeks post op for a hysterectomy due to a somewhat large uterine fibroid thinking that might be what's causing the pain.

This is mapped by doing electroencephalogram which records the waves on the surface of the brain. When there is abnormal brain waves from a hyperactive area then it causes seizures and this is called epilepsy. Epilepsy is another name for seizure disorder.You have got seizures and the EEG is abnormal, therefore a detailed investigation using MRI scan brain is required. The abnormal EEG area should be studied in detail. The answers to your questions are the following.1. Sinusitis and seizures is not directly related. However an infection from sinuses can rarely reach the brain and cause seizures. This is very rare.2. Menstrual cycles can be affected by medicines, illnesses and stress. The details of tablet are important to discuss this point3. It depends on which medicine is there in the tablet. Most medicines are taken after food but some might require to be taken before food.4. Sun stroke is an environmentally influenced condition and there should be sufficient history of going out in the hot sun. Sun stroke is a metabolic disorder and can lead to seizure or epilepsy.5. Epilepsy can be from many causes and if your EEG us abnormal then a cause in the brain must be looked for.6. Epilepsy and seizures are almost the same. Seizure is a single episode and epilepsy is usually for multiple episodes. A fall during first seizure is less likely to cause abnormal EEG and the seizure caused it."},{"Patient":"I currently have nerve damage to my back, and I m on lots of meds.

This will tell us the possible types of nerves affected and if the autonomic nervous system in the spinal cord is dysregulated. This can cause symptoms of intense sweating and feeling chill intermittently.The thermal regulation in our system is managed by a number of structure including the thalamus which is in the brain. Nerve fibers carrying temperature sensation are scattered every where under the skin and this has receptors. Problem in these nerves can make you feel hot at one time and then cold soon after.

Brad, New Bombay.","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your question at HCM At first the kindof spine pain needs to be differentiated. Scenario 1-only neck pain(axial pain) with no radiation to the arms and no tingling or numbness in the upper limbs. Such a scenario suggests age related degenrative changes or muscle strain or pull. Muslce strain or pull usually gets better with rest, medicines and physiotherapy over 2 to 4 weeks. If its degenrative problem, neck pain can linger on for longer duration. can get better with exercises, PT and postural adjustments with supplementary analgesics for pain. Scenario 2 neck pain associated with arm pain or numbness and tingling, with unsteadyness in gait, walking disturbance( all suggest compression of neural structures) etc- here if the pain does not respond over 8 to 12 weeks, will requuire interventions like epidural. nerve root steroid injections or surgery ( last resort) to relieve compression. Sine in your case , the MRI shows multiple level spine degeneration ( in form disc herniation) sustained relief cannot be promised. As of today we have no medical treatment which can reverse age related changes) like disc degeration) Hence some amount of neck pain is bound to persist over time.

Thanks for asking from HCM.I can understand your concern. The tightness in calf can not be due to L5-S1 nerve as nerve damage here will cause soft, flaccid calf. However cord damage at cervical region (C4-C6) can cause tightness in calf.The pain in right leg and sensory loss in middle toe can be due to both or either. To differentiate between two conditions, check whether : you are having tightness in all limbs, it suggest cervical cord compression: you are having pain in lower back till foot, it suggest L5-S1 nerve damage: Involvement of other extremities suggest cervical involvement.Also if you are doing too much exertion of lower limbs, this pain could be due to exertion.

Its usually occur in old age due to degeneration of TMJ disc. You need to consult dentist (orthodontics)."},{"Patient":"My MRI Report:1) Degenerative disc diseases at L5/S1 level.2) Central and both paracentral disc bulge at L5/S1 Level Causing thecal sac indentation, mild spinal cannal stenosis and bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.3) Screening of whole spine shows disc bulge a c3/4, c4/5 & c5/6 Levels causing thecal sac indentation & mild spinal canal stenosis.","Doctor":"Disc bulge causing thecal sac indentation and mild spinal canal stenosis, seems to be manageable by conservative management. Conservative treatment options include- Analgesics (NSAID), Physiothrapy, Gabapentin/Pregabalin.Surgical treatment is indicated, if:1. Muscle weakness or atrophy in supplied muscles.2. Neuropathic changes in EMG in supplied muscles by affected nerve roots.3. No symptomatic improvement on conservative treatment4.

Pain started in May with numbness and tingling down my arm. Took an X-ray , don t see much. Planning to do an MRI. I believe this would be the best way to diagnose? Can this be caused by cycling as I was cycling 60 to 80 km a week? Certain positions are soothing contrary to others where I get a shooting pain down the arm, sort of like an electric shock. Moving my head fully forward relieves me of pain. Basically, the worst pain is when I move my head back and sort of tuck in my chin. Any recommendations? Thank you. Lucio","Doctor":"Pain, Numbness and tingling in arm with electric shock like radiating pain strongly favor diagnosis of involvement of nerve roots. MRI Cervical spine with Nerve conduction studies (NCV) and Electromyography (EMG) will be best way to diagnose and localizing your problem. Such problem doesn't seem to be caused by cycling. I Recommend to use \\"soft cervical collar\\" and Tab Pregabalin 75 mg BD / Tab Gabapentin 100 mg TDS. Get MRI Cervical spine , NCV & EMG both upper limbs and get reviewed with reports."},{"Patient":"my mother ios 82 year old keeps,old case of cerviccal spodylosos ,keeps having giddiness spl while getting up or in the process of lyibg down hwiohc alst for few mts and then settles down.She uses haering aid too.Currtent medication tab dizitec and prothiaden 25..known hypertensive on medication but stabilised ..MRI head is non significant ..any advise on medication ..how long can she take these d drugs ..thks","Doctor":"Giddiness or vertiginous sensations during changing position (as you mention while getting up or process of lying down and lasting for few minutes ) suggest diagnosis of BPPV [Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo]. Dizitac can be effective for symptomatic control. But I not suggest to continue Prothiadine for this problem. Also effective may be Apley maneuver (also called the CRP or canalith repositioning procedure)."},{"Patient":"Hello,I was involved in a slip and fall at walmart on Fri night.
