The grouping of stops into routes in the problem is a special case of the following type of configurations. Consider a set with n elements and certain subsets of this set with the following two properties:(1) Any two (different) such subsets have exactly one common element; and(2) For any two (different) elements in the set, there is exactly one selected subset that contains both of them.Configurations that satisfy properties (1) and (2) - except for certain trivial arrangements - are called finite projective planes; the elements of the set are called points, and the selected subsets are called lines. It is easy to show that the number of lines in a projective plane is the same as the number of points, i.e., n. It is also not difficult to prove that every line has the same number of points - this number is usually denoted by (q+1) - and this number is equal to the number of lines passing through any given point. It then follows easily that n = q^2 + q + 1.Using finite fields, it is possible to construct finite projective planes for every case where q is a prime power. However, there are planes that cannot be constructed using this general method. No one has yet found a plane in which q is not a prime power. This is related to a famous, unsolved problem in finite mathematics: for which values of q does a finite projective plane of order q exist (can q be anything other than a prime power)?![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_d3c5ce393a10cdc3022fg-1.jpg?height=317&width=339&top_left_y=2042&top_left_x=882)"},{"problem":"Given that α in (0,π), and cos α + sin α = -frac{1}{5}, find the value of tan 2α.","solution":"Since α in (0,π), we can infer that sin α > 0.Given that cos α + sin α = -frac{1}{5}, let's denote this equation as (1).From (1), we can derive that cos α = -frac{1}{5} - sin α < 0, which implies that tan α = frac{sin α}{cos α} < 0.Squaring both sides of (1), we get 1 + 2sin αcos α = frac{1}{25}, which simplifies to 2sin αcos α = -frac{24}{25}.Now, cos α - sin α = -sqrt{(cos α - sin α)^{2}} = -sqrt{1 - (-frac{24}{25})} = -frac{7}{5}.

By the uniqueness (up to isomorphism) of the field with p^{2} elements, it can be identified with mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}.

But since the order of alpha does not divide p-1, alpha notin mathbb{F}_{p}. We set x_{n}=alpha^{n}+bar{alpha}^{n} where bar{alpha} is the conjugate of alpha (the other root of its minimal polynomial in left.mathbb{F}_{p}[X]right).

I know how stubborn inanimate objects can be!! If you start trying to find a key for the first suitcase, it will surely turn out that only the tenth key fits. You'll have to try ten keys for one suitcase, and for ten suitcases - a whole hundred times!We won't quote Jelenski further, but will briefly summarize the essence. The saleswoman said that the number of attempts would not exceed 10+9+8+ldots+2+1=55, another employee suggested reducing the number of attempts even further, since if a key doesn't fit 9 suitcases, it will definitely fit the tenth. Therefore, the number of attempts would not exceed 9+8+ldots+1=45. Moreover, he stated that this would only happen in the worst-case scenario - when each time the key fits the last suitcase. In reality, the number of attempts would be approximately![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_8afde072b27934e065bbg-11.jpg?height=551&width=446&top_left_y=1666&top_left_x=291)half of the maximum possible number of attempts, that is, 22.5.Igor Fedorovich Akulich from Minsk wondered why the average number of attempts equals half of the number 45? After all, the last attempt is not needed only if the key doesn't fit any suitcase except the last one, but in all other cases, the last successful attempt also takes place.

After the first suitcase is somehow opened, there will be n-1 suitcases left, and it will take X_{n-1} attempts for them. And so on. Therefore, X_{n}=Y+X_{n-1}, and by transitioning to expectations and introducing the notation e_{n}=mathrm{E} X_{n} for brevity, we find:e_{n}=e_{n-1}+frac{n+1}{2}-frac{1}{n}=e_{n-2}+frac{n}{2}-frac{1}{n-1}+frac{n+1}{2}-frac{1}{n} text { and so on. }Considering that e_{1}=0, we eventually obtain an explicit formula:begin{aligned}& e_{n}=frac{3+4+ldots+(n+1)}{2}-left(frac{1}{n}+frac{1}{n-1}+ldots+frac{1}{2}right)= & =frac{(n-1)(n+4)}{4}+1-left(frac{1}{n}+frac{1}{n-1}+ldots+frac{1}{2}+1right)=frac{n(n+3)}{4}-H_{n}end{aligned}where H_{n} is the n-th harmonic number, equal to1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+frac{1}{4}+ldots+frac{1}{n}It is known that H_{n} approx ln n+gamma+frac{1}{2 n}, where gamma=0,5772 ldots is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

Given the maximum value of d is m- sqrt{n}, find m+n.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a semicircle with diameter ( d ) contained within a square with side length ( 8 ).   - We need to find the maximum value of ( d ) expressed as ( m - sqrt{n} ) and then determine ( m + n ).2. Diagram and Setup:   - Let the vertices of the square be ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ).   - The semicircle's diameter touches two sides of the square, say ( BC ) and ( CD ), at points ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) respectively.   - The center of the semicircle, ( O ), is equidistant from ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ).3. Positioning the Semicircle:   - The semicircle is tangent to the sides ( AD ) and ( AB ) at points ( D_1 ) and ( A_1 ) respectively.   - The center ( O ) of the semicircle is at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of ( B_1C_1 ).4. Geometric Relationships:   - The radius ( r ) of the semicircle is half of the diameter ( d ).   - The distance from the center ( O ) to the sides ( AD ) and ( AB ) is ( r ).5. Using the Square's Side Length:   - The distance from ( O ) to the corner of the square (say ( A )) is ( r sqrt{2} ) because ( triangle A_1OD_1 ) is a right isosceles triangle.   - The total distance from ( O ) to the sides ( AD ) and ( AB ) is ( r + frac{r}{sqrt{2}} ).6. Formulating the Equation:   - The side length of the square is ( 8 ), so:     [     r + frac{r}{sqrt{2}} = 8     ]   - Simplifying the equation:     [     r left( 1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}} right) = 8     ]     [     r left( frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{sqrt{2}} right) = 8     ]     [     r = frac{8 sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2} + 1}     ]7. Rationalizing the Denominator:   - Multiply the numerator and the denominator by ( sqrt{2} - 1 ):     [     r = frac{8 sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} - 1)}{(sqrt{2} + 1)(sqrt{2} - 1)} = frac{8 sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} - 1)}{2 - 1} = 8 sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} - 1)     ]     [     r = 8 (2 - sqrt{2}) = 16 - 8 sqrt{2}     ]8.

It is also known that f(0) and f(1) are both odd numbers.Prove that the equation f(x) = 0 has no integer roots.","solution":"To prove that f(x) = 0 has no integer roots, we begin by analyzing the provided conditions for the function's coefficients and integer results at specific points.Firstly, we are given that f(0) and f(1) are both odd numbers. From the function f(x), we can infer this:f(0) = c is an odd number.f(1) = a + b + c is also an odd number.Since the sum of an odd and an even number is odd, and f(1) is odd, we can deduce that a + b must be even. Consequently, coefficients a and b must be either both odd or both even because an odd plus an odd gives an even, and the same goes for an even plus an even.Assume there is an integer root t such that f(t) = 0. This leads to:at^2 + bt + c = 0.Now, let's consider the two cases for a and b—both even or both odd:1. If a and b are both even, then at^2 + bt is even regardless of the value of t. This would mean that at^2 + bt + c is odd because c is odd. This contradicts the assumption that at^2 + bt + c = 0 since zero is not an odd number. 2. If a and b are both odd, we examine t:   - If t is even, then t^2 is even, making at^2 (odd times even) even, and bt would also be even (odd times even); thus, their sum at^2 + bt is even, and adding c (odd) to an even number does not yield zero.   - If t is odd, then t^2 is odd, making at^2 (odd times odd) odd, and bt would also be odd (odd times odd); however, an odd number plus another odd number gives an even number, so at^2 + bt is even. Again, adding c (odd) to an even number does not yield zero.In either case, adding an odd c to an even sum at^2 + bt cannot equal zero. Hence, this leads to the conclusion that for both scenarios, there is a contradiction, indicating that our assumption of the existence of an integer root is false.Therefore, we have proved that the equation f(x) = 0 cannot have any integer roots, summarized as:boxed{f(x) = 0 text{ has no integer roots.}}"},{"problem":"9.8. A straight rod 2 meters long was sawn into N sticks, the length of each of which is expressed as an integer number of centimeters. For what smallest N can it be guaranteed that, using all the resulting sticks, one can, without breaking them, form the contour of some rectangle?(A. Magazinov)","solution":"Answer. N=102.Solution. First solution. Let N leqslant 101. Cut the stick into N-1 sticks of 1 cm each and one stick of (201-N) cm. It is impossible to form a rectangle from this set, as each side of the rectangle is less than half the perimeter, and thus the stick of length 201-N geqslant 100 cm cannot be part of any side. Therefore, N geqslant 102.We will show that for N=102, the desired rectangle can be found. Note that among all the sticks, there will be two sticks of 1 cm each. Indeed, if this were not the case, the total length of the sticks would be at least 2 cdot 101 + 1 = 203 cm, which is incorrect.Set aside these two sticks. Let the lengths of the remaining sticks be a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{100} mathrm{~cm}, then we have a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{100} = 198. Among the 100 numbers A_{1}=a_{1}, A_{2}=a_{1}+a_{2}, A_{3}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}, ldots, A_{100}=a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{100}, there will be two that give the same remainder when divided by 99. Let these be A_{k} and A_{ell}, k<ell. The number A_{ell}-A_{k} is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than 198, and it is divisible by 99. Thus, A_{ell}-A_{k}=99=a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+ldots+a_{ell}.Thus, we have found several sticks with a total length of 99 mathrm{~cm}. Set these aside as well. The remaining sticks also have a total length of 99 cm. Therefore, we can form a rectangle of 1 times 99 cm.Second solution. We will provide another proof that for N=102, it is possible to form a rectangle.Let the lengths of the sticks in the set, expressed in centimeters, be a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{102}. We have a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{102}=200. Consider a circle of length 200 and divide it into 102 red points, forming arcs of lengths a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{102}. These points are some 102 vertices of a regular 200-gon T inscribed in this circle. The vertices of T are paired into opposite pairs. There are 100 such pairs, and 102 red points, so among the red points, there will be two pairs of opposite points. These two pairs of points divide the circle into two pairs of equal arcs. Thus, we have divided all the sticks into four groups A, B, C, D, where the total lengths in groups A and C, as well as in groups B and D, are equal. Therefore, it is possible to form a rectangle using each group to form one of its sides.Comment. Only the correct answer -0 points.An example is provided showing that N geqslant 102-1 point.

Then sqrt{75-x}=n sqrt{x-25}.Squaring both sides, we get 75-x=n^{2}(x-25) or 75-x=x n^{2}-25 n^{2}. This equation can be rearranged to get 25 n^{2}+75=xleft(n^{2}+1right) and then solved for x to get x=frac{25 n^{2}+75}{n^{2}+1}.Rearranging, we havex=frac{25 n^{2}+75}{n^{2}+1}=frac{25 n^{2}+25+50}{n^{2}+1}=frac{25left(n^{2}+1right)}{n^{2}+1}+frac{50}{n^{2}+1}=25+frac{50}{n^{2}+1}Observe that n^{2}+1>0 for all n, so the cancellation above is justified.Since x and 25 are both integers, frac{50}{n^{2}+1} must also be an integer, so 50 is a multiple of n^{2}+1. Since n^{2}+1 is a divisor of 50 and it must be positive, we have that n^{2}+1 must be one of 1,2 , 5,10,25, or 50 .Setting n^{2}+1 equal to each of these values and solving givesbegin{array}{ll}n^{2}+1=1 & Rightarrow n=0 n^{2}+1=2 & Rightarrow n= pm 1 n^{2}+1=5 & Rightarrow n= pm 2 n^{2}+1=10 & Rightarrow n= pm 3 n^{2}+1=25 & Rightarrow n= pm sqrt{24} n^{2}+1=50 & Rightarrow n= pm 7end{array}Note that n is the ratio of two square roots, which means it must be nonnegative. As well, sqrt{24} is not an integer, so this means n=0, n=1, n=2, n=3, or n=7.Substituting these values of n into x=frac{25 n^{2}+75}{n^{2}+1}, we get that the possible values of x are 75 , 50,35,30, and 26 , of which there are 5 .ANSWER: 5"},{"problem":"3.

Evenness of F(x):Given F(x) = f(x) - x^3, we need to determine if F(x) is an even function. Recall that a function is even if F(-x) = F(x) for all x in its domain.- Compute F(-x):  [  F(-x) = f(-x) - (-x)^3 = f(-x) + x^3  ]- Given f(x) - f(-x) = 2x^3, we can express f(-x) as f(x) - 2x^3. Substituting this into the expression for F(-x):  [  F(-x) = (f(x) - 2x^3) + x^3 = f(x) - x^3  ]- Since F(-x) = f(x) - x^3 = F(x), F(x) is indeed an even function.Therefore, option A is correct, and option B is incorrect because F(x) being even contradicts it being odd.2. Monotonicity of F(x):Given {F'}(x) = {f'}(x) - 3x^2, we analyze the sign of {F'}(x) to determine the monotonicity of F(x).- For x > 0, it's given that {f'}(x) > 3x^2. Substituting into {F'}(x):  [  {F'}(x) = {f'}(x) - 3x^2 > 3x^2 - 3x^2 = 0  ]- Since {F'}(x) > 0 for x > 0, F(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty).By symmetry, due to F(x) being an even function, it must be monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0), making option C correct.3. Inequality Analysis:To analyze the inequality f(x) - f(x-1) > 3x^2 - 3x + 1, we consider the monotonicity of F(x).- Since F(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty), for x > x-1, F(x) > F(x-1).- The given inequality can be rewritten in terms of F(x), noting that the inequality holds when F(x) > F(x-1).- Given F(x) is even and increasing on (0, +infty), we deduce F(|x|) > F(|x-1|), implying |x| > |x-1|.- Solving |x| > |x-1| leads to x > frac{1}{2}.Therefore, the solution set of the inequality f(x) - f(x-1) > 3x^2 - 3x + 1 is (frac{1}{2}, +infty), making option D correct.Hence, the correct options are boxed{ACD}."},{"problem":"## Task A-3.3.Square A B C D with an area of 36 is placed in the coordinate plane such that side overline{A B} is parallel to the y-axis, and points A, B, and C lie on the graphs of the functions f(x)=3 log _{a} x, g(x)=2 log _{a} x, and h(x)=log _{a} x, respectively.

This is because sqrt{x^2-4x+4} = sqrt{(x-2)^2} = |x-2|.3. The absolute value equation x-2=|x-2| leads us to consider two cases: when x-2 geq 0 and when x-2 < 0.   - If x-2 geq 0, then |x-2| = x-2, which is always true for x geq 2.   - If x-2 < 0, then |x-2| = -(x-2), which cannot hold since it would imply x-2 = -(x-2), leading to x-2 = 0-0, which is not consistent with x-2 < 0.4.

Therefore, we adjust the x-coordinate of (2, -3) as follows:   [   (2 - 2, -3) = (0, -3)   ]Thus, the coordinates of the point obtained after these transformations are boxed{(0, -3)}.Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Among the following real numbers, the smallest real number is:A: 1B: frac{sqrt{2}}{2}C: frac{sqrt{3}}{3}D: frac{sqrt{5}}{5}","solution":"To compare the given real numbers, we first express them in a uniform format:- frac{sqrt{2}}{2} can be rewritten as frac{1}{sqrt{2}}.- frac{sqrt{3}}{3} can be rewritten as frac{1}{sqrt{3}}.- frac{sqrt{5}}{5} can be rewritten as frac{1}{sqrt{5}}.Now, we compare these fractions along with the number 1 based on their denominators:- Since sqrt{2}  frac{1}{sqrt{3}} > frac{1}{sqrt{5}} because as the denominator increases, the value of the fraction decreases.Thus, we have the following order:[1 > frac{1}{sqrt{2}} > frac{1}{sqrt{3}} > frac{1}{sqrt{5}}]Which translates back to the original numbers as:[1 > frac{sqrt{2}}{2} > frac{sqrt{3}}{3} > frac{sqrt{5}}{5}]Therefore, among the given real numbers, the smallest real number is frac{sqrt{5}}{5}.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"5.

Find all integers  x such that  frac {x^{2^n} minus{} 1}{x^{2^m} minus{} 1} is a perfect square.","solution":"1. Expression Simplification:   Given the expression:   [   frac{x^{2^n} - 1}{x^{2^m} - 1}   ]   We can factorize the numerator using the difference of powers:   [   x^{2^n} - 1 = (x^{2^m} - 1)(x^{2^m} + 1)(x^{2^{m+1}} + 1) cdots (x^{2^{n-1}} + 1)   ]   Therefore, the given expression simplifies to:   [   frac{x^{2^n} - 1}{x^{2^m} - 1} = (x^{2^m} + 1)(x^{2^{m+1}} + 1) cdots (x^{2^{n-1}} + 1)   ]2. Parity Analysis:   Since ( n ) and ( m ) have different parity and ( n > m ), the number of terms in the product ((x^{2^m} + 1)(x^{2^{m+1}} + 1) cdots (x^{2^{n-1}} + 1)) is odd.3. Odd ( x ):   If ( x ) is odd, each term ( x^{2^k} + 1 ) (for ( k geq m )) is even because ( x^{2^k} ) is odd and adding 1 makes it even. Since there are an odd number of such terms, the product is divisible by ( 2^l ) where ( l ) is odd. This implies the product cannot be a perfect square because a perfect square must have an even power of 2 in its prime factorization.4. Even ( x ):   If ( x ) is even, each term ( x^{2^k} + 1 ) is odd because ( x^{2^k} ) is even and adding 1 makes it odd. Each term is relatively prime to each other because they are of the form ( x^{2^k} + 1 ) and ( x^{2^j} + 1 ) for different ( k ) and ( j ). For the product to be a perfect square, each term must itself be a perfect square.5. Perfect Square Condition:   Consider ( x^{2^m} + 1 ). For this to be a perfect square, let:   [   x^{2^m} + 1 = k^2   ]   for some integer ( k ). This implies:   [   x^{2^m} = k^2 - 1 = (k-1)(k+1)   ]   Since ( x ) is even, ( x^{2^m} ) is a power of 2. The only way ( (k-1)(k+1) ) can be a power of 2 is if ( k-1 = 1 ) and ( k+1 = 3 ), giving ( k = 2 ). This implies:   [   x^{2^m} = 2 cdot 2 = 4 implies x = 2^{1/2^m}   ]   However, ( x ) must be an integer, and the only integer solution is ( x = 0 ).6.

Let's break down the solution step by step:1. Given Condition and Initial Implications:   - We start with the given condition tan Btan C > 1 > 0.   - Since tan Btan C > 0, both B and C must be acute angles. This is because the tangent of an acute angle is positive. Thus, we have tan B > 0 and tan C > 0.2. Implication on Angle A:   - We know that in any triangle, the sum of angles is pi radians. Therefore, A = pi - (B + C).   - The tangent of the sum of angles B and C can be expressed as tan(B + C) = frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C}. Since B and C are acute, B + C is an obtuse angle, and thus tan(B + C)  0 since tan(pi - x) = -tan(x). Therefore, A is also an acute angle.3. Conclusion for triangle ABC:   - Since all angles A, B, and C are acute, triangle ABC is an acute-angled triangle.   - Conversely, if triangle ABC is an acute-angled triangle, then A, B, and C are all acute, implying B + C is obtuse. Thus, tan(B + C)  0 and tan C > 0, it follows that 1 - tan Btan C  1.Therefore, the condition \\"tan Btan C > 1\\" is both necessary and sufficient for triangle ABC to be an acute-angled triangle.

Understanding the Parabola's Direction: Since the coefficient of x^2 (that is, a) is positive (inferred from the shape of the parabola), the parabola opens upwards.3.

Since the parabola opens upwards and the vertex represents the minimum point in this context, the value of y will be greater than the y-coordinate of the vertex for any x to the left of the vertex.   - Given that the y-coordinate of the vertex is -6, for x lt -2, y must be greater than -6.   - However, from the table, we see that at x = -2, y = -5.

If he had no sons, the land went to the state. No other members of the family gained or lost any land in any other way. In total, there were 180 people in the family. What is the smallest fraction of the original plot that any member of the family could have received?Answer: frac{1}{2 cdot 3^{59}}","solution":"Solution: Consider the person with the smallest share. Let his father have a_{1} sons, his grandfather a_{2}, and so on up to the founder of the lineage, who had a_{n}. Then the share of this person is frac{1}{a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n}}, and we know that a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{n} does not exceed 179 (since the founder of the lineage is definitely not included in this sum).Thus, we are looking for a set of numbers with a sum not exceeding 179 and the maximum product. We will prove that any set, except for the set consisting of 59 threes and one two, does not have the maximum product, as it can be increased.Firstly, if the sum of the numbers in the set is less than 179, add another number to make it equal to 179. The product will not decrease.Secondly, suppose there is a number a geqslant 4 in our set. Replace a with a pair of numbers b and c greater than one, such that b+c=a. We will prove that b c geqslant b+c. Indeed, b c-b-c=(b-1)(c-1)-1, which is non-negative for b and c greater than one.Thirdly, if there is a number 1 in the set, we can replace any number a and 1 with a+1, thereby increasing the product of these numbers by 1.Thus, any set can be transformed into a set of twos and threes without decreasing the product of its numbers.Furthermore, if there are at least three twos, their product is 8. If we replace three twos with two threes, the sum of the numbers remains the same, but the product becomes 9, which is again an increase. Thus, we can ensure that the number of twos is no more than two.Since 179=59 cdot 3+2, the final set will have exactly one two.Therefore, any set of natural numbers with a sum not exceeding 179 can be transformed into a set of 59 threes and one two, and the product of the numbers in the set will not decrease.

Associativity: The operation ( * ) is associative, i.e., for all ( a, b, c in A ),   [   a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c.   ]2. Cancellation Law: If ( a * c = b * c ), then ( a = b ) for all ( a, b, c in A ).3. Existence of Identity Element: There exists an element ( e in A ) such that ( a * e = a ) for all ( a in A ).4. Special Condition: If ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct elements of ( A - {e} ), then   [   a^3 * b = b^3 * a^2,   ]   where ( x^k = x * x^{k-1} ) for all integers ( k ge 2 ) and all ( x in A ).Let's analyze these conditions step by step. Case 1: ( a^2 = e )If ( a^2 = e ), then ( a ) has a cycle of 2. This means ( a * a = e ). - Using the special condition (4), let ( b = a ):  [  a^3 * a = a^3 * a^2.  ]  Since ( a^3 = a * a^2 = a * e = a ), we have:  [  a * a = a^2 = e.  ]  This implies that ( a ) is its own inverse. Case 2: ( a^2 neq e )If ( a^2 neq e ), we need to consider the implications of the special condition (4). Let ( b = a^2 ):  [  a^3 * a^2 = (a^2)^3 * a^2.  ]  Simplifying, we get:  [  a^5 = a^8.  ]  Since ( a^5 = a^8 ), we can multiply both sides by ( a^{-5} ) (assuming ( a ) has an inverse):  [  e = a^3.  ]  This implies that ( a^3 = e ), meaning ( a ) has a cycle of 3. ConclusionFrom the above cases, we see that every non-identity element ( a ) in ( A ) must either have a cycle of 2 or 3. - If ( a ) has a cycle of 2, then ( a^2 = e ).- If ( a ) has a cycle of 3, then ( a^3 = e ).We need to check if we can have elements with different cycles in the same set ( A ). Mixed CyclesSuppose ( a ) has a cycle of 2 and ( b ) has a cycle of 3. Then:  [  a^3 * b = b^3 * a^2.  ]  Since ( a^3 = e ) and ( b^3 = e ), we get:  [  e * b = e * a^2.  ]  This simplifies to:  [  b = a^2.  ]  But ( a^2 = e ) for ( a ) with a cycle of 2, so ( b = e ), which contradicts the assumption that ( b ) is a non-identity element.Thus, all non-identity elements must have the same cycle. Maximum CardinalityIf all non-identity elements have a cycle of 3, the set ( A ) can be:  [  A = {e, a, a^2}.  ]This set has 3 elements and satisfies all the given conditions.Therefore, the largest cardinality ( A ) may have is ( boxed{3} )."},{"problem":"9.

To see why, observe thatp(triangle A D E)=E A+E D+A D<2(E A+E D)=2(E A+E B)<2 p(triangle A B E),Similarly, one can show that p(triangle A B E)<2 p(triangle A D E), proving the desired inequality.This inequality limits the possibility of n to only those in (5 pi, 20 pi) subset(15.7,62.9), so n could only range from 16,17,18, ldots, 62, giving 47 values. These values are all achievable because- when A D approaches zero, we have p(triangle A D E) rightarrow 2 E A and p(triangle A B E) rightarrow 4 E A, implying that p(triangle A D E) rightarrow frac{1}{2} p(triangle A B E)=5 pi- similarly, when A B approaches zero, we have p(triangle A D E) rightarrow 2 p(triangle A B E)=20 pi; and- by continuously rotating segments A C and B D about E, we have that p(triangle A D E) can reach any value between (5 pi, 20 pi).Hence, the answer is 47 ."},{"problem":"Given m+n=3 and m-n=4, the value of m^{2}-n^{2} is:A: 12B: -12C: 25D: -25","solution":"Given the system of equations:1. m+n=32. m-n=4We are asked to find the value of m^{2}-n^{2}.

Consider the colorings of a 5 times 5 table described in the problem (i.e., such that in each column and each row exactly one cell is colored).For convenience, let's introduce some notations. Let the top-left corner cell of the 5 times 5 table be called A, and the bottom-right corner cell be called B. Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored. To find this, we subtract from 120 the number of colorings of the first table where A or B is colored. To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not. This leads to the equation 120=a+96, i.e., a=24. Then b=24 as well.The number of colorings where both A and B are colored is the same as the number of ways to color the central 3 times 3 square. It is easy to see that there are exactly 3!=6 such ways (to choose the colored cell in its top row, there are 3 ways, in the middle row - 2 ways, and in the bottom row - 1 way).Thus, the answer to the problem is the number 120-(24+24-6)=78.## 7th grade"},{"problem":"14.

This implies that the difference between ( f(mn) ) and the product ( f(m) f(n) ) is less than 2017.2.

Convert the terms into a more manageable form:   - The first term, {log_2}3 cdot {log_3}4, can be transformed using the property of logarithms that states log_a b cdot log_b c = log_a c. Applying this, we get:     [     {log_2}3 cdot {log_3}4 = {log_2}3 cdot {log_3}2^2 = 2{log_2}3 cdot {log_3}2     ]   - The second term, {log_4}8, can be simplified using the change of base formula, log_b a = frac{log_c a}{log_c b}.

This is because no matter how many marbles the first player removes (2, 3, 7, or 8), the second player can always remove marbles such that the total number of marbles removed is ( 10 ).

Further Analysis:   - If ( n equiv 1 pmod{5} ), the first player loses the game. This is because every move results in ( n equiv 3 ) or ( 4 pmod{5} ), which allows the second player to win by the inductive hypothesis.   - If ( n equiv 4 pmod{5} ), the first player wins the game.

If x=sqrt{3}, in triangle B C E, C E^{2}+1^{2}-2 C E cdot cos frac{pi}{3}=3. Solving, we get C E=2.  At this time, E coincides with C_{1}, which is not feasible, so we discard it. Thus, x=1, E B=1.  Draw E G perp B_{1} A_{1}, then E G perp plane B C C_{1} B_{1}.  Therefore, G E perp E B_{1} and G E is in plane A_{1} B_{1} E.  Also, by the given A E perp E B_{1}, hence angle A E G is the plane angle of the dihedral angle A-E B_{1}-A_{1}.  Since E G / / B_{1} A_{1} / / B A, angle A E G=angle B A E. Therefore, tan angle A E G=frac{B E}{A B}=frac{1}{sqrt{2}}=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.  Solution 2: As shown in Figure 15-7, with B as the origin, overrightarrow{B B_{1}}, overrightarrow{B A} as the y-axis, z-axis respectively, establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system, then B(0,0,0), A(0,0, sqrt{2}), B_{1}(0,2,0), Cleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2},-frac{1}{2}, 0right), C_{1}left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{3}{2}, 0right). Let Eleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, a, 0right), from E A perp E B_{1} we get overrightarrow{E A} cdot overrightarrow{E B_{1}}=0.That is, 0=left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2},-a, sqrt{2}right) cdotleft(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, 2-a, 0right)=frac{3}{4}+a(a-2)Solving, we get a=frac{1}{2} or a=frac{3}{2} (discard), hence Eleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{1}{2}, 0right).  By the given, overrightarrow{E A} perp overrightarrow{E B_{1}}, overrightarrow{B_{1} A_{1}} perp overrightarrow{E B_{1}},  Therefore, the plane angle theta of the dihedral angle A-E B_{1}-A_{1} is the angle between vectors overrightarrow{B_{1} A_{1}} and overrightarrow{E A}.  Since overrightarrow{B_{1} A_{1}}=overrightarrow{B A}=(0,0, sqrt{2}), overrightarrow{E A}=left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2},-frac{1}{2}, sqrt{2}right)  Thus, cos leftlangleoverrightarrow{E A} cdot overrightarrow{B_{1} A_{1}}rightrangle=frac{overrightarrow{E A} cdot overrightarrow{B_{1} overrightarrow{A_{1}}}}{|overrightarrow{E A}| cdotleft|overrightarrow{B_{1} A_{1}}right|}=frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{3}}  Hence, tan leftlangleoverrightarrow{E A}, overrightarrow{B_{1} A_{1}}rightrangle=frac{sqrt{2}}{2} is the required value."},{"problem":"10、Person A and Person B start from locations A and B respectively at the same time and walk towards each other.

Therefore, we get the equation frac{1200-frac{S y}{2 x}}{2 y}=frac{frac{S}{2}-1200}{x}. Since both finally arrive at the same time, we have frac{S}{x}=frac{S}{2 x}+frac{S-frac{S y}{2 x}}{2 y}.

Then, the expression becomes (frac{8(9999 - k)}{k} = frac{8 cdot 9999 - 8k}{k} = frac{79992 - 8k}{k}).3. For (frac{79992 - 8k}{k}) to be an integer, ( 79992 - 8k ) must be divisible by ( k ). This implies that ( 79992 ) must be divisible by ( k ).4. We need to find the values of ( k ) such that ( 9999 - k ) is between ( 1 ) and ( 2014 ). This translates to ( 7985 leq k leq 9998 ).5.

The only integer divisor of ( 79992 ) between ( 8.001 ) and ( 10.02 ) is ( 9 ). Therefore, the only divisor of ( 79992 ) from ( 7985 ) to ( 9998 ) is:   [   frac{79992}{9} = 8888   ]9. This shows that the only possible value of ( k ) is ( 8888 ). Therefore, ( 9999 - n = 8888 implies n = 9999 - 8888 = 1111 ).10.

The plane M B N is perpendicular to the plane A K C. B M and B N are medians of the equal isosceles triangle A K B and triangle C K B, drawn to their lateral sides. Therefore, B M = B N. Q is the point of intersection of the midline M N and the median K E of triangle A K C. Consequently, Q is the midpoint of K E and M N, and since B M = B N, B Q is the height and median of triangle M B N. Since the planes M B N and A K C are perpendicular, the segment B Q is perpendicular to the plane A K C and, therefore, B Q perp K E. Thus, B Q is the median and height of triangle K B E. It follows that B K = B E. Let B K = B E = 1. Then B O = frac{2}{3}, O E = frac{1}{3}.

Therefore, the distance covered upstream is the product of speed and time, which gives us 2(a - b) km.- Difference in Distance:  - To find how many kilometers more the boat travels downstream than upstream, we subtract the distance traveled upstream from the distance traveled downstream.  - This calculation is as follows: 3(a + b) - 2(a - b).  - Expanding and simplifying the expression, we get: 3a + 3b - 2a + 2b = a + 5b km.Therefore, the boat travels boxed{a + 5b} kilometers more downstream than upstream."},{"problem":"Given three boxes numbered 1, 2, and 3, where box 1 contains two balls labeled 1, one ball labeled 2, and one ball labeled 3; box 2 contains two balls labeled 1 and one ball labeled 3; and box 3 contains three balls labeled 1 and two balls labeled 2.

Since overrightarrow{F B} and overrightarrow{A F} are in the same direction, lambda represents the ratio of the lengths of overrightarrow{F B} and overrightarrow{A F}. Therefore, we can consider using the polar equation of a parabola to solve the problem.As shown in Figure 2, with F as the pole and F x as the polar axis, we establish a polar coordinate system. Thus, we only need to find the range of the inclination angle angle B F x.The polar equation of the parabola isrho=frac{2}{1-cos theta} .According to the problem, point B may be on the parabola in the first quadrant or the fourth quadrant.(1) When B is a point on the parabola in the first quadrant, let Bleft(rho_{1}, thetaright)left(angle B F x=theta, 0<theta<frac{pi}{2}right). Then point Aleft(rho_{2}, theta+piright).Thus, |overrightarrow{F B}|=rho_{1}=frac{2}{1-cos theta},|overrightarrow{A F}|=rho_{2}=frac{2}{1+cos theta}.From overrightarrow{F B}=lambda overrightarrow{A F}, we get |overrightarrow{F B}|=lambda|overrightarrow{A F}|.Therefore, lambda=frac{|overrightarrow{F B}|}{|overrightarrow{A F}|}=frac{1+cos theta}{1-cos theta}.Since lambda in[4,9], we have4 leqslant frac{1+cos theta}{1-cos theta} leqslant 9left(0<theta<frac{pi}{2}right).Solving this, we get cos theta inleft[frac{3}{5}, frac{4}{5}right].Noting that the slope k of line l satisfiesk^{2}=tan ^{2} theta=frac{1}{cos ^{2} theta}-1 inleft[frac{9}{16}, frac{16}{9}right].Since 0<theta<frac{pi}{2}, we get frac{3}{4} leqslant k leqslant frac{4}{3}.(2) When B is a point on the parabola in the fourth quadrant, by symmetry, we easily find -frac{4}{3} leqslant k leqslant-frac{3}{4}.In the original Cartesian coordinate system, the equation of l is y=k(x-1).Thus, the y-intercept of l isb=-k inleft[-frac{4}{3},-frac{3}{4}right] cupleft[frac{3}{4}, frac{4}{3}right] ."},{"problem":"If x=2 y and y neq 0, then (x-y)(2 x+y) equals(A) 5 y^{2}(B) y^{2}(C) 3 y^{2}(D) 6 y^{2}(E) 4 y^{2}","solution":"Since x=2 y, then (x-y)(2 x+y)=(2 y-y)(2(2 y)+y)=(y)(5 y)=5 y^{2}.ANSWER: (A)"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementAre the vectors c_{1 text { and }} c_{2}, constructed from vectors a text{ and } b, collinear?a={3 ; 4 ;-1}b={2 ;-1 ; 1}c_{1}=6 a-3 bc_{2}=b-2 a","solution":"## SolutionVectors are collinear if there exists a number gamma such that c_{1}=gamma cdot c_{2}.

Claim: All ( n equiv 1, 2 pmod{3} ) are the only working ( n ).2. Proof by Induction:   - Base Case: For ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ):     - When ( n = 1 ), there is only one coin, and it can be flipped to tails in one move.     - When ( n = 2 ), there are 3 coins forming a small equilateral triangle. Flipping all three coins once will turn them all to tails.     - Thus, the base cases hold.   - Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for some ( n equiv 1, 2 pmod{3} ). We need to show it holds for ( n + 3 ).     - Consider a triangle of side length ( n + 3 ). Flip each possible set of three mutually adjacent coins once.     - The coins at the corners of the larger triangle have been flipped once, so they become tails.     - The coins along the sides of the triangle have each been flipped three times, so they also become tails.     - The interior coins have each been flipped six times, and they form a smaller triangle of side length ( n ).     - By the induction hypothesis, since ( n equiv 1, 2 pmod{3} ), all coins in the smaller triangle can be turned to tails.     - Therefore, all coins in the larger triangle of side length ( n + 3 ) can also be turned to tails.3. Proof that ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ) does not work:   - Color the coins yellow, red, and blue such that any three adjacent coins are different colors.   - If the corners are all yellow, there will be one more yellow coin than red or blue coins.   - The parity of the number of yellow heads differs from that of the number of red heads.   - Each move changes the parity of the number of heads of each color.   - To have all coins be tails, the parity of each colored coin must be the same, which is not possible.   - Hence, ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ) does not work.4. Conclusion:   - The values of ( n ) that work are those for which ( n equiv 1, 2 pmod{3} ).   - The range of ( n ) is ( 1 leq n leq 100 ).   - The number of such ( n ) is calculated as follows:     - For ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ): ( 1, 4, 7, ldots, 100 ) (arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 3).     - For ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ): ( 2, 5, 8, ldots, 98 ) (arithmetic sequence with first term 2 and common difference 3).     - Each sequence has 34 terms (since ( frac{100 - 1}{3} + 1 = 34 ) and ( frac{98 - 2}{3} + 1 = 33 )).     - Total number of values is ( 34 + 33 = 67 ).The final answer is (boxed{67})"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = log_a(x+1) + b (a>0 and a neq 1), the graph always passes through point A(m, 3).

Thus, the only integer values that the expression can take are 1, 2, or 3.Let sqrt{1-x^{2}}+sqrt{5 x-x^{2}}=a and eliminate the roots. Instead of expressing the expression in this form, let's square sqrt{1-x^{2}}=a-sqrt{5 x-x^{2}}, which gives us 1-x^{2}=a^{2}-2 a sqrt{5 x-x^{2}}+5 x-x^{2} or 2 a sqrt{5 x-x^{2}}=a^{2}-1+5 x.

Now consider an arbitrary arrangement of the numbers. Then exclude the square with the greatest number in each column. The least of the numbers in excluded squares is not less than 100, the second least is not less than 200 , etc, the greatest number in excluded square is 10000 . Hence, the sum of the excluded numbers is at least 100+200+ldots+10000=505000, while the sum ofnumbers in the whole square is 50005000 . It means that the sum of the remaining numbers is at most 49500000 .The 9900 squares which are left can be split into 99 distinct paths. The first path consists of the lowest squares in each column which are not excluded, the second path consists of the lowest squares in each column which are not excluded and not included into the first path, etc. The last path will include the uppermost squares in each column which are not excluded. It is easy to see that all 99 paths are proper paths that Max's token can follow, because any two squares in two adjacent columns either lie in the same row or in two adjacent rows.The total cost of the constructed 99 paths is not greater than 49500000 , therefore one of these paths costs at most 500000 coins. Thus in every arrangement of numbers Max can pay less than or equal to 500000 coins.We proved that Max can pay 500000 coins or less while Ann can make Max pay at least 500000 coins, so the answer is 500000 .Alternate proof of the upper bound.

These squares form a path from the square in the left column to the square in the right column; denote the cost of this path as S. In each column of the rectangle, the minimal number is less than the other number by at least 1 . Hence, the total sum of the numbers in the rectangle is at least 2 S+100.

Express (k) in terms of (u) and (v):   Let (k = 3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2). Define (u = x + y) and (v = x - y). Then,   [   k = frac{u^2 + 5v^2}{2}   ]   This transformation helps us analyze the properties of (k).2. Consider any prime (p) dividing (k):   Since ((k, 30) = 1), it follows that (p ge 7). If (p) divides both (u) and (v), then (k ge 3p^2 ge 147). We assume (p nmid u) and (p nmid v).3. Analyze the quadratic residue ((-5/p)):   We need to consider the cases based on the value of (p mod 4).   Case 1: (p equiv 1 pmod{4})   - Here, ((-1/p) = 1), so ((5/p) = 1).   - By quadratic reciprocity, ((5/p)(p/5) = 1), which implies ((p/5) = 1).   - Since (p neq 5), it follows that (p equiv pm 1 pmod{4}). Consequently, (p equiv 1 pmod{20}) or (p equiv 9 pmod{20}).   Case 2: (p equiv 3 pmod{4})   - Here, ((-1/p) = -1), so ((5/p) = -1).   - By quadratic reciprocity, ((5/p)(p/5) = 1), which implies ((p/5) = -1).   - Hence, (p equiv pm 2 pmod{5}). This yields (p equiv 7 pmod{20}) or (p equiv 3 pmod{20}).4. Combine the cases:   Combining the results from both cases, we find that (p in {1, 3, 7, 9} pmod{20}) for any prime (p) dividing (k = 3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2 = frac{u^2 + 5v^2}{2}).5. Find the smallest such prime (p):   The smallest prime (p) in the set ({1, 3, 7, 9} pmod{20}) is (23). Therefore, (k ge 23).6. Verify with an example:   We need to find (u) and (v) such that (u^2 + 5v^2 = 46). One solution is ((u, v) = (1, 3)), which gives ((x, y) = (2, -1)). Thus, (k = 23).7. Check divisibility:   For ((x, y) = (2, -1)), we have (k = 23).

The sine function completes a full cycle over 2pi, so for sin omega x to be increasing in the given interval, we need to ensure that the interval covers no more than a quarter of the sine wave's period (from its increasing part through the maximum point). This leads to two conditions:1. The length of the interval [-frac{{2pi}}{3}, frac{pi}{3}] is frac{pi}{3} + frac{2pi}{3} = pi, which should be no more than half the period of sin omega x, giving frac{1}{2} times frac{2pi}{omega} geq pi Rightarrow omega leq frac{3}{4}.2.

The last digit of a square number can only take the values (0,1,4,5,6,9).For the sum of two square numbers to have the last digit 2, the last digits of (r^{2}, s^{2}) can only be 1,6, and thus the last digits of (r, s) can only be 1,4,6,9. Therefore, (r, s in{9,11,14,16,19}) and it is found that ((r, s)=(11,19)) or ((r, s)=(19,11)) must hold.

When 1989 is decomposed into: 199+199+cdots+199+198, the corresponding product is 199^{9} times 198. Below is the proof that it is the largest. Since the number of decompositions is finite, the maximum value must exist, so we can assume the decomposition left(x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{10}right), where x_{1}+x_{2}+cdots+x_{10}=1989, is one of the decompositions with the largest product x_{1} x_{2} cdots x_{10}. If any of x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{10} is less than 198, let it be x_{1}, then there must be one greater than 198, let it be x_{10}. Let x_{1}^{prime}=x_{1}+left(x_{10}-198right), x_{10}^{prime}=198, then we get a new decomposition left(x_{1}^{prime}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{9}, x_{10}^{prime}right), with the corresponding product x^{prime}{ }_{1} x_{2} cdots x_{9} x_{10}^{prime}.

Therefore, x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{10} are all not less than 198. If any of x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{10} is greater than 199, let it be x_{1}, then there must be one less than 199, let it be x_{10}. Since x_{10} is not less than 198, so x_{10}= 198. Let x_{1}^{prime}=x_{1}-1, x_{10}^{prime}=x_{10}+1, then we get a new decomposition left(x_{1}^{prime}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{9}right., left.x_{10}^{prime}right), with the corresponding product x_{1}^{prime} x_{2} cdots x_{9} x_{10}^{prime}. But x_{1}^{prime} x_{10}^{prime}-x_{1} x_{10}=left(x_{1}-1right)left(x_{10}+1right)- x_{1} x_{10}=x_{1} x_{10}+x_{1}-x_{10}-1-x_{1} x_{10}=x_{1}-x_{10}-1=x_{1}-198-1=x_{1}- 199>0, so x_{1}^{prime} x_{2} cdots x_{9} x_{10}^{prime}>x_{1} x_{2} cdots x_{10}, which is a contradiction. Therefore, x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{10} can only be 199 or 198, thus the decomposition: 199+199+cdots+199+198 corresponds to the product 199^{9} times 198 being the largest."},{"problem":"In an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, it is given that a_5 + a_7 = 16 and a_3 = 4.

We must figure out the sum x+y. The volume of the box is divisible by 7 , and so is the volume of any 2 times 3 times 7 brick. The volume of a 2 times 5 times 8 brick is not divisible by 7 , which means that x must be divisible by 7 .The volume of the box is 10 cdot 11 cdot 14. The volume of the 2 times 5 times 8 bricks in the box is x cdot 2 cdot 5 cdot 8=80 x. Since this volume cannot exceed the volume of the box, we must havex leqslant frac{10 cdot 11 cdot 14}{80}=frac{11 cdot 7}{4}=frac{77}{4}<20 .Since x was divisible by 7 , and certainly nonnegative, we conclude that x must be 0,7 or 14 . Let us explore each of these possibilities separately.If we had x=0, then the volume of the 2 times 3 times 7 bricks, which is y cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 7, would be equal to the volume of the box, which is 10 cdot 11 cdot 14. However, this is not possible since the volume of the 2 times 3 times 7 bricks is divisible by three whereas the volume of the box is not.

Therefore, we have:a_n = 1 + (n-1)d.The sum of the first n terms, S_n, is thus:S_n = frac{n[1 + 1 + (n-1)d]}{2} = frac{n[2 + (n-1)d]}{2}. This leads to:sqrt{S_n} = sqrt{frac{n[2 + (n-1)d]}{2}}. Considering specific values, we obtain:sqrt{S_1} = 1,sqrt{S_2} = sqrt{2 + d},sqrt{S_3} = sqrt{3 + 3d}. Since {sqrt{S_n}} is also an arithmetic sequence, we have:2sqrt{S_2} = sqrt{S_1} + sqrt{S_3}.Substituting the values we calculated, we get:2sqrt{2 + d} = 1 + sqrt{3 + 3d}.Upon solving, we find d = 2.As a result, we have:S_{n+10} = (n+10)^2,a_n^2 = (2n - 1)^2.This gives us the expression:frac{S_{n+10}}{a_n^2} = left(frac{n+10}{2n-1}right)^2 = left(frac{1}{2} + frac{21}{4n-2}right)^2.The sequence left{left(frac{1}{2} + frac{21}{4n-2}right)^2right} is monotonically decreasing because the numerator is fixed and the denominator increases as n increases, leading to smaller and smaller fractions. Hence, the maximum value of frac{S_{n+10}}{a_n^2} is attained for n=1, which is:frac{S_{n+10}}{a_n^2} leq frac{S_{11}}{a_1^2} = 11^2 = 121.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{121}, which corresponds to option D."},{"problem":"22.

Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers in a unique way. (If the positive integer is itself prime, this product consists of only the prime number.) This fact is called the \\"Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\\". This fact is often seen implicitly in finding a \\"factor tree\\" for a given integer. For example, 1500 is equal to 2^{2} times 3^{1} times 5^{3} and there is no other way of writing 1500 as a product of prime numbers. Note that rearranging the same prime factors in a different order does not count as a different factorization.F2. If n is a positive integer and d is a positive integer that is a divisor of n, then the only possible prime factors of d are the prime factors of n. For example, if d is a positive divisor of n=1500, then the only possible prime factors of d are 2,3 and 5 . This means, for example, that d cannot be divisible by 7 or by 11 or by any other prime number not equal to 2,3 or 5 . d might or might not be divisible by each of 2,3 or 5 .F3. If n is a positive integer, d is a positive integer that is a divisor of n, and p is a prime factor of both n and d, then p cannot divide d \\"more times\\" than it divides n. For example, if d is a positive divisor of n=1500=2^{2} times 3^{1} times 5^{3} that is divisible by 5 , then d can be divisible by 5 or by 5^{2} or by 5^{3} but cannot be divisible by 5^{4} or by 5^{5} or by any larger power of 5 .From these facts, the positive divisors of N=p_{1}^{a_{1}} p_{2}^{a_{2}} cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}} are the integers of the formd=p_{1}^{b_{1}} p_{2}^{b_{2}} cdots p_{k}^{b_{k}}where b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{k} are non-negative integers with 0 leq b_{1} leq a_{1}, 0 leq b_{2} leq a_{2}, and so on.This means that there are a_{1}+1 possible values for b_{1}, namely 0,1,2, ldots, a_{1}.Similarly, there are a_{2}+1 possible values for b_{2}, a_{3}+1 possible values for b_{3}, and so on.Since every combination of these possible values gives a different divisor d, then there are left(a_{1}+1right)left(a_{2}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right) positive divisors.Suppose that n has prime factorization 2^{r} 5^{s} p_{3}^{a_{3}} p_{4}^{a_{4}} cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}} for some distinct prime numbers p_{3}, p_{4}, ldots, p_{k} none of which equal 2 or 5 , for some positive integers a_{3}, a_{4}, ldots, a_{k}, and some non-negative integers r and s.We have written n this way to allow us to pay special attention to the possible prime factors of 2 and 5 .This means thatbegin{aligned}& 2 n=2^{r+1} 5^{s} p_{3}^{a_{3}} p_{4}^{a_{4}} cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}} & 5 n=2^{r} 5^{s+1} p_{3}^{a_{3}} p_{4}^{a_{4}} cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}}end{aligned}Since 2 n has 64 positive divisors and 5 n has 60 positive divisors, thenbegin{aligned}& (r+2)(s+1)left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=64 & (r+1)(s+2)left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=60end{aligned}Since every factor in the two expressions on the left is a positive integer, thenleft(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)is a positive common divisor of 64 and of 60 .The positive divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 .Of these, only 1, 2, 4 are divisors of 60 .Therefore, left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right) equals 1 , 2 or 4 .Since each of a_{3}, a_{4}, ldots, a_{k} is a positive integer, then each of a_{3}+1, a_{4}+1, ldots, a_{k}+1 is at least 2.Case 1: left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=4The only ways in which 4 can be written as a product of positive integers each at least 2 are 2 times 2 and 4 (a product of one integer is itself).Thus, either k=4 with a_{3}+1=a_{4}+1=2 (giving a_{3}=a_{4}=1 ), or k=3 with a_{3}+1=4 (giving a_{3}=3 ).Sincebegin{aligned}& (r+2)(s+1)left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=64 & (r+1)(s+2)left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=60end{aligned}then, after simplification, we havebegin{aligned}& (r+2)(s+1)=16 & (r+1)(s+2)=15end{aligned}Expanding the left sides of the two equations, we obtainbegin{aligned}& r s+r+2 s+2=16 & r s+2 r+s+2=15end{aligned}Subtracting the second of these equations from the first, we obtain -r+s=1 and so s=r+1. Substituting into the equation (r+2)(s+1)=16, we obtain (r+2)(r+2)=16. Since r>0, then (r+2)^{2}=16 gives r+2=4 and so r=2, which gives s=3.Therefore, we could have r=2, s=3.Combining with the possible values of a_{3} and a_{4}, this means that we could have n=2^{2} 5^{3} p_{3} p_{4} for some primes p_{3} and p_{4} not equal to 2 or 5 , or n=2^{2} 5^{3} p_{3}^{3} for some prime p_{3} not equal to 2 or 5 .We can verify that 2 n and 5 n have the correct number of positive divisors in each case.Case 2: left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=2The only way in which 2 can be written as a product of positive integers each at least 2 is 2 .Thus, k=3 with a_{3}+1=2 (giving a_{3}=1 ).Sincebegin{aligned}& (r+2)(s+1)left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=64 & (r+1)(s+2)left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=60end{aligned}thenbegin{aligned}& (r+2)(s+1)=32 & (r+1)(s+2)=30end{aligned}We could proceed as in Case 1.Alternatively, knowing that r and s are non-negative integers, then the possibilities from the first equation are| r+2 | s+1 | r | s | r+1 | s+2 | (r+2)(s+1) || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 32 | 1 | 30 | 0 | 31 | 2 | 62 || 16 | 2 | 14 | 1 | 15 | 3 | 45 || 8 | 4 | 6 | 3 | 7 | 5 | 35 || 4 | 8 | 2 | 7 | 3 | 9 | 27 || 2 | 16 | 0 | 15 | 1 | 17 | 17 || 1 | 32 | -1 | 31 | 0 | 33 | 0 |There are no values of r and s that work in this case.Case 3: left(a_{3}+1right)left(a_{4}+1right) cdotsleft(a_{k}+1right)=1Since each factor on the left side is supposedly at least 2 , what can this mean? This actually means that there are no factors on the left side. In other words, k=2 and n=2^{r} 5^{s}.(See if you can follow the argument before Case 1 through to verify that there are no contradictions.)Here,begin{aligned}& (r+2)(s+1)=64 & (r+1)(s+2)=60end{aligned}Knowing that r and s are non-negative integers, then the possibilities from the first equation are| r+2 | s+1 | r | s | r+1 | s+2 | (r+2)(s+1) || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 64 | 1 | 62 | 0 | 63 | 2 | 126 || 32 | 2 | 30 | 1 | 31 | 3 | 93 || 16 | 4 | 14 | 3 | 15 | 5 | 45 || 8 | 8 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 9 | 63 || 4 | 16 | 2 | 13 | 3 | 15 | 51 || 2 | 32 | 0 | 31 | 1 | 33 | 33 || 1 | 64 | -1 | 63 | 0 | 65 | 0 |There are no values of r and s that work in this case.Therefore, combining the results of the three cases, the positive integer n satisfies the given conditions exactly when- n=2^{2} 5^{3} p_{3} p_{4}=500 p_{3} p_{4} for some primes p_{3} and p_{4} not equal to 2 or 5 , or- n=2^{2} 5^{3} p_{3}^{3}=500 p_{3}^{3} for some prime p_{3} not equal to 2 or 5 .Since n leq 20000, then either- 500 p_{3} p_{4} leq 20000 which gives p_{3} p_{4} leq 40, or- 500 p_{3}^{3} leq 20000 which gives p_{3}^{3} leq 40.It remains to determine the number of pairs of primes p_{3} and p_{4} that are not equal to 2 or 5 with product less than 40 , and the number of primes p_{3} that are not equal to 2 or 5 whose cube is less than 40 .In the first case, the possibilities are:3 times 7=21 quad 3 times 11=33 quad 3 times 13=39The order of p_{3} and p_{4} does not matter as switching the order gives the same value for n. We note as well that we cannot have both p_{3} and p_{4} at least 7 and have their product at most 40 . In the second case, the only possibility is p_{3}^{3}=3^{3}.This means that there are 4 possible values of n that satisfy the given conditions."},{"problem":"# 7.

First of all, let's determine for which numbers (x, y, z) the triples ((x_n, y_n, z_n)) and ((x, y, z)) can coincide. Since all triples of numbers starting from (x_1, y_1, z_1) are non-negative, the numbers (x), (y), and (z) must also be non-negative. Let's agree to consider that (x geqslant y geqslant z) and (x_i geqslant y_i geqslant z_i) for all (i=1,2,3, ldots). Since, obviously, (x_i = x_{i-1} - z_{i-1}) for all (i geqslant 1) (where (x_0) and (z_0) are understood to be the numbers (x) and (z)), it follows that (x geqslant x_1 geqslant x_2 geqslant x_3 geqslant ldots), and if at least one number (z_i (i=0,1,2, ldots)) is greater than zero, then (x_{i+1}) is also less than (x); therefore, if (x_n = x), then (z_i = 0) for (i=0,1, ldots, n-1). Thus, it must be that (z=0) and (z_1=0), from which it follows that either (y=x) (and (z_1 = x - y = 0)), or (y = z = 0) (and (z_1 = y - z = 0)).

This assumption helps us to order the primes and simplify the comparison.   2. Identify the largest prime. Clearly, (a + b + c) is the largest prime among the given set because it is the sum of all three positive integers (a, b, c).3. Identify the smallest prime. We need to compare (b + c - a) with (c):   [   c - (b + c - a) = a - b > 0 implies c > b + c - a   ]   Therefore, (b + c - a) is the smallest prime.4. Calculate the difference (d) between the largest and smallest primes:   [   d = (a + b + c) - (b + c - a) = 2a   ]   Thus, (d) is maximized when (a) is maximized.5.

Maximize (a):   - For (a + b = 800), since (a > b), the maximum value of (a) is 797 (since (b) must be at least 3, the smallest odd prime).   - For (a + c = 800), similarly, the maximum value of (a) is 797 (since (c) must be at least 3, the smallest odd prime).7.

During the sales period, it was found that when the selling price is set at 40 yuan, 600 units can be sold per day. Due to the high demand, the merchant decided to increase the selling price. After market research, it was discovered that for every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the daily sales volume decreases by 10 units.(1) When the selling price is 50 yuan, the merchant earns ______ yuan per day;(2) The price management department stipulates that the selling price of the product should not be less than 40 yuan and not more than 60 yuan. At what price should the selling price of the product be set so that the merchant maximizes the profit w yuan per day? What is the maximum profit in yuan?","solution":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into the two parts as asked: Part 1: Profit when the selling price is 50 yuan1. Determine the profit per unit: The cost price is 30 yuan, and the selling price is set at 50 yuan. Therefore, the profit per unit is calculated as:   text{Profit per unit} = text{Selling price} - text{Cost price} = 50 - 30 = 20 text{ yuan}2. Calculate the number of units sold: For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price above 40 yuan, the daily sales volume decreases by 10 units. Since the selling price is increased from 40 yuan to 50 yuan, which is a 10 yuan increase, the decrease in units sold is 10 times 10 = 100 units. Originally, 600 units could be sold at 40 yuan, so the new sales volume is:   text{New sales volume} = 600 - 100 = 500 text{ units}3. Compute the daily profit: The daily profit can be found by multiplying the profit per unit by the number of units sold:   text{Daily profit} = text{Profit per unit} times text{New sales volume} = 20 times 500 = 10000 text{ yuan}Therefore, the merchant earns boxed{10000} yuan per day when the selling price is 50 yuan. Part 2: Maximum Profit within the Price Range of 40 to 60 yuan1. Define variables: Let the selling price be x yuan. Then, the profit per unit is (x - 30) yuan, and the number of units sold is 600 - (x - 40) times 10 = 1000 - 10x units.2. Formulate the profit function: The total profit, w, can be expressed as the product of the profit per unit and the number of units sold:   w = (1000 - 10x)(x - 30)   Expanding this, we get:   w = -10x^2 + 1000x - 10x times 30 + 30000   Simplifying, we find:   w = -10x^2 + 1000x - 300x + 30000   w = -10x^2 + 700x + 30000   Further simplification gives us the quadratic equation in the form of:   w = -10(x^2 - 70x + 3000)   Completing the square, we get:   w = -10(x^2 - 70x + 1225) + 12250   w = -10(x - 65)^2 + 122503. Determine the maximum profit: Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex represents the maximum point. The vertex occurs at x = 65, but since the selling price must be between 40 and 60 yuan, we consider the upper limit, x = 60 yuan, to maximize profit within the given constraints.4. Calculate the maximum profit: Substituting x = 60 into the profit function:   w = -10(60 - 65)^2 + 12250   w = -10(-5)^2 + 12250   w = -10(25) + 12250   w = -250 + 12250   w = 12000 text{ yuan}Thus, the selling price should be set at boxed{60} yuan to maximize the profit, and the maximum profit is boxed{12000} yuan per day."},{"problem":"A water fountain flows at a steady rate of 500 mathrm{~mL} every 6 seconds.

Then the number of ordered tuples left(k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{l}right) that satisfy the indeterminate equation k_{1}+k_{2}+cdots+k_{l}=k is mathrm{C}_{k-l-1}^{l-1}.Proof Let k_{i}^{prime}=k_{i}-1.Then k_{i}^{prime} geqslant 1.The indeterminate equation in the problem becomesk_{1}^{prime}+k_{2}^{prime}+cdots+k_{l}^{prime}=k-l.And l leqslantleft[frac{k}{2}right] Rightarrow l leqslant frac{k}{2}Rightarrow k-l-1 geqslant l-1 text {. }Using the partition principle, we know that the number of solutions to equation (1), i.e., the number of ordered tuples left(k_{1}^{prime}, k_{2}^{prime}, cdots, k_{l}^{prime}right), is mathrm{C}_{k-l-1}^{l-1}.Thus, the number of ordered tuples left(k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{l}right) that satisfy the original indeterminate equation is mathrm{C}_{k-l-1}^{l-1}.Returning to the original problem.Let the k-element subset of set M be left{a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{k}right}, where, a_{1}a_{k_{1}}+1, similar to the process of obtaining equation (2), we knowa_{k_{1}+2}=a_{k_{1}+1}+1.Thus, we can assume that a_{k_{1}+1}, a_{k_{1}+2}, cdots, a_{k_{1}+k_{2}}left(k_{2} geqslant 2right) are k_{2} consecutive positive integers.Proceeding similarly, the k(k geqslant 3)-element subset of set M without isolated elements, when arranged in ascending order, must consist of one or two or more segments of consecutive positive integers, each segment having a length of at least 2.Assume there are l(l geqslant 1) segments, with the number of consecutive positive integers in each segment being k_{i}(i=1,2, cdots, l), andk_{1}+k_{2}+cdots+k_{l}=k, where, k_{i} in mathbf{Z}_{+}, k_{i} geqslant 2, i=1,2, cdots, l.The above equation represents the partition of k into l ordered positive integers, each at least 2.By the lemma, we know that the number of ordered tuples left(k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{l}right) (the number of partition methods) is mathrm{C}_{k-l-1}^{l-1}.For a given ordered partition left(k_{1}^{*}, k_{2}^{*}, cdots, k_{l}^{*}right), i.e., there are l segments, with the number of consecutive positive integers in each segment being k_{1}^{*}, k_{2}^{*}, cdots, k_{l}^{*}, the number of k-element subsets without isolated elements that satisfy this condition is mathrm{C}_{n-k+1}^{l}.Below is the proof.Assume there are n identical balls (not numbered yet).【Step 1】Take k balls from these n balls and divide them into l groups, with the number of balls in each group being k_{1}^{*}, k_{2}^{*}, cdots, k_{l}^{*};【Step 2】Arrange the remaining n-k balls in a row, with n-k+1 \\"gaps\\" (including the first and last gaps);【Step 3】Insert the l groups of balls from Step 1 into l of the n-k+1 gaps, arranging them in a row. The number of ways to insert the l groups of balls is the combination number of choosing l gaps from n-k+1 gaps, i.e., mathrm{C}_{n-k+1}^{l}(l leqslant n-k+1);【Step 4】Number the n balls from left to right with 1,2, cdots, n. This way, the numbers corresponding to the k balls inserted in Step 3 are a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{k}, and the k-element subset left{a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{k}right} is a k-element subset without isolated elements that satisfies the problem's conditions.Thus, we know that the number of k-element subsets without isolated elements that satisfy the ordered tuple left(k_{1}^{*}, k_{2}^{*}, cdots, k_{l}^{*}right), i.e., with l segments, each segment having k_{1}^{*}, k_{2}^{*}, cdots, k_{l}^{*} consecutive positive integers, is mathrm{C}_{n-k+1}^{l}.Using the multiplication principle, we know that the number of k-element subsets without isolated elements with l segments is mathrm{C}_{k-l-1}^{l-1} mathrm{C}_{n-k+1}^{l}.Since l leqslantleft[frac{k}{2}right], and l leqslant n-k+1, and taking r=min left{left[frac{k}{2}right], n-k+1right},we have 1 leqslant l leqslant r, i.e., l takes the values 1,2, cdots, r.Using the addition principle, we getP_{k}=sum_{l=1}^{r} mathrm{C}_{k-l-1}^{l-1} mathrm{C}_{n-k+1}^{l}."},{"problem":"The degree of (x^2+1)^4 (x^3+1)^3 as a polynomial in x istext{(A)}  5 qquad text{(B)}  7 qquad text{(C)}  12 qquad text{(D)}  17 qquad text{(E)}  72","solution":"It becomes (x^{8}+...)(x^{9}+...) with 8 being the degree of the first factor and 9 being the degree of the second factor, making the degree of the whole thing 17, or boxed{(D)}"},{"problem":"If two distinct numbers are randomly chosen from the set {1,2,3,4,5}, what is the probability that their sum is an odd number?","solution":"There are two methods to solve this problem:Method 1: CombinatoricsThere are a total of binom{5}{2} = 10 different ways of picking 2 distinct numbers out of the 5 available.

Base Case:   For (n = 1), the bird can only have one color. Therefore, the bird can live for only 1 day. This satisfies the condition since there are no consecutive days to compare.2. Inductive Hypothesis:   Assume that for (i < n), the bird can live for at most (2i - 1) days with (i) colors.3.

In particular, the square in row 1, column 2 must have a black neighbor within this rectangle.

The statement claims it would be a square, but a square is a special type of rectangle where all sides are equal in addition to having right angles. Therefore, without the condition that all sides are equal, we cannot conclude it is a square. Thus, this statement is incorrect.- Statement B: A parallelogram with equal diagonals is indeed a rectangle. This is because, in a parallelogram, equal diagonals imply that the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length, which is a property of rectangles. Therefore, this statement is correct.- Statement C: A quadrilateral with diagonals that bisect each other and are perpendicular is a rhombus. This is correct because one of the properties of a rhombus is that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, this statement is correct.- Statement D: A quadrilateral with all sides equal is indeed a parallelogram if it also has both pairs of opposite sides parallel. However, the statement does not explicitly mention the condition about the sides being parallel, but it's implied in the definition of a parallelogram.

This gives us {A}_{2}^{2} = 2 ways to arrange A and B once their positions have been chosen.- Therefore, the total number of ways to place A, B, and C in the lineup, with C between A and B, is given by the product {C}_{5}^{3} times {A}_{2}^{2}.

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b). Immediately, we understand that O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}, O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}, and O B = |b| = -b.Let's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point D with coordinates (0 ; d) (Fig. 12). The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D. We get -x_{1} cdot x_{2} = -b cdot d, from which, replacing x_{1} cdot x_{2} with 12b by Vieta's theorem, we get d = 12.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_2fdcf97aa9799d0d4cd6g-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)Fig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7It remains to note that triangle BTD is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point M, has coordinates (0 ; 3).

There are 2 cells labeled 0 and 1, and 2 cards labeled 0 and 1. The objective is to get card 0 into cell 0 and card 1 into cell 1. If the initial position is 10, we need one move to get to 01.

We need to show that for ( n = k + 1 ), the maximum number of moves required is ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ).3. Inductive Step:   Suppose ( n = k + 1 ). We need to show that the number of steps it takes for card ( k+1 ) to move to position ( k+1 ) is at most ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ).   - If card ( k+1 ) is already in position ( k+1 ), no moves are needed for this card, and the problem reduces to sorting the remaining ( k ) cards, which by the inductive hypothesis can be done in ( 2^k - 1 ) moves.      - If card ( k+1 ) is in position ( h ) where ( h < k+1 ), we need to move it to position ( k+1 ).

Detailed Calculation:   - If in fewer than ( 2^{k-1} ) steps, card ( k+1 ) moves forward, then we are done by induction.   - If this is not the case, then in ( 2^{k-1} ) steps, all changes have occurred only in positions ( 0 ) through ( k-1 ). Hence, it follows that ( pi(0), pi(1), ldots, pi(k-1) in {0, 1, ldots, k-1} ) and hence ( pi|_{{0,1,ldots,k-1}} in mathcal{S}_k ). By induction, we know that these can be sorted in at most ( 2^k - 1 ) steps, and so card ( k+1 ) can be transferred to position ( k+1 ) in at most ( 2^k ) steps.5. Conclusion:   Therefore, the total number of moves required to sort ( k+1 ) cards is at most ( 2^k + 2^k - 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1 ).6.

Since vertices with even indices are only connected to vertices with odd indices, removing a vertex with an odd index means the remaining graph cannot have an H-cycle, because the remaining graph does not have an equal number of vertices with odd and even indices.Finally, provide a graph for n=10 that satisfies the condition.

If the numbers n and n+2 have a common divisor, then it is a divisor of their difference, 2.

Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we have:   [   frac{a + b + c + d}{4} geq sqrt[4]{abcd}   ]   Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:   [   a + b + c + d geq 4sqrt[4]{abcd}   ]4. From the second equation (abcd = 8 + a + b + c + d), we substitute (a + b + c + d) with (8) (since (a + b + c + d leq 8)):   [   abcd = 8 + a + b + c + d leq 16   ]5. Combining the inequalities, we get:   [   4sqrt[4]{abcd} leq 8   ]   Simplifying, we find:   [   sqrt[4]{abcd} leq 2   ]   Raising both sides to the fourth power, we get:   [   abcd leq 16   ]6. From the second equation (abcd = 8 + a + b + c + d), we know (abcd geq 8). Therefore:   [   8 leq abcd leq 16   ]7. Now, we use the first equation (ab + cd = 8). By AM-GM inequality:   [   ab + cd geq 2sqrt{abcd}   ]   Given (ab + cd = 8), we have:   [   8 geq 2sqrt{abcd}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   4 geq sqrt{abcd}   ]   Squaring both sides, we find:   [   16 geq abcd   ]8. Combining all the inequalities, we have:   [   abcd = 16   ]9. Substituting (abcd = 16) into the second equation:   [   16 = 8 + a + b + c + d   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   a + b + c + d = 8   ]10.

Accounting for the constraints that x must be a natural number between 4 and 10 (inclusive) based on the number of computers available in each branch, we get:y = 80x + 50(12 - x) + 40(10 - x) + 30(x - 4) = 20x + 880.Thus, the function relating y to x is:y = 20x + 880 quad (x in mathbb{N}, 4 leq x leq 10).(2) By setting the inequality y leq 1000, we arrive at the equation:20x + 880 leq 1000.Solving for x gives us x leq 6.

Let's write the numbers (1,10,11) from right to left under our number, as shown below:[begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrr}4 & 9 & 1 & 2 & 9 & 3 & 0 & 8 & 2 & 1 & 3 10 & 1 & 11 & 10 & 1 & 11 & 10 & 1 & 11 & 10 & 1end{array}]Now, let's multiply the numbers 1 and 10 at the bottom by the numbers above them and sum the products; then do the same with the numbers 11 and subtract the second sum from the first. The result is: (13 + 08 + 29 + 49 = 99); (11 times (2 + 3 + 1) = 66). The difference is 33, which coincides with the remainder of our number when divided by 37.This is the key to solving the problem. If we divide (1,10,100,1000) and so on by 37, we will sequentially get the remainders: (1,10,26) and again (1,10,26) and so on. It is more convenient to subtract 37 from 26 and say that the remainder is minus 11. If you apply this method to the number 49629708213, you will find that the first sum is 99, and the second sum is 165. The difference is minus 66. Add 37 and you get minus 29. Since the answer is negative, add 37 again, and you get the correct answer, which is 8. Now you can apply a similar method to other prime divisors. In the case of 7 and 13, this is easy.

Define the problem and initial conditions:   Let ( N(n) ) denote the number of ( 2 times n ) grids with no stranded black squares. We start by considering the base case:   [   N(1) = 4   ]   This is because there are four possible colorings of a ( 2 times 1 ) grid: both squares white, both squares black, top white and bottom black, and top black and bottom white.2. Recursive relation:   Consider a ( 2 times n ) grid. We can think of it as a ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid with an additional column added to the right. We need to count the valid colorings of this new column based on the colorings of the ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid.3. Case 1: Bottom row of the ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid is all black:   - There are ( 2^{n-1} ) such colorings.   - For the rightmost column, there are no constraints, so there are 4 possible colorings.   - Thus, the number of valid colorings in this case is:     [     4 cdot 2^{n-1}     ]4. Case 2: Bottom row of the ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid is not all black:   - There are ( N(n-1) - 2^{n-1} ) such colorings.   - For the rightmost column, if the bottom-right square is black, the top-right square must be white to avoid a stranded black square. This gives 3 possible colorings.   - Thus, the number of valid colorings in this case is:     [     3 cdot (N(n-1) - 2^{n-1})     ]5. Combine the cases:   [   N(n) = 4 cdot 2^{n-1} + 3 cdot (N(n-1) - 2^{n-1})   ]   Simplify the expression:   [   N(n) = 4 cdot 2^{n-1} + 3N(n-1) - 3 cdot 2^{n-1}   ]   [   N(n) = 3N(n-1) + 2^{n-1}   ]6. Solve the recurrence relation:   We solve the recurrence relation ( N(n) = 3N(n-1) + 2^{n-1} ) with the initial condition ( N(1) = 4 ).   Let's find a closed form by iterating the recurrence:   [   N(2) = 3N(1) + 2^1 = 3 cdot 4 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14   ]   [   N(3) = 3N(2) + 2^2 = 3 cdot 14 + 4 = 42 + 4 = 46   ]   We observe that the recurrence relation can be solved using the method of characteristic equations or by recognizing a pattern.7. General solution:   The homogeneous part of the recurrence ( N(n) = 3N(n-1) ) suggests a solution of the form ( N(n) = A cdot 3^n ). The particular solution can be found by assuming a form ( B cdot 2^n ).   Combining these, we get:   [   N(n) = A cdot 3^n + B cdot 2^n   ]8.

One of the interests in introducing complex numbers (and this is the perspective from which they were introduced in the 16th century) is to overcome this difficulty through the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (stated by d'Alembert and proved by Gauss).Definition 3.45. Let mathbb{C} denote the set of pairs of real numbers (a, b) equipped with:1. the following addition: (a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d),2. the following multiplications: (a, b) times (c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc) and for lambda real, lambda(a, b) = (lambda a, lambda b).We see the set of real numbers embedded in the set of complex numbers: to each real number a, we can associate the complex number (a, 0). Finally, let us denote by i the complex number (0, 1). Thus, we can represent each complex number (a, b) in the form (a, b) = a(1, 0) + b(0, 1) = a + ib.Remark 3.46. With the multiplication rules given above, we see that i^2 = -1, and that (a + bi)(c + di) = ac - bd + (ad + bc)i. Thus, everything behaves as if i were a \\"number\\" such that i^2 = -1 in all manipulations. In particular, i is a root of the polynomial X^2 + 1 = 0.Remark 3.47.

A cone with a vertex angle of 90° implies that if we were to look at the cone from the side, it would appear as an isosceles right triangle. When it mentions that the angle between the cross-section and the axis is 45°, we're dealing with a cross-section that cuts the cone at an angle equal to the angle between the cone's slant height and the axis of the cone.Given these conditions, we need to determine the shape of the curve that the cross-section forms. Here's a step-by-step analysis:1. Context: For a right circular cone, a cross-section through the vertex forms different curves depending on its angle with the axis:   - If it's perpendicular to the axis, we get a circle;   - If it's at any other angle, yet does not go through the cone's base, it can form an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola.2. Given Conditions: Our cone has a vertex angle of 90°. The cross-section is at a 45° angle, which is the same angle that the sides of the cone make with the axis due to the cone being a right-angle cone.3. Derivation of the Curve: When the cross-section plane is parallel to the slant height of the cone, the curve formed is not closed, thus ruling out the circle and the ellipse. Between the hyperbola and the parabola, only the parabola has a single branch, and this is consistent with a cross-section at the angle of the slant height.Hence, the shape is a parabola.[boxed{D}]"},{"problem":"The ancient Chinese mathematical classic \\"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\\" has a problem called \\"Rice Grain Sorting\\": When grain is collected from the warehouse, if the percentage of chaff is not more than 3%, it is considered qualified.

Determine the conditions for the subsets:   - For a subset to have an even sum, it must contain an even number of odd elements.   - For a subset to have an odd product, it must contain only odd elements (since the presence of any even number would make the product even).3. Extract the odd elements from ( S ):   - The odd elements in ( S ) are ( {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11} ).4. Count the subsets of odd elements with an even number of elements:   - We need to count the subsets of ( {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11} ) that have an even number of elements.   - The number of elements in this set is 6, so we can choose 2, 4, or 6 elements.5.

The number of greeting pairs between B and C isbegin{array}{c}(3k+6)(3k+5-n)=(9k-7)n. 9k^2-12kn+33k+n+30=0.end{array}Since all terms in the above equation except n are multiples of 3, it must be that n=3m, m in mathbb{N}. This gives us4m=k+3+frac{9k+43}{12k-1}.When k geq 15, 9k+43 < 12k-1, so 12k-1 can only be 25, 35, or 175. Clearly, only 35 is feasible. In this case, k=3, m=2, n=6, 3k+6=15. The only possible scenario that meets the requirements is that each person has greeted 15 people, and the number of people who have greeted any two people is 6.We now provide an example to show that the above scenario is feasible.Suppose there are 36 people attending the meeting, with 6 people each wearing shirts of 6 different colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. We denote the people wearing these 6 colors as R, O, Y, G, B, and V. Then, let these 36 people sit in 6 rows and 6 columns, marked by their shirt colors as shown in the table below. It is stipulated that each person greets exactly those in the same row, same column, and same color. Thus, each person greets exactly 15 people. Therefore, we only need to verify that the number of people who have greeted any two people is exactly 6.(1) When P and Q are in the same row, the other 4 people in the same row, the person in the same column as P and the same color as Q, and the person in the same color as P and the same column as Q are the 6 people who have greeted both P and Q. All others have greeted at most one of P or Q.(2) When P and Q are in the same column or the same color, similarly, the number of people who have greeted both P and Q is exactly 6.(3) Suppose P and Q are neither in the same row, nor in the same column, nor of the same color. In this case, the person in the same row as P and the same column as Q, the person in the same column as P and the same row as Q, the person in the same row as P and the same color as Q, the person in the same color as P and the same row as Q, the person in the same column as P and the same color as Q, and the person in the same color as P and the same column as Q are the 6 people who have greeted both P and Q.In summary, there are 36 people attending the meeting."},{"problem":"7.

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b).

If we give alphaleft(leq 178^{circ}right), beta can take any value from 1 to 179^{circ}-alpha. Therefore, if we take all possibilities, we get the sum of integers from 1 to 178. Their sum is 15931. However, in this sum, every triangle with different angles appears six times, because each of the three angles of the triangle appears in the values of alpha and each of the other two angles appears in the values of beta. Isosceles triangles appear only three times, for example, the 26^{circ}, 77^{circ}, 77^{circ} triangle, when alpha=26^{circ}, and also when beta=26^{circ} left(alpha=77^{circ}right), and finally, when gamma=26^{circ}left(alpha=beta=77^{circ}right).

Counting Triangles:   - A *friendly triplet* corresponds to a triangle in the graph ( G ).   - For a vertex ( v ) in ( G ), the number of triangles that include ( v ) is determined by the number of edges between the neighbors of ( v ).   - Since ( v ) has 4 neighbors, the number of edges between these neighbors is at most ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ).3.

Applying Möbius Inversion:   Given the function ( f(n) = sum_{i=0}^{infty} frac{gcd(i,n)}{2^i} ) and the function ( g ) such that ( sum_{d mid n} g(d) = f(n) ), we can use Möbius inversion to find ( g(n) ):   [   g(n) = sum_{d mid n} f(d) muleft(frac{n}{d}right)   ]   where ( mu ) is the Möbius function.2.

Thus, triangle C D A is isosceles at D, so D B=D A=D C: triangle C D B is also isosceles at D. Since the sum of the angles in triangle C D B is 180^{circ}, we have 180^{circ}=widehat{D C B}+widehat{D B C}+widehat{C B D}=2 widehat{D B C}+40^{circ}, so widehat{D B C}=frac{180-40}{2}=70^{circ}.

However, a number of students confuse the median and the angle bisector: just because in a triangle, a line passing through a vertex cuts the opposite side in half does not mean that the angle at the vertex is also bisected.

Therefore, T has the volumeV_{T}=frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{2}(R Y+S Z) R S cdot X HIn this, R Y=y-x, S Z=z-x; furthermore, the area of the triangle X R S congruent to A B C isF=frac{1}{2} R S cdot X HThus, we haveV_{T}=frac{1}{3} F(y-x+z-x)(This formula also covers the case x=y=z). The prism P_{1} has the volume V_{P_{1}}=F cdot x.
