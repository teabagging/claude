This requires knowing the number of wins and losses of others, which can be inferred from the condition: \\"A wins the fewest rounds.\\" For any person other than A, they must win at least n + 1 rounds, thus scoring at least 2n + 2. Therefore, 2n + 22, which implies m geqslant 3.This estimate, though not optimal, helps us find someone with a higher score. Since m geqslant 3 indicates that at least 3 people draw with A.

Otherwise, they could be non-coplanar parallel lines, meaning m could potentially be contained in beta instead. Therefore, option A is not necessarily true.Option B: If m is perpendicular to alpha and alpha is perpendicular to beta, it may sound feasible for m to be parallel to beta; however, perpendicularity in this context doesn't lead to a parallel relationship between m and beta. In fact, m could lie in the same plane as beta without intersecting it (since they're not confirmed to be coplanar).

Show that one can select [frac{3k}{7}]  sets from A_1,...,A_k such that their union is X.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Assumptions:   - Let ( X ) be a non-empty and finite set.   - Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ) be ( k ) subsets of ( X ) such that ( |A_i| leq 3 ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ).   - Any element of ( X ) is an element of at least 4 sets among ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ).2. Reduction to Exact Coverage:   - By deleting elements from ( A_i )'s, we may assume that any element of ( X ) belongs to exactly 4 of the ( A_i )'s.3. Maximal Set Selection:   - Pick the maximal number ( t ) of sets ( A_i ) with the property that any 4 of them have an empty intersection. Without loss of generality, assume any 4 of ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_t ) have an empty intersection.4.

Claim 1: ( a_j geq 1 ) for all ( j ):   - Proof: If ( a_j = 0 ), then any 4 of the sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_t, A_{j+t} ) have an empty intersection, contradicting the maximality of ( t ).6. Special Element Distribution:   - Any special element ( x ) appears in 4 of the ( A_1, ldots, A_k ), three of which are among ( A_1, ldots, A_t ), so there is a unique ( j_x ) such that ( x in A_{j_x+t} ).   - Denote ( c_x = a_{j_x} ).7. Claim 2: ( sum_{x text{ special} in A_i} frac{1}{c_x} leq frac{b_i + 1}{2} ) for all ( i = 1, ldots, t ):   - Proof:     - Case a: ( b_i = 0 ). The inequality is vacuously true.     - Case b: ( b_i = 1 ). ( frac{1}{c_x} leq 1 = frac{b_i + 1}{2} ) for the special element ( x ) of ( A_i ).     - Case c: ( b_i = 2 ). Let ( x, y ) be the special elements of ( A_i ).       - If ( j_x = j_y ), then ( x, y in A_{j_x} ), so ( frac{1}{c_x} + frac{1}{c_y} = frac{2}{c_x} leq 1 < frac{b_i + 1}{2} ).       - Otherwise, if ( A_{j_x} cup A_{j_y} ) contains no other special elements besides ( x, y ), then any 4 of ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{i-1}, A_{i+1}, ldots, A_t, A_{j_x}, A_{j_y} ) have an empty intersection, contradicting the maximality of ( t ).

Let ( x, y, z ) be the special elements of ( A_i ).       - If ( j_x = j_y ), then ( x, y in A_{j_x} ) yields ( c_x = c_y geq 2 ), so         [         frac{1}{c_x} + frac{1}{c_y} + frac{1}{c_z} leq frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{1} = frac{b_i + 1}{2}.         ]       - Otherwise, if ( j_x, j_y, j_z ) are pairwise distinct, as in the proof of case c), by replacing ( A_i ) with ( A_{j_x} ) and ( A_{j_y} ) etc., we obtain ( max{c_x, c_y} geq 2 ) and the cyclic inequalities. This implies that at least two of the numbers ( c_x, c_y, c_z ) are at least 2, hence         [         frac{1}{c_x} + frac{1}{c_y} + frac{1}{c_z} leq frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{1} = frac{b_i + 1}{2}.         ]     - Along with the observation that ( b_i leq 3 ) (since ( |A_i| leq 3 ) always), Claim 2 is proven.8. Summing Inequalities:   - By summing all the inequalities in Claim 2, and observing that for a fixed special ( x ), we have 3 indices ( 1 leq i leq t ) with ( x in A_i ), we get that     [     sum_{x text{ special}} frac{3}{c_x} = sum_{i=1}^{t} sum_{x text{ special} in A_i} frac{1}{c_x} leq sum_{i=1}^{t} frac{b_i + 1}{2} leq 2t,     ]     where the last inequality follows from ( b_i leq 3 ).9. Rewriting the LHS:   - Note that for each ( 1 leq j leq k-t ), ( c_x = a_j ) for ( a_j ) values of ( x ), and so the LHS of the above inequality rewrites as     [     sum_{j=1}^{k-t} frac{3}{a_j} cdot a_j = 3(k-t).     ]   - Overall, ( 3(k-t) leq 2t ), i.e., ( k-t leq frac{2}{5}k ).10. Claim 3: ( A_{t+1} cup ldots cup A_k = X ):    - Proof: If there is some ( x in X ) with ( x notin A_{t+1} cup ldots cup A_k ), then ( x ) appears in 4 of the sets ( A_1, ldots, A_t ), contradicting the fact that any 4 of them have an empty intersection.Thus, we have shown that one can select ( leftlfloor frac{3k}{7} rightrfloor ) sets from ( A_1, ldots, A_k ) such that their union is ( X ).The final answer is ( boxed{ leftlfloor frac{3k}{7} rightrfloor } )"},{"problem":"Given the variance of the sample data {x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n} is a, then the variance of the sample data {2x_1+1, 2x_2+1, ldots, 2x_n+1} is ______.","solution":"Let's denote the mean of the original data as overline{x}, then the mean of the new data is 2overline{x}+1.The variance of the original data is given by frac{1}{n}left[(x_1-overline{x})^2+(x_2-overline{x})^2+ldots+(x_n-overline{x})^2right]=a,Therefore, the variance of the new data is: frac{1}{n}left[(2x_1+1-2overline{x}-1)^2+(2x_2+1-2overline{x}-1)^2+ldots+(2x_n+1-2overline{x}-1)^2right]=4times frac{1}{n}left[(x_1-overline{x})^2+(x_2-overline{x})^2+ldots+(x_n-overline{x})^2right]=4a.Thus, the variance of the new data is 4a.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{4a}First, we assume the mean of the original data is overline{x}, then the mean of the new data becomes 2overline{x}+3, and then we use the formula for variance to calculate the answer.This question examines the definition of variance, and paying attention to the changes in the data before and after is key to solving the problem.

One of the internal angles of the parallelogram is 60^circ. What is the maximum possible area of ABCD?","solution":"1. Identify the properties of the parallelogram:   Since ABCD is a parallelogram with an inscribed circle, it must be a tangential quadrilateral. For a parallelogram to be tangential, it must be a rhombus. Therefore, ABCD is a rhombus.2. Determine the angles of the rhombus:   Given that one of the internal angles of the parallelogram is 60^circ, the rhombus has two angles of 60^circ and two angles of 120^circ.3. Analyze the rhombus:   A rhombus with angles 60^circ and 120^circ can be divided into four 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangles by drawing its diagonals. These diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.4. Use the properties of the 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle:   In a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : sqrt{3} : 2. The altitude of each of these triangles (which is the radius of the inscribed circle) is 2.5. Calculate the side lengths of the rhombus:   The altitude (shorter leg) of the 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle is 2. Therefore, the longer leg (half of the diagonal) is 2sqrt{3}, and the hypotenuse (side of the rhombus) is 4.6. Calculate the area of the rhombus:   The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2   ]   where d_1 and d_2 are the lengths of the diagonals. In this case, each diagonal is twice the length of the longer leg of the 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle, so:   [   d_1 = 4sqrt{3}, quad d_2 = 4sqrt{3}   ]   Therefore, the area is:   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 4sqrt{3} times 4sqrt{3} = frac{1}{2} times 16 times 3 = 24   ]7. Recalculate the area using the side length:   Alternatively, the area of a rhombus can also be calculated using the side length a and the sine of one of the angles:   [   text{Area} = a^2 sin(60^circ)   ]   Given a = 4 and sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}:   [   text{Area} = 4^2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 16 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 8sqrt{3}   ]8.

If a＜sqrt{7} lt b, then the value of a+b is:A: 3B: 5C: 7D: 13","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, following the given solution closely:1. First, we recognize that sqrt{7} is between two square numbers. Specifically, 4 < 7 < 9. This is because 2^2 = 4 and 3^2 = 9.2. From this, we can deduce that 2 < sqrt{7} < 3. This is because taking the square root of the inequalities 4 < 7 < 9 gives us 2 < sqrt{7} < 3.3. Given that a and b are two consecutive integers and that a < sqrt{7} < b, we can now identify a and b based on the inequality 2 < sqrt{7} < 3. It's clear that a must be the integer just less than sqrt{7}, and b must be the integer just greater than sqrt{7}. Therefore, a=2 and b=3.4. To find the value of a+b, we simply add these two numbers together: a+b = 2+3 = 5.Thus, the correct answer, following the rules and encapsulating the final answer, is boxed{B}.Explanation: The solution hinges on estimating the value of sqrt{7} by recognizing it falls between the square roots of 4 and 9, which are 2 and 3, respectively. Knowing a and b are consecutive integers allows us to pinpoint their values precisely.Review: This question tests the ability to estimate the magnitude of irrational numbers and requires an understanding of square numbers and the properties of inequalities."},{"problem":"In second grade, 15 trees were planted.

Among these central angles, the largest is widehat{A^{prime} O C^{prime}}, which contains point B (since widehat{B} is the smallest angle of A B C), and will have an amplitude equal to 180^{circ}-48^{circ}=132^{circ}. The corresponding portion of the lake will therefore be equal to frac{132}{360}=frac{11}{30} of the surface.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_48746ba046504379ff31g-3.jpg?height=369&width=396&top_left_y=1000&top_left_x=886)"},{"problem":"Which of the following calculations is correct?A: sqrt{(-3)^2}=-3B: sqrt{3} times sqrt{3}=9C: sqrt{3} + sqrt{3}=sqrt{6}D: sqrt[3]{3} + sqrt[3]{-3}=0","solution":"To analyze each option step-by-step:Option A:We start with the expression given in option A:[sqrt{(-3)^2}]First, we calculate the square of -3:[(-3)^2 = 9]Then, we take the square root of 9:[sqrt{9} = 3]Therefore, option A simplifies to 3, not -3.

From frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{10} to a gt 10 or a lt 0:   - We start with the inequality frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{10}.   - This inequality implies that a must be on the opposite side of 0 from frac{1}{10} to maintain the direction of the inequality due to the properties of reciprocal values.   - Therefore, we deduce that a can either be greater than 10 or less than 0.2. Analyzing the sufficiency of a gt 10:   - If we assume a gt 10, then naturally frac{1}{a} becomes less than frac{1}{10} because as a increases, frac{1}{a} decreases.   - Thus, the condition a gt 10 is sufficient to ensure frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{10}.3. Checking the necessity of a gt 10:   - Given frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{10}, we found that a could also be less than 0.   - This means that a gt 10 is not the only condition that satisfies frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{10}.   - Therefore, a gt 10 is not a necessary condition for frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{10}.4.

By symmetry, a_{n} is also the number of ways to get to (n+3, n) and b_{n} is also the number of ways to get to the point (n+2, n+1).We can easily see that a_{0}=1 and b_{0}=3.

Analyzing the Congruence:   We start by analyzing the given congruence ( x^{11} + y^{16} equiv 2013 pmod{p} ). For this congruence to have a solution, we need to ensure that the values ( x^{11} ) and ( y^{16} ) can cover all residues modulo ( p ).2. Case 1: ( 11 nmid p-1 ):   If ( 11 nmid p-1 ), then ( x^{11} pmod{p} ) can take on all possible residues modulo ( p ). This is because the order of any element modulo ( p ) must divide ( p-1 ), and if ( 11 nmid p-1 ), then ( x^{11} ) will cycle through all residues modulo ( p ). Therefore, we can always find an ( x ) such that ( x^{11} equiv 2013 - y^{16} pmod{p} ) for some ( y ).3. Case 2: ( 11 mid p-1 ):   If ( 11 mid p-1 ), then ( x^{11} ) will not cover all residues modulo ( p ). However, we can still find a solution by setting ( y = 0 ). This reduces the congruence to ( x^{11} equiv 2013 pmod{p} ). Since ( 11 mid p-1 ), ( x^{11} ) will cover all residues modulo ( p ), and thus there exists an ( x ) such that ( x^{11} equiv 2013 pmod{p} ).4. Counting the Primes:   Since both cases ensure that the congruence ( x^{11} + y^{16} equiv 2013 pmod{p} ) has a solution for any prime ( p ) between 100 and 200, we need to count the number of primes in this range.   The primes between 100 and 200 are:   [   101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199   ]   Counting these primes, we find there are 21 primes.Conclusion:The number of primes ( p ) between 100 and 200 for which ( x^{11} + y^{16} equiv 2013 pmod{p} ) has a solution in integers ( x ) and ( y ) is ( boxed{21} )."},{"problem":"1.

First, prove: If a circle's circumference contains 3 rational points, then the circumference must contain infinitely many rational points.Let odot C_{0} in the plane have 3 rational points P_{i}left(x_{i}, y_{i}right)(i=1,2,3) on its circumference, with the center C_{0}left(x_{0}, y_{0}right).Since the perpendicular bisectors of segments P_{1} P_{2} and P_{1} P_{3} pass through the center C_{0}, we haveleft{begin{array}{l}left(y_{2}-y_{1}right)left(y_{0}-frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}right)+left(x_{2}-x_{1}right)left(x_{0}-frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}right)=0, left(y_{3}-y_{1}right)left(y_{0}-frac{y_{1}+y_{3}}{2}right)+left(x_{3}-x_{1}right)left(x_{0}-frac{x_{1}+x_{3}}{2}right)=0 .end{array}right.Since x_{i} 、 y_{i}(i=1,2,3) are all rational numbers, the solution left(x_{0}, y_{0}right) of the above system of linear equations in x_{0} 、 y_{0} is also a rational number, i.e., C_{0} is a rational point.Suppose the coordinates of the rational point P_{n}left(x_{n}, y_{n}right) arebegin{array}{l}qquadleft{begin{array}{l}x_{n}=x_{0}+a_{n}left(x_{3}-x_{0}right)-b_{n}left(y_{3}-y_{0}right), y_{n}=y_{0}+b_{n}left(x_{3}-x_{0}right)+a_{n}left(y_{3}-y_{0}right),end{array}right. text { where, } a_{n}=frac{n^{2}-1}{n^{2}+1}, b_{n}=frac{2 n}{n^{2}+1}(n=4,5, cdots) .end{array}Then left|P_{n} C_{0}right|^{2}begin{aligned}= & {left[a_{n}left(x_{3}-x_{0}right)-b_{n}left(y_{3}-y_{0}right)right]^{2}+} & {left[b_{n}left(x_{3}-x_{0}right)+a_{n}left(y_{3}-y_{0}right)right]^{2} } = & left(a_{n}^{2}+b_{n}^{2}right)left[left(x_{3}-x_{0}right)^{2}+left(y_{3}-y_{0}right)^{2}right] = & left(x_{3}-x_{0}right)^{2}+left(y_{3}-y_{0}right)^{2}=left|P_{3} C_{0}right|^{2} .end{aligned}Hence, the points P_{n}(n=4,5, cdots) are all on the circumference of odot C_{0}, i.e., the circumference of odot C_{0} contains infinitely many rational points.Second, construct an example of a circle whose circumference contains only two rational points.C:(x-sqrt{2})^{2}+(y-sqrt{2})^{2}=6 .It is easy to verify that P_{1}(-1,1) and P_{2}(1,-1) are on the circumference of C.

Each of these triangles contains one of the four equal shares, so each of their areas is greater than frac{t}{8} (Figure 3).

The segments connecting the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral are midlines in these triangles, so the areas of the triangles formed at the vertices of the quadrilateral A B C D are one-fourth of these values.

We use the fact that the total number of paths from ((0,0)) to ((10,10)) is (binom{20}{10}).   - The number of ways to choose 2 points on a path from ((0,0)) to ((10,10)) is:     [     binom{21}{2}     ]   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of points on all paths is:     [     binom{20}{10} times binom{21}{2}     ]   - Since each pair of points is counted (binom{121}{2}) times, we have:     [     binom{121}{2} P = binom{20}{10} times binom{21}{2}     ]   - Solving for (P):     [     P = frac{binom{20}{10} times binom{21}{2}}{binom{121}{2}}     ]6. Simplifying the Expression:   - We know:     [     binom{21}{2} = frac{21 times 20}{2} = 210     ]     [     binom{121}{2} = frac{121 times 120}{2} = 7260     ]   - Therefore:     [     P = frac{binom{20}{10} times 210}{7260}     ]     [     P = binom{20}{10} times frac{21 times 20}{121 times 120} = binom{20}{10} times frac{7}{242}     ]7. Finding (a) and (b):   - We have:     [     frac{a}{b} = frac{7}{242}     ]   - Thus, (a = 7) and (b = 242).8. Computing (100a + b):   - Finally:     [     100a + b = 100 times 7 + 242 = 942     ]The final answer is (boxed{942})."},{"problem":"5.

In this way, we arrive at a sum of 2n terms, where each of the numbers 1,2, ldots, n appears twice, and among the 2n terms, n have a negative sign. The value we are examining thus arises from the sum of the numbers 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, n, n by reducing its value by twice the sum of the numbers that appear with a negative sign. Therefore, the obtained value will be maximal if the sum of the numbers that appear with a negative sign is minimal. This latter sum has n terms, and its value cannot be smaller than the sum of the first n elements of the sequence 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, n, n.If we start from an appropriate sequence of numbers, it follows that precisely the first n elements mentioned will appear with a negative sign. This is demonstrated by the example of the sequence n, n-1, ldots, 1, as we can immediately read from the resulting[|n-1|+|(n-1)-2|+ldots+|1-n|]sum.Our task now is only to calculate this sum. The terms of this sum, whether we take them from left to right or from right to left, form an arithmetic progression with a difference of 2, starting from (n-1). The terms of these progressions decrease until we reach the middle of the sum. Here, we find either two 1-valued terms or a single 0-valued term.If n is even, then the examined sum is twice the sum of an arithmetic progression with a difference of 2, starting from 1 to (n-1), and having frac{n}{2} terms, which is frac{n^2}{2}. If, however, n is odd, then we get twice the sum of an arithmetic progression with a difference of 2, starting from 2 to (n-1), and having frac{n-1}{2} terms, which is frac{n-1}{2}(n+1)=frac{n^2-1}{2}.We can write the result in both cases as left[frac{n^2}{2}right], where the square brackets denote the largest integer contained in the number.Remark. We can also achieve our goal without summing the arithmetic progression if we start from a suitably chosen sequence of numbers.If n=2k, we can start from the sequence k+1, k+2, ldots, 2k, 1, 2, ldots, k. The smaller terms of the differences that appear here are the numbers 1, 2, ldots, k, and each appears twice. Based on the reasoning of our solution, we can state that the chosen sequence leads to the maximum sum. The absolute value of each difference is k, so the sum of the absolute values is 2k^2.If, however, n=2k+1, the sequence k+2, k+3, ldots, 2k+1, k+1, 1, 2, ldots, k leads to the goal. The smaller terms of the differences that appear are again the same numbers as before, but in the middle difference, both the minuend and the subtrahend are k+1. From this, we can again conclude that we arrive at the maximum sum. The middle difference is 0, and the absolute value of the others is k+1. In this way, the sum 2k(k+1) results.We can conclude that the result in both cases is the largest integer contained in frac{n^2}{2}."},{"problem":"Given vector overrightarrow{a}=(1, sqrt {3}) and the angle between vector overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{c} is dfrac {pi}{3}, with overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{c}=2, then the magnitude of overrightarrow{c} equals ______.","solution":"Since |overrightarrow{a}|= sqrt {1^{2}+(sqrt {3})^{2}}=2,  and given overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{c}=|overrightarrow{a}|cdot |overrightarrow{c}|cdot cos dfrac {pi}{3}=2,  we have: 2times|overrightarrow{c}|times dfrac {1}{2}=2,  thus, |overrightarrow{c}|=2.

Understanding the Problem:   Farmer John ties his goat to ( k ) ropes of varying lengths, each centered at points ( Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_k ). The goat can reach any point ( R ) such that ( ell_j geq RQ_j ) for all ( j in {1, 2, ldots, k} ). Given a finite set of points ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) where grass is planted, we need to determine the largest possible lower bound on the area of the region that the goat can reach.2. Convex Hull Concept:   The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points. If the goat can reach all the points ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ), it must be able to reach any point inside the convex hull of these points. This is because the intersection of convex sets is convex, and the region the goat can reach must be convex.3. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: All Points are Collinear     If all points ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) are collinear, they lie on a line segment, say (overline{P_1P_n}). In this case, the convex hull is simply the line segment (overline{P_1P_n}). The area of this convex hull is zero because it is a one-dimensional object.   - Case 2: Points Form a Nonzero Area Convex Hull     If the points form a convex hull with nonzero area, let the convex hull be ( P_1P_2 ldots P_k ). We can construct circles (omega_i) passing through ( P_i ) and ( P_{i+1} ) (with indices taken modulo ( k )). The centers of these circles are outside the convex hull but on the same side of ( P_iP_{i+1} ) as the rest of the points. As the radii of these circles tend to infinity, the area of their intersection tends to the area of the convex hull.4. Conclusion:   Since the intersection of convex sets is convex, the region in which the goat can freely move must be convex. Therefore, the goat can reach all of the points ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) if and only if it can reach any point inside the convex hull of these points. This proves that the largest possible lower bound on the area of the region that the goat can reach is the area of the convex hull of the points.[boxed{text{Area of the convex hull of } P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n}]"},{"problem":"Given that tan alpha and tan beta are the two roots of the equation x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0, find the value of tan(alpha + beta).","solution":"Given the equation x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0, the sum and product of its roots can be found using Viète's formulas.

The first observation is that f must be bijective.Lemma 1. If f^{(a)}(n)=f^{(b)}(n), then we have a=b.Proof. Proof: Otherwise, without loss of generality, assume a>b.

The first observation is that if there is a certain integer in this set, then all integers congruent modulo 2017 with it are also in the set, since x=f^{(t)}(n) implies x+2017 k=f(t+k m)(n) for any integer value of k. Furthermore, in the set are all the representatives of exactly m distinct residue classes modulo 2017. It is impossible to have more, since regardless of t, it happens that f^{(t)}(n) and f^{(t+m)}(n) have the same residue modulo 2017, leaving at most m possibilities. Similarly, there cannot be fewer, since by the pigeonhole principle, this would imply that there exist integers c, d between 0 and m-1 with f^{(c)}(n)-f^{(d)}(n)=2017 k implying f^{(c)}(n)-f^{(d+k m)}(n)=0, which contradicts the Lemma. Finally, it is enough to note that, by construction, two sets A_{i} and A_{j} are necessarily equal or disjoint. Since A_{0}, ldots, A_{2} 016 encompass all residues and each contributes m, it follows that m must divide 2017. Then it can only be m=1 or m=2017, to finish, it is enough to provide an example for each case.

Let the point of tangency be (x_0, y_0) on the circle, then we have x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 1. The slope of the radius at this point is frac{y_0}{x_0} (since the radius is the line segment from the origin to the point (x_0, y_0)), hence the slope of the tangent line, which is perpendicular to the radius, is -frac{x_0}{y_0} (a result of the negative reciprocal between perpendicular slopes). The equation of the tangent line can be written as:y - y_0 = -frac{x_0}{y_0}(x - x_0)Let's now find where this line intersects the x-axis and y-axis. For the x-axis (y=0):0 - y_0 = -frac{x_0}{y_0}(x - x_0)x_0^2 = y_0 xSince x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 1, this means x = x_0^2 + x_0^2 = 2x_0^2.Similarly, for the y-axis (x=0):y - y_0 = -frac{x_0}{y_0}(- x_0)y_0^2 = x_0 yThis results in y = y_0^2 + y_0^2 = 2y_0^2.So the coordinates of points A and B become (2x_0^2, 0) and (0, 2y_0^2) respectively.The length of AB = the Euclidean distance between A and B =sqrt{(2x_0^2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2y_0^2)^2} = 2sqrt{x_0^4 + y_0^4}.Using x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 1, we can bound the expression for x_0^4 + y_0^4 as follows:x_0^4 + y_0^4 leq (x_0^2 + y_0^2)^2 = 1^2 = 1.So the minimum length of AB becomes2sqrt{x_0^4 + y_0^4} geq 2sqrt{1} = 2.Note that the equality holds when x_0 = y_0 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, where the point (x_0, y_0) lies on the circle at a 45-degree angle to the x-axis.

Tangent Line at x=e: Given that the tangent line at x=e is perpendicular to 2x-y+8=0, we find the slope of this tangent line. Since the slope of 2x-y+8=0 is 2, the slope of the perpendicular line is -frac{1}{2}.

This is because a bipartite graph with ( 2n ) vertices and ( 2n ) edges cannot be a forest (a graph with no cycles) since a forest with ( 2n ) vertices can have at most ( 2n - 1 ) edges.   - Since our graph has ( 2n ) edges, it must contain at least one cycle. From any graph that contains a cycle, we can extract an elementary cycle (a cycle with no repeated vertices except for the starting and ending vertex).   - In this elementary cycle, each vertex has degree 2, which is even. Thus, this cycle forms an Eulerian subgraph.3. Conclusion:   - Since we have shown that ( k = 2n ) is sufficient to ensure that there is a subset of squares such that the number of squares in any row or column is even, and we have also shown that ( k > 2n - 1 ), the smallest number ( k ) that satisfies the condition is ( 2n ).The final answer is ( boxed{2n} )."},{"problem":"Brent has goldfish that quadruple (become four times as many) every month, and Gretel has goldfish that double every month.

Thus, a total of 2n-2k+2 pieces of paper are placed, and it is easy to see that no more pieces can be added.If n=2k-1, thenmin {n, 2n-2k+2}=n=2k-1.At this point, n=2k-1 pieces of paper can be placed in the grid as follows.First, place k-1 pieces of paper horizontally in the rectangular region [0, k] times [0, k-1], and place k-1 pieces of paper horizontally in the rectangular region [0, k] times [k, 2k-1]. Then, place one piece of paper covering the region [k-1, 2k-1] times [k-1, k]. Thus, a total of 2k-1 pieces of paper are placed, and it is easy to see that no more pieces can be added.Next, we prove that in any valid placement method, at least min {n, 2n-2k+2} pieces of paper are placed.Let the number of rows and columns in the valid placement method that do not contain a complete piece of paper be r and c, respectively.If r=0 or c=0, then at least n pieces of paper are placed.If r and c are both not equal to 0, we will prove that at least 2n-2k+2 pieces of paper are placed in this case.In a valid placement method, consider a horizontal piece of paper T.Since n<2k, the nearest horizontal boundary line of the grid to the row where T is located is at most k-1 rows away. These rows intersect with the k columns that T crosses, forming a rectangular region where no vertical pieces of paper can be placed.

If we shuffle n times in succession, then the card originally in the k-th position moves to the 2^{n} k-th position (mod 51). Each card will be back in its original position if for every k=1,2, ldots, 50, 2^{n} k equiv k(bmod 51) holds, that is, 2^{n} equiv 1(bmod 51).

Now we can most easily track the movement of the cards if we number the cards from 1 to 52. Then the k-th card moves to the 2 k-th position (bmod 53), and after the n-th shuffle, it moves to the 2^{n} k-th position (bmod 53). This time, we are looking for the smallest n for which 2^{n} equiv 1(bmod 53). Writing down the powers of 2 in sequence (bmod 53) would take a long time until the 1 first appears. We can speed up the calculation if we narrow down the set of n numbers that could be considered. Since 53 is a prime number, by Fermat's little theorem, 2^{52} equiv 1(bmod 53), so the powers of 2 modulo 53 are periodic, and the period length is 52. Our task is to find the smallest period (let's denote it by p), because on the one hand, 2^{p} equiv 2^{p-p}=1(bmod 53), so n leq p, and on the other hand, because of 2^{n} equiv 1(bmod 53), the powers of 2 are periodic modulo 53, so p leq n; thus indeed p=n. The smallest period is a divisor of every period, including 52, so it can only be 1,2,4,13,26 or 52.

Find the smallest possible value of n.","solution":"Resolving the ambiguityThe problem statement is confusing, as it can be interpreted in two ways: Either as \\"there is a k>1 such that the child in k-th place had eaten  n+2-2k grapes\\", or \\"for all k, the child in k-th place had eaten  n+2-2k grapes\\".The second meaning was apparrently the intended one. Hence we will restate the problem statement in this way:A group of c children held a grape-eating contest. When the contest was over, the following was true: There was a n such that for each k between 1 and c, inclusive, the child in k-th place had eaten exactly n+2-2k grapes. The total number of grapes eaten in the contest was 2009. Find the smallest possible value of n.Solution 1The total number of grapes eaten can be computed as the sum of the arithmetic progression with initial term n (the number of grapes eaten by the child in 1-st place), difference d=-2, and number of terms c. We can easily compute that this sum is equal to c(n-c+1).Hence we have the equation 2009=c(n-c+1), and we are looking for a solution (n,c), where both n and c are positive integers, ngeq 2(c-1), and n is minimized. (The condition ngeq 2(c-1) states that even the last child had to eat a non-negative number of grapes.)The prime factorization of 2009 is 2009=7^2 cdot 41. Hence there are 6 ways how to factor 2009 into two positive terms c and n-c+1:c=1, n-c+1=2009, then n=2009 is a solution.c=7, n-c+1=7cdot 41=287, then n=293 is a solution.c=41, n-c+1=7cdot 7=49, then n=89 is a solution.In each of the other three cases, n will obviously be less than 2(c-1), hence these are not valid solutions.The smallest valid solution is therefore c=41, n=boxed{089}.Solution 2If the first child ate n=2m grapes, then the maximum number of grapes eaten by all the children together is 2m + (2m-2) + (2m-4) + cdots + 4 + 2 = m(m+1). Similarly, if the first child ate 2m-1 grapes, the maximum total number of grapes eaten is (2m-1)+(2m-3)+cdots+3+1 = m^2.For m=44 the value m(m+1)=44cdot 45 =1980 is less than 2009. Hence n must be at least 2cdot 44+1=89. For n=89, the maximum possible sum is 45^2=2025. And we can easily see that 2009 = 2025 - 16 = 2025 - (1+3+5+7), hence 2009 grapes can indeed be achieved for n=89 by dropping the last four children.Hence we found a solution with n=89 and 45-4=41 kids, and we also showed that no smaller solution exists. Therefore the answer is boxed{089}.Solution 3 (similar to solution 1)If the winner ate n grapes, then 2nd place ate n+2-4=n-2 grapes, 3rd place ate n+2-6=n-4 grapes, 4th place ate n-6 grapes, and so on. Our sum can be written as n+(n-2)+(n-4)+(n-6)dots. If there are x places, we can express this sum as (x+1)n-x(x+1), as there are (x+1) occurrences of n, and (2+4+6+dots) is equal to x(x+1). This can be factored as (x+1)(n-x)=2009. Our factor pairs are (1,2009), (7,287), and (41,49). To minimize n we take (41,49). If x+1=41, then x=40 and n=40+49=boxed{089}.

Calculating the n-coordinate of the tangent line from O to the ellipse, we find the two n-coordinates are 1 and frac{3}{7}. Since frac{1}{3}<frac{3-sqrt{5}}{2}<frac{3}{7}, the lines from O to any point on the ellipse between A and B are not tangents to the ellipse.

Similarly, from equation (2), we know A C=2.

Thus, the arc with A C as the chord and frac{5 pi}{6} as the angle intersects the arc with A B as the chord and frac{5 pi}{6} as the angle inside triangle A B C at point O. Therefore, the solution to the original system of equations is (x, y, z)=left(frac{O B}{sqrt{3}}, frac{O C}{sqrt{3}}, O Aright).Thus, the required t is all real numbers satisfying frac{3-sqrt{5}}{2} leqslant t leqslant 1."},{"problem":"7.

To find such polynomials U and V, we need to apply the Euclidean algorithm to a=x^{3}+1 and b=x^{2}+1:begin{array}{rlr}a & =x b+r_{1} & left(r_{1}=1-xright), b & =-x r_{1}+r_{2} & left(r_{2}=x+1right), r_{1} & =-r_{2}+2 . &end{array}Expressing r_{1} and r_{2} sequentially in terms of a and b, we get:begin{aligned}b & =-x(a-b x)+r_{2} a-b x & =-b-x a+x^{2} b+2end{aligned}Thus, (x+1) a+left(-x^{2}-x+1right) b=2.

Conditions from the Problem:   - The graph of f(x) is tangent to the line y=1 at a point not on the axes, implying that at this point, f(x) = 1 and f'(x) = 0.   - The minimum value of f(x) is -31.3.

Solving for x_1 and x_2:   Since f(x_1) = 1, we can set up the equation x_1^3 + mx_1^2 + nx_1 + 1 = 1, simplifying to x_1^2 + mx_1 + n = 0 (Equation 1).

The minimum value of f(x), given as -31, occurs at x = -frac{m}{6}. Substituting this into f(x), we obtain:   [   1 - frac{m^3}{54} = -31   ]   Solving this equation yields m = 12.

Since both circles are inscribed in congruent triangles, they are congruent; therefore, EP = FQ = frac{287 - PQ}{2}.

Find the minimum number of good permutations. (2002","solution":"Analysis and Solution: Consider the worst-case scenario: for k=1,2, cdots, n, b_{1}+b_{2}+cdots+b_{k}>0 is difficult to satisfy. This only requires that the number of negative numbers in a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} is as many as possible. Let a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} all be negative, and a_{1}=-a_{2}-cdots-a_{n}+1. At this point, any good permutation left(b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}right) must have b_{1}=a_{1}, and b_{2}, cdots, b_{n} can be any permutation of a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}. Therefore, there are (n-1)! good permutations in this case.Next, we prove that there are at least (n-1)! good permutations. Note that (n-1)! is the number of different circular permutations of a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}. We first prove that each circular permutation corresponds to a good permutation. For convenience, we call the first term of a good permutation a good number. We only need to prove that each circular permutation must contain a good number.Method 1: Induction on n. When n=1, the conclusion is obviously true. Assume that for all n, the conclusion holds. For n+1, since the sum of all numbers is positive, there is at least one positive number. Group each positive number and the next positive number in the clockwise direction, along with all the numbers between them, into one group. Each group has at least one number, and at least one group has at least two numbers (since not all numbers are positive), so there are at most k-1 groups. Summing the numbers in each group, we get fewer than k sums. Write these sums in the order of their groups on the circle. Since the total sum of these sums is positive, by the induction hypothesis, there is a sum that is a good number. Consider the positive number in the group corresponding to this sum; this number is a good number in the entire circular permutation. By the principle of induction, the conclusion holds.Method 2: Using the extremal principle. For any circular permutation left(b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}right), consider all partial sums starting with b_{i}: b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}, where indices greater than n are taken modulo n. For all i=1,2, cdots, n and all t=0,1,2, cdots, n-1, there must be a smallest partial sum b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+c}. Since there is at least one non-positive number, b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t} leqslant 0. Among all such smallest sums, let the one with the largest number of terms t+1 be b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}. We prove that b_{i+t+1} is a good number.Indeed, if there exists a positive integer k such that b_{i+t+1}+b_{i+t+2}+cdots+b_{i+t+k} leqslant 0, then left(b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}right)+left(b_{i+t+1}+b_{i+t+2}+cdots+b_{i+t+k}right) leqslant b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}, which contradicts the fact that b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t} is the smallest and has the most terms.Since there are (n-1)! circular permutations, and each circular permutation corresponds to at least one good permutation, and different circular permutations correspond to different good permutations, there are at least (n-1)! good permutations.In conclusion, the minimum value is (n-1)!."},{"problem":"Let f(x) = ln x + 1, g(x) = ax + 2, where a in mathbb{R}.

However, we also show that there are infinitely many other positive natural numbers (z) that satisfy the statement of the problem.For the first moves for (a) and (a+z) to remove the same stone, (a) and (a+z) must leave the same remainder when divided by 6, so (z) must be divisible by 6, as then, although possibly different numbers of laps around the initially 6 occupied fields are performed, the counting stops at the same position, so the same first stone is removed.For the second moves for (a) and (a+z) to remove the same second stone, (a) and (a+z) must also leave the same remainder when divided by 5, so (z) must also be divisible by 5, as then, analogously, different numbers of laps through the 5 remaining occupied fields may be performed, but the counting stops at the same position, so the same second stone is removed.

Consider the sum of all \\"horizontal\\" addends and the sum of all \\"vertical\\" addends separately across the entire table. If we maximize each of these two sums separately, the total sum will also be the largest.Consider the sum of the \\"horizontal\\" addends. If a row contains x_{i} black cells and 8-x_{i} white cells, then the sum of the horizontal addends in this row is x_{i}(8-x_{i}). Summing this sum over all rows, we get 8(x_{1}+ldots+x_{8})-x_{1}^{2}-ldots-x_{8}^{2}=8 cdot 23-(x_{1}^{2}+ldots+x_{8}^{2}).

Arrange Marbles on the Diagonal:   - Place each of the 2024 marbles on one of the two main diagonals of the (2024 times 2024) grid. For example, place a marble at each cell ((i, i)) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 2024).2. Verify the Condition:   - Each marble is placed such that no two marbles are in neighboring cells. Neighboring cells share an edge, but in this arrangement, each marble is only diagonally adjacent to another marble, not sharing an edge.3. Check the Movement Condition:   - Moving any marble to a neighboring cell (either up, down, left, or right) will place it in a cell that is already occupied by another marble, violating the condition that no two marbles are in neighboring cells.Thus, the arrangement satisfies the conditions, and moving any marble will violate the conditions. Part (b)1. Claim: (k = 2023) is the Largest Value:   - We need to show that for (k = 2023), there exists an arrangement where moving any marble to a neighboring cell will still satisfy the conditions.2. Assume (k = 2024 - n) Marbles:   - Let (n geq 1). We need to show that there is always a way to move a marble if (k < 2024).3. Free Rows and Columns:   - Since there are fewer than 2024 marbles, there will be rows and columns without any marbles, called free rows and columns.   - Let (p) be the number of free columns and (q) be the number of free rows. Without loss of generality, assume (p geq q).4. Claim 1: No Two Free Rows are Adjacent:   - If there were two adjacent free rows, there must be a marble adjacent to this block. Moving this marble into the block would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption.5. Claim 2: The Leftmost Column is Not Free:   - If the leftmost column were free, moving a marble from the next column to the leftmost column would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption.6. Marbles in Non-Free Columns:   - For each free column, the column immediately to the left contains a marble. If a marble is at ((x, y)), there must be another marble at ((x+2, y)) to prevent moving the marble to ((x+1, y)).7. Counting Marbles and Rows:   - There are (p) free columns, so there are at least (p) pairs of marbles with a distance vector ((2, 0)). These pairs use up (p) rows.   - The remaining (2024 - n - 2p) marbles can use at most (2024 - n - 2p) rows.   - Therefore, at most (p + (2024 - n - 2p) = 2024 - n - p) rows have marbles, implying at least (p + n) rows are free.8. Contradiction:   - Since (p geq q), the number of free rows (q) must be at least (p + n), which is a contradiction.Thus, the largest value of (k) such that for all arrangements of (k) marbles, we can move one marble to a neighboring cell and still satisfy the conditions is (k = 2023).The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2023 } )"},{"problem":"A trapezium  ABCD, in which  AB is parallel to  CD, is inscribed in a circle with centre  O.

Then the equation becomes:   [   a^3 + 1 = a^2 cdot frac{1}{y}   ]   Solving for ( y ):   [   y = frac{a^2}{a^3 + 1}   ]3. To find the maximum value of ( x ), express ( x ) in terms of ( a ) and ( y ):   [   x = ay = a cdot frac{a^2}{a^3 + 1} = frac{a^3}{a^3 + 1}   ]   We need to maximize ( frac{a^3}{a^3 + 1} ). Consider the function:   [   f(a) = frac{a^3}{a^3 + 1}   ]   To find the maximum, take the derivative and set it to zero:   [   f'(a) = frac{(a^3 + 1) cdot 3a^2 - a^3 cdot 3a^2}{(a^3 + 1)^2} = frac{3a^2}{(a^3 + 1)^2}   ]   Setting ( f'(a) = 0 ):   [   3a^2 = 0 implies a = 0   ]   Since ( a ) must be positive, we check the boundary as ( a to infty ):   [   lim_{a to infty} frac{a^3}{a^3 + 1} = 1   ]   However, this does not provide a finite maximum. Instead, we use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value.4. Apply the AM-GM inequality to ( x ):   [   frac{x}{27} = left(frac{a}{3}right)^3 (1 - a) leq left(frac{3 cdot frac{a}{3} + 1 - a}{4}right)^4 = frac{1}{256}   ]   Therefore, the maximum value of ( x ) is:   [   A = frac{27}{256}   ]5. Similarly, express ( y ) in terms of ( a ):   [   y = frac{a^2}{a^3 + 1}   ]   Apply the AM-GM inequality to ( y ):   [   frac{y}{4} = left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 (1 - a) leq left(frac{2 cdot frac{a}{2} + 1 - a}{3}right)^3 = frac{1}{27}   ]   Therefore, the maximum value of ( y ) is:   [   B = frac{4}{27}   ]6. Finally, calculate the ratio ( frac{A}{B} ):   [   frac{A}{B} = frac{frac{27}{256}}{frac{4}{27}} = frac{27}{256} cdot frac{27}{4} = frac{729}{1024}   ]The final answer is ( boxed{frac{729}{1024}} )."},{"problem":"7.

In this case, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{mathrm{j}}, A_{4} are all in the Northern Hemisphere (including the equator). If there are no antipodal points, then the North Pole has no points. If a quadrant in the Northern Hemisphere, bounded by a quarter of the equator and two mutually perpendicular meridians, contains two A_{mathrm{t}}, then due to (24.1), one must be at the \\"corner\\" (i.e., the intersection of the equator and a meridian), and the other must be on the opposite meridian. Thus, the difference in longitude between any two of A_{1}, cdots, A_{4} is less than frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, they lie on the four meridians that divide the Northern Hemisphere into four quadrants. Finally, if one point is not on the equator, then its two \\"neighbors\\" must be on the equator (each in a quadrant's \\"corner\\"), and these two points are antipodal.Since there are always two antipodal points A_{1}, A_{2}, and the third point A_{3} cannot simultaneously satisfy angle A_{1} O A_{3} > frac{pi}{2} and angle A_{2} O A_{3} > frac{pi}{2}, the strict inequality in (24.1) cannot hold.

By setting x=-f(y) this gives f(-f(y))=f(y)^{2}+f(0). Finally, by replacing x with -f(x) and using the previous equality: f(f(y)-f(x))=(f(y)-f(x))^{2}+f(0). According to the first point, we have f(t)=t^{2}+f(0) for all real t.Second solution. For x=0 we get f(f(y))=f(y)^{2}+f(0) for all real y. By replacing x with f(x): f(f(x)+f(y))=(f(x)+f(y))^{2}+f(0). We can see the solutions f(x)=x^{2}+c where c is a constant. These functions are indeed solutions, as is the null function. We set g(x)=f(x)-x^{2}. The functional equation then becomes, after calculations:text { for all real } x, y quad gleft(x+g(y)+y^{2}right)=g(x)In particular, for all real x:gleft(g(x)+x^{2}right)=g(0)Let's reason by contradiction assuming that g is not constant. Then there exists a real a such that g(a) neq g(0). According to (III.12), for all real x we have g(x)+x^{2} neq a and according to (III.11) for all real x and y: g(x)+x^{2} neq a+g(y)+y^{2} or equivalentlyg(x)-g(y)+x^{2}-y^{2} neq aWe choose x=y+g(u)+u^{2} where u is arbitrary. Then for all u, y, according to (III.13): (y+g(u)+ left.u^{2}right)^{2}-y^{2} neq a, or equivalently2 yleft(g(u)+u^{2}right) neq a-left(g(u)+u^{2}right)^{2}Since f is not the null function, there exists u such that f(u) neq 0 and thus g(u) neq-u^{2}. For this u, the equation 2 yleft(g(u)+u^{2}right)=a-left(g(u)+u^{2}right)^{2} has a solution in y. Contradiction. Thus, g is constant and consequently for all real x, we have f(x)=x^{2}+c where c is a constant."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} satisfying a_1=1 and a_n+a_{n+1}=left(frac{1}{4}right)^n (ninmathbb{N}^*), and S_n=a_1+a_2cdot4+a_3cdot4^2+...+a_ncdot4^{n-1}.

[   f(k+1) = f(k) cdot left(1 + frac{1}{1 + 2^{k+1}}right)   ]   Substitute the inductive hypothesis:   [   f(k+1) = frac{2^{k+1}}{2^k + 1} cdot left(1 + frac{1}{1 + 2^{k+1}}right) = frac{2^{k+1}}{2^k + 1} cdot frac{2^{k+1} + 2}{2^{k+1} + 1}   ]   Simplify the expression:   [   f(k+1) = frac{2^{k+1}}{2^k + 1} cdot frac{2(2^k + 1)}{2^{k+1} + 1} = frac{2^{k+1} cdot 2(2^k + 1)}{(2^k + 1)(2^{k+1} + 1)} = frac{2^{k+2}}{2^{k+1} + 1}   ]   The inductive step holds, so by induction, ( f(n) = frac{2^{n+1}}{2^n + 1} ) for all ( n ).4. Calculate ( f(10) ):   [   f(10) = frac{2^{10+1}}{2^{10} + 1} = frac{2^{11}}{2^{10} + 1} = frac{2048}{1025}   ]5. Since ( m = 2048 ) and ( n = 1025 ) are relatively prime, we have ( m + n = 2048 + 1025 = 3073 ).The final answer is (boxed{3073})."},{"problem":"In the linear function y=kx+b, where y decreases as x increases and b lt 0, the graph of this function does not pass through which quadrant?A: First quadrantB: Second quadrantC: Third quadrantD: Fourth quadrant","solution":"To analyze the behavior of the linear function y=kx+b and determine through which quadrants its graph does not pass, we follow these steps:1. Understanding the Slope: Given that y decreases as x increases, we infer that the slope of the line, k, must be negative. This is because the slope of a line indicates how much y changes for a unit change in x. A negative slope means that as x increases, y decreases. Therefore, we have:   [   k < 0   ]2. Intercept Analysis: We are also given that b < 0. This means the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, is below the origin (0,0) since b represents the y-coordinate of the y-intercept.3. Graph Behavior and Quadrant Analysis: With a negative slope and a negative y-intercept, the line will start in the lower half of the Cartesian plane (below the x-axis) and slope downwards as it moves to the right. This behavior ensures that:   - The line will pass through the Second Quadrant as it moves from below the origin, sloping downwards to the right.   - It will definitely pass through the Third Quadrant because the y-intercept is below the origin, and with a negative slope, the line extends into this quadrant.   - As it continues to the right, with both x and y being negative in the third quadrant and then x becoming positive while y remains negative, it will also pass through the Fourth Quadrant.Given these observations, the only quadrant the graph does not pass through is the First Quadrant, where both x and y are positive. This is because, with a negative slope and a negative y-intercept, the line does not enter the region where both coordinates are positive.Therefore, the correct answer is:[boxed{A}]"},{"problem":"Four, (Full marks 20 points) In triangle A B C, if frac{cos A}{sin B}+ frac{cos B}{sin A}=2, and the perimeter of triangle A B C is 12.

The rook can move horizontally or vertically to an adjacent cell. We aim to minimize the maximum difference between the numbers in these adjacent cells.1. Zig-Zag Pattern:   Consider a zig-zag pattern where the rook travels through the board. For an ( n times n ) board, the rook starts at the top-left corner and moves right until it reaches the end of the row, then moves down to the next row and moves left, and so on. This pattern ensures that each cell is visited exactly once.2. Numbering the Cells:   Number the cells in the order the rook visits them. For example, in a ( 3 times 3 ) board, the numbering would be:   [   begin{array}{ccc}   1 & 2 & 3    6 & 5 & 4    7 & 8 & 9    end{array}   ]3. Calculating Differences:   In this pattern, the difference between numbers in neighboring cells is either 1 (horizontal movement) or ( 2n-1 ) (vertical movement between rows). For example, in the ( 3 times 3 ) board:   - Horizontal differences: ( |2-1| = 1 ), ( |3-2| = 1 ), ( |5-6| = 1 ), etc.   - Vertical differences: ( |6-3| = 3 ), ( |7-6| = 1 ), etc.4. Generalizing for ( n times n ) Board:   For an ( n times n ) board, the maximum difference in the zig-zag pattern occurs when moving from the end of one row to the start of the next row. This difference is ( 2n-1 ).5. Proof of Minimality:   To prove that ( 2n-1 ) is the minimal possible value of ( M ), consider any other pattern of movement. Any pattern must visit each cell exactly once, and the maximum difference will always be at least ( 2n-1 ) due to the need to transition between rows.

Since overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = 0, it follows that x_{1}x_{2} + y_{1}y_{2} = 0, which gives frac{2m^{2} - 8}{1 + 2k^{2}} + frac{m^{2} - 8k^{2}}{1 + 2k^{2}} = 0. This simplifies to 3m^{2} - 8k^{2} - 8 = 0, and hence m^{2} = frac{8(k^{2} + 1)}{3}.Finally, the distance d from point O to line AB is d = frac{|m|}{sqrt{k^{2} + 1}} = frac{sqrt{frac{8(k^{2} + 1)}{3}}}{sqrt{k^{2} + 1}} = frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}.In conclusion, the distance from point O to line AB is constant and equal to boxed{frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}}."},{"problem":"Given  dfrac {5π}{2} < x < 3π, simplify the result of  sqrt { dfrac {1-sin ( dfrac {3}{2}π-x)}{2}} to be ( ).A: -cos dfrac {x}{2}B: cos dfrac {x}{2}C: ±cos dfrac {x}{2}D: cos^2 dfrac {x}{2}","solution":"Since it is known that  dfrac {5π}{2} < x < 3π, it follows that  dfrac {x}{2} in ( dfrac {5π}{4}, dfrac {3π}{2}).Therefore,  sqrt { dfrac {1-sin ( dfrac {3}{2}π-x)}{2}}= sqrt { dfrac {1+cos x}{2}}= sqrt { dfrac {1+2cos^2 dfrac {x}{2}-1}{2}}=|cos dfrac {x}{2}|=-cos dfrac {x}{2}.Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{A}.This problem involves utilizing trigonometric identities and the double-angle cosine formula to simplify the given expression.

The average m of the first set of data is given by:   [   m = frac{x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_8}{8}   ]   This implies:   [   x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_8 = 8m   ]2. The average overline{x} of the second set of data, which includes m as an additional data point, is calculated as follows:   [   overline{x} = frac{x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_8 + m}{9} = frac{8m + m}{9} = m   ]3.

At the end of the operations we verify, for each lamp, turned on or turned off, how many signals it has received. If it was reached by an even number of signals, it remains on the same state(that is, if it was turned on, it will be turned on; if it was turned off, it will be turned off).

We define a function f: Psi rightarrow Psi where, if xi is a configuration of lamps, then f(xi) is the configurations obtained after we perform the [i]cool procedure[/i] described above.Determine all values of n for which f is bijective.","solution":"To determine all values of ( n ) for which the function ( f ) is bijective, we need to analyze the behavior of the function ( f ) defined on the set of all possible configurations of ( n ) lamps. We will use polynomial theory and properties of finite fields to achieve this.1. Polynomial Representation:   Consider the configuration of lamps as a polynomial ( g_a(x) ) in ( mathbb{F}_2[x] ) modulo ( x^n - 1 ). Each lamp configuration can be represented as a polynomial where the coefficient of ( x^i ) is 1 if the ( i )-th lamp is on and 0 if it is off.2. Function Definition:   The function ( f ) can be expressed in terms of polynomials as:   [   f(g_a) = frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} pmod{x^n - 1}   ]   This function describes the transformation of the lamp configuration after performing the cool procedure.3. Bijectivity Condition:   For ( f ) to be bijective, it must be injective. This means that if ( f(g_a) = 0 ), then ( g_a ) must be 0. We need to analyze when ( f(g_a) = 0 ) implies ( g_a = 0 ).4. Factorization of ( n ):   Let ( n = 2^k cdot m ), where ( m ) is odd. We will consider two cases: ( m = 1 ) and ( m > 1 ).5. Case ( m > 1 ):   - Lemma: If ( x^n - 1 mid x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x) ), then:     [     frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} = 0 quad text{or} quad frac{x^n - 1}{x-1} pmod{x^n - 1}     ]   - Proof of Lemma: Since ( frac{x^n - 1}{x-1} ) divides ( frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} ), we have:     [     frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} = q(x) cdot frac{x^n - 1}{x-1}     ]     for some polynomial ( q(x) ). This implies that the lemma holds.   - Permutation Analysis: Consider the function ( h(x) = 2x + 1 pmod{n} ). This function is a permutation on the set ( {0, 1, ldots, n-1} ) with at least two cycles when ( m > 1 ). This is because ( h(m cdot 2^k - 1) = m cdot 2^k - 1 ), forming a cycle of length 1.   - Cycle Construction: For a cycle of length ( j ) containing elements ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_j ), construct the polynomial:     [     g_a(x) = sum_{i=1}^j x^{c_i}     ]     This polynomial satisfies ( x^n - 1 mid x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x) ). Since there are at least two cycles, either one of them is 0, or the sum of them will be 0. Thus, there exists a non-zero polynomial ( g ) such that ( f(g) = 0 ).6. Case ( m = 1 ):   - When ( n = 2^k ), we need to show that ( f ) is bijective. Consider the function ( h(x) = 2x + 1 pmod{n} ). If ( g_a(x) ) has a term ( x^m ) where ( m neq 2^k - 1 ), then:     [     x^n - 1 mid x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)     ]     By analyzing the ( 2 )-adic valuation ( upsilon_2 ), we can show that no such ( m_1 ) exists, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( g_a(x) = x^{2^k - 1} ) gives ( f(g_a) = frac{x^{2^k} - 1}{x-1} neq 0 ).Conclusion:- For ( n = 2^k ), the function ( f ) is bijective.- For ( n = 2^k cdot m ) with ( m > 1 ), the function ( f ) is not bijective.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 2^k } )."},{"problem":"3-ча 1.

The number (k) is rational; let (frac{1}{k-1}=frac{p}{q}) be an irreducible fraction.

To determine the probability, we need to know how many ways the ants can move and out of these, in how many cases they meet. The total number of cases is easy to determine: each ant can move in 3 directions, and there are 8 ants, which gives 3^{8} possibilities. Counting the number of cases where the ants meet seems quite hopeless. In such cases, it can help to determine the number of other possibilities, that is, now the number of cases where the ants do not meet.If the ants do not meet at the end of their path, it means that there will be one ant at each vertex again. If we marked with arrows where the ants are going from, then one arrow would start from each vertex, and one arrow would point to each vertex. We also know that two ants do not move towards each other, so at most one arrow can run along an edge. From all this, it follows that the \\"movement\\" of the ants will define one or more closed paths (loops) of length greater than two.

Alternatively, of the 10 small marbles, if 9 go through hole #1 and 1 goes through hole #2, we have scored 11 points. The 4 medium marbles can now go through hole #3 giving a score of 11+3 times 4=23.

Find the function that satisfies the above conditions, and write down its analytical expression f(x)=______.","solution":"Given the conditions for the function f(x), let's break down the solution step by step:1. Odd Function Property: Since f(x) is an odd function, we have the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}, and specifically, f(0) = 0.2. Even Function Property for f(x+2): Given that f(x+2) is even, we have f(-x+2) = f(x+2). By substituting x with x+2, we get f(-(x+2)+2) = f(x+2), which simplifies to f(-x) = f(x+4). Using the odd function property, we can rewrite this as -f(x) = f(x+4), leading to f(x+4) = -f(x).3. Periodicity: From f(x+4) = -f(x), by applying the transformation again, we get f(x+8) = -f(x+4) = f(x). This shows that f(x) is periodic with a period of 8.4. Monotonicity: Given frac{f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2})}{x_{1} - x_{2}} < 0 for any x_{1}, x_{2} in (0,2) with x_{1} neq x_{2}, it implies f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0,2).5. Function Form Assumption: Assuming f(x) = Asin(omega x) and knowing the period is 8, we set the period T = frac{2pi}{omega} = 8, solving for omega gives omega = frac{pi}{4}.6. Determining the Amplitude A: Since f(x) = Asinleft(frac{pi}{4}xright) must be monotonically decreasing on (0,2), and considering sin x is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{pi}{2}), we conclude A must be negative.

Matrix Definition and Initial Setup:   The given matrix ( A ) is an ( n times n ) matrix where the entry in the ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column is (frac{1}{min(i,j)}). We need to compute the determinant of ( A ).2. Column Operations:   We use the property that adding a linear multiple of one column to another column does not change the determinant. Label the columns of the matrix ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_n ).3. Transformation to Lower Triangular Matrix:   Consider a new matrix ( B ) where:   - The first column of ( B ) is ( C_1 ).   - For ( k geq 2 ), the ( k )-th column of ( B ) is ( -(C_k - C_{k-1}) ).   This transformation involves subtracting ( C_{k-1} ) from ( C_k ) and then multiplying by (-1). Since we are performing ( n-1 ) such operations, the determinant of ( B ) is related to the determinant of ( A ) by:   [   det(B) = (-1)^{n-1} det(A)   ]4. Analyzing the Entries of ( B ):   For ( j leq k ), the ( j )-th entry of ( C_k ) is (frac{1}{j}), and for ( j geq k ), the ( j )-th entry of ( C_k ) is (frac{1}{k}). Therefore, the ( j )-th entry of ( C_{k-1} - C_k ) is:   - ( 0 ) for ( j < k-1 )   - ( frac{1}{k-1} - frac{1}{k} ) for ( j = k-1 )   - ( 0 ) for ( j > k-1 )   This makes ( B ) a lower triangular matrix with the diagonal entries being ( frac{1}{k-1} - frac{1}{k} ) for ( k = 2, 3, ldots, n ).5. Determinant of Lower Triangular Matrix:   The determinant of a lower triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries. Therefore:   [   det(B) = prod_{k=2}^{n} left( frac{1}{k-1} - frac{1}{k} right)   ]6. Simplifying the Product:   Each term in the product can be simplified as:   [   frac{1}{k-1} - frac{1}{k} = frac{k - (k-1)}{k(k-1)} = frac{1}{k(k-1)}   ]   Thus:   [   det(B) = prod_{k=2}^{n} frac{1}{k(k-1)} = frac{1}{2 cdot 1} cdot frac{1}{3 cdot 2} cdot frac{1}{4 cdot 3} cdots frac{1}{n cdot (n-1)}   ]7.

Case 1: ( P(x) ) is a constant polynomial   If ( P(x) ) is a constant polynomial, say ( P(x) = c ), then ( |P(x)| = |c| ) for all ( x ). Since ( s(|c|) ) is a constant, the condition ( s(x) = s(y) implies s(|P(x)|) = s(|P(y)|) ) holds trivially. 2. Case 2: ( P(x) ) is a non-constant polynomial   Assume ( P(x) ) is not a constant polynomial. Let ( P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ) where ( a_i in mathbb{Z} ) and ( a_n neq 0 ).3. Non-negativity of coefficients   We first show that all coefficients ( a_i ) must be non-negative. Assume for contradiction that there exists ( k ) such that ( a_k < 0 ). Let ( k ) be the largest such index. Then for sufficiently large ( m ), ( P(10^m) ) will have a large negative term ( a_k 10^{km} ) which will dominate the polynomial, making ( P(10^m) ) negative. This contradicts the requirement that ( s(|P(10^m)|) = s(|P(1)|) ) for all ( m geq 0 ), as the sum of digits of a negative number is not defined in the same way. Hence, all ( a_i geq 0 ).4. Degree of the polynomial   Next, we show that the degree of ( P(x) ) must be 1. Assume ( deg(P) > 1 ). Consider ( P(10^m x) ):   [   P(10^m x) = a_n (10^m x)^n + a_{n-1} (10^m x)^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 (10^m x) + a_0   ]   For large ( m ), the polynomial ( P(10^m x) ) will have terms with many zeros between significant digits, making the sum of digits of ( P(10^m x) ) very large. This contradicts the requirement that ( s(P(x)) = s(P(10^m x)) ). Therefore, ( deg(P) = 1 ).5. Form of the polynomial   Let ( P(x) = ax + b ). We need to show that ( a = 10^k ) and ( 0 leq b < 10^k ). Assume ( a neq 10^k ). Consider ( x = c cdot 10^k + d cdot 10^m ) where ( c, d < 10 ) and ( k, m ) are chosen such that the significant digits of ( ac cdot 10^k ) and ( ad cdot 10^m ) overlap. By choosing ( c ) and ( d ) appropriately, we can ensure that the sum of digits of ( P(x) ) exceeds the sum of digits of ( P(y) ) for some ( y ), contradicting the given condition. Hence, ( a = 10^k ).6. Bound on ( b )   If ( b geq 10^k ), consider ( x = 9 cdot 10^m ) for large ( m ). The sum of digits of ( P(x) = 10^k cdot 9 cdot 10^m + b ) will be large, contradicting the condition. Therefore, ( 0 leq b < 10^k ).Conclusion:The only non-constant polynomials ( P(x) ) that satisfy the given condition are of the form ( P(x) = pm (10^k x + c) ) where ( 0 leq c < 10^k ).The final answer is ( boxed{ P(x) = pm (10^k x + c) } ) where ( 0 leq c < 10^k )."},{"problem":"The angle between two lines l₁: x-y=0, l₂: x+y-1=0 is ______.","solution":"According to the question, let the slope of l₁ be k₁, and the slope of l₂ be k₂.Then k₁ = - frac {1}{-1} = 1, k₂ = - frac {1}{1} = -1.So, k₁ • k₂ = -1.Therefore, the angle between the lines l₁: x-y=0, l₂: x+y-1=0 is frac {π}{2}.Hence, fill in: boxed{frac {π}{2}}.Let the slope of l₁ be k₁, and the slope of l₂ be k₂.

Solution 1: The number under the square root is non-negative: x geq 1. Since the right side is positive in this case, the left side must also be positive: x^{2}-4 x+3=(x-1)(x-3)>0. Since x>3. Rearranging the equation:(x-2)^{2}+1=sqrt{1+sqrt{x-1}}+2The function f:(3 ;+infty) rightarrow(2 ;+infty), f(x)=(x-2)^{2}+1 is strictly increasing and bijective on its domain, hence invertible. Its inverse function is f^{-1}:(2 ;+infty) rightarrow(3 ;+infty), f^{-1}(x)=sqrt{x-1}+2. Taking the value of both sides at f^{-1}(x)=sqrt{x-1}+2:f^{-1}left(f^{-1}(x)right)=sqrt{1+sqrt{x-1}}+2The right side is precisely the right side of (1). Based on this, the equation is:f^{-1}left(f^{-1}(x)right)=f(x)which is true if and only if f^{-1}(x)=f(f(x)), or x=f(f(f(x))).Since the function f is strictly increasing, if f(x)>x then f(f(x))>f(x)>x, from which f(f(f(x)))>f(f(x))>f(x)>x follows. Similarly, if f(x)<x then f(f(x))<f(x)<x, and f(f(f(x)))<f(f(x))<f(x)<x. Therefore, the only solution is f(x)=x, which gives x=frac{5+sqrt{5}}{2}, satisfying the condition x>3. Substituting back into the original equation, both sides yield frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}, so the solution is valid.II. Solution. Since x=1 is not a solution, let a=sqrt{x-1}>0. Then x^{2}-4 x+3=(x-1)(x-3)=a^{2}left(a^{2}-2right) and sqrt{1+sqrt{x-1}}=sqrt{1+a}. From this, a^{2}left(a^{2}-2right)=sqrt{1+a}, squaring both sides gives a^{4}left(a^{4}-4 a^{2}+4right)=1+a. Rearranging, a^{8}-4 a^{6}+4 a^{4}-a-1=0.Let's try to factor the left side:begin{aligned}a^{8}-4 a^{6}+4 a^{4}-a-1= & a^{8}-a^{7}-a^{6}+a^{7}-a^{6}-a^{5}-2 a^{6}+2 a^{5}+2 a^{4}- & -a^{5}+a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{4}-a^{3}-a^{2}+a^{2}-a-1= = & left(a^{2}-a-1right)left(a^{6}+a^{5}-2 a^{4}-a^{3}+a^{2}+1right)end{aligned}This is zero if and only if one of the factors is zero.Examining the second factor:begin{aligned}a^{6}+a^{5}-2 a^{4}-a^{3}+a^{2}+1 & =a^{6}-2 a^{3}+1+a^{5}-2 a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}= & =left(a^{3}-1right)^{2}+a^{3}(a-1)^{2}+a^{2}>0end{aligned}since the first two terms are non-negative and the third is positive.If the first factor is zero: a^{2}-a-1=0, then a_{1,2}=frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2}. Since a>0, only the positive solution is valid: a=frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}. Since x=a^{2}+1, we getx=1+frac{6+2 sqrt{5}}{4}=frac{10+2 sqrt{5}}{4}=frac{5+sqrt{5}}{2}Substituting this back, it indeed gives a valid solution.Note. Anyone who factored an 8th-degree polynomial without justification could receive a maximum of 3 points.III. Solution.

Using the hint provided, we know:   [   sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n^2} = frac{pi^2}{6}   ]4. We can express the product over all integers ( n ) as:   [   prod_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n^2}{(n-1)(n+1)}   ]5.

On the left diagram, all knights that attack exactly 4 squares of the board are marked (for convenience, they are highlighted in different colors). Let's call such knights bad. To stop a knight from attacking four others, one must remove either this knight or one of those it attacks.

After investigation, it was found that for every 1 yuan reduction in price, an additional 20 helmets can be sold per month. It is known that the cost price of each helmet is 50 yuan. What is the selling price per helmet when the store maximizes its monthly profit?A: 50B: 90C: 80D: 70","solution":"To solve this problem, we first need to establish a relationship between the selling price, the number of helmets sold, and the profit. Let's denote:- x as the selling price per helmet in yuan.- w as the monthly profit in yuan.Given that the store sells a batch of helmets for 80 yuan each and can sell 200 helmets per month, we can express the monthly profit as a function of the selling price. The cost price of each helmet is 50 yuan, so the profit per helmet is (x - 50) yuan. Additionally, for every 1 yuan reduction in price from 80 yuan, an additional 20 helmets can be sold. This means that if the selling price is set to x yuan, the number of helmets sold can be expressed as 200 + (80 - x) times 20. Therefore, the profit function w in terms of x is given by:[w = (x - 50) times [200 + (80 - x) times 20]]Expanding this expression, we get:[w = (x - 50) times (200 + 1600 - 20x)][w = (x - 50) times (1800 - 20x)][w = -20x^2 + 1800x - 20 times 50x + 1800 times 50][w = -20x^2 + 1600x + 90000][w = -20(x^2 - 80x - 4500)][w = -20(x^2 - 80x + 1600 - 1600 - 4500)][w = -20((x - 40)^2 - 6100)][w = -20(x - 40)^2 + 122000]To maximize profit w, we need to minimize (x - 40)^2, which occurs when x = 40. However, this does not align with the given solution. Let's correct the algebraic manipulation to align with the provided solution:Given:[w = (x - 50) times [200 + (80 - x) times 20]]This simplifies to:[w = (x - 50) times (200 + 1600 - 20x)][w = -20(x - 50)(x - 80)][w = -20(x^2 - 130x + 4000)][w = -20x^2 + 2600x - 80000]To find the maximum profit, we need to complete the square or directly identify the vertex of this parabola. The profit function is a quadratic equation in the form of w = -20x^2 + 2600x - 80000, which opens downwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is negative), indicating that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola.The vertex of a parabola in the form ax^2 + bx + c is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}. Applying this to our profit function gives:[x = -frac{2600}{2 times (-20)} = 70]Therefore, the selling price per helmet that maximizes the store's monthly profit is boxed{70} yuan, which corresponds to choice boxed{D}."},{"problem":"N3.

Indeed, if the height difference between a_{i+1} and a_{i} were at least 2 for some i, then we could remove a token from a_{i+1}; if a_{1} had more than 0 tokens, then we could remove a token from this pile.Thus, the pile a_{i} at the end of the game will have i-1 tokens for every i in{1,2, ldots, 53}. The number N of tokens that will be removed to reach the decisive configuration is equal to the difference between the number of tokens initially present and the number of tokens in the final configuration, that is,N=2020-(0+1+cdots+52)=2020-frac{52 cdot 53}{2}=642Since we can write N=4 cdot 160+2 and there are 4 players, when the decisive configuration is reached, it will be Claudio's turn, so Claudio loses."},{"problem":"The Internet has entered the era of 5G.

Now, we assume (n geq 5) and analyze the equation (2^{n^2-10} + 2133 = a^3). We need to find a general form for (n) that satisfies this equation.4. Since (n) is not divisible by 3, (n^2 mod 3 equiv 1). This implies (n^2 = 3k + 1) for some integer (k).5. Substituting (n^2 = 3k + 1) into the equation, we get:   [   2^{3k + 1 - 10} + 2133 = a^3 implies 2^{3k - 9} + 2133 = a^3   ]6.

Since (n geq 5), we have (n^2 geq 25), which implies (3k + 1 geq 25), so (3k geq 24) and (k geq 8).8. For (k geq 8), (m = 3k - 9 geq 15).

Since (2133 = 3 times 711), we need to check if (a - 2^k) and (a^2 + 2^k a + 2^{2k}) can be factors of 2133.

(x + y) 12 + (x - y) 12 is an increasing function of y, so we maximise the sum by taking as many as possible of the numbers at the endpoints of the allowed interval. There certainly cannot be more than two numbers not at the endpoints, for otherwise we could increase one and decrease the other, thus increasing the sum. If we take n equal to -1/√3 and 1997 - n equal to √3, then -n/√3 + (1997 - n)√3 = -318√3, so n = 1736.25, which does not work. So we cannot have all the numbers at the endpoints. But we can take 1736 equal to -1/√3, 260 equal to √3 and 1 equal to 2/√3. That gives 1736/3 6 + 260.3 6 + 2 12 /3 6 for the sum. But we need to check that this is the only possibility for just one number not at the endpoints. Suppose we take n at -1/√3 and 1996 - n at √3.

By the pigeonhole principle, at least three of the cells in the first row must be the same color. Without loss of generality, assume these three cells are white.   - Now, consider the remaining four rows. To avoid forming a rectangle with the three white cells in the first row, each of these rows can have at most one white cell in the columns corresponding to the three white cells in the first row.   - Therefore, each of the remaining four rows must have at least two black cells in the columns corresponding to the three white cells in the first row.   - If any of these four rows has no white cells in the columns corresponding to the three white cells in the first row, it will have only black cells, and the other rows will be forced to form rectangles with this row or the first row.   - Thus, each of the remaining four rows must have exactly one white cell in the columns corresponding to the three white cells in the first row.   - By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one column among the three columns with white cells in the first row that contains at least two white cells from the remaining four rows.   - These two white cells, along with the white cell in the first row, will form a rectangle with the black cells in the other two rows, violating the condition.   - Therefore, it is impossible to color a ( 5 times 5 ) grid to satisfy the given condition.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 4 } )"},{"problem":"Find the number of positive integers x satisfying the following two conditions:\\r1. x<10^{2006}\\r2. x^{2}-x is divisible by 10^{2006}","solution":"To find the number of positive integers ( x ) satisfying the given conditions, we need to analyze the divisibility condition ( x^2 - x ) by ( 10^{2006} ).1.

( |A_1| = |A_2| = cdots = |A_n| = k ) and ( k > frac{|A|}{2} ).     2.

For any ( i, j ) (with ( 1 leq i < j leq n )), ( |A_i cap A_j| leq 3 ).2. Analyzing the Union of Three Sets:   - Consider the union of three sets ( A_r, A_s, A_t ):     [     |A_r cup A_s cup A_t| = |A_r| + |A_s| + |A_t| - |A_r cap A_s| - |A_s cap A_t| - |A_t cap A_r| + |A_r cap A_s cap A_t|     ]   - Given ( |A_r cap A_s|, |A_s cap A_t|, |A_t cap A_r| leq 3 ) and ( |A_r cap A_s cap A_t| geq 2 ) (since ( a, b in A_r cap A_s cap A_t )):     [     |A| geq 3k - 9 + 2     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     |A| geq 3k - 7     ]3.

Find all values of b for which the described configuration is possible.","solution":"Answer: b=frac{169}{60}.Solution. First, consider b>0. Let the origin be denoted as O(0 ; 0), the center of the circle as Q(a ; b) (since it lies on the line y=b, its ordinate is b); the points of intersection of the line with the parabola as Aleft(x_{1} ; y_{1}right) and Bleft(x_{2} ; y_{2}right)left(x_{1}0right). Also, let T(0 ; b) be the point of intersection of the given line with the ordinate axis, and C be the point of intersection of the circle with the ordinate axis, different from O.Triangle Q O C is isosceles (Q O=Q C as radii), and Q T is its height, hence Q T is also a median, C T=O T, so the point C has coordinates (0 ; 2 b). Drop a perpendicular A H from point A to the ordinate axis. Then angle T A H is the angle of inclination of the line, its tangent is frac{12}{5}. Therefore, cos angle T A H=frac{5}{13}, A T=A H: cos angle T A H=frac{13}{5} A H=-frac{13 x_{1}}{5}. Similarly, we find that B T=frac{13 x_{2}}{5}.A B and O C are two chords of the given circle.

The abscissas x_{1} and x_{2} of the points of intersection of the line y=frac{12}{5} x+b and the parabola y=frac{12}{5} x^{2} are determined by the equation frac{12}{5} x^{2}=frac{12}{5} x+b Leftrightarrow x^{2}-x-frac{5 b}{12}=0.

At x = 1, a(1) - b = 0, which simplifies to a - b = 0. Therefore, frac{b}{a} = 1.2. Transforming the Given Inequality: With the information that a > 0 and frac{b}{a} = 1, we can transform the second inequality (ax+b)(x-3) > 0. Knowing frac{b}{a} = 1 means b = a. Therefore, the inequality becomes (a(x+1))(x-3) > 0. Since we know a > 0, and it does not change the sign of the inequality, we can simplify this to (x+1)(x-3) > 0.3. Solving the Simplified Inequality: The inequality (x+1)(x-3) > 0 tells us that the product of (x+1) and (x-3) is positive. This means the values of x must either make both (x+1) and (x-3) positive or both negative.    - Both are positive when x > 3.   - Both are negative when x  3.4. Conclusion: The solution set of the inequality (ax+b)(x-3) > 0 with respect to x is {x|x  3}. Matching this to the given options, the correct answer is boxed{A}, which is (-infty ,-1)cup (3,+infty)."},{"problem":"7. Stereometric problem.

It is not difficult to check that he can fill at least as many barrels by spending k_{1}+k_{2}+1 energy and resting for an additional minute before doing so, so that his starting energy is n+1 : this does not change the total amount of time. Furthermore, this does not affect the amount of energy Mac has remaining afterward. We may thus assume that Mac first rests for a (not necessarily fixed) period of time, then spends one minute filling barrels, and repeats this process until all of the barrels are filled.Next, we check that he only needs to fill barrels once. Suppose that Mac first rests for n_{1} minutes, then spends k_{1} energy, and next rests for n_{2} minutes and spends k_{2} energy. It is again not difficult to check that Mac can instead rest for n_{1}+n_{2}+1 minutes and spend k_{1}+k_{2}+1 energy, to increase the number of barrels filled, while not changing the amount of time nor the energy remaining. Iterating this operation, we can reduce our problem to the case in which Mac first rests for n minutes, then spends n energy filling all of the barrels.We need n(n+1) geq 2012, so n geq 45, and Mac needs a minimum of 46 minutes."},{"problem":"17.

Understanding the Given Inequality: We are given the inequality a leqslant |x-5| + |x-3| which holds for all real numbers x. Our goal is to find the range of real numbers a.2. Simplifying the Expression: The expression on the right side of the inequality can be simplified as follows:   [   |x-5| + |x-3| = |x-5| + |3-x|.   ]   Notice that |3-x| is the same as |x-3| because the absolute value function measures distance on the number line, which is always positive or zero, regardless of the order of subtraction.3. Applying the Triangle Inequality: The triangle inequality states that for any real numbers u and v, |u+v| leqslant |u| + |v|. Applying this in reverse, we can say:   [   |x-5+3-x| leqslant |x-5| + |3-x|.   ]   Simplifying the left side gives us |2| = 2. Therefore, we have:   [   2 leqslant |x-5| + |3-x|.   ]4. Determining the Condition for Equality: The equality |x-5| + |3-x| = 2 holds if and only if left(x-5right)left(3-xright) geqslant 0.

Simplify the expression: The x^{6} and y^{3} terms cancel out with part of the denominator, leaving -4x^{3}y^{2} after simplification.Therefore, the calculation yields:(2)(2x^{2}y)^{3}cdot (-7xy^{2})div 14x^{4}y^{3} = -4x^{3}y^{2}.Final answer for problem (2): boxed{-4x^{3}y^{2}}."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=asinleft(2ωx+frac{π}{6}right)+frac{a}{2}+b (x∈R, a>0, ω>0) with a minimum positive period of π, the maximum value of the function f(x) is 7, and the minimum value is 3.(1) Find the values of ω, a, and b; and specify the monotonically increasing interval of f(x).(2) Given g(x)=f(x+frac{π}{12}), find the range of g(x) when x∈[-frac{π}{3},frac{π}{3}).","solution":"(1) From the function f(x)=asin(2ωx+frac{π}{6})+frac{a}{2}+b with a minimum positive period of π,We get frac{2π}{2ω}=π, hence ω=1.Also, since the maximum value of f(x) is 7, and the minimum value is 3,We have begin{cases} a+frac{a}{2}+b=7  -a+frac{a}{2}+b=3 end{cases},Solving this system of equations, we obtain a=2 and b=4.Thus, fleft(xright)=2sinleft(2x+frac{π}{6}right)+5.The function f(x) is monotonically increasing when 2kπ-frac{π}{2}≤2x+frac{π}{6}≤2kπ+frac{π}{2}, k∈Z,That is, when kπ-frac{π}{3}≤x≤kπ+frac{π}{6}, k∈Z.Hence, the monotonically increasing interval of f(x) is [kπ-frac{π}{3}, kπ+frac{π}{6}] (k∈Z).(2) From part (1), we know that fleft(xright)=2sinleft(2x+frac{π}{6}right)+5, thus fleft(x+frac{π}{12}right)=2sinleft(2x+frac{π}{3}right)+5.Given that x∈[-frac{π}{3},frac{π}{3}), we have 2x+frac{π}{3}∈[-frac{π}{3},π),Thus, sin(2x+frac{π}{3})∈[-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, 1],Therefore, the range of the function g(x) when x∈[-frac{π}{3},frac{π}{3}) is boxed{[5-sqrt{3},7]}."},{"problem":"2. A point P is chosen randomly inside the triangle with sides 13,20 , and 21 . Find the probability that the circle centered at P with radius 1 will intersect at least one of the sides of the triangle.","solution":"2. A point P is chosen randomly inside the triangle with sides 13,20 , and 21 . Find the probability that the circle centered at P with radius 1 will intersect at least one of the sides of the triangle.Answer: 75 / 196Solution 1: Let A B C be a triangle with sides B C=13, C A=20 and A B=21 and let S be the set of points P such that the circle omega with radius 1 centered at P intersects at least one of the sides of A B C. For a fixed side of A B C (say ell ), omega intersects ell if and only if P lies within one unit from ell. This suggests we construct a triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} such that A_{1} B_{1}left|A B, B_{1} C_{1}right| B C, C_{1} A_{1} | C A and the corresponding parallel sides of A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} and A B C have distance 1. Thus, the set S of such points P forms a region mathcal{R} outside A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} but inside A B C and the probability is then the ratio of the areas of mathcal{R} and A B C.Observe that A B C and A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} are similar and hence the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant, say k>0. Also, triangle A B C is divided into four regions: the triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} and three trapezoids A_{1} B_{1} B A, B_{1} C_{1} C B and C_{1} A_{1} A C. The region mathcal{R} then comprises these trapezoids. We use [mathcal{P}] to denote the area of region mathcal{P}. Using Heron's formula with semiperimeter s=27, we see that [A B C]=sqrt{27(27-13)(27-20)(27-21)}=126. As A B C and A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} are similar, left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]:[A B C]=k^{2} and with B_{1} C_{1}=13 k, C_{1} A_{1}=20 k, A_{1} B_{1}=21 k, we obtainbegin{aligned}{[A B C] } & =left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]+left[A_{1} B_{1} B Aright]+left[B_{1} C_{1} C Bright]+left[C_{1} A_{1} A Cright] 126 & =126 k^{2}+frac{1}{2}(21 k+21)+frac{1}{2}(20 k+20)+frac{1}{2}(13 k+13) & =126 k^{2}+27 k+27end{aligned}so 126 k^{2}+27 k-99=9(k+1)(14 k-11)=0 and k=frac{11}{14}. Therefore, the probability isfrac{[mathcal{R}]}{[A B C]}=1-frac{left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]}{[A B C]}=1-k^{2}=1-frac{121}{196}=frac{75}{196} text {. }Solution 2: The additional points in the figure below (not drawn to scale) are precisely what they appear to be.We can determine the proportionality constant k between triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} and triangle A B C by determining A_{1} B_{1}=A_{2} B_{2}=21-A A_{2}-B B_{2}. Since triangle A A_{1} A_{2} and triangle A A_{1} A_{3} are congruent right triangles, then A A_{1} bisects angle A. Let alpha=angle A_{1} A A_{2}. Then tan alpha=frac{A_{1} A_{2}}{A A_{2}}=frac{1}{A A_{2}} so A A_{2}=cot alpha.From Heron's Formula, [A B C]=126. Since 126=frac{1}{2}(21)(C D), then C D=12. By the Pythagorean Theorem, A D=16 and B D=5.Let the bisector of angle A meet the altitude C D at E. Thus frac{D E}{C E}=frac{A D}{A C}=frac{16}{20}=frac{4}{5}. Since C E+D E= 12 , then D E=frac{16}{3}. This implies tan alpha=frac{D E}{A D}=frac{16 / 3}{16}=frac{1}{3}, and so A A_{2}=cot alpha=3.Similarly, B B_{1} bisects angle B. If beta=angle B_{1} B B_{2}, then B B_{2}=cot beta. Extend B B_{1} to meet C D at F. Since frac{D F}{C F}=frac{B D}{B C}=frac{5}{13} and C F+D F=12, then D F=frac{10}{3}. This implies tan beta=frac{D F}{B D}=frac{10 / 3}{5}=frac{2}{3}, and so B B_{2}=cot beta=1.5.Finally, A_{2} B_{2}=21-3-1.5=16.5. Thus, k=frac{A_{1} B_{1}}{A B}=frac{16.5}{21}=frac{11}{14}, and sofrac{[A B C]-left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]}{[A B C]}=frac{[A B C]-k^{2}[A B C]}{[A B C]}=1-k^{2}=frac{75}{196}"},{"problem":"Example 4 If 3 x-y-1=0, findz=left|sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}-8 x-2 y+17}-sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}-8 y+16}right|the maximum value.","solution":"Solution: The symmetric point of point B with respect to the line 3 x-y-1=0 is B_{1}(3,3).

From the periodicity and nature of sin 2x, we derive the given condition:2kπ-frac{π}{2}⩽2x⩽2kπ+frac{π}{2} quad (kin Z)Simplifying this condition gives us the intervals of monotonic increase:kπ-frac{π}{4}⩽x⩽kπ+frac{π}{4} quad (kin Z).Therefore, the monotonically increasing interval of f(x) is [kπ-frac{π}{4}, kπ+frac{π}{4}] quad (kin Z).For the center of symmetry, setting 2x = kπ where kin Z, we findx=frac{kπ}{2} quad (kin Z).Therefore, the center of symmetry of f(x) is (frac{kπ}{2}, -1) quad (kin Z).

Defining ( f(n) ):   Let ( f(n) ) be the sum of the first ( n ) *good* numbers. We need to find the sum of all values of ( n ) for which ( frac{f(n+5)}{f(n)} ) is an integer.3. Finding the first few *good* numbers:   The first few *good* numbers are ( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ldots ). This can be verified by finding sets of natural numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) that satisfy the given equation for each ( k ).4.

Finding ( frac{f(n+5)}{f(n)} ):   We need to find when ( frac{f(n+5)}{f(n)} ) is an integer:   [   frac{f(n+5)}{f(n)} = frac{frac{(n+5)(n+8)}{2}}{frac{n(n+3)}{2}} = frac{(n+5)(n+8)}{n(n+3)} = frac{(n+5)(n+8)}{n(n+3)}.   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   frac{(n+5)(n+8)}{n(n+3)} = frac{n^2 + 13n + 40}{n^2 + 3n} = 1 + frac{10}{n}.   ]   For this to be an integer, ( frac{10}{n} ) must be an integer, which means ( n ) must be a divisor of 10. The divisors of 10 are ( 1, 2, 5, 10 ).7. Summing the valid values of ( n ):   The valid values of ( n ) are ( 1, 2, 5, 10 ).

Let G be a simple graph of order 10 and does not contain a cycle of length 4, C_{4}. Then the maximum number of edges in G is 16.","solution":"Proof: Let f(n) be the maximum number of edges in an n-order simple graph without C_{4}. Clearly, f(n)=4. Now we prove that f(5)=6. First, if G is two triangles sharing exactly one common vertex, then G is a 5-order graph with 6 edges and no C_{4}. Second, if a 5-order graph G has 7 edges, then there must be a vertex with a degree no greater than 2. Removing this vertex and the edges associated with it, we get a 4-order graph G^{prime}. G^{prime} still has at least 5 edges, which must contain a quadrilateral. Now, we will prove that f(10)=16.Let G be a 10-order graph without C_{4}, and let A be the vertex with the highest degree in G. Let S={x mid x is adjacent to A}, T={x mid x is not adjacent to A}, and assume |S|=k, then |T|=9-k, where 1 leqslant k leqslant 9. For any point x in S cup T, it can be adjacent to at most one point in S, otherwise, adding A would form a C_{4}. Thus, S can have at most left[frac{k}{2}right] edges. Also, S and T can have at most 9-k edges between them, and T can have at most f(9-k) edges. Therefore,begin{array}{l}f(10) leqslant k+left[frac{k}{2}right]+(9-k)+f(9-k) . text { Let } g(k)=9+left[frac{k}{2}right]+f(9-k) . text { Then } f(10) leqslant g(k) .end{array}The relevant data is calculated as follows:begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}hlinek & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 hlinef(9-k) & 6 & 4 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 0 hlineg(k) & 17 & 15 & 15 & 13 & 13 & 13 hlineend{tabular}From the table, we can see that when k geqslant 5, g(k) leqslant 15, so f(10) leqslant 15; also, when k leqslant 3, f(10) leqslant frac{3 times 10}{2}=15.Thus, we only need to prove that when k=4, f(10) leqslant 16. Since T does not contain C_{4} and has 5 vertices, from the initial discussion, f(5)=6. If there is a vertex with degree 1, removing this vertex would leave a 4-order graph with 5 edges, which must contain a C_{4}. Therefore, each vertex must have a degree of at least 2. If there is a vertex A with degree 3, let it be adjacent to B, C, D but not to E. Since E has a degree of at least 2, E must be adjacent to two of B, C, D, which would form a C_{4}. Therefore, each vertex must have degrees of 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, meaning T forms two triangles sharing exactly one common vertex. Since |S|=4, if S and T are connected by at least 5 edges, then there must be a vertex in S that is connected to two vertices in T, forming a C_{4}.

We also observe that, since S is an integer, all the arguments of the square roots must be perfect squares, and since we are looking for a number between 2016 and 2166, we must have a=2 and b=0 or b=1. We also have S>1, because S>sqrt{a} geq 1, and from S leq 3 we find d+S leq 12, from which c+sqrt{d+S} leq 12.d=7. In this case, c+sqrt{d+S}=c+3 must be a perfect square between 3 and 12, so c=1 or c=6.

Each row in the stand has 199 seats, and it is required that students from the same school sit in the same row. Question: What is the minimum number of rows that need to be arranged so that all students can definitely be seated?","solution":"Analysis and Solution First, consider what the worst-case scenario is. The worst-case scenario refers to the situation where the number of empty seats in each row is maximized. Clearly, if the number of participants from each school varies, it is easier to arrange, as the remaining seats can be filled by students from schools with fewer participants. Therefore, a worse scenario is when each school sends a relatively \\"uniform\\" and larger number of participants. Thus, we can first assume that all schools send the same number of participants. Suppose each school sends r people, we examine what value of r would maximize the number of empty seats in each row. The estimation is listed as follows:begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}hline Number of participants r from each school & 39 & 38 & 37 & 36 & 35 & 34 & 33 & 32 & 31 & 30 & 29 & r leqslant 28 hline Number of schools that can be arranged in each row & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & ldots hline Number of empty seats t in each row & 4 & 9 & 14 & 19 & 24 & 29 & 1 & 7 & 13 & 19 & 25 & t leqslant 28 hlineend{tabular}From the table, we can see that when each school sends 34 participants, the number of empty seats in each row is maximized at 29. Note that 1990=34 times 58+18. Therefore, we first examine the scenario where 58 schools each send 34 participants, and one school sends 18 participants, to see how many rows are needed. In this case, each row can accommodate a maximum of 6 schools, and the row that accommodates the school sending 18 participants can only be one row. Thus, the minimum number of rows required is 1+left[frac{58-6}{5}right]+1=12.Finally, we prove that 12 rows are sufficient for any scenario. The most natural arrangement method is as follows:First, arrange the first row so that the number of empty seats x_{1} in the first row is minimized. Then, arrange the second row: again, minimize the number of empty seats x_{2}. Clearly, x_{1} leqslant x_{2}. Otherwise, if x_{1}>x_{2}, moving the students from the second row to the first row would reduce the number of empty seats in the first row, contradicting the minimality of x_{1}. Continue this process until the 11th row, making the number of empty seats x_{11} in the 11th row the smallest. We prove that with such an arrangement, all remaining students can definitely be arranged in the 12th row. squareIn fact, suppose there are still x people left unseated after arranging 12 rows, then x>x_{12}. Otherwise, if x leq x_{12}, these x people could be seated in the 12th row. Therefore, x=1990-sum_{i=1}^{12}left(199-x_{i}right) geqslant x_{12}, which implies x_{1}+x_{2}+cdots+x_{11}>398, so 398<x_{1}+x_{2}+cdots+x_{11} leqslant 11 x_{11}, thus x_{11} geqslant 37. This indicates that in the 12th row, the number of participants from each school is at least 38 (no school's participants can sit in the x_{11} empty seats of the previous row). Since each school sends at most 39 participants, the schools seated in the 12th row must have sent 38 or 39 participants. Noting that 5 times 39<199<6 times 38, exactly 5 schools are seated in the 12th row. Suppose k schools send 38 participants and 5-k schools send 39 participants (0 leqslant k leqslant 5), then the number of empty seats in the 12th row is199-k times 38-(5-k) times 39=199+k-5 times 39=4+k leqslant 9 text {. }But x_{11} geqslant 37, moving the students from the 12th row to the 11th row would reduce the number of empty seats in the 11th row, contradicting the minimality of x_{11}."},{"problem":"5.

Conclusion: Since the sum of the coordinates after 6 moves must be even, it is impossible for the ant to be at (2,1) or (1,2) after 6 moves.Therefore, the probability that the ant will be at either (2,1) or (1,2) after 6 moves is 0.The final answer is boxed{0}"},{"problem":"IMO 1981 Problem A3 Determine the maximum value of m 2 + n 2 , where m and n are integers in the range 1, 2, ... , 1981 satisfying (n 2 - mn - m 2 ) 2 = 1.","solution":"Experimenting with small values suggests that the solutions of n 2 - mn - m 2 = 1 or -1 are successive Fibonacci numbers.

But how do we know that there are no other solutions? The trick is to run the recurrence the other way. For suppose n > m is a solution, then try m, n-m: m 2 - m(n-m) - (n-m) 2 = m 2 + mn - n 2 = -(n 2 - mn - m 2 ) = 1 or -1, so that also satisfies the equation. Also if m > 1, then m > n-m (for if not, then n >= 2m, so n(n - m) >= 2m 2 , so n 2 - nm - m 2 >= m 2 > 1). So given a solution n > m with m > 1, we have a smaller solution m > n-m. This process must eventually terminate, so it must finish at a solution n, 1 with n > 1. But the only such solution is 2, 1.

Find the least possible value of the moves such that one can write the 31 tuplets(0,1,1,dots,1),(1,0,1,dots,1),dots, (1,1,1,dots,0)  to the blackboard by using those moves.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to generate the given set of 31-tuplets from the initial set of 31-tuplets using the specified operation. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.1. Initial Setup:   We start with the 31-tuplets:   [   (1,0,0,dots,0), (0,1,0,dots,0), dots, (0,0,0,dots,1)   ]   These are the standard basis vectors in (mathbb{R}^{31}).2. Objective:   We need to generate the 31-tuplets:   [   (0,1,1,dots,1), (1,0,1,dots,1), dots, (1,1,1,dots,0)   ]3. Construction:   We will construct the required vectors in stages. First, we will create vectors with consecutive 1's followed by 0's, and then vectors with 0's followed by consecutive 1's.   - Stage 1:     Obtain the following 29 vectors in 29 moves:     [     (1,1,0,dots,0), (1,1,1,0,dots,0), dots, (1,1,1,dots,1,0)     ]     Each of these vectors can be obtained by adding the previous vector to the next standard basis vector. For example:     [     (1,0,0,dots,0) + (0,1,0,dots,0) = (1,1,0,dots,0)     ]     [     (1,1,0,dots,0) + (0,0,1,0,dots,0) = (1,1,1,0,dots,0)     ]     and so on.   - Stage 2:     Similarly, obtain the following 29 vectors in 29 moves:     [     (0,1,1,dots,1), (0,0,1,1,dots,1), dots, (0,0,0,dots,0,1,1)     ]     Each of these vectors can be obtained by adding the previous vector to the next standard basis vector in reverse order. For example:     [     (0,0,0,dots,0,1) + (0,0,0,dots,1,0) = (0,0,0,dots,1,1)     ]     [     (0,0,0,dots,1,1) + (0,0,0,dots,1,0,0) = (0,0,0,dots,1,1,1)     ]     and so on.4. Combining Vectors:   Now, we have the first and the last 31-tuplets required. To obtain the remaining 29 vectors, we can use the vectors we already have. For example, to get ((1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,dots,1)), we can add:   [   (1,1,1,1,0,0,dots,0) + (0,0,0,0,0,1,1,dots,1) = (1,1,1,1,0,1,1,dots,1)   ]   Each of these 29 vectors can be obtained in one move.5. Total Moves:   - Stage 1: 29 moves   - Stage 2: 29 moves   - Combining vectors: 29 moves   Therefore, the total number of moves is:   [   29 + 29 + 29 = 87   ]6. Proof of Lower Bound:   We will use induction to prove that at least (3(n-2)) moves are necessary for (n geq 3).   - Base Case:     For (n = 3), we need at least (3(3-2) = 3) moves, which is trivial.   - Inductive Step:     Assume the statement is true for (n). We need to prove it for (n+1).     - Observation 1:       The ((n+1))-tuplet ((0,0,dots,0,1)) must be used at least twice. This is because if it is used only once, we cannot generate all required vectors.     - Observation 2:       There must be a move reserved for obtaining ((1,1,1,dots,0)).     Ignoring the ((n+1))-th digit and using the induction hypothesis, we need at least (3(n-2)) moves for the first (n) digits. Adding the three moves from Observations 1 and 2, we get:     [     3(n-2) + 3 = 3((n+1)-2)     ]     This completes the induction.Therefore, the minimum number of moves required is (87).The final answer is (boxed{87})."},{"problem":"[ Extreme properties of a triangle (miscellaneous).]Consider all acute-angled triangles with a given side a and angle alpha.What is the maximum value of the sum of the squares of the lengths of sides b and c?","solution":"According to the cosine theorem, b^{2}+c^{2}=a^{2}+2 b c cos alpha.

Given equation: x^{2}-9x+18=0.2. Factoring the quadratic equation: (x-3)(x-6)=0.3. Solving for x gives us two possible values:    - From x-3=0, we get x_{1}=3.   - From x-6=0, we get x_{2}=6.These roots, 3 and 6, are the dimensions of the isosceles triangle. We have two scenarios to consider for forming an isosceles triangle:Scenario 1: Using 3 as the base and 3 as one of the legs. This would imply the sides are 3, 3, and 6. However, for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. In this case, 3+3=6 equals the length of the third side, which violates the triangle inequality theorem. Thus, a triangle cannot be formed in this scenario.Scenario 2: Using 3 as one leg and 6 as both the base and the other leg. This configuration satisfies the triangle inequality theorem and can form an isosceles triangle.

In the previous solution, we focused on expressing the angles at the tip of the star with vertex A.

The slope of the tangent line at these points can be represented as k. For C_{1}, k=2{x}_{1}, and for C_{2}, k=a{e}^{x_{2}+1}.3.

Due to his profession, he studied the physiological functions of hearing and speaking. Later, he was hired as a professor of vocal physiology at Boston University. In 1873, he resigned from his professorship and began to focus on the development of the telephone. To invent the telephone, it was necessary to first convert sound signals into electrical signals and then convert electrical signals back into sound signals. Before Bell, many people had already been researching this problem. In 1875, Bell was inspired by the use of electromagnets in telegraph machines, which could convert electrical signals and mechanical movements. Bell began designing an electromagnetic telephone. Initially, he placed a tuning fork in front of a coil with an iron core. The vibration of the tuning fork caused the iron core to move correspondingly, generating an induced current. The current signal was transmitted to the other end of the wire and converted back into a sound signal. Subsequently, Bell replaced the tuning fork with a metal plate that could vibrate with sound and changed the iron core to a magnetic bar. After repeated experiments, he created a practical telephone device. On February 14, 1876, he applied for a telephone patent at the U.S. Patent Office. On March 7, 1876, Bell obtained the patent for inventing the telephone, with patent number NO. 174655. He also established the world's first telephone company, the Bell Telephone Company, which was the predecessor of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).

For brevity, let's denote the command to move left as L, right as R, up as U, and down as D.

Let k be the number of L commands in the sequence. We will count the number N_{k} of the desired sequences for k from 0 to 4.- boldsymbol{k}=mathbf{0}. The sequence consists only of U and D commands.

Therefore, N_{0}=C_{8}^{4}=70;## Interregional School Olympiad in Mathematics - boldsymbol{k}=mathbf{1}. The sequence consists of one L command, one R command, and three U and three D commands. The number of ways to place two L and R commands on 8 positions is C_{8}^{2} cdot C_{2}^{1}: C_{8}^{2} is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 8, and C_{2}^{1}=2 is the number of ways to place the L and R commands on these two positions.

Let the center of the circle be denoted as O, the foot of the altitude from vertex C as H, and the angle A B C as beta.The center of the circle inscribed in an angle lies on the angle bisector, so angle O C K = frac{1}{2} angle A C B = 60^{circ}. Since the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent, C K = O K operatorname{ctg} angle O C K = 2 sqrt{3} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = 2. Therefore, the segment B K is also equal to 2. By the sum of the angles in the quadrilateral O L C K, we find that angle L O K = 60^{circ}.Since O L perp A C and M K | A C, then O L perp M K. Triangle M O K is isosceles, and the height in it is also the angle bisector, so angle M O K = 2 angle L O K = 120^{circ}. Hence, M K = 2 cdot M O cdot sin 60^{circ} = 6. Due to the parallelism of the lines M K and A C, we get that angle M K B = 120^{circ}. Consider triangle M K B. By the cosine rule, B M^{2} = B K^{2} + K M^{2} - 2 cdot B K cdot K M cdot cos 120^{circ} = 52, B M = 2 sqrt{13}.

Our goal is to place the second (and any subsequent) rectangle in such a way that the number of resulting plane sections is maximized. According to the first and second figures, the number of plane sections increased by 2 and 3, respectively. It is easy to see that the number of new plane sections will be the largest if the perimeter of the second rectangle intersects the perimeter of the first rectangle at four points. In this case, a new plane section is formed above each side of the rectangle defined by the four intersection points, as indicated by the dashed lines in the third figure.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_0d0642e9dfb1f442fa61g-1.jpg?height=852&width=426&top_left_y=388&top_left_x=836)Thus, two rectangles can divide the plane into a maximum of 2+4 sections. Applying the previous reasoning, the third rectangle can create at most 4 cdot 2 new plane sections by intersecting each of the already placed rectangles at 4 points, so three rectangles can divide the plane into a maximum of 2+4 cdot 1+4 cdot 2 sections. We conjecture that n rectangles can divide the plane into a maximum of S_{n}=2+4 cdot 1+4 cdot 2+ldots+4(n-1) sections.

Let n be the sum of all ten-digit numbers that have each of the digits 0,1, ldots, 9 in their decimal representation.

We will not directly add the ten-digit numbers described in the problem. The desired sum can be more easily found by determining how many times each digit appears in all the addends at the units, tens, hundreds, etc. places. We will then determine the \\"contribution\\" of each digit to the total sum n.If the digit 1 is in the units place, then we can arrange the remaining nine digits in the remaining nine places in any order, except that we cannot place the digit 0 in the first place. We can place one of the eight different digits (any except 0) in the first place, one of the eight different digits (any except the one placed in the first place) in the second place, one of the seven different digits (any except the digits in the first two places) in the third place, etc. The digit 1 is therefore in the units place 8 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6 cdot 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1=8 cdot 8 ! times. { }^{1}By the same reasoning, we find that the digit 1 appears 8 cdot 8 ! times in the tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. places.

The contribution of the digit 3 is triple, the contribution of the digit 4 is quadruple, etc. The number of occurrences of the digit 0 in the various places is different from the other digits, but we do not need to determine it, because the contribution of the digit 0 to the sum is zero. Altogether, we haven=8 ! cdot 9888888888 cdot(1+2+ldots+9)=45 cdot 8 ! cdot 9888888888 .We could now determine the desired remainder by calculating the value of n and dividing by 77. However, we will avoid the tedious multiplication and division of large numbers. From the expression (1), we see that n is divisible by seven (because the factor 8! is a multiple of seven). Since 77=7 cdot 11, the remainder of the number n when divided by seventy-seven must also be a multiple of seven.We will still determine the remainder of the number n when divided by eleven. Trivially, 45 equiv 1(bmod 11) and it is easy to calculate that 8 !=40320 equiv 5(bmod 11). We can speed up the determination of the remainder of the number 9888888888 using a known statement: A number mathrm{s} with the decimal representation overline{a_{k} a_{k-1} ldots a_{1} a_{0}} gives the same remainder when divided by eleven as the number a_{0}-a_{1}+a_{2}-ldots+(-1)^{k} a_{k}.

The probability of picking a red ball is given by the ratio of the number of red balls to the total number of balls, which is 0.25. Therefore, we have:[ frac{R}{T} = 0.25 ]Given that there are 12 white balls, and assuming all other balls are red, we can express the total number of balls as the sum of white and red balls:[ T = 12 + R ]The frequency of picking a red ball stabilizing at 0.25 implies that the proportion of red balls to the total number of balls is 1 to 4. Therefore, for every 4 balls in the box, 1 is red, and the remaining 3 are of a different color (in this case, white). Since we know there are 12 white balls, which is three times the number of red balls in this proportion, we can calculate the total number of balls as follows:[ T = 12 div (1 - 0.25) = 12 div 0.75 = 16 ]Now, knowing the total number of balls is 16, and given that 12 of these are white, we can find the number of red balls by subtracting the number of white balls from the total number of balls:[ R = T - 12 = 16 - 12 = 4 ]Therefore, the number of red balls in the box is 4.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{text{B}}."},{"problem":"For real numbers a, b, define a point P_n(x_n, y_n) by [(x_0, y_0)=(1, 0)][(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})=(ax_n-by_n, bx_n+ay_n)  (n=0, 1, 2, cdots).]Find all of (a, b) satisfying the following conditions (i) and (ii).(i) P_0=P_6(ii) All of  P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 are distinct.","solution":"1.

Then there exist positive integers a, b such that4=frac{4 a b}{a-b}But this rewrites as (a+1)(b-1)=-1 and the left-hand side is non-negative for any two positive integers a, b, a contradiction.Now consider n geq 6. We make three observations.First, note that if n is good then any its multiple n^{prime}=k cdot n is also good - it suffices to take a^{prime}=k cdot a and b^{prime}=k cdot b. In particular, for a=2, b=1 we have 4 a b /(a-b)=8, hence all multiples of 8 are good.Second, take any positive integer t of the form t=4 k+1. By setting a=t, b=1 we getfrac{4 a b}{a-b}=frac{4 cdot t}{4 k}=frac{t}{k}hence by setting a=t cdot k, b=k we obtain that any multiple of any number of the form t=4 k+1 is good.Third, likewise, take any positive integer t of the form t=4 k-1. By setting a=t, b=1 we getfrac{4 a b}{a-b}=frac{4 cdot t}{4 k-2}=frac{2 t}{2 k-1}hence every multiple of double of any number of the form t=4 k-1 is good.Now we combine the observations. Consider any composite number n geq 6. If the prime factorization of n contains a prime of the form 4 k+1 then n is good (by the second observation). Similarly, if n contains at least two (not necessarily distinct) primes of the form 4 k-1 then their product is of the form 4 k+1, and thus n is good (by the second observation). If n contains a prime of the form 4 k-1 and it is even, then n is also good (by the third observation). Thus,it remains to consider the powers of 2 .
