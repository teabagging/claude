Since frac{text { volume of the tank }}{text { volume of the bucket }} approx frac{3.141}{3.14} is greater than 1 (and, of course, less than 2), we conclude that two trips to the source will be necessary to fill the tank.Now, let's use the approximation pi approx 3.1416. Here we calculate the volume of the bucket and get 3.1415 mathrm{~m}^{3}. Then, frac{text { volume of the tank }}{text { volume of the bucket }} approx frac{3.141}{3.1416} is less than 1, and we conclude, thus, that one trip to the source is enough to fill the tank, a result very different from the previous one!It should be clear from this example that the initial choice of an approximation can strongly influence the final result. In this case, we say that the conditions of the problem are sensitive to the approximation. In our original problem of filling the tank, the initial data were not sensitive to the approximation used for pi, which can be verified immediately by repeating the given solution with pi approx 3.142 or pi approx 3.1416. In both cases, the result is 17 trips.In general, problems of this type proposed in elementary and high school textbooks are stated in a way that is not sensitive to the approximation. This partially justifies the use of \\" pi=3.14 \\" as well as, for example, \\" sqrt{2}=1.41 \\".(CURIOSITY: sqrt{2} approx 1.4142135623730950488016887242097 ).We also note that a few decimal places make the calculations easier, especially when calculators are not used. It would be impractical, in practice, to work manually with the 31-decimal-place approximation we gave for pi at the beginning of this conversation.The treatment of approximation problems is done through inequalities. Unfortunately, time and space do not allow us to address this topic in more detail at the moment, but we hope to have piqued your curiosity about the subject."},{"problem":"Given the parametric equation of line l as  begin{cases} x=4+ frac{1}{2}t  y= frac{ sqrt{3}}{2}t end{cases} (t text{ is the parameter}), establish a polar coordinate system with the coordinate origin as the pole and the positive half of the x-axis as the polar axis.

Maximizing (tan theta):   - Let (x = a_1 + a_2) and (y = a_3 + a_4). We need to maximize:     [     f(x, y) = left| frac{x - y}{1 + xy} right|     ]6. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: (x, y > 0)     - Here, (x, y geq 1) since they are integers. In this case, (|f(x, y)| < 1), which cannot exceed our current maximum.   - Case 2: (x > 0, y < 0)     - The numerator is positive, and the denominator is negative, so (|f(x, y)|) cannot be our maximum.   - Case 3: (x < 0, y > 0)     - Let (x = -u) and (y = v). We want to maximize:       [       frac{u + v}{uv - 1}       ]     - We need to check when:       [       frac{u + v}{uv - 1} > frac{3}{2} implies 3(uv - 1) < 2(u + v) implies 3uv - 3 < 2u + 2v implies 3uv - 2u - 2v < 3       ]     - If (u, v > 1), then it's impossible because (3uv - 2u - 2v geq 3) is false. Thus, we can let (v = 1) and need (u < 5).7. Checking Specific Values:   - For (u = 4) and (v = 1):     - We have (a_1 = -6, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4, a_4 = -3).     - This gives:       [       tan theta = left| frac{(-6 + 2) - (4 - 3)}{1 + (-6 + 2)(4 - 3)} right| = left| frac{-4 - 1}{1 - 4} right| = left| frac{-5}{-3} right| = frac{5}{3}       ]The final answer is (boxed{503})."},{"problem":"Given a function f(x) = 2sin(omega x + varphi) (omega > 0, 0 < varphi < pi), the distance between two adjacent symmetric axes is frac{3pi}{2}, and fleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 0, identify which of the following statements is correct:A: omega = 2B: The function y = f(x - pi) is an even functionC: The function f(x) is increasing on the interval [-pi, -frac{pi}{2}]D: The graph of the function y = f(x) is symmetric about the point left(frac{3pi}{4}, 0right)","solution":"From the given condition, we have frac{T}{2} = frac{3pi}{2}, meaning that T = 3pi.Subsequently, frac{2pi}{omega} = 3pi gives us omega = frac{2}{3}.

Checking if 2sin 10^{circ} is a Zero:   - Use the triple angle formula: sin 3alpha = 3sin alpha - 4sin^3 alpha.   - Substitute alpha = 10^{circ} to evaluate f(2sin 10^{circ}):   - f(2sin 10^{circ}) = (2sin 10^{circ})^3 - 3(2sin 10^{circ}) + 1 = -2(3sin 10^{circ} - 4sin^3 10^{circ}) + 1 = -2sin 30^{circ} + 1 = 0.   - Therefore, 2sin 10^{circ} is indeed a zero of f(x), making statement D correct.Given the analysis above, the correct choices are A, C, and D. Thus, the final answer is encapsulated as boxed{ACD}."},{"problem":"Given that the polynomial frac{1}{5}{x}^{m+1}y^{2}+xy-4x^{3}+1 is a sixth-degree polynomial, and the monomial frac{1}{8}x^{2n}y^{5-m} has the same degree as the polynomial, find the value of left(-mright)^{3}+2n.","solution":"Given that the polynomial frac{1}{5}x^{m+1}y^{2}+xy-4x^{3}+1 is a sixth-degree polynomial, and the monomial frac{1}{8}x^{2n}y^{5-m} has the same degree as the polynomial, we aim to find the value of left(-mright)^{3}+2n.Step 1: Determine the degree of the polynomial.Since the polynomial is a sixth-degree polynomial, the highest degree term dictates this. The term frac{1}{5}x^{m+1}y^{2} has a degree of m+1+2 (since the degree is the sum of the exponents of x and y), which equals m+3. For the polynomial to be of the sixth degree, we set this equal to 6:m + 3 = 6Step 2: Solve for m.Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation gives us:m = 6 - 3m = 3Step 3: Determine the degree of the monomial.The monomial frac{1}{8}x^{2n}y^{5-m} also has a degree of 6, given by the sum of its exponents, 2n + (5 - m).

So deform the chain on a level surface so that links of the chain move towards the inside of the triangle, by fixing the vertices of the triangle to the surface. Geometrically, the links which are on sides of length 2 are now distinct chords of a large circle, attached to each other by their endpoints.If n>5 then first consider a triangle of integer side lengths, with sides of as equal lengths as possible, so that the sum of side lengths is n.

Evaluate at specific points:   [   f(0) = 2^0 - (0 + 1) = 1 - 1 = 0   ]   [   f(1) = 2^1 - (1 + 1) = 2 - 2 = 0   ]   Thus, ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1 ) are solutions.3. Analyze the behavior of ( f(x) ):   - The function ( 2^x ) is exponentially increasing.   - The function ( x + 1 ) is linearly increasing.4. Derivative analysis:   [   f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2^x - (x + 1)) = 2^x ln(2) - 1   ]   - For ( x < 0 ), ( 2^x ln(2) < 1 ), so ( f'(x) < 0 ).   - For ( x > 0 ), ( 2^x ln(2) > 1 ), so ( f'(x) > 0 ).   This indicates that ( f(x) ) has a minimum at ( x = 0 ).5. Conclusion:   Since ( f(x) ) changes from decreasing to increasing at ( x = 0 ), and we have found ( f(0) = 0 ) and ( f(1) = 0 ), these are the only solutions. Part (b)Given the function ( f: mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) such that ( (f circ f)(x) = 2^x - 1 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), we need to show that ( f(0) + f(1) = 1 ).1. Evaluate at specific points:   [   (f circ f)(0) = 2^0 - 1 = 0   ]   This implies ( f(f(0)) = 0 ).   [   (f circ f)(1) = 2^1 - 1 = 1   ]   This implies ( f(f(1)) = 1 ).2. Assume ( f(0) = a ) and ( f(1) = b ):   [   f(a) = 0 quad text{and} quad f(b) = 1   ]3.

Let n be a positive integer. Determine the smallest positive integer k with the following property: it is possible to mark k cells on a 2 n times 2 n board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into 1 times 2 and 2 times 1 dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells.","solution":"Answer. 2 n.Solution. We first construct an example of marking 2 n cells satisfying the requirement. Label the rows and columns 1,2, ldots, 2 n and label the cell in the i-th row and the j-th column (i, j).For i=1,2, ldots, n, we mark the cells (i, i) and (i, i+1). We claim that the required partition exists and is unique. The two diagonals of the board divide the board into four regions. Note that the domino covering cell (1,1) must be vertical. This in turn shows that each domino covering (2,2),(3,3), ldots,(n, n) is vertical. By induction, the dominoes in the left region are all vertical. By rotational symmetry, the dominoes in the bottom region are horizontal, and so on. This shows that the partition exists and is unique.It remains to show that this value of k is the smallest possible. Assume that only k<2 n cells are marked, and there exists a partition P satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from P. Let d be the main diagonal of the board.Construct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of P. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in d are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).Consider any cell c lying on the diagonal d. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to d. Thus they connect c to different cells. This shows c belongs to a cycle C(c) of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle c_{0}, c_{1}, ldots, c_{m} where c_{0}=c and m is the least positive integer such that c_{m} lies on d. Clearly, c_{m} is distinct from c. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to d also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form C(c). Hence, C(c) contains exactly two cells from d. Then all 2 n cells in d belong to n cycles C_{1}, C_{2}, ldots, C_{n}, each has length at least 4 .By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a cycle C_{i} containing at most one of the k marked cells. We modify P as follows. We remove all dominoes containing the vertices of C_{i}, which correspond to the red edges of C_{1}. Then we put the dominoes corresponding to the blue edges of C_{i}. Since C_{i} has at least 4 vertices, the resultant partition P^{prime} is different from P. Clearly, no domino in P^{prime} contains two marked cells as C_{1} contains at most one marked cell. This shows the partition is not unique and hence k cannot be less than 2 n."},{"problem":"A person starts from point A, walks 3sqrt{3}km in the north-east direction (with an angle of {60}^{circ }) to point B, and then walks 2km eastwards to point C.

We will now prove that there is a sequence of 10^{6}-2 moves each checking a different combination. We will prove this by induction on the number of wheels where the case n=6 is given in the problem.Claim: For a lock of n wheels and for any starting combination of the wheels left(a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n}right) there is a sequence of moves checking all 10^{6} combinations exactly once, for all n in mathbb{N}.BASIS: For n=1 and for the starting combination (a), we consider the sequence of movesa rightarrow a+1 rightarrow a+2 rightarrow ldots rightarrow 9 rightarrow 0 rightarrow 1 rightarrow ldots rightarrow a-1Assumption: The induction claim is valid for some n in mathbb{N}.Step: We will prove that the claim holds for n+1 as well.

The following paragraphs prove this in a more formal way.We now determine the horizontal distance from point P to the up side of length 21. Following the spiral outward from P, the first horizontal line segment moves right 2 , or +2 , where the positive sign indicates movement to the right.The second horizontal segment moves left 4 , or -4 , where the negative sign indicates movement to the left.After these two horizontal movements, we are at the line segment of length 5 , an up side. To get there, we moved a horizontal distance of (+2)+(-4)=-2 or 2 units to the left.The horizontal distance from P to the next up side (length 9 ), can be found similarly. Beginning on the segment of length 5 , we are already at -2 or 2 units left of P and we move right 6 (or +6 ), then left 8 (or -8 ).Thus, to reach the up side with length 9 , we have moved horizontally(-2)+(+6)+(-8)=-4 or 4 units left of P.This pattern of determining the horizontal distances from P to each of the up sides is continued in the table below.We now determine the vertical distance from point P to the upper endpoint of the up side with length 21.From P, the first vertical segment moves up 1 or +1 , the second moves down 3 or -3 and the third moves up 5 or +5 .Therefore the vertical position of the endpoint of the up side with length 5 is (+1)+(-3)+(+5)=+3 or 3 units above P.Similarly, we can calculate the vertical position of each of the up side endpoints relative to P and have summarized this in the table below.| Side Length | Horizontal Distance | Vertical Distance || :---: | ---: | ---: || 5 | (+2)+(-4)=-2 | (+1)+(-3)+(+5)=+3 || 9 | (-2)+(+6)+(-8)=-4 | (+3)+(-7)+(+9)=+5 || 13 | (-4)+(+10)+(-12)=-6 | (+5)+(-11)+(+13)=+7 || 17 | (-6)+(+14)+(-16)=-8 | (+7)+(-15)+(+17)=+9 || 21 | (-8)+(+18)+(-20)=-10 | (+9)+(-19)+(+21)=+11 |We now calculate the distance, d, from P to the upper endpoint, F, of the up side of length 21.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_20_748fdafcde2a47412608g-283.jpg?height=377&width=336&top_left_y=2029&top_left_x=949)Since the calculated distances are horizontal and vertical, we have created a right angle and may find the required distance using the Pythagorean Theorem.Then d^{2}=10^{2}+11^{2}=100+121=221 or d=sqrt{221} approx 14.866.## Solution 2If we place the spiral on an x y-plane with point P at the origin, the coordinates of the key points reveal a pattern.| Side Length | Endpoint Coordinates || :---: | :---: || 1 | (0,1) || 2 | (2,1) || 3 | (2,-2) || 4 | (-2,-2) || 5 | (-2,3) || 6 | (4,3) || 7 | (4,-4) || 8 | (-4,-4) || vdots | vdots |From the table we can see that after finishing a side having length that is a multiple of 4, say 4 k, we are at the point (-2 k,-2 k) (the basis for this argument is shown in solution 1 ).Therefore, after completing the side of length 20 , we are at the point (-10,-10).All sides of length 4 k travel toward the left.We must now move vertically upward 21 units from this point (-10,-10).Moving upward, this last side of length 21 will end at the point F(-10,11).This point is left 10 units and up 11 units from P(0,0).Using the Pythagorean Theorem, P F^{2}=10^{2}+11^{2}=100+121=221 or P F=sqrt{221} approx 14.866.ANSWER: (B)"},{"problem":"15.

Base Case:   - Consider the case when ( d = 1 ). In one-dimensional space, any two non-null vectors (rays) will either point in the same direction or in opposite directions. If they point in opposite directions, they form an angle of ( 180^circ ), which is not acute. Therefore, the largest number of vectors in (mathbb{R}^1) with pairwise non-positive dot products is 2.2. Inductive Step:   - Assume that in ( mathbb{R}^d ), the largest number of non-null vectors with pairwise non-positive dot products is ( 2d ).   - Consider ( mathbb{R}^{d+1} ) and let ( u ) be one of the vectors. Denote by ( U = langle u rangle^{perp} ) the orthogonal complement of ( u ), which has dimension ( d ).3. Decomposition of Vectors:   - Any vector ( v ) in ( mathbb{R}^{d+1} ) can be uniquely written as ( v = v_{perp} + v_{parallel} ), where ( v_{parallel} = frac{langle u, v rangle}{||u||^2} u ) and ( v_{perp} perp u ), i.e., ( v_{perp} in U ).   - The coefficients ( frac{langle u, v rangle}{||u||^2} ) are non-positive under our conditions. Notice that ( v_{perp} = 0 ) can occur only once, for some ( u' = v ) (trivially so, since then ( u' = u'_{parallel} = lambda u ) for some negative real ( lambda )).4. Orthogonal Components:   - Consider the orthogonal components ( v_{perp} in U ). We have:     [     langle v, w rangle = langle v_{perp} + v_{parallel}, w_{perp} + w_{parallel} rangle = langle v_{perp}, w_{perp} rangle + langle v_{perp}, w_{parallel} rangle + langle v_{parallel}, w_{perp} rangle + langle v_{parallel}, w_{parallel} rangle     ]     [     = langle v_{perp}, w_{perp} rangle + frac{langle u, v rangle langle u, w rangle}{||u||^2}     ]   - Therefore,     [     langle v_{perp}, w_{perp} rangle = langle v, w rangle - frac{langle u, v rangle langle u, w rangle}{||u||^2} leq 0     ]     since ( langle v, w rangle leq 0 ) and ( langle u, v rangle langle u, w rangle geq 0 ).5. Induction Hypothesis:   - By the induction hypothesis, the number of non-null vectors in ( U ) is at most ( 2d ). Including ( u ) and possibly ( u' ), there are at most ( 2(d + 1) ) non-null vectors in ( mathbb{R}^{d+1} ).6. Model Construction:   - To achieve the bound, we must have the pair ( u ) and ( u' ), with all other vectors orthogonal to them. By inductive reasoning, the only possible model is made by some ( d ) pairwise orthogonal non-null vectors, and some other ( d ) obtained from them by multiplication with arbitrary negative scalars.7. Conclusion:   - The largest number of vectors in ( mathbb{R}^d ) with pairwise non-positive dot products is ( 2d ). Therefore, in ( mathbb{R}^3 ), the largest number of such vectors is ( 2 times 3 = 6 ).8.

Heracle defeats a hydra by cutting it into two parts which are no joined.  Find the minimum N for which Heracle can defeat any hydra with 100 necks by no more than N hits.","solution":"1. Restate the problem in graph theory terms:   - Each head of the hydra is a vertex.   - Each neck of the hydra is an edge connecting two vertices.   - When a vertex ( v ) is hit, all edges incident to ( v ) are removed, and new edges are added to connect ( v ) to all vertices it was not previously connected to.   - The goal is to disconnect the graph by making it into two disjoint subgraphs.2. Initial conditions:   - The graph ( G ) has ( |E(G)| = 100 ) edges.   - We need to find the minimum number of hits ( N ) required to disconnect ( G ).3. Consider the complete bipartite graph ( K_{10, 10} ):   - ( K_{10, 10} ) is a bipartite graph with two sets of 10 vertices each, where every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set.   - This graph has ( 10 times 10 = 100 ) edges.4. Effect of hitting a vertex in ( K_{10, 10} ):   - Hitting a vertex in ( K_{10, 10} ) changes the graph structure.   - If we hit a vertex in one set, it will be connected to all vertices in the other set that it was not previously connected to.   - This operation effectively shifts the balance between the two sets, either increasing or decreasing the number of vertices in each set.5. Strategy to disconnect ( K_{10, 10} ):   - To disconnect ( K_{10, 10} ), we need to reduce it to a state where one set has only one vertex and the other set has 19 vertices, i.e., ( K_{1, 19} ) or ( K_{19, 1} ).   - Each hit reduces the number of vertices in one set by 1 and increases the number of vertices in the other set by 1.   - Therefore, it takes 10 hits to go from ( K_{10, 10} ) to ( K_{1, 19} ) or ( K_{19, 1} ).6. General case for any graph with 100 edges:   - If any vertex has a degree less than 10, it can be disconnected in fewer than 10 moves.   - If every vertex has a degree of at least 10, the graph has at most 20 vertices (since ( 2|E| = sum d(v) ge 10|V| ) implies ( |V| le 20 )).   - If a vertex ( v ) has a degree ( d(v) ge 10 ), hitting all vertices not adjacent to ( v ) and then hitting ( v ) will disconnect ( v ) from the graph in at most 10 moves.7.

So, ( E subseteq overparen{M' B} cup overparen{C N} cup {A} cup {O} cup {T} cup {R} ), where ( O ) is the intersection of ( l_{2} ) and ( l_{4} ), ( T ) is the intersection of ( l_{2} ) and ( overparen{M' A} ), and ( R ) is the intersection of ( l_{4} ) and ( overparen{A N} ). Let ( S_{1} = overparen{M' B} cup {T} ), ( S_{2} = overparen{C N} cup {R} ), then ( S_{1} cup S_{2} ) contains at least ( 7 - 3 - 1 = 3 ) points of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). So, ( S_{1} ) or ( S_{2} ) contains at least 2 points of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). Without loss of generality, assume ( S_{2} ) contains 2 points ( P ) and ( Q ) of ( E ) different from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), then there are only two cases: (1) ( P in overparen{C N} ), ( Q in overparen{C N} ). Since ( triangle P B C ) is an isosceles triangle and ( P B > B C ), we have ( P C = B C ). Similarly, from ( triangle Q B C ) being an isosceles triangle, we get ( Q C = B C ). So, ( C P = C Q ), i.e., ( C ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( P Q ), but the perpendicular bisector of ( P Q ) only passes through ( A ) and not through ( C ), a contradiction. (2) ( P in overparen{C N} ), ( Q = R ). Similarly, we get ( P C = B C ). Since ( triangle R B C ) is an isosceles triangle and ( B R = B N > B C ), we have ( R C = B C ), so ( R C = P C = B C ). In ( triangle B C P ) and ( triangle B C R ), ( B C = B C ), ( P C = R C ), ( angle B C P geqslant angle B C N > angle B C R ), so ( B P > B R ). This contradicts ( B P leqslant B N = B R ). Therefore, there do not exist 7 points in a plane (where no three points are collinear) such that all triangles formed by these 7 points are isosceles triangles.

The case M=N=1 is obvious.Assume that when M=N leqslant K, A must lose, then when M=N=K+1, if A takes the first step in any direction for X steps, B will take X steps in the other direction.If X=K+1, it is easy to see that the right upper corner has been reached, so A has already lost. Otherwise, if X < K+1, A can take the first step directly along the direction of length M for M-N steps, thus transforming the game into a new (N, N) board, and it is now B's turn to move. By the above conclusion, B must lose, meaning A must win.In summary, for A to win, it is only necessary that M is not equal to N.Thus, the number of such pairs of positive integers is 10 times 10-10=90.Therefore, the answer is 90."},{"problem":"1.

Evaluate the functional equation at specific points:   Consider the assertion ( Pleft(x, frac{1}{x}right) ):   [   fleft(x^2 + frac{1}{x^2}right) = g(1)   ]   By the AM-GM inequality, we know that:   [   x^2 + frac{1}{x^2} ge 2   ]   This implies that ( f(x) = g(1) ) for all ( x ge 2 ).3. Use another specific point to show ( g ) is constant:   Consider the assertion ( Pleft(frac{x}{2}, 2right) ):   [   fleft(left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 + 2^2right) = gleft(frac{x}{2} cdot 2right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   fleft(frac{x^2}{4} + 4right) = g(x)   ]   Since ( frac{x^2}{4} + 4 ge 4 ) and we already know ( f(x) = g(1) ) for all ( x ge 2 ), it follows that:   [   fleft(frac{x^2}{4} + 4right) = g(1)   ]   Therefore, ( g(x) = g(1) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R}^{+} ), which means ( g ) is a constant function.4. Conclude that ( f ) is also constant:   Since ( g(x) = g(1) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R}^{+} ), we have:   [   f(x^2 + y^2) = g(1)   ]   for all ( x, y in mathbb{R}^{+} ). This implies that ( f ) is also a constant function.5. Determine the constant values:   Let ( c = g(1) ). Then:   [   f(x) = c quad text{and} quad g(x) = c   ]   for all ( x in mathbb{R}^{+} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = c } ) and ( g(x) = c ) for some constant ( c in mathbb{R} )."},{"problem":"5 cdot 7 Fibonacci numbers are defined asa_{0}=0, a_{1}=a_{2}=1, a_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1}(n geqslant 1) .Find the greatest common divisor of the 1960th and 1988th terms.(29th International Mathematical Olympiad Shortlist, 1988)","solution":"[Solution] Given a_{1}=a_{2}=1anda_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1} quad(n>1)we can calculate the first 28 terms of the sequence step by step as follows:begin{array}{r}1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597, 2584,4181,6765,10946,17711,28657,46368,75025,121393,196418,end{array}317811.For the Fibonacci sequence, we prove thatleft(a_{m}, a_{n}right)=a_{(m, n)}.First, we use mathematical induction to prove thatleft(a_{n}, a_{n-1}right)=1.When n=1, left(a_{1}, a_{0}right)=1,when n=2, left(a_{2}, a_{1}right)=(1,1)=1.So, when n=1,2, (3) holds.Assume that when n=k, (3) holds, i.e.,left(a_{k}, a_{k-1}right)=1.Then, by (1), left(a_{k+1}, a_{k}right)=left(a_{k}, a_{k-1}right)=1.Therefore, (3) holds for all natural numbers n.Assume m geqslant n, by (1) we can derivea_{m}=a_{n} a_{m-n+1}+a_{n-1} a_{m-n}.From (4), it can be seen that the greatest common divisor of a_{m-n} and a_{n} must be a divisor of a_{m}, and the greatest common divisor of a_{m} and a_{n} must be a divisor of a_{n-1} a_{m-n}.By (3), a_{n} and a_{n-1} are coprime, so the greatest common divisor of a_{m} and a_{n} is also a divisor of a_{m-n}, thusleft(a_{m}, a_{n}right)=left(a_{m-n}, a_{n}right).Let m=q n+r, 0 leqslant r < n, continuing the above process, we getleft(a_{m}, a_{n}right)=a_{(m, n)}.Since (1988,1960)=28, thenleft(a_{1988}, a_{1960}right)=a_{(1988,1960)}=a_{28}=317811."},{"problem":"Let P: real number x satisfies the set A={xleft|right.-a lt x lt 2a}, q: real number x satisfies the set B={x|x^{2}-5x+4 lt 0}.

In both cases, the system only has a solution if b is also 0, and in this case, there are infinitely many solutions. Similarly, if b=0 and a neq 0, there is no definite solution. Hereafter, we assume that neither a nor b is 0, in which case neither x nor y can be 0.We could eliminate x if its exponent in both equations were the same. This can be achieved by raising our equations to powers, since in this way the exponent of x (1) in successive powers would be 2,4,6,8,10,12, ldots, (2) in powers would be 5,10,15, ldots, and c has a common element in the two sequences, which is 10.Raising (1) to the fourth power and (2) to the fifth power, we get[begin{aligned}& x^{10} y^{34}=a^{2} & x^{10} y^{35}=b^{5}end{aligned}]and dividing the latter by the former,[y=frac{b^{5}}{a^{2}}]To determine x, similarly raising (1) to the 7th power and (2) to the 17th power, and then dividing,[frac{a^{7}}{b^{17}}=frac{x^{35} y^{119}}{x^{34} y^{119}}=x]Substituting (3) and (4) back into (1) and (2), we see that we have obtained the solution.Remarks. 1.

According to (3), y has the same sign as b - this is easily seen from (2) - and according to (4), x is positive if and only if a and b have the same sign, and negative if they have opposite signs. (The latter can also be stated from (1): x>0 if a and y have the same sign.)2. Several people have pointed out that the system of equations[x^{c} y^{d}=a, quad x^{e} y^{f}=b]can be solved with the same line of thought, where a neq 0, b neq 0, and c, d, e, f are natural numbers such that |c f-d e|=1. This is correct, but it is not advisable to state it in this form in general, rather immediately for any c f-d e=g neq 0 in the following form:[|x|=sqrt[g]{left|frac{a^{f}}{b^{d}}right|} quad|y|=sqrt[g]{left|frac{b^{c}}{a^{e}}right|}]and - in the case of even g - the signs must be determined separately.3. Those who are already familiar with the concept of logarithms and their identities can also solve the system of equations using them. Taking the logarithm of (1) and (2), we arrive at the system of equations[begin{aligned}5 lg x+17 lg y & =lg a 2 lg x+7 lg y & =lg bend{aligned}]which is a first-degree system of equations for lg x and lg y.

Proof:   - Consider the coordinates of points (A, B, C) in (mathbb{Q}^n).   - The angle (angle BAC) is determined by the dot product of vectors (overrightarrow{AB}) and (overrightarrow{AC}).   - Since the dot product and the magnitudes of vectors can be expressed in terms of rational numbers, we can find a rational representation of these vectors in (mathbb{Q}^5).   - Specifically, we can embed the vectors (overrightarrow{AB}) and (overrightarrow{AC}) into (mathbb{Q}^5) while preserving their dot product and magnitudes.   - Therefore, there exists a triangle (A'B'C') in (mathbb{Q}^5) such that (angle B'A'C' = angle BAC).   (blacksquare) Part (b)1. To Find: A natural number (m) such that any triangle that can be embedded in (mathbb{Q}^n) can also be embedded in (mathbb{Q}^m).   Solution:   - From the given information, it is known that a triangle is (mathbb{Q}^n)-inscriptible if the squares of the tangents of its non-right angles are rational numbers.   - It is also given that (n=5) is always sufficient for such triangles.   - Therefore, (m = 5) is the smallest natural number such that any triangle that can be embedded in (mathbb{Q}^n) can also be embedded in (mathbb{Q}^5).

Solution:   - Consider a triangle with angles such that the squares of the tangents of its non-right angles are not rational numbers.   - Such a triangle cannot be embedded in (mathbb{Q}^3) because (mathbb{Q}^3)-inscriptible triangles require the squares of the tangents of their non-right angles to be rational.   - An example of such a triangle is one with angles (theta) and (phi) where (tan^2(theta)) and (tan^2(phi)) are not rational.

Geometric Interpretation:   - The condition that the distance from ( C ) to ( B ) always decreases implies that the ant must be moving directly away from ( B ).   - This means that the line segment ( AC ) must be tangent to the circle centered at ( B ) with radius ( AB = 1 ).3. Circle and Tangent Line:   - Draw a circle centered at ( B ) with radius ( 1 ).   - The point ( C ) must lie on the line that is tangent to this circle at point ( A ).4. Angle Consideration:   - The tangent line at point ( A ) makes a ( 90^circ ) angle with the radius ( AB ).   - Therefore, the region where ( C ) can be located is the half-plane on the side of the tangent line that does not include ( B ).5. Area Calculation:   - The region where ( C ) can be located is a half-plane bounded by the tangent line at ( A ).   - However, since the distance from ( C ) to ( B ) must always decrease, ( C ) must lie within the quarter circle centered at ( A ) with radius ( 1 ) and extending in the direction away from ( B ).6.

Proposition ①: A polygon with equal sides is a regular polygon.   - A regular polygon is defined as a polygon with all sides and angles equal. Therefore, having equal sides alone does not guarantee that the angles are also equal. For example, a rhombus has equal sides but does not necessarily have equal angles unless it is a square. Hence, proposition ① is false.2. Proposition ②: A regular polygon is a centrally symmetric figure.   - Central symmetry means that a figure is invariant under a rotation of 180 degrees about a central point. While this is true for some regular polygons like squares and regular hexagons, it is not true for all. Specifically, regular triangles (equilateral triangles) and regular pentagons do not possess central symmetry. Therefore, proposition ② is false.3. Proposition ③: The radius of the circumscribed circle of a regular hexagon is equal to the side length.   - In a regular hexagon, if we draw a radius from the center to any vertex and then draw a line segment from that vertex to the next, we form an equilateral triangle. This is because all angles in a regular hexagon are 120 degrees, and the segments (radius and side) are equal. Thus, the radius of the circumscribed circle is indeed equal to the side length of the hexagon, making proposition ③ true.4. Proposition ④: A regular n-gon has n axes of symmetry.   - A regular n-gon, by definition, is symmetric about a line through its center and any of its vertices. Since there are n vertices, there are n such lines, each being an axis of symmetry.

Let AC be the base of the given triangle, B its vertex, I the center of the inscribed circle, H the midpoint of side AC, r the radius of the inscribed circle, angle A=alpha, angle B=beta.

Check if 4 colors suffice:   If there are 4 colors (A, B, C,) and (D), we can try to color the vertices such that the condition is satisfied. One possible coloring is:   [   { V_0, V_1, cdots, V_{16} } = { A, D, B, B, C, C, D, D, B, B, C, A, D, D, B, B, C }   ]   This coloring ensures that no two vertices (V_i) and (V_j) with (i - j equiv pm 2, pm 4, pm 8 pmod{17}) have the same color. Therefore, (n leq 4).6. Prove that 3 colors are insufficient:   Assume there exists a solution with (n = 3). Without loss of generality, let (V_0 = A) and (V_2 = B). Then:   [   V_4 = C, quad V_6 = A, quad V_8 = B, quad V_{10} = C, quad V_{12} = A, quad V_{14} = B, quad V_{16} = C   ]   Continuing this pattern, we find that (V_{13} = A), which contradicts the assumption that (n = 3) is a solution because (V_0) and (V_{13}) would be the same color, violating the condition for different colors.Therefore, the least number of colors required is (4).The final answer is (boxed{4})."},{"problem":"Given f(x)=5x^{5}+4x^{4}+3x^{3}+2x^{2}+x+1, calculate f(5) using Qin Jiushao's method.

Solving this equation for a leads to a( a-1) -6 = 0, which gives a=3 or a=-2. Therefore, both a=3 and a=-2 make l_{1} and l_{2} parallel, which contradicts the statement that only a=3 is the necessary and sufficient condition.

The number overline{a b c d} is divisible by 11 if and only if [a+c-(b+d)] is divisible by 11. Since b+d leq 18 and a+c leq 18, we have 2 possible cases: 1) a+c-(b+d)=0 and 2) a+c-(b+d)= pm 11. From the condition of the problem, we have a+b+c+d+1=a b c d, which implies a b c d>1, i.e., a, b, c, d neq 0.Case 1. a+c-(b+d)=0.Since a+c=b+d, it follows that a b c d=2(a+c)+1. Therefore, the product a b c d is an odd number, which means all digits a, b, c, d are odd numbers, leading to the double inequality 5=2(1+1)+1 leq a b c d leq 2(9+9)+1=37.It follows that at least one digit among the digits a, b, c, d must be less than 3, since otherwise, we would have the false inequality 37 geq a b c d geq 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3=81. Since this digit must be odd, it is equal to 1.Let a=1. Then 1+c=b+d and 2 c+3=b c d, which implies b c d leq 2 cdot 9+3=21. Similarly, at least one digit among the digits b, c, d must be less than 3, since otherwise, we would have 21 geq b c d geq 3 cdot 3 cdot 3=27, which is false. If c=1, then 2=b+d and 5=b d, which implies b=d=1, but 5 neq 1. Therefore, c neq 1, which means b=1 or d=1.Let b=1. Then 1+c=1+d and 2 c+3=c d, which implies c=d and 2 c+3=c^{2}, i.e., c=3 and d=3. Thus, we obtain the number overline{a b c d}=1133.

It follows that 2(b+d)+12=a b c d, which means the product a b c d is an even number. We have 13=1+1+11 leq b+d+11=a+c leq 9+9=18, i.e., the double inequality 13 leq a+c leq 18 (*).Since a+c leq 18, then b+d=a+c-11 leq 9+9-11=7.

A move consists of selecting two sets ( A ) and ( B ) such that neither is a subset of the other, and replacing them with ( A cap B ) and ( A cup B ).

Maximum Number of Moves:   The maximum number of pairs ( (A, B) ) where ( A subseteq B ) among ( n ) sets is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ). This is because each pair of sets can form a subset relationship in one way.4.

Therefore, the vertex of the rotated parabola is at (-3,9).3. Form the Rotated Parabola: Since the parabola is rotated 180 degrees, its direction of opening is reversed. The original parabola opens upwards; thus, the rotated parabola opens downwards. The vertex form of a parabola that opens downwards is y = -a(x-h)^{2} + k, where (h,k) is the vertex.

If m = 2r, the y terms are y r (1 + y + ... + y 3r ) = y r (1 - y 3r+1 )/(1 - y). Now summing over r we have ∑ x 2r y r /(1 - y) - ∑ x 2r y 4r+1 /(1 - y) = x 2 y/( (1 - x 2 y)(1 - y) ) - x 2 y 5 /( (1 - x 2 y 4 )(1 - y) ). We deal with odd m in the same way. Let m = 2r - 1, then the y terms are y r (1 + y + ... + y 3r-2 ) = y r (1 - y 3r-1 )/(1 - y). So summing over r, we get xy/( (1 - x 2 y)(1 - y) ) - xy 3 /( (1 - x 2 y 4 )(1 - y) ). After some algebra, we get that the complete sum is xy(1 + x + y + xy - x 2 y 2 )/( (1 - x 2 y)(1 - xy 2 ) ). Hence the required limit is 3. A slightly more elegant approach is to note that the sum over pairs (m, n) with m > n/2 is ∑ x 2n+m y n where the sum is over all m, n ≥ 1. That is just x/(1 - x) x 2 y/(1 - x 2 y). Similarly, the sum over pairs (m, n) with n > m/2 is y/(1 - y) xy 2 /(1 - xy 2 ). Putting the three sums together gives x/(1 - x) y/(1 - y). Hence the required sum is x/(1 - x) y/(1 - y) - x/(1 - x) x 2 y/(1 - x 2 y) - y/(1 - y) xy 2 /(1 - xy 2 ). Unfortunately, things deteriorate from this point on.

In how many ways can this be done?","solution":"Answer: 5184.Solution. For a number to be divisible by 12, it is necessary and sufficient that it is divisible by 4 and by 3. To ensure divisibility by 4, we can choose 0 or 4 as the last digit (2 ways).To ensure divisibility by 3, we proceed as follows. Choose four digits arbitrarily (this can be done in 6 cdot 6 cdot 6 cdot 6 ways), and select the fifth digit so that the sum of all the digits of the number is divisible by 3. Since among the given digits, there are two digits divisible by 3 (0 and 9), two digits that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (4 and 7), and two digits that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 (2 and 5), this selection can be made in two ways.Applying the rule of product, we get a total of 2 cdot 6 cdot 6 cdot 6 cdot 6 cdot 2 = 5184 ways.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_6b29ef4d534e57085f3bg-37.jpg?height=180&width=1056&top_left_y=1121&top_left_x=89)a) Plot on the plane (x ; y) the set of points satisfying the first equation of the system, and find the area of the resulting figure.b) Find all values of the parameter a for which the system has exactly three solutions.Answer: a) 24 ; b) a=-11, a=9.Solution. Note that the equality |a|+|b|+|c|=a+b+c holds if and only if the numbers a, b, and c are non-negative (since if at least one of them is negative, the left side is greater than the right side). Therefore, the first equation is equivalent to the system of inequalitiesleft{begin{array}{l}4 x geq 0, 3 y geq 0, 24 - 4 x - 3 y geq 0end{array} Leftrightarrow left{begin{array}{l}x geq 0 y geq 0 4 x + 3 y leq 24end{array}right.right.This system defines a triangle on the plane with vertices E(6 ; 0), G(0 ; 8), N(0 ; 0), the area of which is 24.The second equation of the original system defines a circle (or a point when a=-1). The system can have exactly three solutions only in one case: when the circle defined by the second equation is circumscribed around the triangle E G N. The center of the circle circumscribed around a right triangle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse, and its radius is half the hypotenuse, from which we obtain the conditions4 sin frac{a pi}{2} = 4, left(frac{a+1}{2}right)^{2} = (5)^{2}The second equation gives two values of the parameter: a=-11 and a=9.

Let a, b, c and d be the number of representatives from each country. Since a must be a multiple of 3 and 4, it must also be a multiple of 12. Therefore, there exists a number k such that a=12k, then b=6k, c=4k and d=3k. The total number of representatives is then 25k.If we call M the number of tables, and P the number of people at each table, we have MP=25k.Let a_{i} be the number of representatives from country A at table number i. The condition imposed tells us that a_{i}<frac{P}{2}, or 2a_{i}<P. Since a_{i} is an integer, this implies that 2a_{i} leq P-1. Adding all the a_{i}, we get:24k=2a=2a_{1}+cdots+2a_{M} leq M(P-1)=25k-MFrom this, we deduce M leq k.

Lemma Application:   We start by using the lemma provided. The lemma states that if (x_1 ge x_2 ge x_3) and (y_1 le y_2 le y_3), and ((y_1', y_2', y_3')) is a permutation of ((y_1, y_2, y_3)), then:   [   x_1 y_1' + x_2 y_2' + x_3 y_3' ge x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3   ]2. Symmetry and Assumption:   Since (S = sum frac{1}{b(a+b)}) is invariant under cyclical permutations of (a, b, c), we can assume without loss of generality that (a le b le c).3. Rewriting (S):   We rewrite (S) as:   [   S = frac{1}{b(a+b)} + frac{1}{c(b+c)} + frac{1}{a(c+a)}   ]4. Using the Lemma:   By the lemma, we have:   [   S ge frac{1}{c(a+b)} + frac{1}{a(b+c)} + frac{1}{b(c+a)} = T   ]5. Combining (S) and (T):   We now consider (2S):   [   2S ge S + T   ]   Substituting (S) and (T) into the inequality, we get:   [   2S ge left( frac{1}{b(a+b)} + frac{1}{c(b+c)} + frac{1}{a(c+a)} right) + left( frac{1}{c(a+b)} + frac{1}{a(b+c)} + frac{1}{b(c+a)} right)   ]6. Simplifying the Expression:   Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:   [   2S ge frac{b+c}{(a+b)bc} + frac{c+a}{(b+c)ca} + frac{a+b}{(c+a)ab}   ]7. Using (abc = 1):   Since (abc = 1), we can substitute (bc = frac{1}{a}), (ca = frac{1}{b}), and (ab = frac{1}{c}):   [   2S ge frac{b+c}{(a+b)frac{1}{a}} + frac{c+a}{(b+c)frac{1}{b}} + frac{a+b}{(c+a)frac{1}{c}}   ]   [   2S ge frac{a(b+c)}{a+b} + frac{b(c+a)}{b+c} + frac{c(a+b)}{c+a}   ]8. Applying AM-GM Inequality:   By the AM-GM inequality, we know that:   [   frac{a(b+c)}{a+b} + frac{b(c+a)}{b+c} + frac{c(a+b)}{c+a} ge 3 sqrt[3]{frac{a(b+c)}{a+b} cdot frac{b(c+a)}{b+c} cdot frac{c(a+b)}{c+a}}   ]   Since (abc = 1), the geometric mean simplifies to 1:   [   2S ge 3   ]9.

Therefore, A can have only one element greater than 24.If x and y are two elements of the set A with x>y, thenx-y geq frac{xy}{25} quad text{implies} quad y leq frac{25x}{25+x}, quad text{which means} quad y leq 25-frac{625}{25+x}Thus, x determines the maximum value of y, and the larger x is, the larger the maximum allowed value of y will be.Therefore, to include the most elements in A, we should choose the largest possible values. It is therefore advisable to choose 24 as the second largest element. This determines the next largest element in the set, as the inequality y leq frac{25 cdot 24}{25+24} implies that the next largest element that can be included is 12, and so on, yielding the elements 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1. For the largest element, the inequality 24 leq frac{25 cdot x}{25+x} provides a lower bound, from which the minimum value for the largest number is 600. Therefore, the set A can have at most 9 elements. One possible set of elements for A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 600}. Of course, other 9-element sets can also be found, such as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 17, 54}.Based on the work of Hablicsek Márton (Fazekas M. Főv. Gyak.

If x is an element of the set A, and the largest element smaller than x is y, then for these, the condition x-y geq frac{xy}{25} holds. This condition also holds for all other elements smaller than y, since decreasing y increases the left side of the inequality, while the right side decreases.Let's find the minimal x values corresponding to the given y values. The pairs (y, x) are: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,7), (7,10), (10,17), (17,54). A suitable set A contains the elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 17, 54}, but other such sets can also be given, as seen in the previous solution.We will prove that A cannot have more than 9 elements.The numbers 5 and 6 cannot both be elements of the set, since 6-5 < frac{6 cdot 5}{25}.Among the numbers 7, 8, 9, only one can be in the set A, since for these numbers, the value of x-y is at most 2, while the minimum value of the right side is frac{7 cdot 8}{25}, which is greater than 2.From the interval [10,14], only one element can be in the set A, since here the value of x-y is at most 4, while the minimum value of the right side is frac{10 cdot 11}{25}, which is greater than 4. Similarly, from the interval [15,24], only one element can be in the set A, since here the value of x-y is at most 9, while the minimum value of the right side is frac{15 cdot 16}{25}, which is greater than 9.As in the previous solution, it can be shown that there cannot be two elements of A that are greater than 24.

First, note that cos70° = sin20° due to the co-function identity cos(90° - x) = sin x.

The correct approach should involve recognizing that 1 - 2sin^225° simplifies to cos50° using the identity sin^2 x = frac{1 - cos(2x)}{2}. Thus, the correct simplification for the denominator should be based on trigonometric identities that lead to cos50°, not to 0. Let's correct this approach:The correct denominator simplification, considering the double angle formula for cosine, which is cos 2x = 1 - 2sin^2 x, gives us:1 - 2sin^225° = cos50°So, the expression now is:frac{sin20°cos20°}{cos50°}3. Use the double angle formula for sine, sin 2x = 2sin x cos x, to rewrite the numerator:frac{1}{2}sin40°4.

If ( a_i < a_{i-1} ), then ( a_{i-2} < a_i ). This implies ( a_{i-1} > a_{i-2} ). Continuing this logic, we see that ( a_{i-k} ) is alternatively greater than the greatest or smaller than the smallest of the numbers ( a_i, a_{i-1}, dots, a_{i-(k-1)} ). Since we eventually come back to ( a_i ), this is a contradiction.7. Therefore, all the numbers must be equal. Let ( a_i = k ) for all ( i ).

Conformal Mappings## 1^{circ}. Concept of Conformal Mapping.Definition. A mapping of a neighborhood of a point z_{0} onto a neighborhood of a point w_{0}, realized by the function w=f(z), is called conformal if at the point z_{0} it has the property of preserving angles between curves and the constancy of dilations (Fig. 14).This means that:1) if under the mapping w=f(z) the curves gamma_{1} and gamma_{2} are transformed into the curves Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2}, respectively, then the angle varphi between the tangents k_{1} and k_{2} to the curves gamma_{1} and gamma_{2} at the point z_{0} will be equal to the angle Phi between the corresponding tangents K_{1} and K_{2} to the curves Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2} at the point w_{0}, i.e., Phi=varphi.2) if in the complex plane z we take an infinitesimally small circle centered at the point z_{0}, then in the plane w it will correspond to an infinitesimally small circle centered at the point w_{0}.Therefore, it is said that a conformal mapping has the property of angle conservation and similarity in the small.If under the mapping w=f(z) the angles between corresponding directions are equal not only in magnitude but also in the direction of measurement, then such a mapping is called a conformal mapping of the first kind.A conformal mapping in which angles are preserved only in absolute magnitude but the direction of their measurement is reversed is called a conformal mapping of the second kind.A simple example of a conformal mapping of the first kind is the mapping w=z, and of the second kind is the mapping w=bar{z}.In the following, we will consider only conformal mappings of the first kind.A mapping w=f(z) is called conformal in a domain D if it is conformal at every point of this domain.Criterion for Conformality. For the mapping w=f(z) to be conformal in a domain D, it is necessary and sufficient that in this domain the function w=f(z) is univalent and analytic, and f^{prime}(z) neq 0 for all z in D.If we do not assume the univalence of f(z), then the mapping realized by this function will not be one-to-one, and thus will not be conformal. For example, the function w=z^{4}, defined in the half-ring 1 leqslant|z| leqslant 2,0 leqslant arg z leqslant pi, is analytic in it, and, moreover, the condition w^{prime}=4 z^{3} neq 0 is satisfied everywhere in the half-ring. However, the function w=z^{4} maps the given half-ring onto the region 1 leqslant|w| leqslant 16,0 leqslant arg w leqslant 4 pi, i.e., a region that twice covers the corresponding ring on the w-plane, which violates the one-to-one correspondence.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_f7d63c3a5e94c3f2f1bbg-119.jpg?height=466&width=946&top_left_y=159&top_left_x=216)Fig. 14"},{"problem":"48. A More Interesting Case- Let's move on to a more interesting case, said the King.Alice perked up her ears.- This time, three accused individuals, A, B, and C, stood before the court, began the King. - The court knew that one of them was a knight, one a liar, and one a spy. But who was who, the court did not know. First, A accused B of being the spy. Then B accused C of being the spy, after which C, pointing either at A or at B, declared: \\"The real spy is he!\\" The court exposed the spy.Who is the spy?- Hold on, hold on! exclaimed Alice. - You don't mean to say, Your Majesty, that I should solve the problem without knowing who C pointed to?- When I read about this case in a book as a child, replied the King, - I also thought that the information was insufficient to solve the problem. But then I thought a bit more and realized that the information provided is indeed sufficient. Yes, yes! You didn't mishear: the given information is enough to solve the problem!Who is the spy?","solution":"48. A more interesting case. The problem would have been unsolvable if the conditions did not mention that the court identified the spy after C pointed to him, since we know that the court managed to determine which of the three was the spy, and this is a very important \\"clue\\"!Suppose that C accused A of being the spy. With this information, the judge could not have determined who the spy was, as it only allows us to assert that either A is the spy, B is a liar, and C is a knight, or B is the spy, A is a knight, and C is a liar, or C is the spy, A is a liar, and B is a knight.Thus, if C pointed to A as the spy, the judge could not have identified the real spy.Now let's consider what would have happened if C pointed to B. In that case, B would have been accused of being the spy by two people: A and C. The accusations made by A and C are either both true or both false. If they were both true, then B would indeed be the spy, and since A and C both told the truth, they would both have to be knights (the \\"position\\" of the spy is occupied by B). But according to the problem, among the defendants A, B, and C, there cannot be two knights. Therefore, the accusations against B for being a spy are false. So, B is not the spy. Could A be the spy? No, because if A were the spy, the mutual accusations of B and C for being a spy would be false. Therefore, B and C would both be liars (which contradicts the conditions of the problem). The only possible case remains: the spy is C (B, who accused C of being a spy, is a knight, and A, who accused B, is a liar).Thus, if C pointed to A as the spy, the judge could not have determined who among the three was actually the spy. But if C pointed to B, the judge could determine that the spy is C. Since the judge knew who A pointed to, C must have pointed to B, and the judge, based on the information received, identified C as the spy."},{"problem":"There are two types of yachts, large and small. 2 large yachts and 3 small yachts can carry 57 passengers at once, and 3 large yachts and 2 small yachts can carry 68 passengers at once.

Choose n_k > 1 + log_{|q|} frac{|d|}{|a_1| cdot (|q| - 1)}. Then, |q|^{n_k - 1} > frac{|d|}{|a_1| cdot (|q| - 1)}.   Thus, |a_{n_{k+1}} - a_{n_k}| = |a_1 q^{n_{k+1} - 1} - a_1 q^{n_k - 1}| = |a_1| cdot |q|^{n_k - 1} cdot |q^{n_{k+1} - n_k} - 1| geq |a_1| cdot |q|^{n_k - 1} cdot (|q| - 1) > |d|, which contradicts |a_{n_{k+1}} - a_{n_k}| = |d|. So, this case is rejected.   When |q|  1 + log_{|q|} frac{|d|}{2|a_1|}. Then, |q|^{n_k - 1} < frac{|d|}{2|a_1|}.   Thus, |a_{n_{k+1}} - a_{n_k}| = |a_1 q^{n_{k+1} - 1} - a_1 q^{n_k - 1}| = |a_1| cdot |q|^{n_k - 1} cdot |q^{n_{k+1} - n_k} - 1| leq |a_1| cdot |q|^{n_k - 1} cdot (|q|^{n_{k+1} - n_k} + 1) < 2|a_1| cdot |q|^{n_k - 1} < |d|, which contradicts |a_{n_{k+1}} - a_{n_k}| = |d|.

In this case, the numbers p and q are 2 and 3 in some order, and the numbers mathrm{s} and mathrm{t} are also 2 and 3.

We need to find m(widehat{PBD}).First, let's use the given information about the lengths and the angles to find the necessary relationships.4. Since m(widehat{BCD}) = 90^circ, triangle BCD is a right triangle with E as the foot of the altitude from B to CD.5.

The speeds on these sections are 3km/h, 4km/h, and 5km/h respectively. The total distance is 3.3km, and the time taken for the journey from A to B is 51 minutes, while the return journey from B to A takes 53 minutes. Xiao Hong has already formulated one equation based on the journey from A to B as follows:[frac{x}{3} + frac{y}{4} + frac{3.3 - x - y}{5} = frac{51}{60}]Here, x represents the distance of the uphill section, and y represents the distance of the flat section from place A to place B. The downhill section's distance is then 3.3 - x - y km.For the return journey from B to A, the uphill section becomes the initial downhill section, the flat section remains the same, and the downhill section becomes the initial uphill section. Given that it takes 53 minutes for this return journey, we need to find the correct equation that represents this scenario.Considering the speeds for the return journey: the speed uphill (initially downhill) is 5km/h, the speed on the flat section remains 4km/h, and the speed downhill (initially uphill) is 3km/h. Therefore, the time taken for each section on the return journey can be represented as frac{x}{5} for the downhill section (initially uphill), frac{y}{4} for the flat section, and frac{3.3 - x - y}{3} for the uphill section (initially downhill).Thus, the equation for the return journey from B to A, taking 53 minutes or frac{53}{60} hours, is:[frac{x}{5} + frac{y}{4} + frac{3.3 - x - y}{3} = frac{53}{60}]This matches with option C, which states:[C: frac{x}{5} + frac{y}{4} + frac{3.3 - x - y}{3} = frac{53}{60}]Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"2.

Thus, n satisfies the condition in the problem. Conversely, suppose that n satisfies the condition. Since left(begin{array}{l}n  0end{array}right)=1, it follows that i equiv 1+left(begin{array}{l}n  iend{array}right) bmod 2 for all i, so left(begin{array}{c}n  iend{array}right) equiv i-1 equiv i+1 bmod 2 for all i.Write n as n=2^{k}+m with 0 leq m<2^{k}.

Thus, left(begin{array}{c}2^{k}-2  cend{array}right) is even if and only if c is odd.

The initial price of the drug is 140, and after two reductions, the price becomes 35.1. Let's denote the average percentage of each price reduction by x. This means that after the first reduction, the price of the drug becomes 140 times (1-x). Here, (1-x) represents the remaining percentage of the price after the reduction.2. Since the drug's price is reduced twice by the same percentage, the price after the second reduction is based on the price after the first reduction. Therefore, the price after the second reduction is 140 times (1-x) times (1-x) = 140(1-x)^2.3. Given that the price of the drug after the second reduction is 35, we can set up the equation as follows:[140(1-x)^2 = 35]4.

Let's proceed step-by-step.1. Define the Set ( S ):   Let ( S ) be the set of rational numbers reachable from ( 0 ) by applying the operations ( x mapsto frac{1}{x} ), ( x mapsto -x ), and ( x mapsto 1 - x ).2. Reachability from ( 0 ):   We need to show that all rational numbers can be reached from ( 0 ) using these operations. We start with ( 0 ) and apply the operations iteratively.3. Subgroup Analysis:   Consider the subgroup ( langle a rangle subset F ) where ( F ) is the free group generated by the operations. If ( q in S ), then ( q + mathbb{Z} in S ). This implies that if ( 0 in S ), then ( mathbb{Z} in S ), and consequently, ( left{frac{1}{n} mid n in mathbb{Z}^{times}right} in S ).4. Euclidean Algorithm and Induction:   We use the Euclidean algorithm to show that all rationals can be reached. We prove this by strong induction on ( M(q) = max(|a|, |b|) ) where ( q = frac{a}{b} ) and ( (a, b) = 1 ).   - Base Case: When ( q = 0 ), we have reached the base case.   - Inductive Step: For ( q neq 0 ), one of the sets ( left(q + mathbb{Z}, frac{1}{q} + mathbb{Z}right) ) contains an element with a strictly smaller ( M )-value. Each rational number has a finite ( M )-value and hence a finite number of steps away from ( 0 ).5. Coloring Analysis:   We have established that all rationals can be reached from ( 0 ). Now, we need to analyze the parity of the path connecting two arbitrary rationals.    - Parity Preservation: The operation ( a ) preserves parity when acting on all rationals except for ( 0 ), while ( a^{-1} ) preserves parity when acting on all rationals except for ( 1 ).   - Homomorphism to ( C_2 ): Consider the homomorphism from ( F ) to ( C_2 ) defined by the generators ( a = 1, b^2 = 1 ). This homomorphism helps us determine the parity of an element of ( F ).6. Conclusion:   By considering the parity and the homomorphism, we conclude that there are exactly two valid colorings of the rational numbers. These two colorings correspond to the two possible ways to color ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) differently and extend this coloring to all rationals while maintaining the required conditions.The final answer is ( boxed{2} )"},{"problem":"9.

Find all triplets (x, y, z) of strictly positive integers such that:1005^{x}+2011^{y}=1006^{z}","solution":"## Solution to Exercise 6We can start by studying the equation modulo a well-chosen integer. A good candidate would be one of the integers present in the equation, in order to obtain a simplified equation.For example, consider this equation modulo 1006: we have 2011 equiv 1005 equiv -1 pmod{1006}, so (-1)^{x} + (-1)^{y} equiv 0 pmod{1006}. This shows that x and y are of opposite parity.Once we have looked at the equation modulo the integers present in the equation, we can look for more subtle moduli. To simplify the equation, we can use a simple divisor of one of the integers as a modulus. A simple divisor of 1006 is 2, for example, but the equation is not very interesting modulo 2. The trick is then to consider the case where z geq k for some k, because then 2^{k} divides 1006^{z}, and we can hope that the equation modulo 2^{k} for a well-chosen integer k is interesting.Suppose, for instance, that z geq 3. Then 1006^{z} equiv 0 pmod{8}, so 0 equiv 1005^{x} + 2011^{y} equiv (-3)^{x} + 3^{y} pmod{8}. This is only the case when x and y are of the same parity, which is a contradiction. Thus, z leq 2. We then note that 2011^{3} > 1006^{2} and 1005^{3} > 1006^{2}, so x leq 2 and y leq 2.We have reduced the problem to a finite number of specific cases. We remember that the three unknowns are strictly positive. If z=1, 1005^{x} + 2011^{y} > 1005 + 2011 > 1006, so there are no solutions. If z=2, we must necessarily have y=1 because 2011^{2} > 1006^{2}, in which case 1005^{x} + 2011 = 1006^{2}. We then observe that x=2 works, since 1006^{2} - 1005^{2} = (1006 + 1005)(1006 - 1005) = 2011. Finally, the only solution is (x, y, z) = (2, 1, 2).Comment from the graders: The exercise is generally well done by those who submitted it."},{"problem":"3.

We construct a circle k_{2}^{prime} with center O_{2}^{prime} and radius frac{4 R}{9}. Then k_{2}^{prime} is the desired circle.Proof. The circles k_{3} and k_{4} intersect because the numbers frac{17 R}{18}, frac{5 R}{9}, and frac{R}{2} satisfy the necessary and sufficient condition to be the sides of a triangle. Since left(frac{17 R}{18}right)^{2}>left(frac{5 R}{9}right)^{2}+left(frac{R}{2}right)^{2}, we conclude that O_{1} mathrm{O}_{2}^{prime} O is an obtuse triangle with the obtuse angle at vertex O. Therefore, point O lies between point O_{1} and the foot C^{prime} of the altitude of triangle mathrm{O}_{1} mathrm{O}_{2}^{prime} mathrm{O} from vertex mathrm{O}_{2}^{prime}. Let C^{prime} O=c^{prime} and C^{prime} O_{2}^{prime}=h. Since triangles O_{2}^{prime} C^{prime} O and O_{2}^{prime} C^{prime} O_{1} are right-angled with right angles at vertex C^{prime}, we haveh^{2}=left(frac{5 R}{9}right)^{2}-c^{prime 2}=left(frac{17 R}{18}right)^{2}-left(frac{R}{2}+c^{prime}right)^{2}Further, we easily get c^{prime}=frac{R}{3} and h=frac{4 R}{9}, which means that circle k_{2}^{prime} touches the line O O_{1}. From the equationO_{2}^{prime} O_{1}=frac{17 R}{18}=frac{R}{2}+frac{4 R}{9}it follows that circle k_{2}^{prime} touches circle k_{1}.

The fourth number is even, so the third is odd, thus it ends in 5, so our numbers end in 3,4,5,6, and according to the requirement, only these four digits can appear in the higher value places as well.Since the fourth number is divisible by 4 and its unit digit is 6, its tens digit is odd, so it is either 5 or 3. Thus, the quartet of numbers is given by one of the following two forms:A:100 k+34B: quad 100 m+53,100 k+35,100 k+36佂where k and m are suitable integers. The first form seems more practical because 33 is divisible by 11, so we look for a k that is divisible by 11, whose digits are from the set {3,4,5,6}, and for which100 k+34=98 k+35+2 k-1, quad text { that is } quad x=2 k-1is divisible by 7. Since k is a number of the form 11 n, thenx=2 k-1=22 n-1=21 n+(n-1)is divisible by 7 if (n-1) is divisible by 7. Performing the multiplication 11 n in the usual way, that is, bringing k to the form k=10 n+n, we see that the first and last digit of n are also from the sought set {3,4,5,6}. Thus n cannot be a single-digit number because (n-1) is not divisible by 7 for n=3,4,5,6. n cannot be a two-digit number either, because in this case the middle digit of k is equal to the sum of the first and last digit of n, and here only 3+3=6 is possible, which would mean n=33, but for which (n-1) is not divisible by 7.If n is a three-digit number, sayn=100 a+10 b+cthen a and c are from the set {3,4,5,6}, and to ensure that the digits of 11 n are also from this set, the simplest way is to choose the value of b as 0. With the choice a=3, none of the numbers 302,303,304,305 for (n-1) are divisible by 7. Among the numbers 402, 403, 404, 405 corresponding to the value a=4, none are divisible by 7, but among 502, 503, 504, 505 there is: the number (n-1)=504. The parameter pair for this isn=505, quad k=5555and the555533, quad 555534, quad 555535, quad 555536quartet of numbers meets the requirements, except for one non-trivial divisibility: 555534: 7=79362.Remark. The quartet of numbers obtained is not the smallest. A smaller number in the A-type is the quartet starting with 355333.II. solution. Now we are looking for a quartet of numbers of type B (see above). m cannot be a single-digit number because none of 353, 453, 553, and 653 are divisible by 11.m cannot be a two-digit number either, because if m=10 D+C, then the first number can be transformed as follows:100 m+53=11(91 D+9 C+5)+(C-D-2)here the value of C-D is a number between +3 and -3, so the divisibility by 11 only holds if C-D=2, that is, D=C-2. However, the number 100 m+54 is not a multiple of 7 in either case when C=5 and D=3, or when C=6 and D=4.However, the attempt is successful with a three-digit m. Indeed, if m=100 E+10 D+C, then the first number is:100 m+53=11(909 E+91 D+9 C+5)+(E+C-2-D)The limits of the second term are:begin{aligned}& E+C-2-D geqq 3+3-2-6=-2 text { and } & E+C-2-D leqq 6+6-2-3=7end{aligned}among these, only the multiple of 0 is divisible by 11, so this term is only divisible by 11 ifE+C-2-D=0, quad D=E+C-2On the other hand, in this case the second number is100 m+54=7(1428 E+143 D+14 C+8)+(4 E-D+2 C-2)here the second term, using (1), is 3 E+C, which is a value between 12 and 24, divisible by 7 if 3 E+C=14, C=5 and E=3, which leads to D=6 from (1). Indeed, the36553, quad 36554, quad 36555, quad 36556quartet of numbers meets all the conditions. This satisfies the requirements of the problem.Remark. It is easy to show that we get a new quartet of numbers if we write a multiple of 77 in front of the found ones, which only contains the digits 3, 4, 5, 6. Such numbers with four and five digits (from the multiplication table):3465, quad 4466, quad 4543, quad 5544, quad 6545, quad and35343, quad 36344, quad 45353, quad 46354, quad 55363, quad 56364and with six digits, any F G H F G H number, since this is 1001 cdot F G H=77 cdot 13 cdot F G H. (Among the four- and five-digit numbers, there are also pairs with a difference of 1001 and 10010, respectively.)"},{"problem":"In right triangle ABC, angle C=90^{circ}, AC=1, BC=sqrt{2}, then cos A=____.","solution":"To solve for cos A in right triangle ABC where angle C=90^{circ}, AC=1, and BC=sqrt{2}, we follow these steps:1.

Let's break down the steps:1. Initial Counts:   - Rocks: 40   - Stones: 30   - Minerals: 20   - Gemstones: 102. Operation Definition:   Each operation removes one rock, one stone, and one mineral or gemstone. We need to ensure that no two objects of the same type are removed in a single operation.3. Balancing the Counts:   To maximize the number of operations, we need to balance the counts of the objects as much as possible. The limiting factor will be the type with the smallest count, which is gemstones (10).4. Performing Operations:   - We can perform 10 operations where we remove one rock, one stone, and one gemstone. After these 10 operations, the counts will be:     - Rocks: 40 - 10 = 30     - Stones: 30 - 10 = 20     - Minerals: 20     - Gemstones: 10 - 10 = 05. Remaining Counts:   After removing all gemstones, we are left with:   - Rocks: 30   - Stones: 20   - Minerals: 20   - Gemstones: 06. Further Operations:   Now, we can only perform operations involving rocks, stones, and minerals. The limiting factor is now the stones (20).7. Performing More Operations:   - We can perform 20 operations where we remove one rock, one stone, and one mineral. After these 20 operations, the counts will be:     - Rocks: 30 - 20 = 10     - Stones: 20 - 20 = 0     - Minerals: 20 - 20 = 0     - Gemstones: 08. Final Counts:   After all possible operations, we are left with:   - Rocks: 10   - Stones: 0   - Minerals: 0   - Gemstones: 09. Total Number of Operations:   - 10 operations (involving gemstones)   - 20 operations (involving stones and minerals)   Therefore, the total number of operations is (10 + 20 = 30).The final answer is (boxed{30})."},{"problem":"3.

What was the leader's position in the alphabetical order?","solution":"After the first robber takes as many gold bars as the sum of the digits in the number of the looted gold bars, the remaining number of bars will certainly be divisible by 9, since according to the rule of divisibility by 9, the remainder of the sum of the digits when divided by 9 is the same as the remainder of the number when divided by 9.Another 13 times, a sum divisible by 9 is taken from a sum that is divisible by 9, always taking the sum of the digits of the amount, which is also divisible by 9, so a number divisible by 9 remains after each step.Since the bars run out, the number of bars taken in the last step is a single-digit number, a number divisible by 9, because numbers with two or more digits are larger than the sum of their digits. Therefore, the number of bars taken in the 14th step is 9.Since 14 times gold is taken and 13 of these times it is certainly a multiple of 9, the initial number is certainly greater than 100.Let's consider the case when the number of gold bars is still three-digit, and a robber takes the sum of the digits, and the remaining number of gold bars is only two-digit:overline{a b c}-(a+b+c)=99 a+9 bSince a>0, this number can only be two-digit if a=1 and b=0. Therefore, at some point during the takings, the number of gold bars will be 99.Then the gold will decrease as follows:| the number of bars | 99 | 81 | 72 | 63 | 54 | 45 | 36 | 27 | 18 | 9 | 0 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || the sum of the digits in the number of bars | 18 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 0 |This is a total of 10 steps, so the 5th robber was the one who took 18 bars from 99.
