The answer to your question based on the various things that unprotected sexual act without ejaculation still puts you at some risk of contacting HIV as you do not know the other person status. But the good thing is that you are circumcised and there is ample evidence that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60 % (world health organization (WHO)). WHO and UNAIDS (The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS) even recommended​ it as an efficient intervention for HIV prevention. In case there are no tears or fresh open wound, chances are very low. However, I do suggest you undertake HIV rapid test now and if negative then a repeat HIV test at three months and then at six months. Take precautions for the future.

And if the bleeding stops permanently, will my gums take the original shape? I want to know this because I do not wish my gums to recede.","Doctor":"Hello. The most common cause of bleeding gums is plaque and calculus deposition on teeth and gums (due to improper maintenance of oral hygiene). Only brushing and mouthwashing at home may not work since it is a little advanced stage and demands professional help (teeth cleaning). Gums may recede due to loss of attachment with the teeth. That requires proper oral hygiene maintenance after cleaning. In some cases, gingival recontouring or reshaping is carried out. In short, see a dentist. He will be able to address all these concerns immediately."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I recently had unprotected sex with a prostitute last month.

I have eye fatigue, muscle soreness, leg weakness, some not red bumpy dots on my hand is not itchy.A little muscle pain and insomnia. I ate a lot of fruits and doing exercise lately.

I regret what I have done. Now it is the fourth week I am going to go for another check-up next week.","Doctor":"Hello. I want to bring some of the recent facts about HIV tests. Studies have shown that the recent tests are highly sensitive and specific and HIV seroconversion (positivity) could be detected within one to two weeks after the onset of illness by the majority of the currently available tests. There are guidelines which have mentioned that four generation test can detect 95 % infections four weeks after exposure. Negative test after four weeks needs to be confirmed with the second test three months after exposure. The symptoms which you are having could have multiple reasons and could be just a coincidental finding at this time point. Continue with exercise and proper diet.

I read your query and from what you described it appears that you have some upper respiratory tract infection, which could be giving the lymph node swelling in your neck, which is associated with your muscle cramps. These are not thyroid gland swellings according to me because the thyroid swelling does not increase or decrease in size so rapidly. I would advise you to do complete blood count, a urine dipstick test to rule out whether you have any infection and a simple TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) test that is a thyroid function screening test to diagnose any thyroid disorder. Try to take tablet Paracetamol 500 mg thrice a day for your cramps in the meantime.

Can I be calm with these results?","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms of acute HIV infection appear relatively for a short duration and resolve within a few days. These can appear anywhere around two to six weeks. Your signs at nine weeks could be a coincidental finding, and there could be numerous causes for the symptoms.  The tests performed these days for HIV are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. Majority of the people who are infected with HIV develop antibodies by two to eight weeks. The literature says approximately​ 5 % develop by three months. With your negative HIV rapid test at 10 and 15 weeks after exposure, you can surely relax and calm. However, there are recommendations, and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the HIV test at six months of high-risk exposure.

If I want to maintain this health ever, then I understood that I should balance vata, pitta and kapha (tridoshas) in my body. I have also studied many basic principles of ayurveda for the last three years. Kindly tell me a powerful medicine that always balances tridoshas and seven dhatus in my body. I am already on Triphala. So, please tell me something useful to balance my body equilibrium. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. According to Indian traditional medicines (ayurveda and siddha), one can be healthy by balancing three life humors and seven body humors. Drugs that contain all six tastes can do this. For example, amla (gooseberry), triphala, etc. But, in today's lifestyle, these two are not sufficient as you feel and I also agree with you. Once in a six month, you need to subject you for body service. It means purgation, vomiting (vamanam) and sweating or sputum expectoration are the three procedures to balance vaatham (vata), pitham (pitta) and kapham respectively. This can be effectively done under ayurveda or siddha physicians. In ayurveda, they do it in panchakarma therapy. In siddha, it is done in two phases :  Currently available Kaya kalpam drugs are Triphala tablet, Karisalai karpam tablet, Bhringaraj karpam powder, etc. You can take the first tablet for five months in the morning and evening and then give one month gap. Then start second or third tablet for the next five months. Again, leave a gap of one month. This should be continued for life long. I have been using these two tablets. This Triphala karpam tablet is different and enriched with other herbals as well. Weekly once, you need to use pancha karpa kuliyal choornam. This powder is boiled in milk and then applied over the scalp at morning. Wait for one hour and then take bath. On that day, you never feel sleepy instead you will be more brisk or refresh. In addition, once in six months take Agathiyar kuzhambu just once for balancing three dhoshas. I feel this regimen is cheaper and effective than regular Panchakarma. Early stage brownish or white hairs will also become black. This is the kaya kalpa regimen for a healthy individual.

Also, a complete blood count, thyroid profile, serum prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH (luteinizing hormone), renal and liver function tests (LFT) would be needed to find out the cause.

Postmenopausal bleeding is the vaginal bleeding, which occurs 1 year after attaining menopause. It should be evaluated, particularly in whom with a family history of carcinoma.

The causes of PMP bleeding include vaginal atrophy (the most common), hormonal replacement therapy for menopause Like Tamoxifen, endometritis or endometrial infection, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial carcinoma, cervical polyps, cervical carcinoma and any other gynecological carcinoma.

If you have bleeding and you have to change two to three pads per day, then you do not have to do anything for bleeding on urgent basis. At 48 years of age, if you are bleeding heavily, then better get an appointment and check your cervix and the other things. If required, do a Pap smear or cervical biopsy or dilatation and curettage and send for HPE (histopathological examination) to rule out cervical cancer. If everything is fine, then you can wait for menopause to come and take medication as and when required. If you are passing clots and there is more bleeding, then I suggest you Etamsylate like tablets two to three times a day. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. If not controlled or have vertigo and disorientation-like symptoms, then rush to the hospital and get checked immediately.

Happily married since the last 26 years to a very loving and caring lady. We have an equally loving daughter. We are a religious family, well settled, financially, socially and professionally, and by the grace of God, have no significant issues in life. My wife and I enjoy normal sexual activity, with the usual ups and downs, due to age and mood. I can confidently say that I am a one women man, and till date have not had any extra marital encounters. I am heterosexual and do not have any sexual deviations. Personality wise, I am an introvert and have a minor speech defect. I am well respected at my workplace, where I interact with female coworkers. I do occasionally indulge in sexually explicit clips, which I receive on social media, but I am not overly obsessed with them. However, lately, I have noticed a propensity towards sexual (mis)adventures, outside marriage, which is a cause of concern for my wife, who is also aware of this and we are very upset. I am very much aware and realize the devastating effect this can have on my life, and especially on my family, which I treasure more than anything in this world.

You need an adventure in life, take a trip, soul searching, yoga, meditation, fulfill your mental craving. 2. The other option is sexing up your life. Talk to your partner about your feeling. There are like other things in life two people can do rather than just normal sex. You can try role-playing, introduce sex toys, try different sex position, try difficult sex position, and so on. I Hope I have answered your query. If you have further doubts, I would be happy to help you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I prematurely gave birth to twins on the 18th at 25 weeks and two days. The reason behind it was told to me that my regular gynecologist did not put some closure on my uterus to avoid premature birth, which is a common issue in twins. Mine was a normal delivery. My boy was born at 865 g and girl at 585 g. They have now survived for over 45 hours in the NICU. The doctors have just been telling me that the children are alive and breathing. That is all they tell me. I am still very worried. What are the chances of such children to survive in NICU after they have survived for several hours in most odd conditions? I know they are going through the toughest challenges to breathe through their underdeveloped body but I still want to get a generic view. All their body parts have been found to be growing and fine in the last level-2 ultrasound.","Doctor":"Hello. Both your babies are extremely premature as well as extremely low birth weight. The main complication that arises is due to incomplete development of lung. So, immediate surfactant therapy and oxygen support would be required. The next common complication is sepsis. Complete asepsis is to be maintained. Tertiary level NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) care which should be handled by qualified neonatologist is the primary requirement. A complete aseptic environment is to be created. In my practice, I have very mixed experience in the prognosis. I have seen these babies succumbing mainly to the sepsis. As per me, the baby with more weight has a better prognosis. It also depends on the level of NICU care being provided.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

In the mid of last month when I was cleaning the area, I noticed it starting to burn around the bottom swelling area. During those couple of days, I saw the swelling lightly increase. It is now late and have not seen any drop of swelling and worried that this would never heal. Also, my tip area has some light swelling which has not changed for the past eight weeks (it was pretty bad for the first two weeks). My erection last month did not hurt, but now when I get erections, I have some discomfort due to the dryness or redness. I saw my doctor last week who did the surgery, which he did not say much. I am attaching photos on how it looked last month and how it looks now. The picture with the stitches is what it was last month. If you can help me answer the questions below, that will be great since I am stressing out. Is it normal to see this type of swelling behavior? Is it normal to have swelling around the tip? Is this expected healing based on my current photos and healthy to see swelling for three months? I started having a burning sensation which is on and off after I cleaned the area, I am assuming this is just from the irritation that I caused? When I elevate my penis when I get out of the shower, the glands and swelling area look white or tan like it is almost healed, and I see a slight decrease in swelling, is this a good sign? Can I have swelling for this great cause any long term complications or there is nothing I should be worried about? My Glands looked dry and slight red and cracked. Is applying sensitive lotion safe to this area and will it help heal?","Doctor":"Hello. 1. Yes, it is reasonable to have this much swelling, which will resolve over time 2. Yes, it is usually expected to heal. 3. Yes, the burning sensation is due to irritation. 4. The appearance of tan following shower has nothing to do with healing. This is due to moisture following the shower. 5. The swelling is unlikely to cause any long term complications. 6. The cracks in the skin are due to dryness, and applying lotion is not harmful. However, you need to take the opinion of a dermatologist (skin specialist) if there is no improvement in six weeks. I hope I have answered all your queries. Please get back to me if you have any more questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had to strain to have a bowel movement a few days ago. I instantly felt a lump in my throat after pushing.

First one is related to your lower gut (straining to have bowel movements) which is constipation, a second symptom which is the lump in the throat can be a symptom of hiatus hernia (one of the reasons). Check the following symptoms which usually happen with hiatus hernia, 1. Acidity increases, especially after having particular foods like fried, spicy, mint, chocolate, caffeine drinks, chili. 2. Burping. 3. Upper central abdominal pain. 4. Pain in the center of the chest, more while sleeping. 5. Prolonged unexplained coughing. Constipation, globus, hiatus hernia, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Three months ago, I was treated for syphilis with a shot of penicillin and other antibiotics. I was never tested for syphilis. I am a very active gay man who had signs of syphilis, and my infectious disease doctor presumptively treated me by providing antibiotics before I was tested. He told me to get tested as soon as possible, but I have never done. Two days after the antibiotics, my symptoms went away (I had swollen lymph nodes). I also experienced mild flu-like symptoms, which I understand, are common after syphilis treatment. So, I assumed it was syphilis and never got tested. Now I am worried that if I get reinfected, my doctor will not be able to tell. Should I be concerned? Currently under Biktarvy for HIV. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you are concerned. But serological tests for syphilis do not work like this. There are tests which remain positive for a lifetime if you once acquired syphilis. I dont know what features you had of syphilis but to confirm you have it or not you need to go for the serological tests, 1. TPHA (Treponema pallidum haemagglutination ) remains positive irrespective of the treatment taken for lifelong in most of the cases. So if it is positive, it will indicate the disease. 2. VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory) titers decrease after taking treatment, might become negative after treatment. Usually used to monitor the treatment response. Eg. If titer decreases, fourfold treatment is working fine. Not of much use if you did not have baseline VDRL in the first place. Still, get these two tests done and revert as there is no point in assuming that you had syphilis or not without these tests first."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have been dealing with some issues lately regarding panic attacks. I am not sure what it is, but it is scary. I had three panic attacks in one day, or I think they are panic attacks. My fingers will twitch consistently then lock up and lose circulation, along with my whole arm, on both sides. My upper right lip will switch and my eye will too, then my cheek all while pulling my head back in the same motion.And all, while this is happening someone, will be trying to talk to me but I cannot speak, almost like being catatonic. I am a little skeptical about if they are panic attacks or not. Mainly because I usually have them when I am stressed, but I had two more again today, and I am not even stressing about anything.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms you are experiencing can be possibly due to hyperventilation during panic attacks. These can give rise to tetanic symptoms like tingling in limbs and face, muscle stiffness, trembling in hands, etc. It is advisable to consult your primary care doctor initially so that he can complete a necessary examination to rule out any physical causes that may cause similar symptoms. It will help to learn regular breathing and relaxation exercises. It will get better with practice. Also, learn strategies to manage stressful situations. I hope this helps. You can contact us again for any further advice."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had strong, persistent twitching in my left calf for over a week, sometimes with intermittent twitching in thigh, foot and buttock of the same leg. I am very concerned about this. I had a neurological exam (strength and reflex testing) at my GP, and he said all looked normal or good or no loss of strength or unusual reflexes. He ordered blood tests, and they have not come back yet, awaiting results. I have been exercising strenuously for the past few months and wonder if it could be exercise-related, but feel alarmed that it is on one side. Two weeks ago, I did not see a stair, stumbled and fell on my left hand, hurting my elbow, which has been in pain too. Physiotherapist hypothesizes this fall could have also brought on the twitch. I am seeking advice as I am quite scared that it could be a severe neurological conditon since I twitch about once every three seconds, sometimes even more, and it has only let up for a few hours before coming back in the same calf and part of the muscle. I have not noticed any real weakness aside from slightly wobbly feeling legs (but can still do a full workout on the gym, walk on heels and toes without difficulty, etc.). Mainly the anxiety is keeping me awake and probably making it all worse. My muscles feel tight and compressed at the moment, from calf up to left hip or buttock.","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that the twitching in this calf could be related to a twisted muscle or a pinched nerve (considering the straining physical activity that you have been doing lately and the falling). I would recommend performing nerve conduction studies and a lumbar spine X-ray study to exclude a possible pinched nerve or a bulging disc in the lumbar vertebral column. I would also recommend checking calcium, blood electrolytes, and vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency and inflammation tests like complete blood count, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate).

I remain at your disposal for any further questions whenever you need."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter has been using Differin for five weeks now every other night and now has pimples all over her forehead.

The possibilities are, 1. Your periods previous to pregnancy was irregular, so what you count as eight weeks maybe less, need to wait and repeat scan after 7 to 10 days. 2. Pregnancy is not healthy. Only if the growth of the baby is normal, the rate of growth of the baby will be regular, and by eight weeks, you should be able to see the baby.You can confirm the health of the baby by checking the serum beta hCG, repeat it after 48 hours, and it should be doubled in 48 hours. For example, if today value is 100 IU/ml, it will be 200 days after and 400 after two more days. If the baby is not healthy, the rise will be less than that. So then repeat it till you can confirm no adequate growth.Only when the beta hCG value is 1500 mIU/mL can a baby be seen on the scan.

I need to know details of your symptoms like since when you have this pain, other symptoms, any prior illness, you can also upload your blood reports, X-ray and discharge summary or prescription if available for better analysis. Since you are diagnosed with pneumonia, we would consider the pain to be arising from the lungs. The pain associated with pneumonia is called pleuritic Chest pain, and this kind of pain is sharp and increases on deep breathing. Muscle relaxant will not help in this kind of pain. For this kind of a pain, you will need tab Ibuprofen 400 or Diclofenac 50 mg whenever needed up to two times a day. So you can get this prescribed. It will resolve once your pneumonia is settled.

There is a definitive genetic component in vitiligo and if someone is affected by it, he is more likely to transmit it to his kids than a person who does not have it. There are 4 to 5 times more chances of getting vitiligo than general population without it, if one of the parent or sibling has one.

For 30 years, I have always had different strengths, both with astigmatism usually going up a bit each year to the last one 18 months ago which was: Left -4.50 -.75 160 8.6 14.5 and Right -5.00 -2.25 180 8.6 14.5. Now this new place is telling me I do not need any astigmatism correction. The trial lenses I left with did not work 30 minutes later. I think their test was done wrong or could they possibly be right? They are acting like they do not want to retest at all.","Doctor":"Hi. If someone has an astigmatism and that too upto 2.5 diopter, it is rare that it is reversed. But sometimes optometrist can add astigmatic power in spherical power that is called spherical equivalent. In such cases half the power of cylinder is added to spherical power. For small astigmatism, it works well that you can use simple spherical lens but if astigmatism is higher then spherical equivalent will not give optimal visual correction.  For right eye which has 0.75 cylinder can be added to spherical and it will work but in left eye cylinderical power is 2.5 diopter. Now, if you are comfortable with simple spherical glasses then it is okay. But if it is not working then you should shift back to cylinderical contact lenses. You can visit to your optometrist or ophthalmologist again for accurate refraction and I hope your problem will be solved. You are welcome for any queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter (4 years old) had an eye injury around seven months back. She is now diagonised with granulomatous panuvietis. I have consulted in person around six opthalmologists and they have told that it is due to eye injury. However, one of them wanted me to go for auto immune tests just to rule that out and asked me to consult a rhemutologist as well. My daughter did not have any joint pains or any other problems at all. It was only eye inflammation. We did all the tests including CPR, ESR, RA factor, ANA and every possible test. Tb also, jaundice LFT, X-ray, B-scan, C-scan. All of them are normal. Only that she has cataract in eye due to inflammation which opthals told that it is due to injury as it was ignored and not treated. Later, the doctor prescribed her Deflazacort 18 mg. She was on medication for three weeks and we were shifting our house to another city. She suddenly fell ill due to hot weather. Physicians asked to stop steroids immediately and the opthal doctor also asked us to go ahead with them. She was ill only for a day. Next day, we shifted back to our native which is much cooler and she was absolutely fine without any medications. However, after a day, she started having severe joint pains only in her knees. Since we were in a village,we could not take her to doctor. After 4 to 5 days she started getting swelling in both the knees. When we rushed to doctor, they claimed it as autoimmune. Now we are in confusion. Till she was taking steroids ,she was fine. Rather, even before she was on steroids also, she had no problems. However, after pulling off steroids, she has inflammation and there is no evidence of why this inflammation has occured, if it is autoimmune. As all her reports are normal and only her joint inflammation which we believe is due to the medicines that she took, can anyone conclude that its autoimmune? Does any knee inflammation in a normal person means autoimmune? Is inflammation in any part of the body related to only auto immune diseases. Is there no other reason? Now the doctor is saying that she has to be on immunosuppressants for two years. Is this only because she has inflammation in leg which also occured due to withdrawal of steroids and there is no other reason?","Doctor":"Hello. I shall try to answer your queries one by one. Eye injury may sometimes set up the autoimmunity. It is not clear in your question how much eye problem she currently has. Inflammation anywhere in body could be set up by infection, autoimmunity, or auto-inflammatory disease. The age group of the patient suggest the possibility of oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In this, eye involvement is also common, in the form of uveitis. But it can be definitely diagnosed only after physical examination. Most of the blood tests are usually normal in it. If it is juvenile arthritis, then long time treatment is recommended. Wysolone and Folitrax are commonly used to treat it. Other possibilities for garanulomatous uveitis include tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. You should consult with a rheumatologist for establishing a definite diagnosis. In addition to the tests described, I would also suggest to get HLA B27 to be done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a beta thalassemia minor, but my wife is not. Recently my 5-year daughter was diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major (heterozygous). She is active and playful. No problem reported yet, but her Hb level is between 7.8 to 8.8 from starting. Her spleen is enlarged as diagnosed in USG. Will she be transfusion dependent? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. If you are having thalassemia minor and your wife is thalassemia negative than there is no chance of acquiring thalassemia major in your child.So your wife must also have thalassemia minor if your child is thalassemia major. Your child's attached report suggestive of thalassemia major (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The only treatment in thalassemia major is either bone marrow transplantation or regular blood transfusion to maintain hemoglobin level within range. So your child might need a routine blood transfusion to maintain hemoglobin within range. She can be given an iron tablet, but it will not work in your child case as she has thalassemia major. I am sorry to say, but your child will need a blood transfusion for the treatment of low hemoglobin.  You can consult nearby good hematologist or the place where bone marrow transplantation facility is available, which is a curative treatment for thalassemia major. But it is costly treatment. I hope I have answered well of your question in detail. I will guide you further if needed."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been experiencing some unexplained bruising for a few weeks. Also, last week I had a few pin point red dots on the side of my back which went away in about two days. This past week I discovered some more of the cluster of red dots on the back of my thigh, which turned into a big bruise the following day. Also, today I woke up with the red dots on the back of my other thigh. I had a CBC done today, but is this something I should be concerned about? I am not having any other symptoms. Would I be more symptomatic if I had a blood cancer?","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are not suggestive of any blood cancer or other form of cancer. For repeated bruise and attached photo of lesion (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you have to investigate as follows: Liver profile reports to check liver pathology. CBC to rule out low platelet count, if present. PT, APTT to rule out coagulation problem if present. BT bleeding time testing to rule out vessel problem if present.

Since the start of the year, I have severe (before that mild) erection problems. It got bad, hardly any erection, hardly felt glans anymore during masturbation (been a few years since I had penetrative sex). The penis is feeling sore. Nearly two weeks ago, I got itching and pain in glans/tip and a part of the outer skin discolored (also caused by masturbation friction). I saw a GP, did not see glans as I had never retracted foreskin in my life and told me to see a urologist. The next day, I used coconut oil outside and tip and it was soothing for the tip and pain but sore feeling stayed. After a week, I got so far that I retracted foreskin (a bit difficult but no pain) and there was a white substance on the left side. The GP told me to keep it clean and prescribed Miconazole. There was an adhesion with the white substance which I massaged loose after a few days (left side where white stuff was). This spot makes it hard to roll back the skin as the inside skin sticks/rolls. This skin is cracked as you can see from the picture. I showed different GPs and they told me the glans looks healthy and to keep using Miconazole, see a urologist, etc. I am considering taking Diflucan 150 mg to rid infection asap. I cannot really roll back the skin further as in the picture for cleaning further due to foreskin rolling/sticking, also afraid of paraphimosis. Your view, please.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the images sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are concerned with two problems: Regarding glans, the retraction of the foreskin is good. It is almost maximum. So, nothing to worry about the retraction. The glans is normal and fine. Glans is sore and slight whitish due to mild infection as it was not cleaned for many years. You will have a sore feeling because it is exposed to the new environment. The white substance you are talking about was smegma. But, it is cleared now. I suggest you take Diflucan (Fluconazole) as it will speed up the healing infection. Soreness is due to drying of glans when exposed to the outside. You just need to apply a soothing ointment like Lignocaine jelly during bedtime. You can stop Miconazole cream also when finished. Regarding erectile dysfunction, get some blood tests done if possible as we need to find the cause of ed. Treatment of ED depends on the cause.

So, my GP gave me medicine for UTI and also gave few tests which included CBC, sugar test, urine routine and culture, sonography for abdomen and lower abdomen, PSA, and serum creatine which all came negative. But still, I was having lower abdomen pain and burning tip, now with a stinging sensation in the penis as well as in the anus. Since it was not going away, my GP referred me to a urologist who then said it is dysuria and gave me Levoflox 500 mg, Tizan, Paracetamol 650 and Lactulose solution for motion for five days. But still, the pain was not gone. So, the urologist said to see a surgeon for abdomen pain and a dermatologist for the red meatus. The dermatologist said I do not have any skin issue but still gave me antifungal tablets and an antiallergy with a cream. So, the redness of meatus came down and burning too, but the stinging sensation of the lower abdomen and the sting from the penis to anus was not gone as I could feel it every now and then and more when passing motion.After all this, then I visited the surgeon who checked me for a hernia and prostate. To confirm, he also referred me to a sonography B/L hernial region and color doppler scrotum as now the pain was in the testicle too and a stool test.I did the following test and result for a hernia was negative while for scrotum test it came as: The right spermatic cord is bulky and shows mildly increased vascularity s/o funiculitis. Right simple epidydimal cyst. Normal both testis.Now, the surgeon was not available.

Your report is normal and there is no need to worry. If you want a detailed explanation about the report, then here you go. There are some genetic syndromes, which are happening worldwide in which baby can be seriously handicapped physically, body function wise or mentally. Now you cannot diagnose any genetic disease directly without baby cell as it contains DNA. But, the procedure (amniocentesis) for obtaining baby cell itself is very risky and can even lead to abortion and also more costly. So, we are doing a screening test to diagnose the high risk pregnancies that have a high risk of getting that genetically abnormal baby. For that we combine different parameters and compare it with a standardized data to come to a ratio for chance of current pregnancy having that genetic abnormality. The test is negative and positive; according to either it is below the cutoff value or above. 1:250 meaning, 250 pregnancies like you having a chance of only 1 positive for that genetic abnormal baby. So, as your report is good in which it is negative for Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) and also for 18 and 13 (Patau and Edward syndrome). So, your pregnancy is normal and no need to worry. You have to do only one thing and that is to follow normal medicines and precautions. One more thing I have seen in your report is that the cervical length is 3.0 cm. It is somewhat borderline at 12 weeks of pregnancy. For that you need to take proper rest. Just increase the duration of your rest time and continue Progesterone (Endogest 200) two or three times a day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a problem with lower left abdominal pain for 7 years which is diagnosed in 2017 as an umbilical hernia. I subsequently did the surgery in January 2018 and I was diagnosed with moderate fatty liver during the test prior to the surgery. But I was given Liv 52 to take for three months and Lipitor 20 mg. But when I reported to work I started noticing mild pain in my heels and imbalance which I thought was due to the drugs side effects. Somewhere in March I panicked out of sleep and started sweating with my heart beating very fast. I rushed to the hospital and they did a brain CT and kidney function test which was normal and the gave me some anxiety tablets Lexotamil 1.5 mg. Afterward, I noticed that my heel pain was aggravating with flashes of dizziness and minor headaches which I could manage. I reported to the hospital and was referred to an orthopedic specialist. There I was asked to do and MRI of the brain, neck, and spine with magnesium, phosphate, calcium, and sodium test which were all normal. The doctor then gave me Renerve and Stugeron for the dizziness. But still the issue persisted so I reported back to focus and was asked to see and ENT specialist and EYE specialist. I went to an eye center but they all proved negative. So I was referred to see a neurologist who asked for an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spines and also test for Folate and Vitamin B12. But again they were all negative and he said my situation might be idiomatic so he did not give anything. But in all these, I realized my energy levels were coming down I easily get tired and occasionally my heart rate will go up with a feeling of uneasiness and confusion all coupled with balancing disorders associated with cluster headaches. I went back to my hospital and was advised to see a cardiologist. He also did his relevant test which all proved negative and he declared me safe. But he advised if I am still not normal I should see his boys at the executive heart center which I did. They have been working on me since and nothing has come up. Although the symptoms still persist. So just last week I was not feeling very well and had to go for a check up when I was told of the micro-pulmonary embolism and was admitted. I currently have serious heel pain without swelling in the legs, dizziness without spinning, chest discomfort, unsteady gait, muscle weakness and extreme fatigue, diminished vision, issues with acid reflux and indigestion, occasional heart palpitations, insomnia, and pressure and discomfort in the chest after standing for about 5 minutes or while walking with extreme dizziness. I currently take Xarelto 15 mg, Motilium once daily, Stugeron 25 mg, Maalox plus suspension 150 ml, Pariet 20 mg, Carvedilol 6.25 mg, and Lexotanil 1.5 mg once daily at night.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I can imagine how difficult time you have doing all these visit to doctors. Well, I have gone through your history, I could not see you have any specific gastrointestinal issues at this moment. Your main concerns are related to the neurological department not a gastroenterology department. I urge you to seek help from a neurology team. Well, some of your concerns like fatty liver, and indigestions are related to my field, hence I would like to give you some suggestion regarding that. So I see you already on some medicine for indigestion such as Maalox syrup and Pariet which is an acid suppressant medication. They are relatively safe and can be taken regularly or intermittently based on symptoms. The second concern from GI prespective are fatty liver. You did not mention your weight so I could not estimate the body mass index which is a direct tool to assess the level of fat one has over the liver and other body tissues. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) can reduce some fat from liver but they are not the preferred treatment for fatty liver disease, they can control lipids however if elevated. Atorvastatin can cause myopathy means muscle damage and can cause severe cramps over legs and throughout the body. I want you to check your creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels to confirm this if you have recently stopped your Atorvastatin. The preferred therapy for fatty liver disease, if you are not diabetes is Vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for at least three months. The other recommendation is to reduce your weight by 7 to 10% of current body weight in the coming six months. Walk 150 minutes/week and dieting which is all required. I am sorry I could not answer the rest of your concern, but I want that should contact a neurologist available online on icliniq to be given proper suggestions regarding your health. I hope this helps. Fatty liver disease. Indigestion. Creatine phosphokinase. Drug-induced indigestion. Capsule Vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for three months. You can follow up with me for your GI related issues, and discuss long term management of your fatty liver disease."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, From the last three months, I have a constant pain on the right side of my mouth. I believe the pain was similar to when someone has an erupting wisdom tooth, but I am not 100 % sure. When I looked in the mirror with a flashlight, I found a tiny white spot in the area between my right upper and lower wisdom teeth. I had this spot for at least 4 or 5 days, and then gradually it subsided within a week or so. After a week, when I took a look, that white spot was gone but the little surrounding area had become white. This white area got bigger with time. I visited a dental surgeon in a top hospital, who visually examined the area and asked me to get an OPG done. The OPG report suggested impacted wisdom tooth. The doctor said the white area was caused by trauma from the friction of the two wisdom teeth on that side with the skin. I was not very convinced and visited another dental surgeon, who also said more or less the same thing, after examining and going through the OPG. As per his advice, I got both wisdom teeth extracted. The white area has remained till this date, not the initial white dot which had disappeared within 5 to 6 days as mentioned above. I could not open my mouth properly for few days after the extraction, but when I finally did, everything appeared normal. Since then, I have not had any oral or dental issues. It is to be noted that neither doctor had seen the first tiny white dot or spot since I had met them after it was gone and when the surrounding area was white. I have attached some photos here, and the photos marked 1 and 2 show the first white dot. While the remaining show the condition after this spot disappeared. I request your thoughts and opinion about the issue detailed above. Could the original white spot be an ulcer or canker sore? If yes, what could have been the possible cause? Is a single canker sore cause of worry? Can it indicate some very serious underlying condition? I have read on the internet that mouth ulcers normally occur on the inside of cheeks, tongue, and lips. Can it occur in the area where the spot appeared? If it had been a mouth ulcer, is it possible that the ulcer affected the area in a way which caused a trauma resulting in the white area? I request a detailed response to the above at the earliest, please.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for your query. I have seen all the attached photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

By seeing her reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity), I understand the pattern of rise in creatinine and her condition of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

I have cramping pain in my lower abdomen, and I suffer from indigestion, bloating, burping, and nausea. Nausea seems to originate from my lower intestine. If I smoke, it makes me nauseous. I have a constant feeling that something in my lower intestine is irritating. I do not have diarrhea or constipation. I go to the toilet every morning, and the stool looks normal. I feel my appetite has gone down because of all the air in the intestine. I cannot digest fatty foods, milk, and some fruits. I know it is not IBS. If I massage my belly, I get a burning pain in my lower abdomen. I feel like there is some obstruction in my intestine.I did an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and it is fine. The ultrasound showed the ileum is full of air and there are no visible thickening. Then, I got UTI, and I was given Macrobid antibiotics for it. This antibiotic helped my stomach also, as the burping had stopped. But, the symptoms started again when I stopped taking the tablets. It always feels like something inside is irritating, and I saw fresh blood in the stool one time. Probiotics do not help much, and I cannot sit for long because it feels like my anus will explode. The food is not passing normally through the gastrointestinal tract.It all started after taking some Magnesium pill. I felt as if something was swollen from the inside, and I passed less stool. Then I was given PPI, and it made things worse. Bending over makes me nauseous. All this is going on from the past three months. I even stopped smoking, but it is not getting better. Whenever I smoke, I start feeling nauseous again. I know it is not stress-related or IBS. How much of small intestine is seen using colonoscopy? What could this be? I lost weight due to poor absorption. I do not think it is cancer, as I had a colonoscopy two years ago, and it was fine, but back then, I had no such problems. What test needs to be done?

Nasopharyngeal swab for Coronavirus is a very simple test just like how you use your ear buds. So nèed not worry, it can be done even if you have deviated septum.

It is located on the right side of my right foot below the ankle joint. I am attaching pictures of me pointing at the spot. There is a small ganglion near it but I am not concerned about that. The bone lump is what that is troubling me. There is no pain at all almost. It is there mainly when I drive and use the gas pedal a lot. I know about it for more than half a year, but it was there probably longer. It is smooth when I press on it and kind of round and hard as a bone. I have had some x-rays done on my feet, it was some time ago but the lump was there back then. My biggest concern is that this could be some kind of bone cancer. I am also sending the x-ray files of both of my feet. Could you have a look at them?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity) I understand that you are concerned about a lump in your right midfoot on the outer side. The probable cause is a benign bony prominence. However, differential diagnoses include a calcified ganglion, accessory ossicle, a subluxed peroneal tendon, ankle ligament sprain, and tarsal coalition. You described the lump as a hard lump with a smooth surface. The pictures you sent suggest that it is around 2 cm long and 1cm wide. Investigations that need to be done include anteroposterior and lateral and oblique radiographs of the right foot. The fact that it has been there for a long time and that there is no pain is reassuring and goes against cancer. However, it is important to know if there have been any recent changes. Prevention measures include wide comfortable shoes with good padding. The attached files only contain clinical photographs.There are no radiographs to comment on. Kindly upload the reports.

The platelet count has dropped already to 52000 from 1,40,000. Please advise us what to do further?","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through the data you have posted. Low platelet count occurs in almost 70% of people with dengue fever. Normally, in case of disease the platelet count may go low for four to five days and then starts rising. Low platelet count (<100000) has risk of bleeding like bleeding from nose, blood in stools, which will be even more when count drops below 20000. So, only when platelets less than 10,000 we may offer platelet transfusions as they have a risk of anaphylaxis reactions. We need to do observe for any bleeding manifestations. If bleeding starts, then we need to give platelet transfusions irrespective of platelet count. Kindly upload the complete blood reports that will give us the clue whether platelets may improve or it will take time. You can do IPF (immature platelet fraction) which also can tell prognosis. So as for now, there is no specific therapy for low platelet count except some studies showed eating papaya fruit and leaf extract showed an increasing trend.

During the winter, one night we went to a restaurant in and after that we went to a bar for some drinks and then to a food store. I had not dressed appropriately for the cold weather and I had no hat or scarf and it was very cold. We ended up going to his place. Next thing, I was fingering him and we had oral sex. I started to masturbate but I am circumcised so it hurt without moisture. He gave me jerkins and I was behind him. I slipped inside him and he came off. Then we put on a condom and did anal. We did mostly cuddling. Then I pulled out the condom with no ejaculation. The next day, I developed a severe headache so I assumed it was from the alcohol. I was not drunk. The next day, I started to get burst of muscle and joint pains throughout my body mainly when I was indoors. I was caught up with my final exams so I ignored the pains. When the pain went on for some days I went to a sexual health clinic and did a full STD test. I got negative for HIV but for acute HIV I had to wait 10 days for all the results. I still had the pains and took no pills. The very next day, I had night sweat and chills. I got so worried that I went at 11 p.m. to a 24-hours pharmacy to buy painkillers. My fever went up to 104°F. I took Tylenol then get a cab at 3 a.m. to go to the ER. The fever went down and I did not see the doctor until 8 a.m. and I only got a painkiller.The next day I saw my right leg looked slightly swollen. Since then, my fever has always been low and the muscle pain and joint pain was still present. I ended up rushing to other ERs for help. Two nights ago, the pain got to me when I tried to sleep. My arms, armpits, neck, collarbone, groin, legs were all paining. I got another HIV antibody/antigen blood test just two weeks after possible exposure and it came negative. I have been taking Ibuprofen every five hours to reduce the pain but I start to get breathing problems and my bladder area feels tender with pain in the upper right abdomen. I explained to my friend all my experiences but he was firm that he is negative. We did not have bareback sex and we used a condom. I have no diarrhea, cough, fatigue or rash.

Protected anal sex and fingering is safe and there is no risk of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). However, receiving unprotected oral sex carries a very low risk even though saliva is not considered infectious, provided he didn't have oral sores or bleeding gums. You may wait for another four weeks for a repeat HIV 1 and 2 antigen/antibody test. At six weeks it is considered conclusive of CDC (Centers for Disease Control) recommendation.

So if suppository is not working I suggest you to use Mesalamine enema. You can use 2 grams enema once a day preferably in morning after passing the first stool. Not thrice a day. The once a day dose work fine. Actually suppositories may not reach up to the extend of disease, hence in such situation enema which are rather liquid preparation would work fine.

Corn in my left leg near thumb bone and it is troubling very much. Since three years in summer, it bothers me. After taking some Homeo medicine, I feel relieved, but next summer, it starts troubling. Please advise me","Doctor":"Hello. As far as right knee complaint is concerned, it must be physiological and age-related. So you need to take general precautions the avoid the overuse. Corn in the left leg is something which can recur as you may be tending to regrow to it due to some precipitating factors. You need to check is the skin hardness around it is bothering you and from inside the corn site. Walking on hard surface with bare foot. Improper care of the soles.

Many reasons can cause the problem of weak erection and low libido, so you need to be evaluated and investigated to find the cause. The main reason for these problems is Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thyroid hormone, or other hormonal issues. If you are currently taking any medicine, then need to check them also as some medications can cause these side effects. So visiting a nearby doctor or psychiatrist will help you to find the underlying medical cause if any and then act accordingly. If no medical cause is found, then it may be attributed to psychological issues, and then drug like sildenafil or Tadalafil will help you to get a proper erection. To enhance your libido and erection problems take a healthy diet, do regular exercise, and take adequate sleep of six to eight hours daily. Spend enough time during foreplay. Try to follow the Master and Johnson technique, and you can google this and read about this and try to do it. You can go to a psychiatrist to get more insight into this and how to practice it as it can not be explained fully here. I hope this clarifies your concern."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 36 years old. I am a vegetarian. Before three years due to stomach disturbance, yellowish urine, pain and some popup and cracker sound in my legs and knee joints. I visited a doctor and he suggest me for liver function test and all reports in normal range except for sugar which was 138 mg/dL at that time, he gave some medicines and referred to an orthopedic for joint pain. I visited an ortho specialist and he took an x-ray of both leg knees and tell that it is an early stage of osteoarthritis of knee and suggest for MRI. I had done an MRI and in the report it is mentioned that the left knee has affected with osteoarthritis. After that he give some medicines for 10 days and refers to a physiotherapist for exercise and weight loss.

I would like to ask you a few more questions to confirm the probable diagnosis. Do you experience a lot of fatigue? Is the sleep pattern normal or is it disturbed? Any feelings of tiredness in the mornings after sleep also? Any history of recent irritability, forgetfulness? When you say stomach complaints does it mean loose stools or increased frequency of stools or constipation? Any history of weight loss?

I have PCOS. I am not taking regular contraceptive pills.","Doctor":"Hello. It is not recommended at all. Ideally, a withdrawal bleed should be expected in the next three to five days after taking unwanted 72, but if no bleed occurs, then a serum beta hCG test should be done to rule out pregnancy. The second pill taken would have masked the withdrawal bleed following the first pill, hence if again no bleed in next four to five days after the second pill intake, so please rule out pregnancy with a serum beta hCG test. If the hCG levels are less than 5 mIU, then you are surely not pregnant, and then you can safely wait for your menses to arrive naturally.

I feel that my voice is unattractive. I do not know what words to use but I feel that there is some problem. The quality of the voice feels low. Please give me solution or answer.","Doctor":"Hello. You have consumed energy drinks more than enough through 10 years. Change of voice for more than 10 days with failure of treatment is a strong indication for laryngoscopy to assess the condition of your vocal cords. So, did you receive any treatment before?

Later, my eye turned red and started mucus discharge and the next day the lens was expelled. So the redness got reduced but now there is mild drooping of the eyelid of that eye. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Most probably you have infection of the eye, due to lens being there for a long time. It causes inflammation of eyelids which causes drooping. You should start putting some antibiotic eye drops. Consult some ophthalmologist nearby to prescribe you one for it. Do not worry, it should resolve within a week with proper treatment.

She is in pain, but does not want to immobilise or stay in bed. What advice does she need to follow? Her sphincters are intact and she can control her bowels and bladder.","Doctor":"Hello. If she has a T8 vertebral fracture, that is I hope a compression fraction that you are talking about, which is minimally displaced and compressed. Then the treatment that is required is principally pain relief with minimal activities and physiotherapy initially to her mobilize with frame or support. She can use a TLSO brace (thoracic, lumbar sacral orthosis) and mobilize as able as tolerated by pain. Bed rest is only indicated in case of severe pain. Pain-killers like Co-codamol or Paracetamol or Morphine can be prescribed locally.

I have responded to ECT extremely well in the past but it did not hold me. I could no longer afford monthly maintenance treatments. I have currently started a treatment called Theta burst stimulation. After nine, 3-minute sessions I have had a few normal days but more days where I feel depressed. I am more depressed after I have started this treatment. Is this normal? I am scheduled to have a total of 36, 3-minute sessions.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. Although it is too early to measure the effect of TBS (theta-burst stimulation) after the nine sessions there is a good possibility that there will be an enduring effect over the coming weeks. My statement is based on the fact that early response (may be transient one) is an indicator of long term response for most antidepressant therapies including medications, TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) and now rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation), and TBS.  Considering the above fact I like to state that reversal of symptoms after a few days of normalcy at this stage is considered normal and we need to hold on till the completion of therapy. Although this is not the part of the question I like to draw your attention to the suboptimal dose of Effexor for someone who has depression over the 30 years. I rarely see any patient who responds to below 150 mg of Effexor after a prolonged history of depression, say 30 years.

It is known that some people experience increased anxiety when taking Adderall ( Dextroamphetamine, Amphetamine). If the excessive stress continues to be problematic and has not settled in few weeks, discuss with your psychiatrist about possibly reducing the dose of Adderall or looking at alternative medication for managing ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactive disorder). Meanwhile, Propranolol can be used as needed to manage anxiety provided there are no contraindications like asthma.

I will explain what happened.He was in his garden, on a cold winters day, standing in a ditch, that was not deep or wide when he tripped over something and fell backward onto his back. The surface he landed on was not hard. He was lying in the ditch and could not get up despite trying. I found him lying in the ditch for one and half an hour after the fall. He was trying to get up out of the ditch, and he could raise his head off the floor and his upper body slightly but not pull himself upright and out of the ditch. He wanted me to pull him up and out of the ditch. First of all, I assessed what injuries he thought he had, he had no pain in his head, neck or back, but thought he had broken his arm after smashing it against the side of the ditch as he landed. I decided not to pull him up in case he had any other injuries, so I phoned for the ambulance. While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, my friend said he had a strange tingling sensation in his legs. A paramedic arrived first before the ambulance, and he assessed my friend for any injuries. The paramedic then decided to get my friend out of the ditch, and as he was trying to get him out of the ditch, my friend said he could not feel his legs despite being to move them. The paramedic eventually got my friend out of the ditch and sat him down on a seat. The ambulance arrived, and instead of escorting my friend into the ambulance on a stretcher, the paramedic walked my friend into the ambulance. My friend walked from his back garden, down some small steps, and a sloping drive into the ambulance, covering a distance of about 40 meters. His arm was in a sling, and he was walking at a steady pace, but from what I saw, the balance was normal. It was when he was taken to the hospital that he was diagnosed with a fractured neck and died a few days later from transection of the cervical spinal cord. There was an inquest into his death, which I could not attend, where there was a verdict of accidental death. There are some questions I would like to ask about his injuries, please. He had no close family, so I can not ask them, and the coroners service can not give me any information because I am not related to him, and it is confidential information.So I would appreciate it if you could answer these questions, and I would particularly I like to know if there was any more I could have done to help him. The questions are, (1.) Did the fall cause the transection of the spinal cord the moment he fell and fractured his neck? (2.) If that was the situation would he have not survived even if I found him straight after his fall, and not 1 to 1 1/2 hours later, and also if he was kept immobilized and not walked after the fall would it be the case he would not have survived. (3.) Or would the fall have not caused the transaction of the spinal cord the moment he fractured his neck, and it was the period after the fall when lying in the ditch and moving around trying to get himself up that may be an unstable, broken bone in his neck struck his spinal cord and severed it? (4.) Or would the fall have only caused a slight spinal cord injury and if I found quicker and he was kept immobilized he could have survived? (5.) While waiting for the ambulance to arrive my friend said he had a strange tingling sensation in his legs and also when the paramedic was trying to get him out of the ditch, my friend said he could not feel his legs despite being able to move them, were the signs he had a spinal cord injury at that time? (6.) If my friend had severe injury his spinal cord when he fell or the time afterward, how could he have managed to walk into the ambulance 2 to 2 1/2 hours after the fall? (7.) Would it have been the walking that caused the most damage to his spinal cord? (8.) Can a person with a severed or partially injured severed spinal cord walk?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. 1. Yes, the fall seems to be the cause of the fractured neck and the damage to his spinal cord (attachment removed to protect patient identity). 2. Nothing would have changed if you found him one or two hours before. 3. I think that the fall caused the vertebral column fracture. Then, during transport to the hospital, the instability of the vertebral column has to lead to compression of the spinal cord, probably due to a wrong posture. 4. As he had tingling in his legs and could not feel them, these are signs of a spinal cord injury, probably in the posterior part where the sensory columns lay. A person with partial spinal cord damage can walk if the motor pathways in the anterior spinal cord are not damaged. But there is no way to know if he had broken his neck because he had no neck pain. So, it seems that this was a fatal injury. He should not have walked, but even if this did not happen, I am not sure if he could survive. You should know that the most important thing after a spinal cord injury is the swelling of the spinal cord, which increases in size in the next days. That is why his situation worsened the following days. You should know that the respiratory heart nerve pathways and lay on the cervical spinal cord. So, probably as the spinal cord has been swelling in the next days, it has affected this area, causing his death. There is no way to predict that if something changed in the management of the situation, it would make him live. This is because cervical spinal cord injuries have a high mortality rate and poor outcome. I hope you will find this information helpful. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to ask me again."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I recently lost a crown, and as a result, I have to get the tooth out, and I have to get an implant.

Cefpodoxime and Amoxicillin being different classes of drugs, will not cause an allergy if the other one causes. Cefpodoxime is safe in patients with liver injury, at least in moderate doses.

Dietary advice - avoid cold foods and liquids, smoke, dust, masala, spicy and oily foods. Take plenty of warm liquids, soft diet, warm water, etc. Take multivitamin tablets till your condition improves. Anti-inflammatory meds are Chymoral forte (Trypsin Chymotrypsin) or Disperzyme (Rutoside, Bromelain, and Trypsin) tablets. Mouth rinses like Tantum gargles (Benzydamine) diluted in water will be helpful. Any associated nose or ear symptoms will require additional measures. Do you suffer from allergy?

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I am wondering if there is a chance I have endometriosis. I am wondering this because I have no other risks/causes that could have caused the ectopic. There is no chance I could have an STD because my husband and I both waited until after we were married. I am young, just 29. I have never smoked, had an abortion, had fertility treatments, or have had surgery. I also do not have an IUD. Do you think the chance I may have it is big enough that it should be brought up with my gynecologist? I forgot to mention I have had one successful pregnancy two years ago. Also, I recently had a Pap smear two months ago and everything was normal. I have never had a bad result from a Pap smear. When it comes to symptoms, it is tricky because I feel they are very similar to menstrual cycle symptoms. I do have painful cramps on the heaviest day of my period. The cramps last for a couple of days. I have bad mood swings and bloating. I do have painful intercourse more recently. It always hurt occasionally in the past, but recently it is much worse. I also have spotting right before my period and right after.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? From your history, the only problem I feel is the problem which could happen to the tube. Your history of having a tubal pregnancy and severe pain during sex, that is dyspareunia, means that there is some problem which is happening around the uterus and the tubes. So, it could be endometriosis or could be a pelvic inflammatory disease. It need not always be an STD (sexually transmitted disease), it can be common pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID) too. You definitely have a good chance to get pregnant, keeping in mind your previous pregnancy and history of tubal pregnancy. If I may suggest: I would give more chances for infection. Infection can cause the embryo to get stuck in the tube (ectopic), unhealthy implementation in uterus and miscarriage and also severe pain during sex. Also, it is associated with vaginal discharge and itching after sex and around periods. Hope I have clarified your query.

It hurts tremendously even with pain medication and birth control. I would get horrible periods since I was about 12 years. In my 15 years age, I used to vomit on the first day of my period, but vomiting stopped in the past two years. Before one year I have been diagnosed with endometriosis and prescribed birth control to help ease symptoms. My current medication is only over-the-counter painkiller and doctor did not prescribe any medication as she felt it would not help me. I am considering switching from hormonal pill birth control to an IUD. I have researched on the internet and I would prefer a hormonal method because I have endometriosis. My heavier periods and cramps sound absolutely horrible. However, I have also read that a lot of women experience weight gain and moodiness with the hormonal methods, the two things I do not need in my life. Which method is better for me? I am 19 years old, moderately sexually active with a serious relationship, generally healthy (prone to colds and flus), no serious medical issues in the family aside from my endometriosis and no history of cancer or ectopic pregnancies.

Keeping your history in mind, it is suggested that possible endometriosis or PID which can be the cause of raised CA125 should be ruled out with a diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal lavage for culture and possible malignant cells (if any, ovarian). This is mandatory to justify rising CA125 levels which indicate epithelial ovarian cancer. Once that is clear, then you should ideally opt for IVF- ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) procedure with wife ovum and husband sperm pre-genetic implantation diagnosis (PGD) of the embryo to rule out any age-related congenital anomalies followed by embryo transfer and maintenance of pregnancy on progesterone support and IVF drugs. Considering that fibroids usually do not support IVF pregnancy but they are presently small and once implantation and growth occur, they shall thin out, so still best is IVF. If the cause of raised CA125 levels turns out to be malignant, then pregnancy should not be opted for and treatment for malignancy would take priority."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My wife has severe endometriosis as well as several other pre-existing conditions. She was recently approved for Zoladex to treat the endometriosis. She is supposed to have her first injection in the next few days. Today we were in the emergency room. She was slightly tachycardic as well as extremely low in iron and electrolytes. Turns out she is pregnant. We are already scheduled for further doctor visits in the next few days.She is 35 and has had several ectopic pregnancies as well as three miscarriages. She has never been able to carry longer than four months. We have tried a lot to help her be healthy and have a baby. Two years ago, we decided to stop trying - too much pain, physical and mental to go through again and again.She is certainly under four weeks. It could be false, we are getting more tests. Her ob-gyn is not the best. We will be seeking another. So, here are my questions.If she does not want to be pregnant, will the Zoladex terminate the pregnancy, or will she need to have a physical or chemical abortion first?If she does want to be pregnant, what are the dangers associated with Zoladex and pregnancy? Given that her endometriosis has advanced to her pancreas and other organs, is it even possible to carry to term? What are the chances of carrying to term?","Doctor":"Hello. Her menstrual, obstetrics, gynecological, medical, surgical, and drug history also should be described here to make things more clear. Her MRI or ultrasound report would be helpful for me to explain better. Zoladex is Goserelin acetate, that is, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist reduces sex hormone production and used in prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis, and breast cancer. It has side effects like hot flushes, impotence, mood changes, sleep disorder, vaginal dryness.etc. Normally, endometriosis symptoms should be better during pregnancy and in menopause. Injection Zoladex, I think not at all to be given in case of pregnancy as it is for sex hormones suppression. It can disturb pregnancy hormones as well and could be harmful in normal fetal development. Normally, if an infertile patient with endometriosis (mild to moderate) gets pregnant, her treatment stops and then whole concentration diverts to her pregnancy and its better management. But here, I really do not know which stage of endometriosis it is. You described till pancreas. Is this involved lymph nodes or having cancer effect? These are the most important questions in which further plan is based. If this endometriosis is not having any cancer signs and with effects of pregnancy it would get better and having pregnancy would be a blessing and will cure symptoms, then obviously all efforts would be for safe pregnancy and it management must in future. In case of cancerous element and if there is urgent need for chemotherapy or need to treat lymph nodes and other organs as you said involving pancreas then to have really clear and detailed look as either pregnancy would be in danger in that circumstances and could end up in miscarriage or could have harmful effect by disease inside patient's body and its treatment. So, endometriosis stage and pregnancy status should be clearly defined for further treatment. As in last stage of endometriosis (cancerous) stage, we need to treat the patient more intensely and could have an effect on pregnancy. But in earlier stages with no cancer element, it will regress endometriosis and would not need treatment for it, only to manage pregnancy would be the best option. I suggest Folic acid 0.4 mg daily now. And treat anemia if she can tolerate ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency. Do have a transvaginal scan and serum beta hCG two times with an interval of 48 hours to have a clear view of pregnancy either doing well or unhealthy pregnancy. (serum beta hCG should increase more than 66 % in 48 hours in case of healthy pregnancy. If it increases but suboptimal could have chances of ectopic or miscarriage). In case of failing pregnancy, God knows. It depends on how the body responds. If bleeds and expels itself or otherwise might need surgical or medical induced miscarriage. In case of healthy early pregnancy, she will need lots of precautions and complete treatment of her other issues like anemia and electrolytes as you mentioned.

I do not experience any eye pain. I have been to the ophthalmologist, and I had a lot of eye exams, everything is fine with my cornea. I do not have any dystrophies or keratoconus. My eye pressure is also normal 16 and 19 mm Hg, and everything is fine with my retina. So could you suggest what it could be?

My husband and I want to start trying to conceive. We had some tests done to know where we stand since I am not young, and I had a hysteroscopic myomectomy three years ago. Back then my doctor told me I had a couple of other fibroids inside the uterine walls, but his concern was only the one inside the uterine cavity which he removed. I got two different doctor opinions on my recent tests. Both agree I have two fibroids about 4 cm each inside my uterine wall, that my hormone levels are normal, my husband's sperm looks perfect, and they want to do surgery to remove the fibroids. However, on my HSG test, the lab stated that my right fallopian tube is good, did not mention the left, but on the X-ray, it seems to be blocked. No liquid went through. ' The first doctor was not concerned about the health of my tubes, only the fibroids. The second doctor said the right tube does not look fine, she saw it as distorted upwards and the ovary far away from it, plus one fibroid on each side of it. She thinks the fibroids are to blame for the distortion. My questions are, do fibroids affect the position of the fallopian tubes? Could this be corrected by removing them? Would it make sense to see unblocking options for the left tube? If my fallopian tubes are indeed damaged. Is there any point in having the surgery? Fibroids do not cause me any trouble otherwise.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to icliniq .com. 36 years is not old. Of course, pregnancy chances are higher before 35yrs, but ladies do get pregnant after that too. Fibroids distorting the uterine cavity or tube needs to be removed, also those which are near the implantation site of the embryo, they can cause the inadequate blood supply to the fetus.If fibroids are stretching the tubes thereby blocking the free flow of dye, they need to b removed. Another option, instead of going for removal is IVF. If fibroids are close to the sides of the uterus, removal may interfere with the blood flow to ovaries, thereby reducing the egg number. Surgery will need cauterization of bleeders, which will reduce the blood flow. So at 36 years, you will not want to reduce eggs number further. If the cavity of the uterus is normal, IVF would be good.Do not worry about the fibroids pulling away tubes from ovaries. Even if you ovulate on the blocker side, the egg will swim or will b pulled to the opposite side.

Passing motion too often is a normal phenomenon in neonates (gastrocolic reflex). Make sure baby is passing adequate urine and playful. 2. Redness over the perianal region may be due to prolonged wetness over the part or due to cleaning the area by rubbing. Wear him a napkin and change immediately once wet, the purpose is to keep dry the perianal region as much as possible. Cleaning not to be done by rubbing, it can peel the skin. 3. Try to keep the perianal region dry, and you can apply Rashfree cream (Benzalkonium chloride, Zinc oxide) over the lesion. 4.

Like a reduced sense of smell, regular or recurrent discharge from the nose dripping into the throat? Nose block or running nose or sneezing or itching of eyes or nose or watering of eyes? Do you have any allergy? Do you stay at a polluted area and expose your self to harmful fumes or smoke or dust or pollen? Any seasonal or diurnal variation to your problems?

Couple it with an antihistamine like Allegra (Fexofenadine) or Claritin (Loratidine) taken once daily in the evening. Take these two for two weeks and subsequently continue the sprays. Review with us after a week so that we can advise you further. You may require a CT scan of nose and PNS to check if there is any polyp or mucosal hypertrophy or nasal mass that is causing the problem. When you venture outside, try wearing a mask.

Derealization means when you have a sense that things around you are not real. A person may experience one or both of the above conditions. Feelings of depersonalization and derealization can be very disturbing and may feel like you are living in a dream. Many people have a passing experience of depersonalization or derealization at some point. But when these feelings keep occurring or never completely go away. It is considered depersonalization or derealization disorder. Depersonalization or derealization is more common in people who have traumatic experiences in life. Insufficient information to diagnose the disorder. The best treatment for depersonalization or derealization disorder is talk therapy (psychotherapy), although sometimes medications also are used to treat anxiety related to this condition. If you find yourself experiencing a similar kind of experiences, I have elaborated above then you are strongly recommended to seek treatment from a clinical psychologist after your complete psycho-diagnostic assessment. Delay in treatment may worsen your problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My son is 1.8 years old. He is not munching the food. He is just swallowing food very difficultly. Food will not touch his teeth too. When he was eight months, I started to give all foods in pure form. I will grind all the vegetables and rice to give him. I feel like there I started my mistake. When he was one year, I began to give in solid form.But he is not munching just swallowing it. I have to mash all the solids foods with hand and give. Kindly help me. I am very worried about him. He fears too much, even for the biscuit. He will try to eat a cookie, but he will put it down then. Kindly let me know what should I do. He is not eating any snacks and chappathi.

She was attempting to stand up holding onto a chair, and when she quickly sat, her head firmly bumped the bottom of the portion of the chair which is made of metal. She cried immediately and vomited once but otherwise seemed fine and in a short time was back to play. From all, I read online, and the other family around there was no need to go to emergency.A few weeks later, I started to notice subtle changes. She developed a deep scowl that seemed to favor her left side where she hit. Also, the mark where she hit still came out when she was upset (it still does) and rubbing ensued. I took her into her Pediatrician and told him all three weeks after it happened. I Showed him pictures of the chair where she hit as well as images of her the day after and tried to explain the scowl, the rubbing, and just how I felt something was amiss.He assured me she had none of the symptoms associated with severe head trauma. Six months later and a few visits then all for the same thing I am still unsure and wish we could have look to make sure no tissue or other damage has been done. My question is, if internal damage was done to a vessel or two or a small fracture occurred, is it possible for the symptoms to be slight at this time and if there is a minor ever so slight bleed inside, could it take months if not years for visible signs to occur and irreversible damage to follow suit? Would it not then be too late? Should I push for cranial sonography or MRI?","Doctor":"Hello. The mark on eyebrow may be some superficial injury. Your kid is not having any symptom of deep brain injury. Your kid was back to play shortly after an injury. Did she have any headache or vomiting or weakness of one side of body or seizure? If not, she is unlikely to have any internal brain injury.Slight bleed inside brain/ small undisplaced fracture heal spontaneously and in the long term may or may not cause a seizure. Might be you are a very anxious mom. If you are much worried, you can go for MRI brain, if it comes out to be normal, your anxiety level will decrease. But if no such symptom in kid, there is no need for doing tests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 24-year-old male. I had six times protected sex with a prostitute. I had used a condom all the time, and it was not broken or slip off. At all the time, I used to do vaginal intercourse merely half a minute. After that, I remove my part and masturbate. I have not ejaculated inside. Then after masturbation, I used to remove my condom. But now I am worried about my status. In my scenario, may I have been infected with HIV? Please help me to get out of this guilt, and overthinking is killing me.","Doctor":"Hello. Even though there is a higher than normal incidence of HIV infection in workers in the sex trade, the fact that you used a condom, does make the risk that you contracted the HI Virus very low and unlikely. In my experience, however, I have found that patients will only truly relax or have their concerns completely alleviated when they have themselves tested. A rapid HIV test requires a very quick finger prick that can be done almost at any primary health care clinic, and results are available within a few minutes. This will give you documented proof of your status and is the only way to put your concerns at rest once and for all conclusively."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

I do not see any problem in your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your blood reports and scan are within normal limits.Ultrasound scan is done at this 11 to 14 weeks to find out the most common genetic abnormality of the baby- Down syndrome. 1. Your age first diagnoses this, usually, as you cross 35 years the risk increases. For your age of 25 years, the risk is, very low. It has been mentioned in your report too. 2. The Nuchal translucency is the skin thickness of the baby's neck. In babies with Down syndrome, there is increased thickness. Up to around 3.5 mm is normal. Your level is normal. 3. Blood tests are the serum levels of PAPP-A and beta hCG. They are altered in the Down syndrome. As you see the risk of these above 1:250 is normal. As your values are above 4000, chances of any abnormality is next to impossible. Even the blood flow in the essential vessels are normal, which rules out Down syndrome (also called Trisomy 21). The only problem is nasal bone is not seen, and this could be ignored. If you want you can have repeat scan seven days later, by a doctor specialized in high-risk obstetrics. But I do not think that single finding needs to be worried about.

You might want to visit an ophthalmologist or an optometrist instead, considering that the emergency doctors are not equipped with all the required diagnostic machines that can see minute things in the eye.

I was sent for an ultrasound needle biopsy, and blood test, and a pet test. I was told that I had follicular lymphoma stage 3. I was upset and in tears. My doctor told me, that follicular lymphoma, was a prolonged progressing cancer, and responded very well to chemotherapy.After all of these test, and verification, of what I had. My oncologist said, he would send me home, for three months, then at the next appointment, he would decide, on further test and or treatment. As the doctor said is that this cancer, and what do you think, about being sent home, for three months for a watch and wait.","Doctor":"Hello. So I would start by saying that follicular lymphoma is most common low grade lymphoma diagnosed in this age group. Incidentally detected lump is most common way in which follicular lymphoma presents, which was in your case. After histological confirmation staging is usually done with PET scan. Which shows stage III disease as per your query. Ideally I would like to know few things like, 1. Confirmation of stage and grade. 2. Any symptoms like fever or weight loss. 3. CBC (complete blood count) and liver renal functions. 4. Also report of pet CT to look for any bulky disease. Because in case of stage III or IV follicular lymphoma there are certain indications for treatment such as, ●Local symptoms due to progressive or bulky nodal disease ●Compromise of normal organ function due to progressive or bulky disease ●Presence of systemic B symptoms (ie, fevers, weight loss, night sweats) ●Presence of symptomatic extranodal disease, such as effusions ●Cytopenias due to extensive bone marrow infiltration, autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, or hypersplenism ●An increase in disease tempo (these are collectively called GELF criteria or BNLI criteria) If these indication are not fulfilled standard guidelines advice observation with follow up. In case physician feels some indications are borderline then usually decision is taken to follow up to see pace of disease and then take decision for need of treatment. If all these things are negative and I would say that decision for your follow up is ideal. If you have any further questions I would be happy to help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have been very stuck in the past few years. About four years ago, I was in a long term relationship with a boyfriend of mine. And during that time, I became sick and did not know what it was. Came to know that it was an STD (chlamydia). I was cleared after being in the hospital for two days. I have recently been with my current boyfriend for four years now and soon to be engaged.We have tried conceiving, and nothing works. I believe I may be infertile due to what happened to me, but I did not think so at first because I thought the doctors during my hospital visit would have explained that something else was wrong. I have not gone to the gynecologist yet nor have got my concern about this checked because I am terrifyingly nervous of the outcome as I know it is severe. I need some help on any natural remedies if this is the case.","Doctor":"Hello. Chlamydia is an infection which appears very mild and may be asymptomatic, but the damage it causes is quite extensive. The main risk is of damage to the inner lining of tubes and also the structures surrounding the uterus. It can create a block to the movement of the sperm, egg, and embryos.As you have been treated in the hospital, the infection has been handled thoroughly and adequately. You can find out if there has been any damage to the tubes, the bridge between ovary and uterus, where the egg and sperm meet to form an embryo. Either have an HSG (hysterosalpingography, X-ray with dye) or laparoscopy to clear any adhesions. If this path is clear, then there is nothing to worry, and you will surely get pregnant. Quality and quantity of eggs are affected by these infections. At this age of 20 years, you can get pregnant. There could be many other reasons for no pregnancy. 1. Have your partner's semen, blood sugar tested. 2. Have your blood sugar, and thyroid tested. 3. Has an abdominal and pelvic scan done to rule out any abnormalities? Out of these tubal patencies is most important. Worst scenario if the tube is blocked, it needs to be cleared by hysteroscopic tubal cannulation, or if the damage is not correctable, then IVF (in-vitro fertilization) is the solution. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have my braces for three or four weeks I suppose to get spikes because my tongue thrusting I was wondering do I get the spikes when I go to my next visit? When will do I get the rubber bands and power chain? I hope you can tell me some more information I am looking forward to.","Doctor":"Hello. The time at which the tongue crib appliance is placed is usually in earlier visits at the start of treatment. However, this decision depends on a multitude of factors, along with your orthodontist treatment approach. It varies with each orthodontist. Also, elastics and e-chain are used for many different purposes like correction of bite, closing spaces, aiding in alignment, retraction, etc. So again, it depends on what tooth movement your teeth require. The simplest way of knowing is to ask your orthodontist for these details."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 15-year-old boy, from the past week I am having constipation, my stool is very soft, but it is difficult to pass, I read about these symptoms in, and they said this is signs of colorectal cancer, I am very scared, I went to my doctor he said there is nothing to worry, he just touched my stomach.

And I need to struggle to remove stool, but it either comes our in balls, loose of sometimes slightly thin and extended.","Doctor":"Hello. You are suffering from constipation. It is not colorectal cancer. There is nothing to worry about. Follow these instructions for one week, and you will be completely cured. 1. Continue using Skilax (Sulfolax) for one week. 2. Eat a diet rich in fibers like carrots, green leafy vegetables, and legumes. 3. Avoid meat as it increases constipation. 4. Drink at least seven glasses of water in a day. 5. Do brisk walking at least for 30 minutes every day. 6. Drink one glass of warm water on an empty stomach in the morning. 7. Do not eat junk or processed foods. Follow this strictly for one week. I hope that helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a CT scan done of my sinuses. I would like a second opinion as to the severity of the findings and the best next step if you think that is needed.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you are a 66-year-old woman with runny nose problem and headaches, worsened over last few years, been there ever since you moved to new place. Your CT scan suggests there is some inflammatory changes in the sinuses (the exact sinuses as described in the report) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Based on your CT report, I cannot conclusively give you any suggestion as to what has to be done for solving your problem. But what I can tell you is how things can be alleviated, what plan of management can be thought upon, what other things you need to tell us, what else to observe for you to be watchful. I would like to know if you suffer from any of the following, if so then the duration, any worsening recently. Nose block, reduced sense of smell, post-nasal drip, foul smell in mouth (bad breath), facial pressure or brow pain, cough, asthma, wheezing, breathing difficulty.  Next, did your scan centre give you the relevant cuts of the CT scan? The film I mean. If you can upload the CT films it will be great. Reason: the report of the radiologist is based on his radiological practice which is far from the clinical practise. Whether these findings are significant or warrant an aggressive action will depend on an ENT specialists assessment of the films. For the same, I request you to send me the CT films if that is possible. If you were to come to me, I would do a nasal endoscopy in office after local decongestant and anesthetic spray to look for any frank congestion, mucus, pus, enlarged turbinates, anatomical abnormalities, mucosal abnormalities, deviated nasal septum, allergic signs, etc. At the very outset, I would keep the Cetrizine (Zyrtec) intact with an additional Montelukast (Singulair) component. I would put you on Flonase (Mometasone or Fluticasone) nasal spray. The spray has to be taken in a particular way, mind it. Can help you with regards to that if you need help. Whether to go for a conservative management (medicines, sprays, steroids) or a surgical one (endoscopic sinonasal surgery) would depend on the endoscopy and CT correlated with your detailed history. At least I would be able to point to a proper plan of action then. If there are polyps, we would like to bring them down with a course of steroids (oral, provided you are not diabetic or hypertensive, are you?) and then reassess with sprays and eventually may need surgery. If there is deviated nasal septum, that would also need a surgery (can be done with sinus surgery together). If there is any anatomical blockage of sinuses which will not be addressed by medicines, then again surgery.  For long term management of the issues, we need to rule out allergy. A skin prick test is useful for that. You would need Zyrtec, anti-allergics and nasal sprays even after surgery to prevent recurrence. However, your quality of life would be much better with a surgery if that is indicated. Symptoms to watch out for are severe pain, proptosis of eyes, loss of vision, bleeding from nose, severe sudden nose block, etc. Do revert back to us with more details and shall guide you on what has to be done. As such with the limited information available with the CT report, I would not go for surgery now."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

If possible forward few clear pictures of the bump to help you through precisely."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Yesterday I had my ultrasound, and there is a small cystic lesion of size approx 5.4 mm x 3.4 mm seen in the left lateral ventricle said to be choroid plexus cyst and I am anxious. What should I do? Please advise whether I should terminate or wait till next sonography.","Doctor":"Hello. For your information, a choroid plexus cyst is not considered a structure or functional brain abnormality. Most of these cysts are isolated and occur in otherwise low-risk pregnancies. The only association of some significance between a solitary choroid plexus cyst and the possible fetal problem is with trisomy 18. For this, when these cysts are found in sonography, we go for the next examinations, the detailed fetal anatomic survey should be performed by an experienced provider. Should run a thorough examination of the fetal heart, which includes four chamber view and outflow tracts view. Plus of the hands, clenching or another abnormal positioning. If no other abnormalities present, the choroid plexus cyst is considered isolated. So, to me should not rush, but wait for a complete fetal examination of sonography tests. Discuss this further with your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a history of miscarriage at 18 weeks, and hysteroscopy and laparoscopy confirmed cervical incompetence and my polypoidal endometrium was removed. Recently I conceived again with follicle test procedure during which CG 10000 was injected into my blood, but unfortunately, I had to undergo D and C at eight weeks because of no sign of fetal pole (no yolk sac and heartbeat). My TSH value is 7.44. Please let me know the cause of my first miscarriage and lack of proper development and absence of fetal pole in a second pregnancy. Which is the exact specialty which would be best placed for resolving my problem?","Doctor":"Hello. It is evident by the history that you have cervical incompetence, and that is what the possible cause of your mid-second-trimester spontaneous abortion. Nextly your TSH (stimulating thyroid hormone) levels are high, qualifying you to be hypothyroid, which is the probable cause of anembryonic gestation, the second time. It is essential that your TSH levels should be rough between 2.8 to 3.2 by taking thyroxine supplementation to attain safe levels for conception and avoid future mishaps. Also, it has to be kept in mind that at 16 to 18 weeks of your next gestation, cervical McDonalds or shirodkar stitch has to be applied to the cervix to avoid spontaneous mid-second-trimester abortion. I hope I have answered your query."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 15-year-old female, and I have put something inside my private area, and when I took it out, it started bleeding.

If the bleeding is minimal, which may be due to mild abrasion, that will subside usually. If the bleeding is persistent, better to consult your gynecologist once, get examined to find out the exact problem, and take treatment accordingly.

I have had some massages previously, which reduces the pain temporarily, but the pain comes back. I was wondering if a chiropractor could help as maybe something needs an alignment?","Doctor":"Hello. As with history, I can speculate that you are having trapezius. As the pain around the shoulder blade is due to the inflammation of the insertion of the trapezius muscles. As per my clinical practice of I do not think that dry needling and massage are the more extended term relief. I will advise that you should do hot water fermentation over the upper back and neck region. Post that, myofascial release, correction of the posture, and strengthening of the trapezius muscles.  This issue is commonly arising due to bad posture and the cervical spine IVDP (intervertebral disc prolapse). But for the cervical spine IVDP we need an MRI to understand the nature of the soft tissue injury. I understand that doing hot water fermentation, myofascial release, correction of posture and trapezius strengthening has helped my patients relief of the pain. I request you to look for one and let us see after a week. I assume things should get correct soon with the mentioned treatment plan. Regarding the chiropractor, I do not think it is needed for now so soon. If you have any more queries, please feel free to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is 28 years old.

I have gone through your query and can understand your concern for her health. As you have given every possible analgesic and the pain is not relieved, I think the hemorrhoid has strangulated.

Also, I suggest her apply Diltiact gel (Diltiazem) over the anal area and inside the anus with finger twice daily. I suggest you to consult a surgeon as soon as possible to avoid any complication. She may need some intervention. Also, I suggest you try sitz bath. Take a tub and add warm water in it and a few drops of Dettol. Tell her to sit in that tub for about 20 minutes.

The lymphocyte count are usually high in children. So you may need not to worry about lymphocytes count. But the hemoglobin level of your child is definitely low suggestive of anemia. It could be nutritional anemia or hemolytic anemia like cause. I suggest you do further work up for anemia with serum ferritin, serum iron, peripheral smear examination, and USG abdomen.

You seem to have gained a lot of weight for your age. This is one of the major reason for not growing taller. Children who are overweight are often seen to stop growing taller earlier than others and this is particularly true for girls. Also, you may have acquired your mother's genes in terms of height.

Since Microbiota (pooled microorganisms in your gut) is completely different from the other person and For one to know what range of microbiota is present in your gut; you have to get it tested by giving a fresh stool sample and ask for stool mapping for microbiota. Once you have report in hand Anybody can tell which good bacteria are short and should be replaced and which bad bacteria are present to be removed. Actually there is no specific regimen of probiotics developed to empirically replace with probiotics. studies has largely seen Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium longum subsp longum, and other lactibacillus species such Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and B. longum all work well. But there is no single capsule that can fit all. You have to take a probiotics which can anticipate and fullfil your need. The one which I commonly prescribe is Ecotec twice daily beside good diets including fruits green vegetables and yougurt. Avoid use of antibiotics as possible as can. The probiotic use comes after a good healthy diets and avoidance of antibiotics commonly used for common infecion of gut and flu.

I never had milia before and all my laboratory work is good. Please share your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. Milia are a white material containing papule type lesions that mainly presents over the face. Milia are due to sun exposure. Long term sunlight exposure cause sweating and mild sunlight reaction and in turn form milia. If you notice the area, then you will come to know it is always present over sun exposed part only like face, hand, neck and forehead. For further prevention, use proper sunscreen with 50 SPF (sun protection factor). Sunscreen should be applied in daylight before going outside twice or thrice in a day. I want to make you sure that after removal of milia no marks will be left. I do it on a daily basis and almost every day. It should be extracted by small needle and it is not a time taking, painful or complicated procedure. Milia is very superficial lesion so even if it is removed manually by needle or extractor they do not leave any scar or marks. So, you can go for it without any anxiety or anxiousness.

So, I started doing that while urinating and pooping. I was all right for the next 10 days. But, I was studying once, and I had to breathe on my own manually. I get conscious about my breathing. I am fine when I am engrossed in watching the television, hanging out with my friends or busy at class. But, when I am alone studying, urinating or pooping, I am aware of my breathing, and I have to breathe on my own manually.

It is good that you have elaborated your problem. Now, let me start from the beginning. You said that you had a urinary tract infection (UTI). That causes an incomplete emptying of your bladder. If your urine emptying is not complete even now, then I suggest you take tablet Norflox 400 mg, two tablets, one in the morning and one at night after food for a week. Now, coming to the breathing problem, you have got yourself used to it. I advise you to play loud music in the adjacent room when you visit the loo for urinating and pooping.

Firstly, visit a proctologist to see if your canal has shrunk, thereby preventing the complete passing of stools. Then take syrup Cremaffin (milk of magnesia and liquid paraffin), half a tablespoon before bedtime. It will allow you to pass stools well. You only develop the breathing problem when alone, which is a clear indication that you are just anxious about it. Hence, I gave you tablet Anxit 5 mg before sleep for a week. For more assurance, you can take counseling from a psychologist who will provide you the necessary anti-anxiety therapy. You can get a chest X-ray and a laryngoscopy done. In the meantime, if you feel too breathless, take tablet Asthalin (Salbutamol) 2 mg once a day for five days.

Is it safe?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for attaching the pictures. Now I can answer your query in detail: This clinical picture represents a case of 'Nursing Bottle Caries'. That means, kids who take milk feed while sleeping or have the habit of keeping feeder in mouth for long and then sleep without brushing develop this type of caries in upper four anteriors; because of the bacterial colonization, which starts at that surface of tooth during night time. And we can see only those 4 teeth are affected where the feeder rests or cleaning is not done properly, and the rest are fine. This was the diagnosis. Now let me tell you about treatment options: 1. If cavities are not deep and kid has no history of severe pain or swelling then they can be simply restored through fillings. 2. If cavities are deep or tooth colour is changed to brown or black, kid is giving history of pain and tenderness over particular tooth then medicines regime is given as first line of defense. And in this case if the symptoms go away after 3 or 5 days course that is good and 70% chances are that infection has gone away and will not recur. Meanwhile you need to concentrate on brushing habits, not leaving feeder in mouth for long and brushing or rinsing before going to sleep. 3. If symptoms have become severe or even after following the medicines for a week symptoms of pain, swelling in gums or tenderness recur then we will proceed to RCT (i.e named as 'pulpotomy or pulpectomy' in pedodontics, after evaluating the x-ray of teeth) The answer to your questions: (Answer 1- Yes, Pulpotomy (Modified RCT for kids) can be done on 2.5 year old.) (Answer 2- Pulpotomy is a very delicate procedure and pedodontists do it very carefully keeping in mind that they do not hurt the buds of permanent teeth lying below these milk teeth. So do not worry if your dentist is good,the next permanent teeth will not get affected through this procedure).  (Answer 3- No, there is no alternative for this treatment as you can see it is already the last stage or third line of defense to save the tooth.. I know very well kids of age 2-5 are least co-operative. So there are two options left for these conditions:Option 1)  GA(General Anaesthesia) - This is best, as less time will be consumed, work will be done properly without any chances of mishap. Option 2) In some cases where parents do not want to go through GA phase, they are recommended to follow the medicine course whenever symptoms occur. However this is NOT a permanent solution or treatment. (For eg: The kid is given medicines, symptoms get subsided for 2 months then recur, and again same medicine course is given then symptoms get subsided for next 3 months and so on till the kid reach the age 5). From 5 till 7 years of age permanent incisors are expected to erupt, so we want to keep these milk incisors till 5 in place for better alignment of permanent teeth. Typically the patients who cannot afford for GA facility usually go for the second option. (Answer 4- GA(General Anaesthesia) is safe. And no any big complication is reported ever for such cases so you do not need to worry. Be sure your anaesthetist is good and the procedure will go smooth.  Before ending up I would like to share my diagnosis that can be considered as half as I need x-ray of all upper 4 incisors to give final word. Anyways, Just by seeing clinical picture, I think only front 2 incisors need RCT rest 2 does not look deeply infected, there is not much colour change. I do not know about pain symptoms that can be checked clinically. Ask your dentist to re-evaluate, or if you can show me picture of x-ray of your kid then I will confirm the diagnosis online -->  make your son brush teeth after taking feed and before sleeping :)"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I am currently paranoid about HIV. Recently, I had an encounter in a massage parlor, where the masseur gave a full body massage with a handjob. I never had sex, this is the closest thing I have come to sex. When she massaged my penis, I felt her hand quite rough, not sure if she had any cuts. She was fully clothed and I was naked. No vaginal, anal, oral, mouth kissing involved. Am I at risk of HIV? Based on your experience, have you come across anyone, who is positive due to handjob? I have consulted a local GP after a day of exposure. He told there was no risk whatsoever and told no need of testing. According to him, no one was infected with HIV through masturbation in any situation, in 40 years of this epidemic. He refused PEP prescription as well. I just wanted a second opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection does not spread through masturbation. As described in your case, there is no risk of acquiring HIV. A handjob is not considered an exposure, thus ruling out the chance for any STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). You could relax totally and let go of your fears of HIV. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) would not be needed for you.

Four days ago, I learned I had tonsil stones when I coughed up about 10 (no photos provided). I went to the doctor and she said it was because of a virus causing me to produce more mucus than normal. I was given a medicine and took it and the mucus amount went down a lot and I started feeling better and thought my tonsil stones were gone. However today, I coughed up two more. So, I decided to see if there were any I did not find on my previous visit, so I could make sure there were none left. I ended up removing 22 tonsil stones (photos provided to prove I am not exaggerating). While removing one, my tonsil started bleeding. I am not even sure if they are all out since I got the majority of those from one side of my mouth and my throat has hurt after both times I have gotten them out. Anyway, my question is, is there a possibility my sinus issues are linked to my tonsil stones, and would an ENT help me remove them since I have so many? Is there a possibility I have tonsillitis?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand you want to know if your tonsil and sinus problems are related.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

She now has the most significant possible VP shunt in her brain, and recently (a couple of weeks ago) had a bleed after surgery, but that has been treated now, and she is going well.The client also has uncontrollable absence seizures, a chromosomal disorder, intellectual disability, connective tissue issues, hand deformity, and recently diagnosed tuberous sclerosis (skin and possibly in the brain). The client's mother would like me to complete a funding application for them to get a hospital bed at home, as the daughter (client) is currently sleeping upright with pillows.She said sleeping upright helps the shunt drain. I have not been able to find any research around this, and have also read about something that says over drainage can be an issue. Did you have any thoughts about this issue? Or if it is really client specific and I do need to contact her neurologist or neurosurgeon.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your question carefully and would explain the upright position (head of the bed 45 degrees) can help reduce the intracranial pressure. So, I agree with the patient that she feels better in this position. Regarding the medication, I would recommend Diamox and Furosemide to help reduce intracranial pressure. An anti-epilepsy drug is also needed for her seizures. I would suggest Valproate or Levetiracetam. I hope you will find this answer helpful.

I'd really appreciate if you could help me","Doctor":"Hello,The private area where you get spots / boils is due to warmth and moisture. Keep the area between the balls and the inner thighs clean and dry. Bacteria (staph aureus) or fungus have the tendency to grow in the moist and warm areas. However, people who have this infection can spread it with skin to skin contact or contaminated towels, bed sheets, clothes, etc.Make sure that the natural skin barrier is not broken with some kind of injury or friction. Inner thighs are areas where friction occurs due to rubbing of the skin(if obese), exercising, running, etc. Wear loose fitting cotton clothes, avoid sex for a couple of days. You can apply Bactroban (mupirocin) ointment after cleaning the area affected. If its fungus (ring worm infection), then you can apply clotrimazole or miconazole cream inn the area affected & take a course of anti fungals (fluconazole) orally.Take care.

As a young man, I used to masturbate a lot and it was after one such session that I started feeling disorders in my scrotum till it developed to these movements. When the movements are on I actually see the scrotum sack move as well and if I put my finger under the scrotum I actually feel the movements like one is hold some worms in his hand which are sort of ?struggling to escape?, that kind of feeling. Over the years I have been consulting General Practitioners who would tell me that my condition was normal and there was really nothing to worry about. However some would prescribe me amitriptyline for a couple of months, but this never really helped by situation. Now over the years I have developed a very bad odour coming from my genitals which I suspect could be linked to this problem. I have often thought perhaps the scrotum skin is so ?worn out? (though it does not look so) that it now stinks. Now I worry more about the odour than the movements as they are not painful as such. The odour makes it quite difficult for me to freely mix with people and this is worse in my professional circles. Just last year I went to consult a urological surgeon who advised me that I had varicoselectomy that is why I feel the wormlike movements. He said to correct that I needed to undergo a minor operation which I did, but to no avail. I have also consulted a dermatologist about the odour, but so far the prescriptions I got from him have not really helped my situation either. I need your assistance please!","Doctor":"Hello,It may be due to varicocoele. For further assessment you may require ultrasound scrotum after surgeon consultation.

Do not worry about it. This happens especially when person suffers from constipation or passes hard stools. When you apply pressure, hard stool gives pressure on prostate gland and seminal vesicles, causing this fluid to come out.

The Doppler showed left sided varicocele and also a small epiididyman cyst there also. Is there anything else I can do, Thank You.","Doctor":"Hi, what is your age? Your burning could be due to the Varicocele. We usually operate on Varicoceles if the patient comes to us for Infertility or inability to bear children due to low sperm count.

I don t have this anywhere else on my penis, just literally where I cut it, its a very small area. I m a white male at 5 ft 11 and weigh 12 stone","Doctor":"With the history of cutting the frenulum it is probably the healing shown by granulation tissue in the damaged area which can bleed easily.

Once in a while, the trauma of intercourse does help in that the area is replaced by a thicker fibrous scar that does not bleed, but quite often, such patients might need a simple procedure called 'frenuloplasty' or maybe even a circumcision."},{"Patient":"For my high blood pressure, I am taking medicines for the last 15 years; I'm 66 year old.

Thanks for posting your query. Too much masturbation can't cause any detrimental effects to your penis and doesn't really lead to a decrease in the size of the penis. However it can make you extremely fatigued and lead to a premature ejaculation. If you're healthy, without any chronic medical disorder, for example, diabetes, you don't have to be worried about the size. Its better you avoid any sexual activity or masturbation for couple of weeks and then look for improvement. If it is still not getting resolved, you need to get a health check up to find out if anything is wrong with you.Hope that answers your query.Regards"},{"Patient":"So I have a burning sensation when i pee, discharge and when i flex my penis sometimes it hurts all this start to happen 2 days ago.

Many patients keep shifting from doctor to doctor with little or no improvement. You can try taking medication like Pregabalin, Tramadol and acetaminophen combination for pain, and wear a scrotal support. It is unlikely that the pain is due to the cysts which are present in many men with no issues.If the pain is really troubling you and reducing the quality of life, you can approach a urologist for a trial of cord block, and see if symptoms get better. If they do, you will be a candidate for micro-denervation of scrotal nerves with good relief in a significant percentage of patients."},{"Patient":"hi, i have a curved penise towards the left , it is very obvious and make an angle of around 40 deg from straight, also 2 months back i got swelling and pain in my left testicle , when swelling went away i found that my left testicle has become rock hard with pain in it but in 4 days it got normal bt i still feel if a little heavy and it hangs like a ball without any relation with rest of the parts. in my childhood once i was hit on my testicle while playing since then i feel weakness in it and now i feel it is because of that . your suggetion r welcome i also feel that i ejaculate too early in 1 minute. should i marry or not .","Doctor":"Hello, First of all nothing to worry about curved penis since it is normal.

I am doing bodybuilding for the past 1 year. 6 months a ago I felt pain in my left testicle and the very next day I went to the Urologist . He examined my testicles physically and then advised me to have a scrotal ultrasound . An early varicocles on the left side was found in ultrasound. He advised my to wait and see if the pain still exist then a surgery have to be done to correct it. I waited for 4 months and fortunately the pain has gone but there is another problem occurred and that is when I urinate, I feel pain on the right of my testicle. I feel pain only when my bladder is full and after I urinate. Again I went to the same Urologist and told him the situation. He ask me to do two test: Urine and UTI . I did both tests. Urine test was ok and in the UTI test, my bladder wall was found thick due to infection or inflammation. As per my reports, I undergo some antibiotic treatment for 1 week. The problem has gone now, no pain on either of the testicles. After two months of my above mentioned tests, I have been advised by the doctor to have a semen analysis . and the report is as follows: Volume: 4 ML Colour: Grayish White Viscosity: Normal Reaction: ALKALINE Liquifacation Time: 30 Mins Normal Forms: 70% - Oval Forms Abnormal Forms: 30% Pus Cells: 6-8 / hpf Sperm Agglutination - Present MOTILITY: Active after 1/2 hours: 30% Sluggish after 1/2 hours: 40% Non-Motile after 1/2 hours: 30% The doctor saw this report and said Your report is good but it is still advisable to have a surgery to treat varicoceles, Puss cells are there but no need to have another antibiotic treatment cos you already had it once to UTI infection Need your advice here.","Doctor":"Ok. great description of your problem. Do you have any problem presently? What is the total sperm count per ml in the report - I did not find it here, Your sperm report is near normal. I dont think you need any treatment at all - no medicines and no surgery. There is no need for Varicocele surgery if it does not cause any problems like a low sperm count which I cannot establish in absence of absolute count.

Veltam is a reasonably good rug in that it will help your father avoid retention of urine, especially if it has been combined with Dutasteride. Importantly, your father might be feeling he is voiding urine well, but the correct estimate of how well he is voiding is to get a test called Uroflowmetry done, followed by an estimate of post-void residue in bladder. If the flow is poor or if the residue is very high,he could still benefit from endoscopic prostate surgery which is, under normal circumstances, a very simple procedure."},{"Patient":"Hello My Name is Yasir My age is 28 I am suffering from night fall from last 8 years i used all kinds of medication but it was not cured now i am using clomfranil tablet at night before sleep and my night fall has stopped please guide me should i continue to use it","Doctor":"Night fall is a common issue among young adults, especially if you are not used to self stimulation and masturbation. By itself it is harmless, and I would personally suggest that you need not use any medicine for it. But if you really are insistent on using a drug, Clofranil is good but has its side-effects. You should not abruptly discontinue it. Day time sedation can be a problem in some patients. Before you withdraw from the medicine, please consult the doctor who has prescribed you this and see if he can taper the drug slowly. Night fall is likely to come down once you have regular intercourse."},{"Patient":"hi i am 32 years old and i got married last September 2011. last month i tested my semen analyses .the result is 50% active motility and there are 8 to 10 pus cells. i want know the problems that rises due to the pus cells, precautions to prevent the pus cells in my semen, and what should i do for my batter sexual, physical, and mental health","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for writing to HCMYour semen analysis report suggests infection.Infection is indicated by the presence of pus cells in semen.

Thanks Rohit Kumar (MP) INDIA","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  I do not understand from which website you got that wrong information. Let me clarify.1. Nocturnal emission happens when the body wants to emit the produced semen because semen is a waste product. Semen is produced whenever you are sexually aroused. Such produced semen is a waste product. If you do not engage in sexual activities or masturbation for a week or so, body finds its own way to expel the semen. One way is through nocturnal emission and another is through urine. Very much a normal process body adopts. 2. Semen is produced by testicles. You are ill informed. Production of sperm cells are not at all a tiring or health wasting or losing hormones process. They all are myth. Don't fall prey to such information and get anxious.3. You are worried about the nocturnal emission problem and you are anxious and obsessive about that. That is why you are having this premature ejaculation. Forget sexual problems. Forget Nocturnal ejaculation. Forget masturbation.  Just show love and passion to your wife and your problem is solved.If you require more of my help in this aspect,Please post a direct question to me in this website.

Ive been to several urologists and done all tests and all Urologist say im normal and i should go on daily cialis. I have done that and did not work with me.. cialis viagra and livrta dont work for me and i dont know why! I had an penile injection and had a full erection. I have been using face down masturbation since i was a child and i cannot reach to orgasm only by this way.

Please advise me on what step i should take next?","Doctor":"HelloLet me explain about sexual orgasm , penis size, erection , premature ejaculation.As you mentioned that you are doing masturbation since childhood .Viagra, livrta, cialis , all these drugs are nor working but injection causes erection .This means there is no defect in brain or hormone or in penis .As you mentioned that different urologist don't find any disease .In my opinion sexual orgasm reaches its climax when there is discharge both partners.Size of penis varies from 10-15 cm in full erection .Premature ejaculation means discharge at once within 2 minute in all sexual activities ( including fore play also ).As far as about you , in my opinion you are perfectly alright .This is a psychological problem , so consult a psychiatrist and get his opinion.Good luck."},{"Patient":"My penis and scrotum has become sticky.

It can be a route to safer sex, to help prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. It allows for sexual pleasure for those who are not ready to engage in vaginal, anal or oral sex.It allows people to become familiar and comfortable with their body. For men, it can help them increase ejaculatory control and manage rapid or delayed ejaculation. There are no harmful side effects of masturbation. Medical science has debunked many myths formally associated with masturbation, such as hair growing on the palms, insanity, or that masturbation will drain excessive energy from the body or wrinkles on face.Sperm is produced daily in your body and excess masturbation may delay ejaculation and also quantity of ejaculation will also be less. But this will be recovered once an individual reduces the frequency of masturbation.Masturbation is a healthy sexual behavior. Like other behaviors, when over practiced or addicted, it can lead to both psychological and physiological imbalances. Acceptable frequency of masturbation is 3 to 4 times per week and it is again subjective. If you masturbate daily and it is disturbing your daily routine then it is better to come out of that habit.Try these methods:1. Avoid being lonely2. Avoid watching porn if you have habit of watching3. Develop new hobbies4. Play outdoor games5. Practice some meditation techniques6.

About 1 months ago suddenly I started feeling pain in the RIGHT testicle in the back part or epididymis.I immdeiately consulted an FCPS surgeon who gave me anti biotics Augmintin 625 mg for five days and pain killers but the pain did not stop.Then I went to another sugeon who continued same antibiotics for 3 more days and adivised scrotum ultasound.I used medicines for 3 more days and had scrotum ultrasound but its reports are normal and the pain persists.After that I consulted 2 urologists and 2 general physicians but all of them said that there is nothing serious and did not prescribe any medicine. RECENT PROBLEM: Now here I am with pain in epididymis of both testicles which sometimes radiates into cord that leads to seminal vesicals.Sometimes I feel epididymis of testicles burning and sometimes very warm.I also have another problem that since last 10 years a very tiny stone is formed in left kidney,passes through ureter injuring it and into the urninary bladder and causing some bleeding in urine.It happens every second or third month.But I am not very much concerned about it because it eventually has to pass out.I am mentioning it just here to know if it has anything to do with testicles pain becuase when there is pain in ureter the pain in testicle increases. When I had pain only in one testicle (left) my sex desire or libido and errection was ok but now I feel it decreased very much.Now the semen on discharge is little and thin in quality Now I am seriously conerned and want you to please help me get rid of this pain and also suggest right combination of medicines for 1.thin semen 2.decreased libido 3.complete errection and 4.premature ejaculation P.S: I am also worried about another problem that my penis size is not good and it is harldy 3.5 inch (three and half inch) when fully erect.Pls tell me if it is enough to satisfy my would-be wife and can I increase penis length in this age?

About 6 years ago I had a chronic throat infection problem and after 10 months of being on anti biotics and many different tests, I started to develop yeast infections.  Common for anti biotic use.  My tonsils were removed and I havent had any more throat infections.  Until last winter I hadnt had any more yeast infections. I got a yeast infection for what I believe to be the cause of me trying new soap and I didnt wash it off properly, cause I was not sexually active.  I bought monistat applied it and with in days it was gone.  Then this summer I received another one, again not sexually active.  I bought monistat and it was cured.  Then this winter about 2 months ago I got another one, again not being sexually active.  I got rid of it but then I had a mole on my face that was infected and I was put on antibiotics and a week after the anitbiotics were done I received another yeast infection.  I applied monistat for a week as I have always done, and this time I cant get it to go away.  Everytime I think its gone it comes back.  However now it seems to be getting worse.  I went to my doctor last week and he gave me Lotriderm.  I applied it as perscribed for a week and no difference.  So I went back today and he told me my sugar blood test from a week ago came back normal, my STD tests even though Im not currently active came back normal.

These instances are fairly normal, are common & can happen with any couple. But because of his status of a testicular cancer survivor; these instances might have caused stress/pressure on him with subsequent assumption of ''spectator'' role where rather than enjoying sex; he is unconsciously more preoccupied with how he is performing etc. & hence getting these symptoms. You (both as couple) should get yourself evaluated by a Urologist followed by a Psychiatrist for management of this issue.

Masturbation is natural and normal and even animals do masturbate. But it should be under control. At your age of 18, you can masturbate up to one time a day. Decrease it to thrice a week gradually. Of course masturbating is tiresome.  That is the reason why you are feeling tired and the stress related to your masturbation habit makes you loose your hair and concentration.

I suggest you not to worry much. The viscosity of the semen is determined by so many factors including water intake, mental state while having sex, stress rate, physical debility, time of the sex etc. Means there are lot of factors which determines the thickness of semen. You just see whether it has the capacity to produce children. Unnecessary worrying about sexual matters induce sexual anxiety which inturn causes sexual debility and weakness. this could be reason for your dark circle under eyes. Do consult a psychologist.Thoughts are there to come and that is the duty of the brain. let the thoughts come. You need to divert the thoughts to more priority ones.

The area where you have the irritation is one of the commonest areas were fungal infections are found. It's easy to control and kill them but it's pretty difficult to prevent recurrent infections in future. If you visit a Skin specialist he will prescribe Clotrimazole ointment which you can apply in the morning and at bed time. Wash the area with warm water and soap and dry the area before applying the ointment. This will get rid of the infection in 2 to 3 days. But the problem is the fungal spores which will be present in all your undergarments and towels or whatever clothes that comes into contact with it. Those spores can cause reinfections 2 to 3 weeks later. I usually suggest my patients to get rid of their old undergarments and buy new ones. If you still want to use old ones, then boil them in water for 15 minutes, put them in sun and later iron them especially in the folds. Same can be done with towels as well.

The reason I am stressing these is that there are other molecules like Apomorphine which have been claimed to help men achieve erections which are just not that effective, and also can cause nausea, or worse such a severe sedation that your hubby might just drop off to sleep rather than take interest in making love.Let him read this, and if you have issues to discuss, i will be glad to help you."},{"Patient":"hi ...in my husband semen analysis report : sperm count: 10 millions/ml rapid progressive motility : 10% slow progressive motility : 10% non motile sperms : 80% morphology normal forms : 80% giant forms : 05% double heads : 05% constricted heads : 10% microscopy pus cells : 8-10/hpf epithelial cells : 1-2/hpf rbc - nil viscosity : normal volume : 2ml liquifaction : normal reaction/ph : alkaline 8.0 He is taking ubipheme and maxoza from 3 months.....what are the chances of improvement of spems by this medicine..........","Doctor":"Hi,The chances of sperm count improving will depend on the problem which has caused it to be low in the first place. For example, if his testes had a damage due to oxinats, taking maxoza could help. likewise, if his count is low with a low stimulus from the brain with low FSH ( hormone from the pituitary gland in the brain), his sperm count could go up with Ubiphene.I suggest you ask your husband to get an ultrasound examination of scrotum and a serum FSH, (preferably at 8 AM) if not done earlier.

I suggest you not to worry much. I can see your problem. The white sticky substance you see is actually the semen itself. Let me explain. Semen is produced whenever you get sexually aroused. The produced semen is stored inside your body till you masturbate or engage in sexual activities. Semen is a waste product and body wants throw out. If you do not engage in sexual act or masturbation, body finds its own ways to throw the semen out. One way is dripping with urine and other was is through night fall.

It started today morning when I woke up I noticed my left testicle is larger and stiff compared to my right. It seems that the spermatic cord/ artery on the left is not like my right (which is normal and feels like separate veins). I m experiencing a sagging & dragging feeling on my left testicle and resulting uncomfortableness if I sit for a long period of time, extremely slight pain just as I get up. Apart from that there is no discoloration, no lumps that I can feel, no pain, no problems with urine/erection/ejection, no stomach upsets or nausea . The only thing is the actual left testicle has grown larger overnight by a bit and the area near the spermatic cord is also hard and stiff asif it is one cord instead of threads like on the right. While I know going for a UD is the best medical approach, it also would create a lot of awkwardness as I am a minor.

Semen should liquefy within 20 to 30 minutes of ejaculation. Delayed liquefaction of more than 60 minutes  may indicate an infection or a problem with the prostate or other glands, which are also known as the male accessory glands. However, you should not draw premature conclusions. You should undergo a post-coital test (PCT). This fertility test evaluates the cervical mucus after sexual intercourse. If sperm are found and moving normally, the delayed liquefaction is not consider a problem. In that case, you would have NO  problem in getting pregnant.

I wanted to know whether this is being overstated, or if, to your knowledge has any severe side-effects that should lead one to avoid using the product. it does not have FDA approval, so im just inquiring to see the validity of their claims and the possible repercussions of using it. Thank You, ND","Doctor":"Hi ND, Thanks for your query. Remember that healthy genitals are an individual's assets. So, one should be very careful with use of \\"off-the-label\\" and non-FDI approved medications for warts removal. As such, there are lot of conflicting reports and harrowing tales of the duped patients.  Perhaps, Wrtrin contains a sclerosing agent to 'burn' the wart, but you may land up with the burnt surrounding genital tissues!! I would therefore, strongly recommend long-term use of safer agents (lotions/creams), such as, podophyllotoxin lotion, Imiquimod cream or Trichloroacetic acid cream. These agents take weeks to even months for curing the warts and should be used only under medical supervision. Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me and will prescribe the advised drugs in appropriate doses.

I think you are suffering from phimosis, Phimosis is the inability to retract the foreskin behind the glans in males. Physiologic phimosis is the normal condition in which children are born with a tight foreskin and separation occurs during late childhood and early adolescence.The inability of the foreskin to retract can lead to difficulty cleaning of the area which can cause balanitis, there can be difficulty or painful urination, painful erection, or paraphimosis.Your doctor can diagnose phimosis based on a thorough history and physical examination. Additional tests are usually not necessary.The first choice of treatment is usually a steroid ointment that is locally applied. This treatment has shown a success rate of over 70%. The ointment softens the foreskin and is applied for 4 to 6 weeks. Once full retraction is possible the ointment is discontinued.If the steroid treatment is not successful, a circumcision might be beneficial. When penis is fully erect the fore skin should retract with out any problem, but in your case you have mentioned that you cannot retract it completely which is not normal. Please consult a surgeon and he will examine you and may suggest a small surgical correction called Circumcision. After the surgery you will be discharged on the same day.

Weight is simply the deposition of excess fat in the body and that occurs when calorie intake of food is higher compared to its loss due to physical activity. I will advise you to decrease the fat intake by reducing oil and ghee intake. Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Also eat only 75% of your total appetite and avoid extra calories in the form of biscuits, namkeens, tea, etcetera.If you can start exercising at least for 30 to 45 minutes then you can reduce your weight faster. Don't try to loose your weight too fast as it is dangerous for the body in the long term.Hope I have answered your query.

I'm worried that they may be genital herpes.","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query.Genital herpes can be presented as cracked or red areas or blisters.In some it is accompanied by fever and lymph node enlargement.But a yeast infection can be mistaken for that as you may get somewhat same appearance.A physical examination with a dermatovenerologist will  help to rule out that.Genital herpes is treated with antiviral drugs like acyclovir.Ointment of acyclovir is also used for local application.Medication helps to decrease the duration and frequency of outbreaks.Hope this may help you.Let me know if you have any further query."},{"Patient":"Hello I ve got a large yellow head spot on my scrotum and some tiny spots aswell, and my penis is like dotty( up the underneath bit is a few tiny dots, what is it and how can I remove them and I shower most of the time and my penis smells all the time even after I ve washed it","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Health care magic forum.
