I ve been seeing a Dr. since January of this year about the skin and had a visit again today. I ve had labs done 3 times now and recieved like a naproxon shot today, but already struggling again with aching. I ve been reading about psoriasis and psoratic arthritis, and have had some chest pain when taking a deep breaths neglected to tell my Dr. today. Should I notify him right away, or wait until next visit? Also how much can be learned from so many labs? Will the X-ray s taken of my hands, feet, and knees show any indication of this arthritis?","Doctor":"Hello, With such presentations, I would first of all advice to have an ECG done to rule out any cardiac involvement. Once I am sure that this is Psoriatic arthritis and is not a life-threatening one then I would suggest the following Ayurvedic medicines. 1. Mahamanjishtadi Kashayam 3 teaspoon with three teaspoons of water thrice a day before food. 2. Kaishora Guggulu - 2 tablets (chewed) thrice a day with the Kashayam (Item 1) before food. 3. Siddhartaka Snana Churna - made into a paste by mixing it with water and applied all over the body before bath. The same powder is to be mixed with gram flour at the ratio 1:2 teaspoon and used for bathing instead of soap. If it is not relieved then I would recommend Classical Vamana and Virechana treatment (Panchakarma) and then continue the above medicine. As this involves specialised treatment and monitoring I suggest you meet an Ayurvedic specialist and discuss the condition. Please let me know if you have any further doubts before you meet the doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr. Mahesh T S, Ayurveda Specialist"},{"Patient":"For over a year now I have been experiencing numbness, severe burning. and extreme tightening of my right arm.

I have tried taking gabapentin and lyrica they do not help either.","Doctor":"Hi, With such presentations, I suggest you have an X-Ray and an MRI was done to rule out any complications. I am sure that it is not a life-threatening one and I think it as the Advanced state of Cervical Spondylitis. For this, I would like to suggest the use of Collar belt to provide some rest to the neck which may reduce the symptoms. I see patients with this complaint in my clinic and I suggest them the following Ayurvedic medicine to be taken for a period of 15 days initially. 1. Tapyadi Loha - 1 tablet thrice daily along with the Kwatha or decoction before food. 2. Gandharvahastadi Kashayam - 3 teaspoons mixed with 3 teaspoons of water thrice a day before food. 3. Caps Palsineuron - 1 capsule thrice daily along with water after food thrice daily. 4. Sahacharadi Taila for application and massage (45minutes) over the neck, back and both the hands followed by hot fomentation over the region till there is good sweating. My suggestion on diet is 1. Avoid high protein, spicy, oily and junk foods. 2. Advise to take some dry fruits, a good quantity of fibre rich vegetables, those belonging to Cucurbitaceae like ash gourd, etc 3. Advise to take meat soups and fruit juices. I suggest you start with this regimen and get back to me after 15 days. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My question is now the Dr don t want me on any anti-inflammatory meds and in addition to everything else , they have me on Percocet 40 mg per day. Is this safe and the best way to go.","Doctor":"Hello, The risk of narcotics is a curve with a sharp and continually declining drop off. In the first year there might be up to a 20% risk of addiction. If people don't have the risk in the first year, their risk rapidly drops. People who've been on them for a while the risk of problems drops to about 1% per year. Oh, 40 mg a day is moderate. You should be advised of the risks of getting used to it and getting into a problem that you need more and the problems go up (this is in the first months not one year or, far more likely it will not happen). the guidelines for risks of narcotics start at 30 mg.

Also I am diabetic and about 45 pounds overweight.","Doctor":"Hi, The fatigue tends to not get worse and to level out. I don't know what to say about pain issues. Most drugs for treatment of pain cause fatigue. Disk disease has to be monitored that it doesn't cause paraplegia. If it doesn't cause nerve damage, then, mostly the same way that muscles, joints, skin sag with being old, the internal structures also sag. This produces the lumbar disk paradox of the disk getting further out of place over age, but the need for narcotics decreasing because the disk and the other structures have more space. Fibromyalgia responds well to modalities to increase pain tolerance (exercise, mobility, meditation, and physical therapy). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Your explanation seems to be consistent with a nerve related problem known as Trigeminal Neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia can occur due to disturbances associated with the fifth cranial nerve that is the Trigeminal nerve. You need to consult a neurophysician and get evaluated for the exact cause of the nerve induced pain as there can be some causes like the most common one is a large artery impinging over the nerve causing damage of the Myelin Sheath [a protective cover over the nerve] leading to severe electric shock like pain. Other causes are disorders like Multiple sclerosis, tumor compressing the nerve, physical trauma etc. The common drugs given to relieve neurotic pain are Carbamazipine that is the first line drug while others like Gabapaentin, Baclofen, Oxycarbazipine etc but in case if the pain does not subside then a detailed evaluation and tests like MRI SCAN can be done to rule out the underlying cause and treatment of the same can relieve. If there is any artery impinging the nerve Microvascular decompression in which the compression over the artery is surgically removed is done. Other procedures like Balloon decompression,gama knife radiosurgery, glycerol injection etc can be done to relieve pain. Hope I have answered your query.

I suffer daily sinus headaches docs say they see something in there but there s nothing they can do about it. I have bursitis they tell me, which at times calls for a long needle to be jabbed into my hip and, there s nothing imaginary about that. They tell me I have Gerd so I imagine that s that burning sensation that come up in my chest and throat when I miss taking my omeprazole. I wonder if something like that could have led to my moms and her only sister s esophageal cancer? Or it could be the hiatal hernia or the unspecified intestinal disease they told me I have.

The very next day I was back in the emergency room oh I forgot before I left the rehab a sore started to form at the surgical site and it began to bleed a little but no one was alarmed, especially not me I had had at least 8 abdominal surgeries before, one of them had to ripped back open due to infection (my C-section) the other burst back open when I was made to get up and too soon I thought, after my hysterectomy when I became dizzy and fell while walking down the hospital hallway.

My surgeon has the reputation in our area as the Dr. who fixes the supposidly number one spinal surgeon in U.S. MY surgery went very well 6 hre vs original 3 hrs, lossr a lot of blood and my current surgeon said in 30 yrs of practice he had never seen such a messed up spine. My first surgery 10/2004, a procedure called Pro Disc was used entering through my stomach for pain the clearly could not be helped other than through the back. Second surgery 5/2010 was Disectomy and fusion l3-l4, l4-l5, current dr said based on mylogram i had in october the fusion never took, the dr performing the surgery should have noticed immediatly due to dent where fusion took place and surgical x-rays. needless to day I continued with the same ortho dr until 10.2013 and ended up with total revision of both prior surgeries, found cage had broken from second surgery and screw was protruding outside bone. During those 4-10 yrs either site where metal was involved rubbed together creating schrap metal thus causing serious nerve damage that he suspects will take up to one year to hea. Spinal nerves affected are not a normal bluish color, they are jet black. Finally my question! My spine surgeon works w/ a pain mgt group. No affilliation, pain center rents office sppace from my drs surgical group. After three month of finding corrects meds and dose for my pain, ( out of pocket 1000.00 for meds my insurance did not cover but dr felt would work best as I have been on opioids for off and on 10 yrs). Go in for first follow up with surgeon 6/13/14, looks good ,siatic nerve will be most pain etc. Asked if I needed refills on meds, said yes I would run out before app t w/pain mgt dr 6/25/14, dr told receptionist to refill. Next thhing I know nurse gives my husband letter stating the pain mgt group will no longer treat me and to find new group? I was completely blown away, when asked why , I was told I violated the Narcotic document which I recall signing but not really paying attention to why or what may prevent office from treating me. I have called numerous times for an answer or some explanation, same answer violated narcotics document. How? Every time meds did not work for me I gave them back to the office for the staff to desroy. I was cut off yesterday at a current dose of 30mg MS Codone 3x per day and 10,g oxycontin 1-2 every 4-6 hrs. my rx s were filled 5/28/14 90 ms codone 3x per day amd 180 oxycotin 10mg 1-2 every 4-6 hrs for brak through pain. Many other medical issues arose from surgery 25lbs overnight weight gain knees down to feet. Many differemt drs made changes to amount and dosing schedule and pain clinic claims they see not such notes. Surgeon has me scheduled for 2 ultra sounds for upper/lower ab, pain clinics eply we are two separate practices. Now I will end up in wd s correct. Isn t the a high med dose to just stop meds without weaning down? Please help me, I am so scared, I begged this pain dr to keep meds low so I would not experience wd s from other peoples horror stories. Do I have any recourse?","Doctor":"Hello, I think we see that surgery is not very effective for disk disease. There does not have to be FDA approval or even a controlled trial for a surgical procedure to become standard practice. When controlled trials are done there has to be a fake surgery and even then it is hard to (1) fake the surgery and (2) have everyone not snicker under there hands at the people who got the fake surgery and give the whole thing away. When this has been done, with for example knee surgery, mostly the surgery has been found to be far less helpful than people thought. Hope I have answered your query.

So it's safer to continue Celebrex than Ibuprofen. For cramping you you need to take smooth muscle relaxants like Buscopan or Hyoscine. Cramps are also caused by electrolyte loss due to dehydration. So take lot of fluids and fruits, leafy vegetables. I Hope I have answered your question.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Diclofenac is not recommended for long duration of time. Prolonged use can damage your kidneys and liver and thus it is not generally prescribed as a routine drug.

Thank you for answering but I don t have the money to pay for an answer","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Wow, it's nice when the amount of narcotics is under a fatal dose. First, find out why there is falling. It is not usually from the drugs but the risk is certainly high enough to be found in clinical surveys. There can be partial paralysis from the disk. There can be dizziness or even brain injury from the fall. These are each quite uncommon, but then again, most people don't have the falls! So, something is certainly going on and it is only Most likely the medications but does not have to be from them.Then, soma has alternatives with less falling. These include chemically similar to soma robaxin and chemically quite different cyclobenzaprine(flexeril). There are other drugs like aspirin for pain that have less falling than norco, but frankly at 30 mg per day or less, I'm not sure they are even safer and they are less likely to work on the pain. One should try them just to verify the falling stops when the narcotics are not present (12 hrs after stopping them). Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Ok, any drug we try will be a \\"pain medication\\". You mean \\"is there something for nerve pain other than dangerous narcotics\\". The answer is a very very emphatic YES. There are MANY. They are all very safe and non-addicting and most are very inexpensive. Aspirin like drugs worked on me, mostly they don't. They are easy to try. My jaw pain from martial arts dropped to zero within an hour and lasted til the drug wore off and felt like a fire alarm went off in my jaw when it did. And, nerve pills: gabapentin, amitryptiline, lyrica, maybe cymbalta are very effective and work in a day. Lidocaine patch can also work if the nerve is near the surface where the drug reaches it. Direct acting procedures can work, but they are not incredibly cheap. There can be tens unit (applied ONLY by a specialist because it has a warning about use on the head but the risk is highly over rated). There can be implantable tens units that work all the time. There can be local injection to numb or kill the nerve. It is very treatable. Hope I have answered your query.

I expected nothing from the Requip because I had taken Darvacet N-100 for 30/yrs. only to experience it being suddenly removed from the market! Why, I continue to take the Darvon all those yrs. is because I m severely allergic to ASA {swells my brain} with all the symptoms of a brain-stem stroke!

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Cannot say in your particular case, but generally, fibromyalgia is considered to be a problem with the opiate system not working. Therefore, giving high doses of something that isn't supposed to work does not make sense. Alternatively, fibromyalgia might be in some people be depression or narcotic addiction. Neither of these would be a good reason to take narcotics. In some people, they don't have fibromyalgia. They have a real disease like broken bones, disk disease, or severe arthritis. Saying it is fibromyalgia is like having someone hit in the chest and having their chest pain being evaluated as a heart problem (seen it many times; surprisingly it was never due to heart problems!)

It was being evaluated as a non-narcotic pain medication about a decade ago but nothing came of it, so I suspect it isn't very helpful and there is a real risk of addiction to it. The pain effect, however, if it were to occur would also occur with any other nicotine like the gum and patch. Although addiction is a risk, the pain effect would occur in 2 days or not and addiction is time dependent and usually takes longer than 2 days.

It would be diabetic neuropathy. Each treatment for it other than very high doses of narcotics has only about a 1 in 4 possibility of working. At all. It is hard to treat. Other drugs with novocaine like effects like lidocaine patches or creme or amitryptiline are other possibilities but they do not have a high likelihood of working either. It is a tough disorder. Sometimes if the diabetes is really badly treated, getting the sugar below 300 will change it.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I had seen your medical presentation and understood your anxiety.Chest pain is more concerned for many people as heart is located. But there are many causes of chest pain. It can be muscle pain, lung pain, rib pain or esophageal gastric pain. All these factors are to be considered before diagnosing the exact cause. Coming to chest pain, you were having bruising on left side and burning pain above right breast. Probable most common cause could be acid reflux or gastritis (inflammation of stomach).As pain was changing with your sitting position, it could be due to muscle pain. So all these factors are to be considered before confirming the cause. It is better to go for the following investigations:1. ECG2. Chest x-ray3. 2D Echo4. Gastric function testsComing to your case, my opinion is there were no classic signs of heart pain. So the most probable cause might be gastritis. You can follow the below measures:1. start using antacids in the morning before taking breakfast2. avoid spicy food 3. better to have frequent small mealsSo don't get worried you will be relieved soon from your symptoms. You can go for investigations and if any abnormality is there you can contact us at anytime. Hope you will be recovered soon from your symptoms. Hope I have answered your query.

Unfortunately because of the opioid crisis and the fact that studies show that opioid medication to nothing in the long term, not only are doctors reluctant to prescribe it, but they don’t prescribe it at all.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment. Type of pain. Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain. Location of pain. There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might  be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \\"hit a nerve\\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are MULTIPLE areas and tends to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve. What hurts. Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves. Can be irritation of the liver or pancreas--blood tests are quite good at indicating this. It rarely happens after gall bladder surgery. Hope I have answered your query.

We had been to a Gynecologist and tested my sperm first time it was 2 to 3 motility and advised me to take medicine for two months later we had been for sperm test and it was 30 to 40 %.","Doctor":"Hello, 40% motility is normal. However, the chance of pregnancy depends on other factors like you (sperm count and morphology, sexual abilities) and your wife (age, condition of her tubes and AMH). Often we see men are coming to us with abnormal semen analysis report showing very low (\\"Oligospermia\\") or absent (\\"Azoospermia\\") sperm count or very poor \\"motility\\" (ability to move) of the sperms. Naturally, they are very much worried and want to know whether medicines can be helpful. Two things must be remembered 1) Semen Report must be REPEATED from an AUTHENTIC LABORATORY after ABSTINENCE of 3-5 days. This is important, as the sperm count varies day to day. It takes almost 3 months to produce the sperms. therefore, if today you wear very tight underwear or you have high fever, your sperm count (checked after 3 months from today) will be low. As a result, a SINGLE ABNORMAL SEMEN ANALYSIS report does NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANCE. You need to repeat it. 2) Both Male and Woman should be seen together. What treatment is required, actually depends on the reports of both the partners, their age and duration of infertility. Moreover, the pregnancy will ultimately happen on the woman. That's why, we need to see both together. What medicines should I take if the second semen analysis report is also abnormal? It all depends on how abnormal the report is. In case of mild abnormalities, we give medicines called \\"Antioxidants\\" (special types of minerals and vitamins that act on the sperms) for 2-3 months and ask to repeat the test again to see if there is any imporvement. At the same time, some life-style changes are advised. These include avoidance of smoking and alcohol, reducing weight, avoidance of using tight underwear, prolonged sitting and driving. However, if the problem is severe, you can take antioxidants. But it is more IMPORTANT to do some tests to FIND OUT THE CAUSE. Sometimes, we can find the cause like diabetes, which if controlled, can improve your sperm count without any other treatment. What tests are required? You may need physical examination of your genital organs by the doctor. You may be advised some blood tests for hormones (Testosterone, FSH, LH, Sugar etc). Some ultrasound examination of your testicles or prostate gland may be advised. In severe cases, some genetic testing (blood test to see if there is any chromosomal problem) may be needed. Can any medicines help if there is severe problem? In most of the cases, medicines cannot help. You can take antioxidants but SHOULD NOT RELY solely on it. In most cases, you will require IUI or IVF. However, there is ONLY ONE CASE where medicines can ACT DRAMATICALLY. That is if there is problem in the pituitary gland (situated in the brain). In that case, taking gonadotrophin injections for 3-6 months will significantly improve your sperm count. What's the problem if medicines are taken for long time? As such, medicines will not harm. But if you take medicines despite the fact that your sperm count is not improving, you can land up in azoospermia. This is because, in male having severe oligospermia, there is a tendency that sperm count may further decrease over time. therefore, relying on medicine will INDIRECTLY HARM you. Rather, you should think of IUI or IVF. Can Testosterone be taken? Even if your testosterone is low, if you start taking tablet/ injection of testosterone from outside, your SPERM COUNT WILL DECLINE FURTHER. Therefore, under any circumstances, if you want to become father, you SHOULD NOT TAKE TESTOSTERONE. Sometimes, after hormonal tests, we can advise tablets like Letrozole, which can help to improve the testosterone level, indirectly. IUI or IVF- What to do? If the sperm count is mildly/ moderately low, IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) can be tried. however, if its severely low, you should go for special type of IVF (in vitro fertilization), called ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection). All of these will be done using your sperms only. Conclusion- In most of the case, we may not be able to improve your sperm count by  medicines. taking medicines years after years, can rather be harmful. In most cases, you can become biological father of your own baby using your own sperms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The prescription monitoring program shows my doctors that I have been prescribed suboxone in the passed, and Ive already told my doctors about my passed addiction anyway. Now because of the suboxone, I cannot recieve pain medications. If I can, the doctors I have been to do not feel comfortable giving it to me.

Voltaren, as an anti-inflammatory, is not for everyone and can be associated with ulcers in up to 10% of those taking them.Much rarer are effects on the kidney (usually only for the few hours while the drug is working and going away entirely when the drug is stopped; I've had people who got hospitalizable heart failure from this sort of drug that went away in hours after stopping them), and effects on vessels producing a (small) increase in risk of stroke and heart attack.Narcotics have none of those side effects but can be addictive. It's strange because the addictive problems have been in the news and the problems of the Voltaren haven't been in the news.Most physicians are taking people off of Lortab and Oxycontin and giving them ulcers and heart disease instead.

I am concerned that the conditions are somehow related, either as a result of the tear itself, or as a result of the medicine I was given to treat it.","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! You might have developed fever because of your muscle tear. It's very common to get fever when you get injury. It's body defense system to fight injury. You don't have to be worried.

I have a huge bulging blood vessel with bluing color not black and blue it is dark blue from the vein. I have all sorts of allergic reaction to drugs I take none at all I have high colestrol but can not take statins I had anaphylactic shock 5 times. I have changed my diet to fruits vegetable and fish and chicken I am on a diet of 1200 calories a day. I am 55 weigh 175 5 8 my job is active outside and inside. I swim but can not do as long as this pain is in my leg I actually can not walk on it either I have poison Ivy","Doctor":"Hello,Generally, big blue vessels are varicose veins. Sometimes they ache locally. Often there is poor circulation and swelling in the limb out from where the varicose veins are.Allergy to one thing does not apply to unrelated things. Statins might all be related to each other but they would not be related to for example chicken. Other drugs for circulation or pain are likewise not statins. Lifestyle and really low fat, low sugar diets lower cholesterol, but the lifestyle actually has a better track record than the drugs for lowering health problems.Pain below the leg if there is swelling in the leg would imply circulation. This is mostly due to small clots and small problems BUT could be from LARGE clots which are a large problem and if the LARGE clot breaks loose and goes to the lung it can kill you. A reason to have it examined.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Well I feel in a hole and twisted my ankle.

In particular nerve pain has different drugs than narcotics that can not only help the pain better but really make it go away in many cases.In injured nerves, the prognosis for non-narcotic treatment is quite good with way better than 50 % having the pain more or less controlled by simple nerve pills like anti-epileptics at low doses.

Mostly it is not. There can be infection; mostly it is fairly obvious that there is infection (red, hot, swollen, purulent, et cetera) and, the breast is near nerves that run under the armpit and out to the arm.The breast does not have to be involved for these nerves to be hit. It is hard for me to remember how bad it was when I pulled one of these nerves out just from reaching out with the arm too fast and far, but it hurt quite a bit for months.It is obviously a reason to get it checked, mostly, not cancer.

In particular, sore surface muscles respond to rest, heat, and aspirin, while the attachement area of the arm to the shoulder (rotator cuff) is much more serious and requires orthopedic input much of the time."},{"Patient":"I woke up two days ago with MAJOR tailbone pain.

Haven't had all that much problems in long bones that stay straight even with fractures.Then, pain can be from various causes. going outward from an injury may imply a (very small) nerve is irritated.

The operation issue intrigues me because the shoulder and the back are not connected. and the shoulder if it is the part down below the neck is inside the chest and doesn't get much wear and tear. If it is at the neck, then neck disk disease is very very common and almost always shows up on regular x rays. BUT. Has nothing to do with back and legs in the vast majority.Back to pain managment: There are multiple levels. Obviously the first level is what is broken and fixing it with the surgery. The second level is the pain produced from the problem. Nerve pills sometimes work. Muscle relaxants sometimes work. Amitryptiline is both a nerve pill (like lidocaine) and a blocker of pain signals at the spine.The third level is the context in which the pain is held. While lately everyone is talking about mindfullness and yoga, frankly you might as well try a fidget spinner. I am highly dubious about all of them. BUT, having the pain be directed by oneself and having it decrease is known to be among the MOST effective modulators of pain. So, if you can do exercise or physical therapy in the context of MAKING IT PAINFUL,  then the  pain experience is less after creating the pain and with repeating it the pain goes down (except during the physical therapy where it goes up for the first 2 months then stabilzes but is still painful)."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am having trouble getting my primary care provider to follow up on care I need.

I do have a left def segment and i know i have to go and get it sorted out, i.e fix my nose bone as the xray disply a def on the left.please help","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for the query. If you have a deviated nasal septum, then it is possible that pain in the  gum is not due to some problem after the root canal. Deviated nasal septum can lead to recurrent sinus infection and inflammation. It can also cause facial pain. Although, if there is an infection below the root tips of the root canal treated tooth it can also lead to pain in gum region and can radiate over the sinus region and the face. Therefore, it is important that you consult your treating dentist and get evaluated. In case, if there is an infection either an antibiotic course like Augmentin 625 mg thrice a day or Ketorol DT one tablet dissolved in one fourth glass of water four times a day and Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day empty stomach will help. All has to be taken for 7 days and it will help. If the pain does not subside re-root canal treatment can be attempted. But in case if there is no infection in tooth then you have to consult an ENT expert and get evaluated. Get treated for the deviated septum and Rhinoplasty can be done. Hope this helps.

The hallmark of buprenorpine is that it has a maximum effect that is not increased with increasing the amount that you take, while other narcotics keep going up. Although buprenorphine is strong in the effect per milligram, the maximal effect it can do is less than with any other narcotic. If someone is on a lot of them, then the buprenorpine will NOT be able to achieve the effect of other narcotics. It will more or less fail.THC works on pain by a different method.

This is an irritation of nerves near the wrist due to repeated use.THere can be many other causes first, carpal tunnel can occur from thyroid disease, previous injury, or other disorder. Also previous trauma can cause irritation to other structures. There could in theory be problems in blood circulation but this is extremely uncommon because arteries come into the hand from both sides so it is hard to have a problem bad enough to be noticeable.

It s rarely aggravated except in very specific movements, such as putting my arm flat on a wall and leaning into it. My partner rubbed the area both of us thinking it was a tightened muscle and it was too tender to do anything with and now hurts more today then it has lately. I ve looked up pinched nerve, but the pain is mostly localized to that one spot and somewhat radiates down into my upper right rib under my arm. The pain isn t severe, but when it strikes it s definitely noticeable and somewhat alarming. Thank you in advance for your help.","Doctor":"Hi there! !The pain in your shoulder could be due to several factors such a muscle sprain, arthritis, rotator cuff injury etc. Sprain or a tear might occur if there has been an overuse of the shoulder, for a short period of time. You havent mentioned if the pain is associated with swelling, redness or any accompanying chest pain or so. If the home care remedies, such as Ice and painkiller medication do not work, please do consult a specialist. They may prescribe blood tests to rule out gall stones and pancreatitis , as such conditions may cause referred pain to the shoulder.

Pain at the base of thumb if happens in elderly patients above 60 years of age likely cause is 1st carpometacarpal joint arthritis. This is age related degenerative arthritis. If you are younger age likely cause of pain is dequervains tenosynovitis. In this condition there is inflammation of the synovial layer of first dorsal wrist compartment.

The structures that are at the base of the toes are muscles, joints, and bones. These get irritated. There can be fractures, this is far less common.

Most of the other causes are similarly 1) non-serious and 2) treated with NSAIDS about the same. There can be irritation of the rib joints (costochondritis), other aches and pains, minor irritation around the lung (devil's catch). There can also be pneumonia, a tumor, angina, depression, anxiety, and probably many other disorders that can cause similar problems.

Was it for osteoarthritis or nonspecific pain? If corticosteroids injection is given intraarticular it gives pain for initial 2 to 3 days due to inflammation and subsequently pain decreases.If pain continues after 3 days there are two reasons 1. Corticosteroids were not effective 2. there is little possibility of infection. I would like to advise local ultrasound to rule out collection. If it's normal infection is less likely.

While there can be stress fractures in the foot, irritations of the local structures is near 100% of those who dance regularly. Ice at first for the first 12 hrs applied as an icepack without direct touching of ice onto the skin where it could cause frostbite. Then, aspirin like drugs, and heating pads are helpful. Resting the area is quite difficult to do. then after the pain is mostly gone, physical therapy on range of motion, stretches, building up muscles, and how to hold positions correctly will be an important and quite difficult  set of routines to come up with and to do.

After cast few precautions such as strict limb elevation and active toe movements is advised. If that is not done swelling may increase and pain will peslrsist.

Facet joints are on both sides of vertebra and holds both vertebra together with intervertebral disc. Degenerative changes in disc leads to loss in their height which strains facet joints. In turn facet joints reacts by hypertrophy and arthritis trying for natural fusion. All this process leads to back pain.  Nerve roots pass through narrow canal known as spinal canal. Narrowing of canal due to bony spurs and ligamentum flavam hypertrophy leads to canal stenosis. This impedes blood supply of nerve roots  and pain in lower limbs while you walk. you need to consult spine surgeon to discuss various treatment options like canal decompression or fusion. all the best."},{"Patient":"Hi.

This illustrates several issues connected to the development of narcotic existence so very well I question if it is a plant or a fake.1) the drugs decrease effectiveness over time.2) Taking narcotics at one level of pain then isn't enough when the pain goes up (like broken foot and ankle) and then one gets stuck if one is already at the highest dose that is going to be given.Then3) doing progressively more illegal things which make one more likely to do more illegal things.4) with progressively more drug one can get drug withdrawal which sets up for serious consequences, etc.So, drug treatment centers offer more narcotic effect and more monitoring."},{"Patient":"5 days ago I had routine blood work done and while the needle was still in my arm as the technician untied the tourniquet, a burning stinging pain shot down me forearm...almost made me pass out it was so painful.

I had some Norfloxicin from the Travel Medicine Centre from prior to my trip. GP said I could take that. Will it treat Giardiasis if it is Giardiasis? My gastro symptoms have completely resolved. Just have back pain now (from doing lots of laundry when I returned) I took Meloxicam, which I have since leant is contraindicated with the antibiotic I was on. Still have back pain after 4 days. Normally better after 2/3 days. What should I do/take?","Doctor":"I do not know why there is an interaction with the antibiotics. A lot of them interact with meloxicam by interfering with liver metabolism BUT the effect isn't that bad.On the other hand. ONE aspirin will determine if that is an alternative drug and it doesn't have liver metabolism issues. Aspirin is the strongest anti-inflammatory. The problem is that it is also the strongest on stomach irritation."},{"Patient":"I have the sensation that I have pieces of glass in my skin. Nothing comes out and the sensation is there for a while (weeks) and then it goes away. It use to be on the bottom of my feet and at the top of my head. Now it is on the top of my foot, along the underneath side of my left arm between my wrist and elbow, and all over my head. When I lay down to sleep or rest my head against a piece of furniture it really hurts. The same is true when I put on socks or clothing over the affected areas. I have been checked for MS in the past but the doctors didn t see enough symptoms. These symptoms have developed since that time. When I was checked, they did not do a spinal tap, we just answered questions and I had an MRI, which showed a non-specific lesion in the brain. Other symptoms were pain on the right side of my body, memory issues, speech issues, overall pain, fatigue, etc.","Doctor":"Quite a lot of possiblities. First, there is the possibility of having glass in there. But generally something would be visible .Sick nerves in localized areas can occur from nerve poisons. It is more typically at the ends of nerves and on both sides evenly, BUT B12 deficiency, thyroid level low, or lyme disease or syphillis or some metal poisonings can do this. Cannot say which is in your case and sometimes a biopsy is needed.MS typically goes for years prior to diagnosis."},{"Patient":"How long will joint pain last after taking doxycylcine hydate? I took the medication 2 times a day for seven days for chlamydia. After taking a single dose of antibiotics, the std did not go away. So I waited about three months or more and tested positive for Chlamydian again. So the Dr. prescribed me doxyxylcine. On a couple of occasions, mostly morning, I had nausea. One of the mornings I went to grab the remote and got an alarming pain in my left elbow on both sides of the joint (bicep/tricep). And it has continued to spread throughout my other joints on both sides: knees, knuckles, and elbows. I stopped taking the medication on 5-28-14. I d like to know what s the usual recovery time from this side effect if at all? I work out and I have had to stop all activity due to this problem.","Doctor":"This isn't that typical for doxycycline. Some STD's can infect joints and the joints usually but not always look like they have infection. AND far more common, if someone has an infection, everything from a cold to overwhelming gonorrhea sepsis, it makes one feel sick and have joint pain.Then, sometimes, joints get irritated and have pain.(but it wouldn't be that many points and not on both sides usually) For me, that lasted months but was clearly improving in 2 weeks. Lifted something wrong and strained the tendons. My muscles built up faster than the tendons."},{"Patient":"hi i am from nepal, i am 32 of male and suffering from obstructive azoospermia. i did IVF Tesa but in nepal but no result. one of the doctor suggested me to go to sufdar jung hospital in delhi and meet urinary surgeon. can a urinary surgeon do surgery and make it better","Doctor":"Hello, There are some surgical procedures or reconstructive methods which can treat your obstructive azoospermia.

If yes, then someoen has to have a urologist see where the infection is coming from. If not, then if it is when the pain medicine runs out the pain comes back, this is typical for fibroids. THe aspirin like drugs which are probably the best treatment for this are potentially toxic and this has to be watched closely."},{"Patient":"I have been suffering with severe neck pain for over two weeks. I have seen a chiropractor who diagnosed me with Torticollis. I have suffered from this neck condition since I was 3. The chiropractor administered stimulation and acupuncture to the affected site which brought immediate relief from the pain. However, I have flu-like symptoms (but no fever) as well that get better and then suddenly come on again. I am weak, shaky, tired, my eyes hurt/itch, and just don t feel well. It reminds me of when I had mono. Can mono flare up repeatedly over my lifetime?

Thankyou Jane","Doctor":"It is a set of symptoms with the current listing includes things that literally everyone has. It is basically depression. People with it have every indication of depression. Anti-depressants help it. BUT this does not necessarily apply to everyone with fibromyalgia; just to most and to those who fit the current definition of it.Note that another ingredient of the diagnosis is that no sign of a real disease is present. So if there are signs of infection--it is not fibromyalgia.Treatments are mostly for depression: 1) anti-depressants, 2) nerve dampers/ anti-epileptics 3) muscle relaxants 4) counseling as if the person has depression."},{"Patient":"I have neck back and leg pain managed by pain management soon to be starting prolothearpy I was wondering how effective and success rate is but also I was referred to wear asics gel cumulus 15 sneakers and I must say they help a lot I just wore my nike sneakers today and I had nothing but pain going up my foot through leg and caused my back and neck pain to irritate so I am looking for a opinion on the asics gel cumulus 15 are they really that good for them to be preventing a lot of my pain I receive ?","Doctor":"Yes, this commonly happens. There are a wide variety of reasons for it to work. Probbly the biggest is that walking trasmits pain to the back vertebrae and this cushions them.

I have on a cast to prevent my ankle from cracking the bone. the ankle and foot is swollen and iam diabetic. I can not understand were the swelling can go if I have this cast on. I have been told that I would have to keep this cast on because I have slow blood flow to the bone in my ankle. after three months I will have to wear the Arizona brace for the rest of my life.is there any other treatment possible.","Doctor":"cannot say in your particular case, but generally, a cast or other occlusion prevents blood from coming back up and localized swelling occurs below tthe occlusion. This si somewhat helped by elevating the limb.Circulation improves with the edema being down. There can be several easily reversible things that can limit circulation. cigarettes are the main one. The swelling itself can hurt circulatio and this is helped by diuretics OR keeping the area elevated."},{"Patient":"I have a dull ache in my mid left side. It goes around into my back. It sometimes feels like a pinching that you may get after running a long race. Or wearing tight clothing. I have had it for a couple months now. It comes and goes and I ve been getting it more frequently now on a daily basis. I m concerned as I do have a narrowed pancreas due to a severe case of salmonella poisoning as a child. Cancer was ruled out. They said that I ve obviously been able to live with narrowing with no problems. I am now 53 years old. Please advise.","Doctor":"Ok, first it can be easily evaluated if the pancreas is still irritated iwth some simple cheap bloodwork (pancreatic enzymes). If they are not elevated then other cuases of pain have to be considered. If they are elevated it gets... tricky. Lowering the pancreas work load helps . This is done by changing the diet but mostly by taking pancreatic enzymes iwth meals (they car very cheap). Sometimes an imaging study will show a correctable problem iwth the pancreas but this is rare."},{"Patient":"Hello my name is Melissa..

At least to know we can not afford a doctor as of now.Thank you agin in advance.","Doctor":"Ok, continuing cellulitiis is very destructive and often causes loss of limb. Several things to consider would be if the germs are ressitant to antibiotics. This is espeically true if there is a yeast infection that is not even treated. Then, reasons why a treated infection does not go away can include having infection deep in . this can include infection of the bone and this requires specialized testing to evaluate ity. THere can also be pockes like boils externally or internally that need to be removed. there can also be problem if the area does not get good blood flow and this generally requires an expert in vascular surgery to be able to evaluate or treat it."},{"Patient":"I fell off a ladder jan 4, 2014 about 30 off the ground and slammed my tailbone low back and head .

Seroid injection has likely already been tried and amitryptiline probably HAS NOT.Anti-epileptics would be another group of drugs to try. Several of the medicines are already more or less in this categorey (gabapentin. soma).Certainly imaging studies such as MRI or ct with contrast would have likely been the first thing done in concussion, or back pain or tinnitus. but if it was not done it should be."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a young boy that is turning 12 years old this year.

I can say for certain that this is not happening but I am thinking that his recent interest in girls this year could be leading to him masturbating himself. My question is can a masturbation cause a 12 year old male to have a bruise or could it be another medical issue that needs to be observed.  He is a typical boy and recently he and his friends went over bmx jumps and the bar on his bike hit his testicles and injured him.  The boys took video footage of this and they all thought it was funny.","Doctor":"Hi, The majority of genital infections I see are from the germs you get anywhere else.

Then, tehre are two large groups of arthritis, osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis. Osteoarthritis is wear and tear. as such it tends to be on the bing joints first and it certainly is not even on both sides.Rheumatoid is an inflammatory disease.

I m really sorry I can t work with my harsh pain I have. I real need help for pain to be control. I have ibuprofen and tyonlal.","Doctor":"You will really want to see a doctor about this. Fractures have to be aligned in the normal way the bones fit together. Bones heal together BUT only if they are touching and not if the pieces are far apart. Second, the pieces have to be healthy and in some situations some of the pieces do not get blood and die off and this hurts and Most importantly, in that situation and whenever the bones are not in the proper places, they will not heal together right and someone will have permanent loss of function of the limb. If it doesn't heal right, it won't work right."},{"Patient":"sir i have a problem .that i am habituated in realising sperms since 5years......i am not married what should i do..........it ill harm me later or what.................and i tried to stop it many time but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not possible.what should i do to increase my sperms","Doctor":"Hello, I am sure you are talking about masturbation.

New onset angina would be a reason for a lot of interventions like cardiac catheterization to see if there are blockages.

Thank you for any suggestions or regime I can do daily that may improve this pain, confused on clear treatments.","Doctor":"Well, you certainly are taking the right actions to help fibromyalgia. Some of it is due to depression and antidepressants are generally used for it. Otherwise it is perhaps a disregulation of the nerves that damp down pain. This is more or less corrected by exercise up to the point of the exercise causing pain. The pain from the exercise resets pain perception. It is temporary and needs to be done regularly."},{"Patient":"I fell almost a week ago.. Landed really hard on my knew put a huge bruise on my knee on top of ripping a layer of skin off.

The pain that goes out from the back and down the leg is classic for a pinched nerve in the back. This is where that nerve goes.

Are these all symptoms of just a cold or should he go see his doctor?","Doctor":"Ok, productive cough is often a reason to see the doctor to evaluate for a potentially serious lung infection. The pain from lung infection can occur in many places for many reasons. Generalized pain from inflammation would imply a more serious infection than a common nose cold.

In theory, antivirals would help in about 5 days. But it probably is NOT herpes. Yeast infection, boils, just plain skin irritation can occur. LOTRISONE is a bit helpful for any of those but boils and it might make herpes worse (probably NOT), but it is an alternative.

However if the person is not taking other drugs of abuse nor seeing other doctors nor having other sources of medication, there is precious little to be able to find that they are snorting the medicine.

My Rheumatologist said don t lose any sleep on this finding. But I am getting worse and worse. Have been started on Gabopenton, 600mg a day. It really helps a lot, but still have the same problems.

The next day it felt same. It only hurts when extended, so I forgot after shower and bent to put socks on. When I extended my arm, there was a strong sharp horrible pain in the mid arm.

I am in extreme pain now and my rib cage is touching my hip due to the surgery ..I am in constant pain- what are my options for long term functionality and pain management?","Doctor":"Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment.  First, you cannot have the rib cage touch the hip. What about intestines?The context would be an important feature. Is it right after the fracture? in which case a lot of narcotics ouwld be quite reaonable for about 2 weeks and then less narcotics and more aspirin like drugs.Type of pain. Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain. There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might  be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \\"hit a nerve\\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are MULTIPLE areas and tends to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerveWhat hurts. Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.\`\`     Having a diagnosis leads to choice of medicine for the pain. Inflamed outer structures respond to treating inflammation. Inner structures need diagnostic tests because something internal is broken. MRI's.And, structures that cannot be fixed need adaptations.

I suggest you to get relax as soon as possible to combat these symptoms. More than 50% of pain and discomfort goes away when we do relaxation exercises. You are young and exercise can make you stronger and calmer reducing stress. Join gym and increase work out slowly. Furthermore, an evaluation of chest pain by your medical specialist is essential in case your heart is undergoing any changes due to stressful life episodes. I will not recommend any medication at this stage. Just change your lifestyle, eat healthy diet and make exercise your routine."},{"Patient":"I have bruised the palm of my hand on more than one occasion in the same general area. The bruising occurs at the base of my ring finger on the fleshy part of my palm and is very painful. Both times I only used my hand to grasp something which resulted in a visible bruise appearing immediately and soreness which lasts for days. Is this just bad luck or could it mean something is not quite right ? Thanks","Doctor":"Could be either. With ONLY one spot having bruises, then all the serious conditions involving blood clotting are just very unlikely. THEN, it's what causes irritation one spot. There can be just a mechanical reason. Usually is. The flesh is thin there, the area is exposed. Frequently there is also a bony part (bone spur)"},{"Patient":"my daughter is on hydrocodon-acetaminoph 7.5-325 and she should also be taking acetaminophen 325mg but I do not want her to take to much acetaminophen so if she is taking 2 tablets of the hydrocodon every four hours then how much of the acetaminophen 325 should she be taking in a day","Doctor":"There is no added benefit by taking over the recommended dose of tylenol. Then, acetaminophen like food, water, and sunlight is only harmful when too much is taken all at once. About 4000 mg at one time is potentially quite serious perhaps fatal, but that is from all sources. I don't know the exact number of hours that can be taken and be harmful but it is NOT over 24, so, 4000 mg in 24 hrs is quite bad. Mostly we try to limit to 1000 to 2000 at most in 24 hrs. Certainly 4000 mg in a week is fine."},{"Patient":"I have had LUQ spasm with pain. It feels like I have a knot that tightens like a Charlie horse under my left rib cage. It can be very painful and last 10-30 min. It is sometimes positional, sometimes not. Sometimes it is accompanied by heartburn, sometimes not. I am 58, morbidly obese and am diabetic","Doctor":"Ok, depends how deep down it is. If it is on the surface, it is obviously the abdominal wall muscles, Hernia, tight clothes, electrolyte abnormalities, or just diabetes can make this more common. If it is NOT on the surface, there are a lot of upper gastrointestinal problelms such as reflux that are very common in diabetes and/or obesity."},{"Patient":"I have an online friend who has a very painful condition, I am not sure what it is but she does not want to use opiates and will not use them though they were prescribed.

Could anyone give an approximation of how effective one dose unit of orphenadrine (I think it is either 60 or 100mg) might compare to 10mg hydrocodone? Would it even come close to hydrocodone s effectiveness? I know this is likely a difficult question but if anyone could help, I d be thankful.","Doctor":"The two aromatic rings with a tail is shared with flexeril. Both are muscle relaxants that are NOT narcotic nor controlled substances but certainly not going to be over the counter.As such, comparison to narcotic or even aspirin is not really going to make any sense.

I have constant back pain and stiffness. I ve been to see a doctor and all he wants to do is give me expensive meds that just make me sleep all day and feel sluggish. I have a full time job. I can t afford to be sluggish working around dangerous tools and driving a lot. Can you tell me what I can take that is natural. This pill is suppose to be good. What you say?","Doctor":"A fake drug reduces any sort of pain by up to 50% in any test of pain. So, if they took out 90% of the ingredients, and reduced the cost to you by 90%, they would still have something that would work quite well. The fact that they do not lower the cost is either stupid, greedy, or that they really believe their drug is working. BUT since there has never been a test on the main model for pain (get a bunch of people getting dentistry; see if it lowers acute dental pain), we can rule out that the people think the drug actually works.In the not as good tests done on it, generally it is not better than fake drug. For actually healing joints/tendons on x rays, it does nothing, but then I do not know of anything that has worked on this. It's components, turmeric, gum from frankinsense, and an enzyme are being studied but are not proven to do  anything. THe enzyme, especially, wouldn't even get in without being digested. This is true of the gum of frankinsense also, but it contains some small plant compounds that MIGHT be absorped after digestion and MIGHT do something. It is a stretch of the data to say anything and they haven't published any real data to support this doing anything. They certainly haven't established the right dose. So, taking 1/10 of it 3x a day will make it quite affordable; there is not data to say what dose is the minimal with full activity. Maybe 1 thousanth. Maybe just opening the bottle and inhaling dust.

I scared to death. I don t know what to do. I also see track marks on my hands and arms. I am a diabetic but I think it s something else too.","Doctor":"Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment. Type of pain. Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain. There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might  be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \\"hit a nerve\\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are MULTIPLE areas and tends to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerveOk, so, what causes sick nerves. Diabetes can do it. and that tends to be at the tips of the nerves (feet and hands). Electrolyte abnormalities, however, often cause more widespread nerve problems/pain. Simple blood tests can show if potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium are at normal levels."},{"Patient":"I am 62 years and weigh 110 kg. on 20th feb. 2014 I suffered muscular injury of my right shoulder after fall on ground while trying to catch support of neaby bike handle which i missed and fell.

It feels like it has fever and is very painful.I went to ER and they said they coucouldn t find anything. Please help me Im in tears.","Doctor":"Dear user,Firstly to control your pain, while you get further investigations. There are a couple of things that will help1. Regular pain killers. Start with regular over the counter Paracetamol ( if you are not allergic or have liver problems). You can add on stronger pain kilkers like Diclofenac(make sure you get a prescription for some PPI e.g Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole to rotect your stomach with this), Tramadol, Oxycodone(with tjis you might need a laxative) for the first few days. 2. Pressure Stocking. You can start with class 2 elastic stockings above knee. Your pharmacist should be able to help with sizing.3. Avoid prolonged standing3. Elevate your leg when your sitting or lying to help rdduce the swelling.This swelling could be because of Varicose veins, Cellulitis due some infection around your foot or leg, DVT( deep vein thrombosis; this is one of more serious problems where a deep system of veins is blocked and blood keeps pooling in the legs).While you are dealing with pain, try and get an appointment with a Vascular Surgeon, if not get your doctor to examine and refer you to them. They will be able to look at the veins in your leg and the ball of vessels behind your knee. They might need to do some scans though. In the meantime, stockings and elevation should help with discomfort anyways.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi I have been having severe pain in my jaw (both sides) I also have a trachea which I have had for about 8 yrs now.

I have only taken 10 mg 3 times per day max and for the last 6 months or so 5mg 3 times per day and am now trying to detox completely. My PCP (the same one who started me on the Methadone 5 years ago) gave me Promethazine for nausea, Clonodine for withdrawal symptoms, Trazodone for sleep, and I haven t had Methadone in 5 days. I am still experiencing withdrawal and the Clonodine makes it impossible for me to go to work but without it I am having chills, restless legs, no appetite, can t sleep, and just feeling like crap. Is there any light at the end of this tunnel? I am close to just taking the back up Methadone so I can feel normal and get back to work (I haven t been able to go since starting this process). I ve called my PCP but she is not in clinic today and her only suggestion was to quit taking the Clonodine. Any other suggestions? Also, I don t want to go on Suboxone and then have to withdrawal from that, I feel that is just like taking the Methadone. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, the symptoms are temporary. The withdrawal from a long acting drug lasts longer. The entire list of options are, taking a lower dose of a narcotic (methadone 2.5 mg a day?) and weaning gradually, taking a narcotic and not ever getting off of it, or cold turkey. 5 days is a considerable time of the entire time it would take for withdrawal to peak and start diminishing (7 to 10). Changing narcotic responsiveness hasn't been looked at. It would likely shorten withdrawal significantly by changing how one felt about withdrawal. This would be taking an oral short acting blocker, going into the worst withdrawal possible and then stopping everything. This is done in some private clinics under the term \\"rapid detox\\". It is not well studied and even less regulated.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The pain is way worse now then when I was 17, could be that I ve raised three children since then! If it weren t for my children, I wouldn t be here right now - everything I do is painful, exhausting, and depressing.... The way I explain my unrelenting pain to some people has been telling them that just because I m smiling today doesn t mean that I am not in pain, doesn t mean every single joint, muscle etc... isn t driving me mad, every second of every minute of every hour of every day etc... and that I m a good actress when I need to be! I also explain my situation this way: if I were a dog, that felt all of the above...would you not have it put down so it wouldn t have to suffer one more horrible/painful minute? I ve been very careful not raise my pain meds (I just try to increase for a while, then decrease to the initial dosage etc...) I m trying to keep the dosages low (and not getting much relief) because of all the hoopla and the abuse of pain meds lately in both Canada and the US. Drs. now afraid to write higher dosage scripts for fear that the gov t will come down on them, and then before you know it, I will be stuck in the middle and have to try something else etc... The problem is I am in so much pain all the time, (even my pain Dr. told me that I will probably never not be completely pain free. I understand that I need to enjoy reduction in pain no matter how small or for how long... I see him every week to pick up my prescriptions but what makes the hour long (hard, painful, tiring) drive to see him worth it, is the Nerve Blocking Injections in my back, shoulders, and neck areas! (where were these injections 20-30 years ago?) I feel really good and abnormally energetic for a day or two after the injections, then it stops working, but I do appreciate the one or two days - very much! So, my first question is: along with my daily dose (2400mg of Gabapentin), should I stop worrying so much about the actual dosages and just keep raising it over time until I start to feel better, then level off? Right now I am on: 6mg 3x/day of extended release morphine, oxycodone 10mg 3x/day and cyclobenzaprine 10mg 2x/day. My second question is: How safe are these injections over time? Can I just keep getting them every week, after week for years? Thank you for your time, Diana","Doctor":"Ok, the top question I do not see the milligram of gabapentin. 800 mg three times a day is the usual top dose. However, a key point on medications is the dose dependence of bad things happening. The relationship between drug and bad things varies all over the place.Gabapentin is extremely LOW RISK, HIGH SAFETY, but, it's side effect curve (sleepiness) is weird in that it starts at about 1 in three people at the low dose having sleepiness and it doesn't really change much with higher dosing. Bad stuff doesn't seem to happen with much higher doses as opposed to most things (like water) where going up 3 to 5 fold is dangerous.Flexeril is dangerous above the recommended dose which is the MAXIMUM SAFE DOSE. It affects muscle including heart. Bad.Narcotics are the more usual case. low low doses don't do much. Average doses have some risks and some help. Going above the recommended dose increases both some pain relief but vastly increases the danger of stopping breathing, addiction, etc.Can't say about the back injections because I do not know what is injected. Steroids would typically stick in any space they are put into for weeks not days, but this depends on if it is steroids injected and what type of steroid. Lidocaine wouldn't last as long but it's quite safe except for the needle which can hit something each time. Steroids in theory weaken muscle, tendon, bone, but I've never seen anyone who's gotten 10 injections in their entire lives so, I cannot comment on actual problems. The near 100% risk of local minor bruising and local pain and significant risk of spinal fluid leak with spinal injections are the biggest risk (of minor seriousness). Back muscle injections....the injections themselves are really close to zero risk; we do antibiotic shots daily. Thousands. Not much risk. Oh wait flu shots. tens of thousands. Not much risk."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor.Due to falling into a drain, my right shin was hurt, seems to be just abrasion about 0.5 x 3 inches, but as there are a few puss, just clean with spirit and put neomycin sulphate oinment and take ampilclox (500 mg x times) orally about two days. I think there is no problem with the bone due to external signs. According to the present treatment, it seems to be improved. In such a situation, I would like to have a few suggestion as follows: 1) Is the present treatment (my own prescription) sufficient and safe? 2) If not sufficient or correct, what shall I do or change? 3) How long should I take ampilclox?

The doctors have proscribed oxycodone before, but. I am afraid it is more habit forming and don t like taking it. I am taking 2 10/325 mg 6 to 8 times a day and I am still in pain most of the time and they have not been able to find the cause of the pain. I only take when I have pain, but the pain is been getting worse over the last few months. I just don t know what to do.","Doctor":"over 100 mg a day is quite a concern. Norco (hydrocodone) and oxycodone are close to equivalent. Indeed, the overdose epidemic was more common for hydrocodone simply because it was more avaiable until 2016. For that matter, 4 gm of tylenol in a day is quite a concern. certainly 4 gm at one time of tylenol would be a hospitalizable overdose and 4 gm over a year is entirely safe. One day is a borderline interval. certainly any other tylenol along with it including in cold medicines is quite dangerous. Having a symptoms for years without it changing or new associated symptoms with it would strongly imply it isn't going to kill you today; I'm less certain about the safety of the medication.Anyone taking over 100 mg of narcotic a day WILL have pain when stopping it; it is called 'narcotic withdrawal'. Less obvious, but equally true, anyone taking 100 mg of narcotic a day will have their perception of any pain changed by it. This change in the perception of pain will last for at least weeks after stopping the narcotic.One shouldn't take a medicine without knowing why one is taking it.Narcotics are dangerous and high amounts are more dangerous.Seeing a pain specialist who is NOT PAID BY THE VISIT (university based for example) would be someone who could give an unbiased opinion."},{"Patient":"Sir, i was just recovered from viral fever.

Done my x-rays at the ER the doctor said no fractures no broken bones. However it hurt so much my ribs pop when I move, when I sit or stand or even move my right arm, also my right arm hurt so much it has limited movement. I m using anti-inflammatory gel (Reparil-Gel N) and pills ( Reparil-Dragees) since I was discharged this morning, it helped little but the pain is not reduced. What shall I do?","Doctor":"Hi, Since the problem is in the chest, we cannot immobilise it. However we can do quite a bit to relieve your pain. You can continue the gel, but take as little medication as possible. You can wear the right arm in a sling when not in use so that it gets a little rest to heal. Also apply ice for ten minutes every four hours to the painful ribs. After 48 hours of the injury, you can apply alternate ice and heat in that order ten minutes each every four hours. Follow this with the pain gel. This should help you, but it will still take 4-6 weeks for full healing. Regards"},{"Patient":"Last night when I showered I washed my rear end in the crack area. I don t know what happened but it is so sore and feels like its raw. It is above the anal area. It is sore when I sit. There are no bumps or open sores.

Please use any anal cream available for piles with lidocaine and steroid in it three times a day. This will soothe the area. Regards"},{"Patient":"Sorry, I did not know that I had to pay and that you are a Family Physician. Please disregard my request/story. Good Evening, I was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002. The cancer was too small and just watching it was suggested by the doctor(s). the growth was very, very slow. Once it got past about a PSA of 5, I had annual biopsies. Eventually in Dec. 2017 my PSA went up rather quickly to about 9 and my doctor suggested a biopsy which resulted in a Gleason score of 9. My doctor, a Urologist, suggested to see an oncologist for the radiation around the prostate to take care of any micro cancer that may be there before treating the prostate with implants. Because of a minor preceding bladder surgery (transurethral resection), he injected a 4 months LUBRON. My PsA went to about 7 or 7.5 within 2-4 weeks. THEN ! on the 5th. of March I went to raw food diet until the 12th. of March, when I started with a one-week juice diet with 1 enema daily for one week about 7 PM, In the morning I also started with one cup of hot water with one tee spoon of Baking Soda every day, and 1/2 Cup of mostly carrot with spinach, beets, orange juice -each hour between 6 AM and 8 PM. and on the 19th. of March I went back to raw food diet. MY new PSA reading on the 19th was 0.6. YES, 0.6 ! ! ! Conclusion? Your opinion? Your advise? Bert: age 78 YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi, When was your last injections ok Lupron? Also, it wasn't clear if you underwent radiation therapy or not? PSA of 0.6 is a good sign that means the prostate cancer is dormant and I suggest you just continue what you are doing because it seems it's doing fine for you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Manuel C See IV, Urologist"},{"Patient":"Recently I started having pains on palms and foot. My GP has just prescribed Renerve plus.

They can be taken at the same time but then you won't know if the marijuana by itself does significant pain relief. Certainly the narcotic effects do not last 24 hrs. One could hold off the narcotics or drastically lower the dose and 1) see if the pain returns and 2) if it does see if another drug including marijuana can do anything for the pain."},{"Patient":"I have an intermittent pain, that lasts maybe a second that comes intermittently 20 seconds to 2 minutes. It has been going on for about 4 hours now. Location is right side chest just about breast height. I had been cycling this morning but not hard when it started. Just went for a walk....did not change the frequency or intensity. No other symptoms.","Doctor":"Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment. Type of pain. Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain. There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might  be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \\"hit a nerve\\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are MULTIPLE areas and tends to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerveWhat hurts. Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.OF course if EATING or COUGHING triggers pain then that would imply structures invovled with those activities are sore (esophagus or Lung)."},{"Patient":"Have had treatment for some tight muscles from hip to knee on one leg only.

I did go to a pain clinic in which they know nothing about my medical history the Dr. There is the one that said to cut me off as the meds are what s causing the pain. Mind you I saw this Dr when I was an inpatient at her hospital at the time I was taking oxycodone and percocet that was prescribed by my primary rehab & pain management Dr s, anyway she stopped the Percocet which is ok but now 2 yr s later with more injury s she wants to take me off all pain med s. Please any advice would be helpful. The Dr. Here does not seem to care or want to understand.","Doctor":"Well, obviously there are several questions we are not going to deal with here on why someone is being taken off of narcotics. How much drug and how much problems someone has had from them, etc.The pattern of stopping the drug depends on the amount of narcotic. People with surgical problems get stopped all the time and there is no problem. The duration they were on them is short and the doses are below those that cause withdrawal (under 30 mg a day of morphine or oxycodone). If the amount taken is much higher, then withdrawal can occur. Several things can be done for that 1) keep someone on narcotics possibly in a drug treatment context like methadone clinic 2) add drugs that lower the withdrawal symptoms like clonidine (nobody uses reserpine but I've no idea why not). Then for drug tapering, typically one would lower the dose by > 10% and less than 50% and see what happens. The symptoms start in 24 hrs, peak about 3 to 5 days and diminish in 1-2 weeks. Tapering at 1 week intervals is fast and 1 month intervals is slow; those would be the usual time frames used."},{"Patient":"My daughter plays basketball.

The funny thing is there is not much swelling!","Doctor":"Yeah, this has to be seen by an expert there are a lot of possibilities. They are all serious in a growing, tall 15 yr old. Even the most minor (muscle strain) needs expert couching on stretching, prevention, and how much to rest versus train. And, can be a stress fracture, a minor fracture, a fracture in the growing part of the foot/ankle that can cause deformity and probably other possibilities."},{"Patient":"Hi i have constant pain in my back legs and feet.

I have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis fibromyalgia and osteoporisus but am still concerned. What do u think could be the cause of my leg and foot pain.thanks Dianne.","Doctor":"Not fibromyalgia. If it does exist as a disease then it is an overall, everywhere disorder of pain. By definition, there cannot be anything wrong/broken for fibromyalgia. Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are shown on x rays (or not). But, if kicking straight out causes pain, then a bad back with a pinched nerve is the cause. The nerve goes out the back and down the back of the leg and around the hip and pain sensations are felt all along the nerve path. But you wouldn't see abnormal knee/hip with a bad back because it is the back and the nerve and not the skeletal structures elsewhere."},{"Patient":"Severe shoulder pain after drinking alcohol-extreme pain until alcohol (which is only a couple of drinks) is out of system at 5 or 6am, no relief or worsening of pain on movement of arm.

Long term rash on upper outer arms & on shoulder blade area for 6 months. Never itchy - dry rash & burns if any creams etc applied. Initially looks like large area of ringworm in different sizes but now looks like a general patchy rash.

Not a diabetic. Any advice appreciated.","Doctor":"Cannot say in your particular case, but there are particular clues about pain. While the pain may be felt in the shoulder region, unless pressing on the shoulder also causes it, it probably is not FROM the shoulder. Irritation of the diaphram, stomach, esophagus, pancreas can all be felt in the shoulder. Irritaiton of the stomach is very very common with alcohol. There can be some irritaiton of the breathing muscles especially if there is vomiting. Pancreatitis which is often from alcohol commony causes abdoinal pain with some throbbing straight thru to the upper back, BUT people with that are VERY sick and don't get over the pain quickly and usually have to be hospitalized for a few days."},{"Patient":"A couple of months ago I began feeling localized pain in seemingly random spots on my body.

Still no relief so now I am going to get a MRI of the brain tomorrow. I recently had a root canal and the pain is in different areas of my right side of my head. It hurts sometimes on top, up thru my nose and upper jaw and mostly the area behind my right ear. I sometimes feel a little light headed and my head like when I get a sinus infection.Do you have any suggestions","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The type of pain you are experiencing is also felt if oral cavity or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) has focus of infection. As you have recently been through root canal treatment, I suppose that the dentist must have checked your other teeth and may have informed you if any of them is infected. So we are ruling out infected tooth as a cause for pain you are having now.The other possibility is TMJ problem. This joint is associated with opening and closing of jaws along with side to side movements of the lower jaw. The problems with this joint are often felt in ear and can be felt up to temple and behind the ear. The upper jaw and nose might feel referred pain.Thus, before going for diagnosis of brain problems and MRI, I would advise you to visit a dentist or oral & maxilofacial surgeon for examination of the TMJ. If they rule out any problem with the joint or oral cavity, you should go for MRI of brain.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

The intensity of pain to the top layer of skin is very off the chart pains. Do I need to take a precaution ...often I do not know if food eaten or environment is the culprit. I firmly believe it is due to latex. I want to keep from anaphylaxis... what preventative measures do I need to have in place?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that you have allergies to more than one substance and you do not exactly know what substances are acting as allergens for you. Thus, firstly, I would recommend you to go for a blood test for allergy. It will show in results what food and environmental substances are acting as allergen for you and so you can be alert in your day to day routine regarding exposure to these substances and avoid yourself from exposure. This is the best precaution you can take.In addition, you can also keep antihistamine such as Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) or Cetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) all the time with you so that as soon as the reaction starts, you can take the medicine immediately and control the reaction.Also, if you are allergic to more than one substances that you can be exposed to routinely, you can talk with your physician about taking an antihistamine regularly as hypertension patients take antihypertensives. Always take care to try new medicines and food items.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

He had a lithotripsy 4 days ago for a kidney stone after having a stent placed for a week prior.  The stone was intially lodged in the ureter but was too high to have a basket retrieval so it was pushed back into the kidney for the later lithotripsy.  He was taken off Plavix and ASA he takes for 2 prior heart attacks. He was taking Hydrocodone every 4 hours for pain.  He also has a hx of prostate cancer successfully treated by proton therapy.  The stent was removed yesterday.  He developed low abdominal discomfort, lethargy, loss of appetite and a low grade temp.  He is voiding without difficulty.  IVP was done today along with a urinalysis, CBC and chem profile but all is normal.  Waiting on urine culture results.  IM Rosefin and PO Ceclor was started today.  He  continues with the low grade temp, now no higher than 100.8 but has no appetite (is drinkining) and falls asleep at the drop of a hat.

It is good that the IVP was already done which basically rules out an obstruction in the kidneys. He may have urinary tract infection in which he is already on antibiotics.

Alternatively, you might be having tooth infection or infection in the oral cavity which may cause swollen lymph node under jaw and jaw pain. It could also be a muscular pain. To reach a specific diagnosis, you should see a dentist for physical examination of the oral cavity and treatment of the cause.By the time you visit a doctor, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac DT 10 mg up to three times a day. Please do not do heat application to the area or salt water gargles as if it is related with infection, it may worsen.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Over the course of two days flexeril was given to me, one 5 tablet pill & also two 10Mg pills. The left side of my mouth & my chin has now been numb for two days. I m scared. Will this go away soon? What can i do? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Flexeril is a muscle relaxant which is given to you for severe pain in your neck. However, it is a typical side effect of this medicine that it may cause numbness on the one side of the body. As you are having numbness only on the left side of the mouth, it can be because of the side effect only. To answer your questions, I do not expect it to go away until the medicines will stop or will be changed. So you can consult your treating and prescribing doctor regarding this issue and discuss if medicine can be stopped or changed. I hope this information guides you well. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. Take care.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing a right side dull pain in my temple and at times sharp. My right side cheeks and face feels kinda tender when touched. I know I have been experiencing headaches and neck pains as well. Im just concerned due to a previous aneurysm on right side in back of my head lower to neck.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It is logical that you can assume it to be aneurysm again as you have had it before. However, if it was aneurysm, you should be feeling symptoms like pulsations, numbness over the area etc.What you are experiencing is a sharp and dull pain episodes in the cheek area which seems like pain from infection of the oral cavity or due to sinusitis. It could also be pain related to Trigeminal or Facial nerve. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity to look for presence of infection in the area. If dentist clears you for any foci of infection, an ENT specialist or physician can examine you for sinus or nerve related problems. By the time you see a doctor, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to thrice day to have relief from pain.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

I am suffering from face pain on the right side of my face. The most pain I experience as I lay down, I am not able to sleep for more than couple of hours a time, after that pain is horrible and i have to sit up and after time pain goes away. Pain is often throbbing and occurs most often by the cheekbone, but also next to nose, upper jaw and lower jaw. The problem has been there for already for months and doctors can t find the reason (sinuses clear etc.). What is this, what can I do to make it stop?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Have you ever been to a dentist after the pain started? Pain that isl involving only one side of face and throbbing in nature when you lay down indicates possible presence of the decayed tooth.When we lay down, the blood supply towards the head and face increases. This also causes increased blood supply in the teeth. If a tooth is infected or decayed, this increased blood supply can cause severe throbbing pain. The pain gets little relieved after one wakes up and sits. In addition, if the upper tooth is infected or decayed, it can cause pain in cheek bone, upper jaw and lower jaw and area around nose. Thus, you should visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity and looking for any carious tooth that can cause such pain. If that indeed is a cause, then getting treatment of the infection, root canal treatment, will clear the infection and relieve you of pain. By the time you visit a dentist, Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac DT 10 mg up to thrice a day will help in relieving pain.I hope this answer helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Taking therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help control the pain symptomatically and exercises will play an important role in stabilizing the spine and also improving the muscle strength to hold the spine without leading to nerve root impingement.In my clinical practice most patients need more than 15 session of physical therapy and they respond well.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I ve been having tailbone pain for about 10 months now mostly on the left side and about a month ago, the pain has started in left leg.

Right side of tongue feels strange, and slightly sore to swallow also. I m 40 but my wisdom teeth never came in, could this be a cause?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Usually, wisdom teeth come in mouth at the age of 18 to 25 years. However, as you have never had them in  mouth, it is possible that they might be impacted or locked in the jaw. As right side of jaw is causing you pain, let us focus on that only. Due to absence of physical space to come out in mouth or due to its improper position, it might be possible that the wisdom tooth of that side was locked in the jaw all this time and now might be impinging on the muscle of the mastication or nerve that supplies tongue causing you the pain and discomfort you are experiencing. It is also a possibility that a tooth might be decayed on the side of the jaw that is causing you problems, has developed an abscess that is causing these symptoms.In both cases, you need to visit a dentist to get an oral examination to find out if any tooth is decayed and taking x-ray of the wisdom tooth area to diagnose wisdom tooth related problem.By the time you et an appointment of the dentist, Ibuprofen 400 mg thrice a day will help you in getting relief from pain.

For the past week when I sneeze or blow my nose or even just so my teeth actually hurt like I had root canals done on all of my teeth. Tonight I went into a coughing spasm, I coughed that hard that I got a weird feeling an blacked out for a few seconds. My head hurts, I feel really weak and my face feels has a hot feeling ,but my temperature is 98.9. Could I have broke a blood vessel in my head from coughing so violently and why do my teeth hurt so bad? What could I have and what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you have got root canals on all of your teeth, if the treatment has been done well, there is less chance that the teeth can cause pain as they have become non-vital after root canal treatment.In addition, the root of the upper molar teeth lie near to or inside the maxillary sinus. So when the maxillary sinuses are congested sue to could and sinusitis, they cause pressure on the teeth and cause pain. When you cough or sneeze or blow your nose, the fluid moves inside the sinus and that causes severe toothache. When your cold and sinusitis will get cured, you will find relief in toothache. You have not broken any blood vessel in brain so do not worry about that.Thus, I would advise you to take Azithromycin 500 mg (Azee 500) once a day for 3 days along with Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) once a day for 5 days. You can also use nasal decongestants. Hot water vapor inhalation will help a lot in clearing sinuses. If you do not feel better in 5 days, you should visit an ENT specialist for further investigations and treatment.If the teeth keep paining after clearing sinuses, you should visit a dentist to follow up on the teeth for re-infection in the root canals.

Painful swollen lymph node that aggravated with heat application indicates presence of the infection of area that drains in that lymph node. The infection could be from the ear or from the temporomandibular joint. I would advise you to start with the antibiotics course. You can take Cefixime 200 mg (Topcef) twice a day for 5 days.

If it is a bony issue which found during examination than x-ray should be fine but in case if we find something like capsular issue of the shoulder joint then an MRI might be needed.based on the clinical findings and correlation with the MRI or x-ray will help an accurate diagnosis. treatment will be simple pain killers and more of physical therapy as this looks more of a muscular weakness and needs a thorough strengthening protocol.In my clinical practice such cases undergo a thorough clinical examination and an MRI post which physical therapy strengthening protocol helps them alot to recovery.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My wife has an intermittent burning pain that shoots to her left foot second, third, & fourth toes.

Cancer of tongue is treated with surgeries first and removal of part of tongue always brings complications in eating and talking etc. compromising the quality of life. The shooting pain you are experiencing on the back of the skull is due to the surgical procedure that may have cut the nerves invaded by cancer. Due to damage to the nerves, experiencing these shooting pain episodes is usual. You are taking opioid analgesic Morphine which should control the pain episodes.

I couldn t eat for 2 days without it hurting very nadly. Now when I sparr and get hit there again it hurts everytime, and I always have a little pain sometimes when I chew or after I wake up in the morning","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Pain in jaw due to trauma even after a few months can be due to fracture or crack in the jaw bone that has not healed properly or the bone may have infected or due to trauma to the teeth which may have become non-vital due to impact of trauma and now presenting with pain as a result of infection in them. If some tooth may have fractured, it can also cause pain while chewing or when the upper and lower teeth meet as a result of cracked tooth syndrome. I would advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and get an x-ray of the injured area done. If it would be a bone problem, it would reflect in the x-ray. In addition, the doctor can do the pulp vitality tests of the teeth injured that can show if teeth have become nonvital. The doctor can also check for cracks in teeth with dye or by biting test.By the time you visit the doctor, you can take Acetaminophen 500 mg or Ibuprofen 400 my up to 3 times a day for relief in pain and discomfort.I hope this answer helps you.

If it would be an allergic reaction, it should be controlled by this medicine.However, if it does not resolve in 5 days or increases as time passes, you should see a skin specialist or an eye doctor.I hope this information helps you.

As you were symptomless after the surgery for some years, the problem you are experiencing now seems like a muscular problem and not bone related.

As most medication are symptomatic and not a cure purpose basis.For the cough and breathlessness this happens due to poor respiratory system. The best way to improve the poor respiratory system is by improving the lung capacities in the form of doing regular breathing exercises and nebulization. Now nebulization will help loosen the mucous and and breathing exercises will help improve the strength in the respiratory system. the chest pain is due to the weakness of the respiratory muscles as the respiratory muscles wioo get tired and fatigue due to breathlessness and heavy work of the respiratory system.Now in my clinical practice most patients with such issues are referred to physical therapy for strengthening the respiratory muscles and most of them are above 80+ , who gets helped for their breathlessness issue.Regarding the operation, I will advice you to try out physical therapy for regaining strength of the respiratory muscles and you can surely avoid the surgery. as per me I do not feel the operation will solve your problem.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Car insure 500 is recommended for my ankle pain for 15 days one per day I am 59 yrs old lady with BP .Along with that Cap.Snepdol is given two caps daily .Any side effects are there,and the swelling at the ankle is not reducing completely.

A natural process of healing will take anywhere between 5-7 days and you should allow that to happen without aggravating it further.In my clinical practice for pain and inflammation therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy for pain helps when patient underwent physical therapy.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was in the garden, when i accidentally stabbed my self between my forth and fifth toe on my rake.

It goes on 24/7. Every single day. Have seen numerous specialists. Had a total hysterectomy in mid twenties. I am now 53. Have several bulging discs in back and one in neck. However, the doctors do not believe they are bad enough to cause this extreme pain. The pain has increased over the years. It is always like cramps from a period and increases to the extreme of labor pain. I have IC, IBS, chronic bladder infections. During my hysterectomy the surgeon nicked my bladder in several places and I came home with a catheter for two weeks. At times the pain is worse than others. The really bad times last for 2-3 weeks and then I get some relief but pain never stops. I have become disabled by this after working for 33 years. If I stand on my feet for more than 10-15 minutes the pain intensifies greatly. Last year I battled Non-Hodgkins MALT lymphoma of the stomach. Two physicians stated they believed the cancer caused the pain. However, I have been in remission for 7 months and the pain is getting much worse. I have no life because of this pain. I also have Sjögren s Syndrome and osteoarthritis. I have asked several physicians about scar tissue / adhesions being the problem as besides the hysterectomy which was done by incision, I had a C-Section in 1985, and a huge ovarian cyst removed by incision during the very early 90 s and soon after the hysterectomy. But that idea was dismissed as they stated if it was adhesions it would have begun immediately after the surgeries. And they say IC and IBS does not cause severe leg pain. I have been tested for PAD and everything great there. Please help as I am at my breaking point. Right now I have another UTI, the 6th since October 2013. The UTI s make the pain much worse.

Do you think I need to see a neurologist","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. There are many reasons that can cause a tingling tongue along with numbness in gums and nose. It could range from vitamin and mineral deficiency to reduced blood flow to the area, injury to nerve supplying the area or neurological disease. However, Methotrexate is not one of the reason. Even though neurological problem sounds more like the cause of the problem, I would advise you to go for blood tests to check level of Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D.

So its tough to understand has she underwent the surgery for the lumbar spine disc?As she is having pain in her leg/hip, this looks more of a pinched nerve issue and now its already 3 weeks, you can try undergoing physical therapy at home. Using the therapeutic ultrasound therapy will help the wound to heal faster and reduce inflammation. TENS therapy will help reduce the pain and also control the pain to progress further.Also, post surgery due to inflammation of the tissues, the nerves can get irritate as well, for which patience is needed for the inflammation to come down. Using icing near the surgical incision site or lumbar spine region should help reduce the pain.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My left knee was replaced nov 11, 2014- had intensive rehab -however i stop going to rehab 2 months later, my knee stayed hot -like i had an infection ?

As your age is 69 years and also the TKR was done, now facing with back pain and also swelling of the leg, it is totally related to the overall body non-conditioning.As body is a single unit the conditioning of the body is of importance to balance the systemic requirements.Now coming to TKR - you should have continued your TKR rehabilitation program as by which you must have been helped more than even thought. The exercises post TKR are helpful to make the muscle stronger not only of the knee but also of the over body when we talk about rehab.If you were only performing TKR operated leg than the rest of the body needs an attention.Since you have a back ache, again, physical therapy is of the choice to help you out. Core stability is what needed.Also, for swollen ankle, you need to have a check for your heart and your vascular system. As due to weakness of both the swelling can occur frequently.In my clinical practice, patients post TKR undergo 16 weeks to 24 weeks of rehabilitation program for not only the TKR procedure but also for the overall body conditioning. And majority of them recover to the maximum.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was rear-ended in my vehicle in June of this year. Since then, my right elbow has been hurting.

I've since examined my testicles and nothing seems out of the ordinary. Furthermore, my semen is getting more thick and my orgasams are feeling more intense; this has been a development only over the previous few days, too. Do these symptoms pertain to anything in particular? I'm not experiencing any major irritation, but I would like peace of mind. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, The given symptoms do not significantly particular to any major problem. Still do talk to your doctor in person. Hope I have answered your query.

By the reduction in the inter vertebral disc space there will be compression on the disc which is a jelly substance in the inter vertebral disc to provide act as a shock absorber. Also when muscles fail to hold the vertebral body in place the pressure applied to disc may in turn compress the exiting nerve roots and leads to pain and weakness.As in my clinical practice such patients with high level of disc injuries we refer to physical therapy and MRI. With physical therapy like therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the pain can be controlled for a limited period of time and in that duration strenthening the muscle groups of the neck is important. Also, the therapist can provide manual traction and release the pressure from nerves to provide good relief.Most cases in my practice respond well to physical therapy .RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi, I woke up this morning and I had this terrible pain on my upper back.

Also Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have been useful to reduce the pain but importantly exercises are the choice.meditation helps improve the control over the anxiety and leads to cooling of aggression.Breathing exercises helps to improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which acts as a fuel in the metabolism and reduce the metabolic waste as well.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My leg always feels numb and now it is starting to give me a really bad sharp pain running up my hip, I had an ultra sound because my doctor wanted to see if i had maybe a blood clot, but nothing...this pain is really interferring with me walking...and sometimes i have to stop because the pain in so sharp","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough clinical neuromuscular assessment is advised.As you have a sharp shooting pain and numbrness you need to undergo a Neuromuscular assessment along with MRI of lumbar spine as this may be due to pinched nerve.post which taking a physical therapy like therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy will help reduce the pain.

I honestly feel pressure in the rectum that is constant and it s a very strange unfamiliar feeling. I ve had a pain in my upper hamstring (believed to be caused by running). It was high up where your thigh meets your buttocks, so at first I was wondering if there was some connection between this which preceded the feeling of pressure in my rectum. Thank you.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As mentioned ,that you were practicing for the run and feels like the digestive systems has some issue due to hamstring pull than there is much less possibility for this.Also, for run you need to balance your diet intake and your run output as well. Due to excessive loss of water during the run practice in the form of sweat and other metabolism there may be a chance for the hard stools. For this I will advice to eat the fruits more to balance the fluid intake and output.Now coming to your hamstring, if I has got a pull or a tear we need an assessment of the muscle to be performed. Also intially you have to stop training first as it will aggrevate the muscle fibres to not heal and later it may trouble more. Also, undergoing proper physical therapy before training is advised to get the maximum output from the muscle.I deal with sports cases regularly and prevention is better than cure for the longer runs. with physical therapy they respond well and perform better in a later stage of sports.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I workout with heavy weights and also smoke marijuana.

I had bells palsy on my right cheek last January 2014.I m now ok,my face is symmetric,corners of my mouth are also symmetric but my right eye is still tearing.My question is,the thickness in my cheek is still sign of my bells palsy,but why I fell thickness(sometimes mild pain) in my shoulder?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The thickness in the cheek and jaw you are feeling is because of the residual effects of the Bells Palsy just like you have tearing right eye. It might go away eventually like other effects of Bells Palsy.In addition, the thickness you are feeling in the shoulder is not actually due to the shoulder problem, but it is referred pain. Referred pain is always felt in the area that is far from the area of disease or injury. As the feeling of thickness in jaw and cheek with tearing eye will resolve, the feelings of thickness in shoulder will also go away.I hope this information helps you.

Veins are the blood tubes that carry deoxygenated blood from various parts of our body to heart and lungs. If these veins become abnormally thick, twisted or tortuous, they are called varicose veins. Usually these happen in elderly people, but if there is some abnormality in the vein wall, you are obese, your routine requires you to stand for very long periods of time then younger people like you may suffer from it, too.To get relief from this, you need to wear compression stockings that are available in medical stores. Do lots of exercise. Elevate your legs while sleeping and if possible, when you are sitting. Try to avoid continuous standing periods.

I have really bad teeth, that a little at a time I have been getting pulled out due to costs. I had an infection for the better part of 4 or 5 months but it didn't abcess until recently. I could just feel a huge puss pocket.  I finally got it pulled after being on 4 rounds of antibiotics on the 18th. It is a top back molar on my left side. The dentist informed me that the infection had completely eaten away the whole bone leaving my sinuses or sinus cavity exposed. Ever since then I have not been able to breathe out of my left nostril. I have been having pain since then in my jawbone on that side. Each day it gets worse but it's spreading. Now its right in the front of my ear a little above, in my ear, behind my ear and then wraps around the back of my head. The pain just gets worse each day. The dentist told me it shouldnt be hurting and he doesnt know what it is. I do not have medical insurance as well, so Im tryin to avoid hefty ER bills if I dont need to go. I'm just concerned this could be something more serious. Do you have any idea what this could be or what I should do? Thank you, Jennifer Duffy","Doctor":"Dear Patient,I can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. You are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. Roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity.In this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. It is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. It could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now.However, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. A blood clot may have filled the area. So what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ENT specialist. I know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. You might have to go for x-rays and probably CT Scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection.I hope this information helps.

I am not sure about the name of it in English. But I think he has inflammation on his Plica fimbriata. It hurts even when he is not eating.What should we do? Please help me.Thanks Best regards mercedeh","Doctor":"Hi Mercedeh,It might be possible that your boyfriend may have hurt or burnt underside of tongue while eating. Pizza or sandwich can do that some times.However, it would have been good if you could describe how long has he been suffering from pain or if you can see presence of ulcer or lump in the area.It sounds more like an ulcer and may take 3-5 days to heal. Meanwhile, to get relief, you can apply Mucopain or Dologel in the area 3-4 times a day, preferably before eating. It has an anaesthetic component that will numb the area for some time, so eating will be troublefree. If you find presence of lump or swelling in the area, do consult a dentist or physician promptly for physical examination.If pain does not subside in 5 days, I would suggest to consult densist for physical examination. I hope this information helps. Thanks for choosing HealthCareMagic.Regards,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"I ve been having really bad sharp pains in my stomach and keep having headaches to the point where I m about to cry it s so uncomfortable. About a month ago they diagnosed me with a UTI but I got medication for that and should be cleared, could I have something else wrong with me?","Doctor":"Dear Patient,It sounds like you may have stomach infection. Is there any history of eating out or eating possible bad food in recent past? If yes, then I can say little more surely that you may have stomach infection.You have taken antibiotics for UTI about a month ago, so they might not be able to cover you for the recent infection.Do you have fever? Headache may be associated with fever. Also, stomach infections are very notorious for being associated with headaches. So I would not advise you to take headache as a different malady. When the stomach infection will resolve, headache will disappear automatically.I do not know what medicines you took for UTI, but i would suggest taking Norflox 400 mg 2 times a day for 5 days. If the symtoms are not resolved, you might need to go for a complete blood test (CBC). Avoid this medicine if you are allergic to fluoroquinolones group of medicines. Furthermore, avoid eating out for a while and take diet that is easy for you to digest.I hope this helps. Wishing you good health. Take care. Thank you for choosing us to help you.Best regards,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hello, My sister has had major pains for over a month and a half. Many ER visits and still no understanding of a reason. Here is the issue: she has major pain that starts from her back. The pain travels to her abdominal region which then also causes pain in her lower abdomen and bladder area. The pain is a shooting pain and also a burning sensation in the back. The pain starts with or without food. After taking Motrin, she feels fine until the medicines effect goes away. We recently discovered that she was vomiting constantly early on a lot due to the pain. If she doesn't take the medicine, she vomits constantly and is in pain. Her test results: UA specific gravity low 1.005, blood large, leukocyte esterase traced, RBC 9 HPF HI. No gallbladder or pancrease issues. No evidence for cardiac arrhythmias. What could it be??? We only suspect kidney stone but cannot figure out what to look for in test that maybe all dr missed.","Doctor":"Hi,I appreciate your concern for your sister. I also advise you to go in the direction of the kidney stone diagnosis. The pain that starts from back, is shooting in the nature, travels towards abdomen and bladder, and is associated with vomiting is very peculiar indication towards kidney stone.I advise that she should go for urine routine test. That may show discharge of crystals suggesting kidney stone. To be further sure, she should go for USG (Ultrasonogram) stomach. Kidney stones, if present, can be diagnosed and located in USG. Meanwhile, she may take painkilers that suit her to relieve pain. Also, she should drink plenty of fluids. Drinking fluids will increase urination and so the chances of passing out small kidney stone in urine become high. I hope this helps. Thanks you for choosing us to help you out.Best regards to you and your sister,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"My ten year old has been complaining with not being able to get good breaths, he says it is like trying to breathe through a straw.

I cracked two ribs in the lower back last September. I was under Hydrocodone for a month to reduce the pain. During that time when I was taking the Hydrocodone, I was setting a whole day on a single couch with my laptop on my legs in a way that my neck and head are always looking down to the screen without anything at the back to rest my head. Also during that time I was depending on my right arm all the time to do things (i.e, pulling my self off the couch or bed using the right arm) since my cracked ribs were at the left side and I could not use the left arm. This situation last for about a month until I finished the Hydrocodone course. After about a week of returning to normal life, I lifted a heavy couch one day, and in the next day I my right shoulder starts hurting so bad (in the rotator cuff spot). I went to the doctor he gave me a cortisone shot in the shoulder and pain went away but still feeling it sometimes when I use my right arm for lifting something or even when I raise the right arm to the level of the shoulder. The doctor told me to go to a physical therapy program but I was lazy, unfortunately. Its been 5 months now and I was fine before I tried to make some pushups last week. When I did some pushups the burning sensation i the shoulder and arm starts again and I can feel that my neck (right side) behind my ear to the way down is also hurting. When I lay on bed and put a pillow behind my neck I ll feel that along with my shoulder. When I walk or go out the pain disappear immediately, unless I use the right arm to lift something. I have a meeting with a physiotherapist and I ll start following his instructions. Two doctors told me to go to the physical therapy. They told me that doing an MRI scan is unnecessary. I just want to make sure and liked to share my situation with you here. Thank you so much Jordan","Doctor":"Yes i strongly recommend  physical therapy .  Interferential therapy and ultrasonic therapy have been found highly effective  in controlling rotator cuff damage and eases out 90% of the pain when coupled with manual therapy and a rotator cuff strengthening exercise  program.

Meanwhile you can massage that area with wax and place pillows under your both knees while lying straight in bed, it will help relieve the backache.I hope this might be of some help. If you have any query feel free to ask.thanks"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing pain behind my left knee. My foot feels numb and kind of tingles. It hurts when I walk but I am able to bend the knee. I went for a short walk this morning, some of which was uphill. The pain did not start until several hours later. I am 72 years old and not in great physical shape. I am worried about a possible blood clot. What should I do?","Doctor":"Cannot diagnose or treat wtihout actually being there.Pain can often be localized to where the problem is by 1) poking areas and seeing what is painful. Joint pain varies a bit, but generally it hurts when moving the joint or bearing weight on it. Muscles often hurt after the exercise in situations that are NORMAL. Blood clots hurt soon after they occur and stay constant.2) the pattern of what causes the pain exercise causes pain due to lack of blood flow and occurs as a dull ache after exercise and often gets worse hours or a day later. If this occurs with minimal exercise atherosclerosis to the area and serious circulatory problems can be there. This would show other signs of an area not getting blood (pale, white, cold, poor pulse, etc.)these would need evaluation and treatment pretty soon."},{"Patient":"I gave started having chest pains with pain under the left arm and down it.

Sometimes it goes away - and sometimes it returns with excruciating shooting pains which keep me from being able to stand or walk.I am 55 and in fair health, though I don t exercise much. I was riding a bicycle the other day fairly strenuously - and then retired to a small restaurant with short stools to sit on. After about 20 minutes I stood and felt a little pain - then got into a taxi for a short drive to my apartment - and by time I reached there I was almost incapable of getting out of the cab. This was a month ago.I ve done chiropractic before and so went to a trusted practitioner, had several treatments with varying degrees of temporary relief but the pain keeps returning daily.I have also noticed a lump along the ridge of my left hip just off-center from my spine... and that I didn t have one on the right side (my initial pain was on my left side). I ve tried massage with heat and oils to reduce or eliminate the pain with no success.I m tired of putting up with the consistent pain, and also the worry of sitting wrong or for too long and not being able to walk when I stand up.If I experience pain when I stand I can get some relief if I sit back down and bend over stretching the area... I can at least stand up and walk even though there s still residual pain.Realizing it s impossible to diagnose accurately online - I d like recommendations.","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for your question at HCM Most commonly Low back ache can be attributed to bad posture or muscle pull/ strain due to abnormal stress on back like sudden twisting movements or lifting weights etc. But  I think it needs further work up since. 1. you have back pain for after sitting for 20 minutes( not expected at your age). 2. you have  start up pain( pain on getting up form sitting position- indicates some form of instability in the back , muscular or bone)3. new onset pain like sensation in one of your legs( might suggest pinching of nerves in back) 4. no significant improvement in pain after several treatments, heat and medicine( suggests severity of underlying etiology) and 5. you have relief of pain on bending forwards( can suggest arthritis of facet joints - joints in your back). The most basic work up will include a thorough physical exam and X Ray of your spine. Further course of action will be decided based on them. Online solutions might help you in muscular strains and postural pain , but not if there is some pathology in your back.The lump like feeling in your back can be due to muscle spasm or bony instability, which further calls for a visit to your physician to be more sure. In the mean time,I would suggest you to go through websites on ergonomics. Ergonomics is branch of science which deals with posture adjustments according your livelihood. It will help you choose a posture most suited for your daily routine. Also core stabilisation and back strengthening exercises wil help support your back in the long run.Hope this helps. All the best. Regards.Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"So I have a lot of pain and discomfort when sitting, laying etc at the top of my bum crack and bottom of spine. It s been very painful and doesn t seem to be getting better.I had had this previously about 6-8months ago and my doctor gave me cream to use. Over time it went away however I m not sure it was the cream.I have now had this same pain again for a week and I can feel a lump/bump under my skin, which hurts to touch...What could this be?? And how do I get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hi there. Thanks for your question at HCM . Tail bone pain responds best to offloading the pressure over it.Sitting cushion which is usually an horse show shaped or a doughnut shaped inflatable balloon cushion helps to offload pressure on tail bone. I suggest you to use it religiously irrespective of where you are sitting over at least 6 weeks to get any meanigful benefit from it. Also it is advisable to avoid sleeping directly over your back. Sleeping on the sides for a few weeks can help. Relieving the pressure over the tail bone is the most important step in relieving your pain. You can use any pain killer over initial few days. The lump is mostly the tip of tail bone . If this lump is something you have noticed now only , it is best that you see a doctor and get it examined.(any new lump needs to be seen by a doctor) Hope this helps. All the best Regards. Hi there.Thanks for your question. Tail bone pain responds best to offloading pressure over it..

Six weeks later I started having a dull ache in my groin area. 12 years ago I had a hernia mesh surgery. The ache is in that same area. I went to a sports doctor. He checked me for hernia. I don't have one. It has now been six weeks. The pain comes and goes. Some days no pain. I can walk without pain. I can go to the gym with no pain. Then out of nowhere it appears and escalates. Ibuprofen, Tylenol, advil . . . . they all do nothing. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Any idea what is going on? I think it could be nerve damage from my fall. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi there Thanks for your question at HCM Groin pain is most commonly associated with strain of of the muscles, ligaments, or tendons present in that area. This is more likely if the onset of your pain is associated with any injury which happened while playing or after you slipped or twisted.Such pain would usually respond over 2 to 3 days to rest, pain killer medicines and ice applicationHernia is one of the reasons for groin pain( but you mention that it has already been ruled out by your doctor)On the other hand if you have been having pain for more 6 weeks and it has not responded to the above measures then other cause of one sided groin pain have to be considered.

Now the red is gone and it is back to normal. The small area that was hit is still swollen. It is about the aize of a quarter and probably is swollen up about 3mm. it feels hard to the touch, but can still be pressed (but the pressing hurts a lot). Is this normal? Will it heal on it s own, even though it has been so long?","Doctor":"i there , thanks for your question at HCM.The swelling and the pain will reduce gradually over 5 to 7 days. Rest, Ice and bandage application with limb elevation on two pillows accelerates the process of healing over fort 2 to 3 days.I would ask you to follow these four things. However by third day you should experience considerable pain relief and should be able to walk with mild pain. If you are still not able to stand or walk after at all, I think it's appropriate for you to meet your physician and let him or her see it in person. Hope this helps.

This is more likely if the onset of your pain is associated with any injury which happened while playing or after you slipped or twisted.Such pain would usually respond over 2 to 3 days to rest, pain killer medicines and ice applicationAnother common cause of groin pain is an inguinal hernia. An inguinal hernia occurs when internal tissues push through a weak spot in the groin muscles. This can create a bulging lump in your groin area and cause pain. Kidney stones (small, hard mineral deposits in the kidneys and bladder) or bone fractures can cause groin pain as well.On the other hand if you have been having pain for more than week and it has not responded to the above measures then other cause of one sided groin pain have to be considered. These include urinary tract infection, any inflammation in ovaries ( in females) and testes (in males), intestinal inflammation, hip joint related pain etc Groin pain due to pinched nerve in the spine is relatively uncommon and is usually associated with involvement at higher spinal levels mainly L2/3/4 levels. An L4/5 and L5/S1 problem is less likely to be associated with groin pain. At present there is not enough evidence to say that your L5/S1 disc is the reason for you groin pain.I would suggest you to see an orthopaedic surgeon , so that any lesion around the hip area can be ruled out and once that is done other less common cause can be ruled out in a step wise manner based on your response.

I am seeing a chiropractor who has used some electrotherapy, and adjustments to treat the pain. I feel immediate relief, but seem to be back in the same spot within 48 hours. He says he is reluctant to do an x-ray on me because I have endometriosis and he says it could damage my eggs. I am considering getting a second opinion. Could you please advise? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi there Thanks for your question at HCM The cervical related  neck and shoulder pain usually reduces over 2 to 3 months( with maximum relief over first month). Physiotherapy usually takes 2 to 4 weeks, to show any kind of meaningful relief . Analgesics medications in tablet form or local applications can increase the amount of relief. Posture modification is one of the things which can add to the benefits of physio and medications.If you are working on a computer, there are several posture related adjustments, which can help you to fasten your recovery and help you maintain your cervical spine strength over time .Ergonomics is the field of science which deals with such adjustments. I would suggest you to go through websites which deal with ergonomics for working on a computer and adopt those postures. Apart from this, you should avoid sitting or standing in the same posture for more than 20 to 30 minus at a stretch, avoid looking into or playing on your phone for more than 2 to 3 minutes. These minor modifications can help you maintain good cervical spine postures.If there is no meaningful relief after 2 weeks, its worthwhile to get an x ray c spine. You can wear a lead apron to shield your tummy during x ray of your neck.Hope this helps All the best Regards,Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"my name is matshepo i was dignosed with endometriosis in 2008 and had a laparotomy done in june of same year.my problem is that the operation didn't help i even had to quit my job,i was told that my bowel is adherent to uterus.i'm 29 and everytime i menstruate is so painful and it becomes worse when a flesh like thing comes out.what can i do to help myself?","Doctor":"Hi, Endometriosis will cause such pain.

It hurt really bad for a few moments then felt better. I went back home but it hurts to walk. I can move all my toes with out pain. The pain mostly feels like it s on the top left part of my foot","Doctor":"Hi there thanks for your question at HCM. Ice and rest usually give relief in pain and swelling over the first two days. But you are not expected to have pain on standing or walking in mild injuries.Such pain should suggest you to take your injury seriously to avoid long term ligament related pains. If you have any pain when you walk or stand on your injured foot, it suggests severity of injury and warrants further work up which will include a X ray at the least. As walking or standing includes weight bearing, it induces stress on the soft tissues of the foot and hence helps to unmask milder forms of sprain of these structures. No t having pain on movements of toes indicates milder injuryHope this helps All the best. Regards.Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"Sneezing causes pain to the skin around lower anterior abdominal section.
