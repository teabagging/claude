Out side food might cause intestinal infections specially amebiasis in some regions which might give rise to gaseous distension and pain abdomen on the right side due to collitis. For this I would advise you for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and treat it if positive. Please carry on taking Nexium as before. In case some kind of infection comes out in the stool test, then further appropriate management could be done.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

She has had a lot of abdominal and epigastric pain - more epigastirc lately. She has had studies for growth delays, an abdominal ultrasound and an unsuccessful UGI. She is very afraid of having an UGI. We have a history of IBS, Crohn s, and ulcerative colitis in our family. Do you have any suggestions about diagnosing her problem? Thanks so much, Alison Flowers","Doctor":"Hi... I suggest that you get a fecal calprotectin test done for the kid. This offers a corroborative evidence for the inflammatory bowel disorders. If it is positive then the confirmatory test will be a endoscopy and a tissue biopsy with histopathological examination. If the fecal calprotectin is positive then we can later counsel her for going ahead with an endoscopy.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 13 month old baby girl - has very dark green poop - she is not in pain - she has movicol for constipation, drinks 1+ growing up cow& gate formula, eat all kind of meats, pasta, veggie, fruit, bread. i would like to know if it is normal for her to have this very dark poops?

Some patches have a clear skin in the middle. Her appetite is low and has alos developed a cold since this morning. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.By what you quote it should be an urticarial or a simple skin allergy. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose every 6th to 8th hourly for 7-10 days. Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days. If this happens, you can start using the same medicine but I suggest you get the kid evaluated with your paediatrician.But...Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly. I suggest you to upload photographs of the same on this website, so that I can guide you scientifically.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

I tried drinking milk to lessen the burn , but could it be maybe acid burns?","Doctor":"yes it's most likely an acid reflux and possibly associated gastritis ( inflammation of the stomach ) , the hint here is the pain after eating, and using milk to lessen the burn sensation. I recommend the following :- avoid eating pipers and spicy food - avoid caffeine especially in early morning - use one of the proton pump inhibitor for 1 month duration , use it half an hour before breakfast , try lanzoprazol 30 mg once daily or omeprazole 40 mg once daily , this dose is measured according to your body weight .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"i have a newborn that has reflux and is on a soluble tablet for it i have had to take him off breastmilk after changing my diet several times. he has been on two other formulas and now is on his 3rd.he spits up constantly no weight gain and cries after every bottle. he had fever last week and took him to the dr his lab came back okay she said he could have inflamed intestines. could a milk allergy have caused this? will the soy formula work or neocate formula? other formulas were nutramigen which caused his reflux to act up majorly and the other was allimentum it helped with the reflux just made his digestive system act up.. he is 2 months old and has cried continuously","Doctor":"the signs and symptoms of cows milk protein allergy includes gastric upset , vomiting, cramps, failure to gain weight and sometimes diarrhoea / constipation or bloody stool .in sever cases of cows milk protein allergy neocate is the gold standard formula because it contains completely hydrolyzed proteins into amino acid which doesn't cause allergies unlike proteins .the only problem is its coast . so another option is to use partially hydrolyzed formula like Nan HA or bebelac HA . it has a reasonable price and effective .soy-based formulas are not recommended because they cross reacts with cow's milk ( about 60 % ) which can cause allergy .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi my son got a Bcg vaccine when he was 16 months old.

But this morning, the mucus was a bit slimy (i don t know how else to put it). he doesn t complain of any pains but he does have trouble breathing because of the stuffiness. And breathes with a hard sound even when he is awake. what could this mean?","Doctor":"the most common cause of this condition is allergic rhinosinusitis , this mucous will turn into green in few days , and the post nasal drip will some times make him cough , the blood is because of the irritation of the mucous membranes .he is breathing difficulty because of the obstruction made by mucous plugs .since he has no fever, and no persistant dry cough there is no worries but something is needed to be excluded first , many children stuff their noses with any object the can find, so the possibility of foreign body stuck in the nose is there. so I recommend visiting you doctor to examin his nostrils . you can use nasal steroid sprays , it's very effective, you can use flixinase nasal spray twice a day, and zyrtic syrup will improve his condition ."},{"Patient":"My 9 year son old son get motion sickness hours after he has ridden on a ride.

The medication Nystatin that is prescribed to your daughter is an antifungal medication and as the patches respond to the medication, the child is suffering from fungal infection only and not herpes.

A dentist can take such swab and send to the laboratory. Based on the test report, such treatment can be started that the infection does not recur.

The description of the symptoms give the indication that the child is suffering from fungal infection. Thus, the treating doctor has also given antifungal medication to control the infection.However, since the white patches have not decreased and instead increased along with formation of ulcers, it seems that the child is suffering from viral infection. The bleeding in the gums can be due to presence of debris or plaque at the gingival margin of the top teeth which should be cleaned by a dentist after the ulcers are healed.

As the teeth are not decayed and show brownish discoloration, it seems that the child is having fluorosis in his teeth. Fluorosis occurs due to excess amount of fluorine in drinking water when the teeth are developing.

Right now, the teeth might be milk teeth but the effects may persist in the permanent teeth.However, if cosmetics is the concern, the teeth affected by fluorosis can be treated with bleaching or veneers that can be done by dentist.I hope this information helps you.

Fishy odor from breath does not seem to be related to the swallowing penny incidence or course of amoxicillin 2 weeks ago.It seems that the child's oral cavity is not cleaned adequately which is causing accumulation of debris, plaque and calculus around teeth and gum margins and on the tongue. I would advise you to visit a dentist for ultrasonic cleaning or scaling of the oral cavity which will remove all the debris, plaque and calculus. Make sure that the child is brushing is teeth twice in a day. Mouthwash can also be used if the child has learned spitting.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Mouth ulcers in small children can be due to viral disease such as herpes, fungal infection or vitamin deficiency. It is very difficult to reach a confirmed diagnosis and suggest treatment without clinical examination. I would advise you to visit a pedodontist (dentist who specializes in treatment of kids' dental and oral cavity problems).By the time you get an appointment, you can apply local Benzocaine gel (Mucopain) over the ulcers 3-4 times a day. It will promote healing and give relief in pain of the ulcers. Make sure that you keep your daughter hydrated by giving lots of fluids.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish your daughter feels better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...Hi doctor, my baby is 1 month old and he is doing motion in green color and before doing it he is crying means he is feeling difficulty in doing motion is there any problem?","Doctor":"HiI understand your concerns but don't worry. Infants show great variations in colour, consistency and frequency of motions. This usually improves gradually as the baby grows. Also, discomfort before it is normal finding. There is no need for treatment if your baby is feeding well, active, alert, urinating well and gaining weight.Ensure exclusive breastfeeding.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 1 year old daughter has a green swollen spot on her gum, I have never seen anything like it, it doesn't seem to bother her but it is green green. Like crayola crayon green - and no she didn't get into a green crayon, we already ruled that out. Any suggestions would be great, we are getting worried. She has a chest cold right now and has been on albuterol treatments for the last two days, could that have anything to do with it?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Usually there are no green lesions of the oral cavity. This is very rare. However, it is possible that some green food particle such as pea or herb may have been pushed inside the gum by the force of tongue while chewing. The green swollen area you are seeing might in fact be the color of the food particle. I would advise you to wait for a week and observe if the food piece comes out by itself. If it stays there for more than a week or if the gum area starts paining, then you should visit a dentist and ask him/her to remove it with a instrument.I hope this information helps you.

He had a mild case of thrush at 3months old and an ear infection at 11month. He also had bronchitis Feb. this year. Those being his only illnesses, he is complaining of pain in his mouth and lips, and his belly hurting. He has a fever, white patches on his tounge and have spread to his lips over nig. What is this and how do I treat it?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. There seems to be one of two possibilities in case of your son. Firstly, it is possible that the child has viral infection which is presenting as low grade fever, white areas in mouth and on lips and pain in stomach. Usually, viral infections heal by itself as the body's immunity takes over in 7-10 days and it is not treated by medication. Secondly, there is a chance that the focus of infection is in the stomach. Stomach infections are able to develop ulcers in the mouth that are painful. As the stomach infection will heal, the mouth pain will disappear. Stomach infection might need treatment with antibiotics.In addition, there is also a possibility that the mouth and stomach problem are different and coincidental and mouth problem is associated with another episode of fungal infection. To conclude, I would advise you to visit a pediatrician and pedodontist for clinical examination of the child and further investigations, if needed. I hope this information helps you.

I wish your son feels better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"My 4 year old has hit the edge of timber table and pushed her gum right up, leaving a semi circular 20c size shaped cut on her gum just above her teeth. The gum has come down and I have been giving her ice to help with the healing process. I was advised this afternoon when it happened that the mouth will heal this problem and not to worry taking her to get it stictched. The bleeding stopped and she was fine all afternoon, although when she smiled at me I could see a slightly brown cut line, and at the bottom of the gash it was a bit swollen. I am concerned that it may not heal properly and will distroy her gorgeous little smile for the period of her life, or perhaps she might have nerve damage and her teeth might die......... I need some advice, please, what should I do? should I take her to the jospital, should this be stitched, or have I left thie wound to long already? Thankyou.... Linda","Doctor":"Hi Linda,I can understand your concern. As far as the bleeding is stopped, there is no need of stitches. Slight rash and swelling will heal in a week by itself without any treatment. Smile will also not be distorted. I would advise ice application over the wound to reduce the swelling and have relief in pain. Regarding injury to the tooth, it is possible that the tooth might have hurt and it may die internally. For that, I would recommend that you visit a dentist after about a month and go for electric pulp vitality test for that tooth which will ascertain if the tooth is dead or living. If the tooth changes its color to brownish or black, then the tooth is definitely dead and you should go for pulpectomy treatment for that tooth. You do not need to rush to the hospital and the wound is also not left for too long already. If she is in pain, youcan give her 100 mg Acetaminophen or 162.5 mg of Ibuprofen.I hope this information solves your concern. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish the wound heals soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"10 1/2 year old female. type 1 diabetic for 5 years. has ongoing stomach pain and headaches with moderate to large ketones continuously over this time. running low grade fevers now with sporadic sugars from extreme lows to extreme highs? any suggestion for pain","Doctor":"OK, this an emergency , because children who has type 1 DM and having fever , their body build up ketones and metabolic acidosis , and this causes abdominal pain.  so it's very urgent to do a blood gas in order to know the Child's PH and bicarbonate. if ph is less than 7.3 and bicarbonate is less than 16 then your child is having DKA ( diabetic ketoacididosis ) and this situation can't be treated at home , and she needs to be admitted .if the blood gas is normal and the fever and abdominal pain suggest other cause like food posing or urinary tract infection , then you need to increase the total daily insulin by 10% .you look this up more by searching ( diabetic child sick day managment ) I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"my 2 1/2 year old son was suffering from fever from last three days and also having loose motion with mucus in it from last five days .

Are the patches painful? If they are painful, then there are chances that your daughter is suffering from viral or bacterial infection. In that case, antivirals or antibiotics should be given after consultation with a physician. If the patches are not painful, then it is possible that the papillae of the tongue that give rough texture to the tongue are located in such pattern. In that case, there is nothing to worry about. It could also be due to vitamin B complex deficiency that can be treated by oral supplements.However, I would advise you to visit a dentist once and let him/her clinically examine the tongue so that any abnormality can be ruled out and treated.

The dorsum aspect of the tongue has rough texture. This texture is due to the presence of different papillae on the surface that contain taste buds. In case of your daughter, it is possible that some of the papillae are overgrown and giving projection like look.

The recurrent swollen glands can be due to viral or bacterial infection, but the ulcer like lesions in the mouth seems to be like apthous ulcers which are painful ulcers healing in 7-10 days and recurring in different parts of mouth.Apthous ulcers can occur if the child has constant upset stomach or Vitamin B complex deficiency. I would advise you to start Vitamin B complex supplements such as B-Folcin once a day for 1 month. In addition, you can apply local Benzocaine gel (Mucopain) over the ulcers. It will help in faster healing of the ulcers and relief from pain of the ulcers. If the child is constantly having constipation or upset stomach, laxatives should be given after consultation with a physician. If the ulcers do not heal in 7 days or if they keep recurring, you should consult a dentist for clinical examination of the ulcers and further investigations along with treatment.I hope this information helps you.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

As you describe you had salpingectomy of right tube in 2005, and left side 7 weeks before, for the same reason. Still you are having pelvic pain, and pain on intercourse. First thing to be considered is whether  only tubes are removed or along with the ovaries, (salpingo oophorectomy) Including second operation you might have got both ovaries removed probably. it causes lack of eostrogen harmone , and drying of vegina etc. Which cause pain during intercourse. If it is the case Harmone replacement  therapy may be needed. If ovaries are not removed the pain during intercourse might be due to infection. Cause of pelvic pain could be remnant pelvic infection, or adhesions of the disease or operation. I advise you to consult your gyncologist for diagnosis and treatment.

One week, post abortion is too early to start your sexual life again. It is better to wait for at least 3 weeks before resuming the sexual activity. Have you got a check scan done post the abortion? If not, please get a scan done to make sure that there are no products of conception, remaining in the uterus. Drink plenty of fluids. In any case, it is better for you to get a physical examination done by your primary care physician. I wish you get well soon.

Below are the details: Weight at birth: 3.55Kgs (7lb 13oz) Lowest weight observed during first week: 3.29Kgs (7lb 4oz) Gained to birth weight by 11th day. Increased the weight to 3.60Kgs (7lb 15oz) We detected UTI on his 19th day. He already lost weight by that time. 3.40Kgs (7lb 8oz) He has been hospitalized and is on IV antibiotics for 5 days. Gained a few ounces. 3.52Kgs (7lb 12oz) Got discharged from hospital and is on oral antibiotics for 5 days. Gained a few ounces. 3.62Kgs (7lb 15.5oz) His Pediatrician suggested continuing the antibiotics (1 dose a day) for another few weeks and ordered VCUG test. He is having Strider almost all the time and the sound has been increasing. He has chest and throat retractions. He is on breast feeding but is not able to feed well because of the strider and the retraction. We tried pumping the milk in bottle which helped a little but not to the desired extent. On his Pediatrician referral we consulted Pediatric ENT specialist Initially on April 26th he thought its in moderate stage but yesterday May 16th he evaluated again and mentioned that its in severe stage and mentioned that a surgery is needed for correcting the same.

This tool even comes more after eating, it is so bad now that the girl is trying to avoid eating.","Doctor":"the frequency of the stool indicates there is diarrhoea even if the consistency is not watery, giving an antibiotic will increase the problem because most of these antibiotics can cause diarrhoea as a side effect and killing the beneficial bacteria in the intestines. the fact that ( stooling  ) occur after eating indicates that this child has what is called exagerated gastrocolic reflex , which is a normal physiology but increased by the hyperactive bowel from an offending agent .I recommend doing a stool analysis and culture to exclude bacteria or parasite .in the mean time you need to increase fiber diet to bulk the stool, and water to prevent dehydration , you can use smecta sachets which can decrease the amount of stool .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old son has a lot of food allergies and takes zyrtec for them.

When the blood seeps into the skin, it causes the familiar black-and-blue mark. Then, as the body breaks down the blood and reabsorbs it, the bruise typically turns a greenish-yellow.Bruises are more obvious on babies and younger children because their skin is thinner. They also tend to show up more on fair-skinned children. Some children simply bruise more easily than others.Wrap whatever you decide to use as an ice pack in a washcloth or paper towel before you put it on your baby's skin, and try holding it in place while you feed or cuddle him or look at a book together.If you think the bruise is painful (your baby cries out when it's touched, for example), ask your baby's doctor about giving your baby the proper dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Keep in mind that while these remedies can help with the pain and swelling, there's not much you can do for the bruising itself."},{"Patient":"Good evening.

From the description it appears that you are over weight, and have thyroid cancer , had head injury, now you have left sided pain, and shoulder pain. As you had thyroid cancer, there might be metastasis of the cancer cells to any part of the body like shoulder, back bone etc. The obacity also may be one of the causes of sedentary life. I advise you to follow some non medical procedures for the relief, like yoga, meditation, reading books, hearing music, etc for diversion from the agony. Wishing for a quick and continued recovery, and thanks for choosing H.C.M.F.

It seems that it usually happens after she eats sweets. For example yesterday she had cake and ice cream and that did it for her. She also complains about her joints and her hip hurting. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"vomiting after eating sweets is usually because of inflammation in the stomach / esophagus or a reflux . but before that happens the child will usually describe an epigastric pain , a pain right under her middle chest or sometimes in her chest . and a trial of PPI like omeprazole 20mg is helpful for 1 month , if persisted I recommend endoscopy .regarding joint pain and hip pains , if these are consistent with the vomiting episodes and the vomiting has nothing to do with abdominal pain then more history and complete physical exam is needed to reach a diagnosis , because so disorders like juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause all these symptoms  I recommend visiting her pediatrician to assess her .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My daughter is three months old, and has been in and out of he hospital for almost a month and a half now, first the doctors said she had the rhino virus, then she started having seizures a few days later, then an mri was done and they found bleeding in the back of her brain. all CT scans prior to this were normal and blood work was normal too. About a week later a skeletal survey was done and the doctors said she had two broken ribs. I was shocked to hear this and she was taken into cps care. she was in the hospital for two and a half weeks before they found the broken ribs, and now three weeks have passed and she just had a shunt put in this morning because of fluid building up in her brain. I dont know what is going on, or what could be causing this, they say she was tested negitive for shaken baby syndrome and there are no other signs of trauma. My baby has never been mistreated or abused, do you have any idea what could be going on?","Doctor":"OK, your baby got into stress because of flu like disease which was the rhinovirus , then started to have seizures right after she developed intracranial hemorrhage, and because of the that the small ducts that connect the fluid in the brain was obstructed and fluid build up ( hydrocephalus ) and they have to put a shunt . one of the inborn error of metabolism can cause this and this disorder is triggered by stress (like the flu ) and causes intracranial hemorrhage which usually is mistaken as child abuse , which is called glutamic acid Urea type 2 , a rare disease but can explain all these symptoms , and there is available test for it .but it doesn't explain the broken ribs , unless the child develops cardiac arrest and in trying to save the baby ribs broke .doctors will keep abuse in their minds because it explains all of the above symptoms , but it's a very sensitive, legal and diagnosed by exclusion.  I hope she becomes better soon"},{"Patient":"Hi. I m planning a trip to the south of France this summer with my nine month old daughter. My mom has me freaked out that it s going to be too hot for her because the place we re staying doesn t have air conditioning. We ll have fans going and open windows. Plus of course I ll keep her hydrated. Should I be concerned? I m also looking for information on heat seizures. If she has one, what do I do? What would be the consequences for her?","Doctor":"if you are going to keep her hydrated and make a balance between the heat exposure and the type of clothes she will wear , then you don't have to worry about anything . heat seizures or in medical terms febrile convulsions are not caused by excessive heat exposure, they are triggered by fever because of an infection or inflammation in a genetically predisposed children . so , there is a family history of febrile convulsions and you worry that your child is going to have one once she got fever then all you have to do when it happen is not to panic , keep her on her left side , don't put anything in her mouth and seek medical help . usually prophylactic antipyretics are useless , many pediatricians prescribe rectal Diazepam in recurrent febrile convulsions , and non of these you should worry about .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My son has been vomiting for no apparent reason - he is 4 years old - dr did an x-ray and said he was constipated- now he is taking muralax... if he doesn t take it for a day, he starts vomiting - now he is also saying the top of his head hurts. We have a CT scheduled. Is there anything gastrointestinally that could be causing this?","Doctor":"first of all , in order to constipation to cause vomiting it needs to be so sever that child can't pass stool for days or even more than a week .and sometimes sever straining in the bathroom can cause headache , but constipation is something you notice clearly and the child suffer from it and doesn't need an XRAY to tell you that . in other words : if your child has sever constipation, it can explain all this symptoms .BUT , if he doesn't, we should worry about increasing intracranial pressure; the pressure inside his head , which gives him headaches and vomiting , a brain CT and ophthalmic exam is very helpful to exclude this I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My 3 years old daughter just started going to school but doesn t listen to the teacher leading to daily complaints.

Pls advice.","Doctor":"yes , your daughter shows some symptoms of ADHD , but in order to diagnose her with such disorder , she must have these symptoms for at least 6 months . however, the next step in managing her is take more history from you about her birth , infancy period, siblings and other family history , and of course she needs a full body exam .if ADHD is highly suspected then behavioral and psychotherapy is the cornerstone in treating this child , and you can't do it alone , and she should be followed by experts in behavioral therapy . some medications can help with the hyperactive behaviour and the inattention .the good news you catch this early and your child has better prognosis because of this .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Am 33 years with a 14 month old baby. weigh 80kg. about to under go ivf and have to use microgynon 30. still breast feeding. is it okay to use while breast feeding? would like to continue breastfeeding .How long does it stay in the blood stream? can i also continue breast fedding while using suprefact injection? How long does this stay in the blood stream?","Doctor":"using of microgyron can affect quality and quantity of breast milk , small amount of steroids is passed in the breast milk , American Academy of Pediatrics says it's safe with nursing .half life 12-50 hours a very few sources talks about suprefact , some of them suggest not to take it if you are breast feeding , since it passes in the breast milk .half life is 80 minutes I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, My daughter age is 2yrs 4 months. When I consult the ent specialist, he told that she is is having Adenoids and ear infection. He suggested for Surgery, Surgery is the only way to remove the adenoids and ear infection ?

I belive she is obese 145 pounds for a 9 year old kid , it might explain the elevated liver enzymes in the absence of any other information, that's why sever obesity can cause fatty liver which can appear on abdominal songoraphy, the surrounding tissue might get inflamed and cause this elevated enzymes but detailed history and complete physical exam will reveal the cause .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in 2007 by colonoscopy after a course of Doxycycline and suffering for about 3 years. I went into remission after this with a course of treatment with Lialda, Canasa and Hyosycamine, although I truly suspect the colonoscopy prep triggered the remission, as I was fine for a week before starting these meds. I have been suffering a flare since last June, and am not responding to the treatment this time. Any advice? I have also had tachycardia for years, managed with atenalol for the past two years.

Thanks for choosing H.C.M.F. You have got ulcerative colitis, got treated for that and you are fine. Flare since june, and no response. you have got tachy cardia and using atenolol. Tachycardia might be due to Hypertension, that is got treated, and anxiety. Flares also might be due to hyper acidity of the ulcerative colitis, or secondary to anxiety. I advise you to consult a physician for treatment of anxiety and diagnosis of underlying causes of your problems, and treatment. Besides i advise you some diet recommendations as avoid taking more of spices, junk foods, and oily foods. i also advise you to follow some nonmedical procedures for diversion as yoga, meditation, gardening if interested, reading books, and hearing music.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the kid in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If the baby is still crying - put in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

It started as a little pain in my lower stomach, over the course of about a week it slowly localized to my lower right abdomen. I was constantly peeing and there was no sense of relief after peeing like there normally is and I also wasn t letting out a lot of urine. Eventually the pain was constant but sometimes it wasn t as bad as others. The pain eventually got so bad I had to go to the hospital, the doctor finally got around to me after waiting for about 5 hours, she pushed on my side and just by the way I jumped when she pushed she told me it was most likely appendicitis. The nurse told me I would have to stay on an if overnight and get an ultra sound in the morning. The ultra sound didn t show anything but they said my appendix might just have been behind something so they decided to do a cat scan even though they normally don t do them on someone as young as me because they wanted to be sure. After the cat scan the doctor told me I most likely had mesenteric lymphadenitis and if he were to magnify my cat scan results he would see swollen lyphnodes and he basically said there was nothing that would get rid of it, but it would eventually go away on it s own. He said they would normally have someone with this stay on iv fluids for a few days but they just didn t have the room. The doctor suggested drinking Pepsi because it has a lot of sodium and that would help almost like how you gargle warm water with salt when the lyphnodes in your throat are swollen. So I took his advice and also booked an appointment with my doctor for about a month later. I told my doctor what the doctor at the hospital said it most likely was and he said that it could be that but brushed it off saying it was probably just menstrual pains, I m no doctor but I don t think menstrual pains are a permanent pain. He also said it could be a very small ovarian cyst which is too small to see on an ultra sound and therefore too small it worry about. Five months later I m still in the same amount of pain as when I went to the hospital.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

I have an 8 year old daughter who is very active but has a very large midsection. She is an Irish Step dancer, plays soccer on a team year round and is involved in other sports on a recreation level. She is what I think you would consider a stand out athlete at this age as she is very strong, agile and fast. She eats very healthy, as does the whole family. Very little red meat, lots of fruits & veggis, everything low sugar, etc. She does not like to sit around. She loves to play actively all the time. Her sisters are close in age to her and eat the same foods and are thin. We feel like we need to cut her off from the amount that she eats b/c of her size. Everyone else can have more if they are still hungry and it is very challenging as a parent to encourage her not to have more. Is there any reason she should have this much fat in her mid section. You can see the fat and it is also fatty around her breast area. She has had a big belly since she was a baby but we always expected it would go away as typically the case with young children. Any suggestions would be great.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic. I understand your concern. Your kid is definitely overweight. There could be two reasons for this.1.

By just pulling and massaging, the shape of the nose cannot be changed. Actually the nasal bones and facial bones keep growing till 14 to 16 years of age.

Vertigo is feeling dizziness especially while sleeping, turning head positions or posture. Vertigo can happen if you are suffering from middle ear infection or if you have temporomandibulat joint (TMJ) problem. This joint is near ear and it helps in opening and closing of jaws along with side to side movements. If you have ear pain or related symptoms, it might be due to infection in the ear. If you are having pain or clicking noise while chewing, it might be due to TMJ problem.I advise you to visit an ENT specialist for clinical examination of the ear for presence of infection. If the ENT negates any presence of infection, I would recommend you to consult an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the TMJ and investigations.I hope this information helps you.

I thought it may have been stomach pains at first but now think it was his nappy area as when I changed him he screamed if I went near his ball sack . He has been doing really smelly and runny (although not as runny last couple of days) poos with seeds in them and his bum is very tender now as he seems to be pooing a lot .ive managed to get him back down now but wondering what might be causing his poos and what to do?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for choosing H.C.M.F. Your 11 month old son is screaming in pain, feeling pain when you touch his nappy area near ball sack, and also while pooing. It appears to be the nappy rash that is causing pain, caused by loose motions , as the motion contains seeds it represents indigestion, and stomach pain also would have been there. The stools is smelly and runny, so it must be with lot of infection. I advise you to consult a pediatritian for diagnosis and treatment. You may have to get the stools examination for bacteria, and reducing substances, besides other routine tests for confermation of the cause. If reducing substances are present lactose containing foods should be excluded from the diet of the baby. Wishing for a quick recovery. Best regards."},{"Patient":"hi my friends son has been having a small fever, alot of stomach pain and frequent headaches. he has been to the er but the tylenol they gave him is not working. he is not eating much either and his mouth has small blisters and his lips are chaped. what else can i do to help???","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that the child is suffering from the stomach infection that is causing the headache, fever and stomach ache. Tylenol alone will not help to cure the infection. Based on the age and weight of the child, the child needs to be given antibiotics.In addition, the mouth blisters that the child is suffering from can be attributed to the stomach infection or presence of vitamin B complex deficiency. This should subside itself after the stomach infection is cured. You can also start Vitamin B complex supplements such as B-Folcin once a day. Also, local Benzocaine gel (Mucopain) can be applied to the mouth sores for faster healing and relief from pain. I would advise you to visit a pediatrician for the clinical examination regarding the stomach pain and for the prescription of antibiotics based on the age and weight of the child. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish the child gets well soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"My 1 year old has a very red groin area that is causing him pain. My dr. had prescribed Traimcinolone for the bad spot of his Egzima (spelling?) and I did use a little in the creases between his legs last night and all day today he has been uncomfortable.......I have been trying to keep him dry and clean and have been using Zinc Oxde cream, but not helping. He is obviously in pain.","Doctor":"Hi...I understand your concern. I suggest you upload the image of the groin area of the infant on this website and get back to use please. I am suggesting this because - skin conditions are always best diagnosed and treated after direct visualization. This is all the more important as the kid is not responding to a long acting steroid like Triamcinolone.Hope this helps. Please get back to us as suggested.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son, who is almost 2, has swollen gums and I believe he also has swollen Lypmh nodes under his jaw. He has been complaining of pain in his mouth and has been fussy. He has been cutting a lot of teeth recently, which I think may be the problem, but whenever I brush his teeth recently he cries in pain and the gums bleed. I have taken his temperature and so far he has no fever. But, the swollen Lymph Nodes do concern me, and I wonder if that is usual for children cutting teeth, or if I should be more concerned. He also had a cold and a sinus infection and has just recently Since it is the weekend I can t take him to his doctor, so I was wondering what may be causing this and rather I should be more concerned or if it can wait until the weekend is over.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The gums might seem swollen as the primary teeth might be erupting into the oral cavity around this age. At this time, the gums overlying the erupting teeth become sore and they cause pain which makes the child fussy and irritable along with his denial to eat anything. However, the swollen lymph nodes indicates presence of infection which might be in the gums as an alternative to the diagnosis of the erupting teeth. The gums in rare cases swell and get infected and bleed a lot in small children. It may require treatment with professional cleaning/scaling and a course of antibiotics.I would recommend you to apply orajel over the gums for easy eruption of the teeth. In addition, consult a dentist or pedodontist after the weekend is over for clinical examination of the oral cavity and ruling out presence of infection. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish your son recovers soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"When my baby was 6 months old, he got a tiny pink spot on his forehead that slowly got slightly raised, and very red.

If she was on actrapid for a whole month then she shifted to novorapid , this may results in any undesirable effects or not ???","Doctor":"actrapid is regular insulin while novorapid is rapid acting insulin, which means it takes half the time the actrapid needs to reach its peak actrapid lasts longer but if the amount of carbohydrates is calculated correctly and given the appropriate amount of insulin either novorapid or actrapid ; it shouldn't be a problem shifting the child to novorapid, in fact it's faster which means your child can eat within 10 minutes of the injection .I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"my one year old has tonsilitis (as diagnosed by my GP yesterday) and associated fever.

While I ve pain in the lower right back and near the rib cage (of back), I ve internal pain/burning/discomfort in the front side. I suffer acute pain on the front side when I m starving. I do not know what is the exact region. And further if I hold urine for a long time and pass I experience pain in the right testicle and burning under my right foot. If I stretch with my hands up I get a muscle pull just under my ribs at the back side on the right. I ve shin splits on the right limb. I also experience complete squeeze out of energy in the right limb some times. Could you please explain to me whether this is more related to a muscle, like a spasm , OR something related to Gastrointestinal disorder OR something related to kidney stones? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for calling H.C.M.F. Pain right abdomen near the rib cage, and to the front, acute pain when starving, all these suggest gastric irritation, or peptic ulcer. This is to be treated first to solve the confusion. If you stretch your hands up you get muscle pull under the ribs, at the right back,lack of energy in the right limb some times, this is all suggestive of muscle pain due to some systemic infection, cervical spondylosis, If you hold urine for long time and then pass urine you get pain of right testicle and burning in the foot may be due to kidney stone on the right side or urine infection. So it is to be treated as a second step. Muscle pains could be secondary to the U.T.I.or kidney stones. I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment . You may need to have M.R.I. of the urinary system, and cervical spine and gastroscopy for confermation, Wishing for a qiuck recovery.

My grandaughter has being having seizures since she was 3 years old and she is now 8. Her seizures got worse through time but then stopped in the last 12 months. But she has now had a couple of short ones. I have been looking into the ketogenic diet. My daughter is not pushy enough to ask for this help. How can we look into it more. My daughter has already asked about the diet but is not getting any response from anyone. I feel i need to help both my grandaughter and daughter with this as as i said my daughter is too shy to ask. They attend Walsgrave hospital and only go to Birmingham on the odd occasions. Not enough appointments in my eyes.","Doctor":"Hi.... I understand your concern. In your query you have said that the kid is not having any seizures for the past 12 months. Then in that case I don't think a ketogenic diet will be necessary. Ketogenic diet can be tried only for intractable seizures. The other option which you can try if the seizures start again and uncontrollably -  is using by Pyridoxine at 40 MG per day on doctor advice.Regards - Dr..

I am wondering if the blood has been there on and off for this long and it either changed color or I just didnt notice it. What are the causes of blood in stool? Could this cause the iron deficiency anemia? He has been taking iron now for 2 days. What should I do now that I have seen blood again?","Doctor":"Hi I am dr Kadhir,At first I wold explain you the causes behind blood in stools.. most common cause in a well thriving child is food allergy, that could be cows milk, wheat(gluten),nuts depends on the allergen.. or a bacterial infection (dysentery ).. but in dysentery kids usually have fever, abdominal pain and vomiting .. If child is having constipation causes like rectal ulcer, fissure should be ruled out.There are few serious conditions but they are so rare .. they are uncommon in a well thriving child. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)is one such condition but I have seen only 1 infant with IBD in past 9yrs of pediatric practice .I can reassure that this could be normal if baby is otherwise doing well. Find out the food and avoid it, its the best way to diagnose allergy .wait and watch for recurrence of symptoms .Iron deficiency anemia is common in this age group, as mother's milk is not a good source of iron and body's normal iron stores deplete by the age of 6 months, it is good that u start iron supplements and iron rich food.It is difficult to comment the relationship between iron deficiency and blood in stools. But occult blood loss is definitely a cause of anemia in conditions like meckels diverticulum in a well thriving child.My best advice is avoid allergen, wait and watch , treat anemia.. follow up if symptoms reccur or if anemia not improving..

I have 2 days left on my antibiotic and I still have symptoms and they seem to have gotten worse.  I now have this pain in my lower abdomen when I sit down or stand up.  This just started maybe a day ago or so.  The pain is very uncomfortable and I'm not sure what is going on.  I get chronic UTI's so the fact that the antibiotic isn't working and I have this lower abdominal pain concerns me.  I do not have insurance and I know that the ER will just tell me to go to a OBGYN which is what they told me before.  Any insight?","Doctor":"Hi,  thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Most often, UTI is caused by gram negative organisms. Acute infections usually involve a single organism and are self limiting.. Recurrent or chronic infections may be mixed infections. It could be due to many reasons like bacterial infections, Diabetes Mellitus renal calculi (stones) etc. Since you seem to be getting repeated infections,  cause of UTI needs to be investigated instead of taking antibiotics  every time. Bacteriological investigations are important in deciding the choice of the antibiotic. Although we dont usually wait till the arrival of report for starting the antibiotic,  urine sample must be collected before starting the therapy for better results. Most antibiotics attain high concentrations in urine and so may be effective in lower UTI. But in upper UTI (like pyelonephritis), the antibiotics needs to be concentrated in kidney tissue. Antibiotics are given for 3 to 5 days. In recurrent UTI, the choice of antibiotics are Cotrimoxazole, Cephalexin or Norfloxacin. The pain you are experiencing may be due to cystitis (bladder infection), pyelonephritis (kidney infection) or renal calculi (stones causing obstruction and subsequent infection). Ruling out these possibilities is necessary to decide further course of therapy. Inadequate therapy or indiscriminate use of antibiotics is often harmful as it can result in development of resistance.  The organism or bacteria will not be sensitive to the antibiotic if it becomes  resistant to it. Hence you should complete a full course of antibiotic. I hope it is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, We have got thyroid test done for our 8 months old son.

There are certainly alternative management therapies in allopathy now-a-days. Medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100% controllable.2. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your paediatrician I would have suggested the use of Budamate metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Levolin and this can used as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Budecort. The technique is very important and very crucial for the drug to be delivered correctly to the lungs. Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines.

From the explanation of the problem, it seems that red spots inside the lower lip are due to allergic reaction to some food item that the child has come in contact with.I would advise you to visit a dentist or pediatrician for the clinical examination of the bumps so diagnosis can be confirmed. Based on the diagnosis, antihistamines can be prescribed that can help in curing allergy.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

His spleen may be enlarged, and an impact or straining could cause it to burst(severe pain in the upper left part of your belly may mean that your spleen has burst. This is an emergency.)-->avoid drugs like Ampicillin  and amoxicillin.->In severe cases, medicines called corticosteroids may be used to reduce swelling of the throat, tonsils, or spleen. \\"mono,\\" is a common illness that can leave him feeling tired and weak for weeks or months.

Was your son born with dark tongue and discolored tongue? If that is the case, then there seems to be problem in the development of the teeth and tongue and it might be difficult to cure. However, if the black tongue and discoloration of the teeth have developed after birth, then it might be due to inadequate oral hygiene. When oral hygiene is not maintained well, plaque and debris accumulate on the tongue and teeth which may cause the discoloration or yellow discoloration.I would advise you to visit a pedodontist, dentist who specializes in the treatment of oral cavity of children or a dentist and go for ultrasonic scaling, which is the process which cleans the plaque, calculus (tartar) and debris from the teeth. He/she might also advise to use a mouthwash and about the care of tongue.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

As your daughter is 22 months old, she might be teething right now. When new teeth erupt in the oral cavity, tongue repeatedly touches the newly erupted tooth and that causes production of excess saliva. This is just a temporary phase.As all the teeth will erupt into the oral cavity and she will get used to teeth in mouth, the excess salivation and drooling will stop on its own.

During teething, the gums become sore and itchy and the child constantly wants to bite or scratch on something with the teeth .This makes children to eat anything that they can put their hands on. This habit sometimes cause stomach infection and food poisoning. In addition, because the child himself is annoyed with the teething process, he screams and acts irritated and annoyed. Holding on to you very tight is a symptom not associated with the teething process. You can discuss this issue with the pediatrician.

Mom told me to but salt on a wet towel and rub it in her mouth but it look like that would hurt. Is there something else less painful I could do? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that the oral cavity is not cleaned of the baby while bathing her. Before the teeth erupt into oral cavity, the oral cavity and gums should be cleaned gently with a clean cotton cloth. After the eruption of teeth, toothbrushing two times a day should be done and appointment should be made with a dentist every 6 months for examination of the oral cavity of the children.Right now, to make her feel better, you can apply local Benzocaine gel (Mucopain) over the sores and painful areas in the mouth. This gel can be applied 3-4 times in a day. In addition, for the sore bleeding gums, plaque attached to the teeth and making gums inflamed can be the reason. To resolve bleeding gums, an appointment with the dentist or pedodontist should be made for ultrasonic scaling of the child.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

The white patch over the tongue that can be scrapped off can be considered as thrush and not due to strep throat.

What you are seeing might be a salivary stone in the sublingual salivary gland.As kidney and tonsils develop stones, salivary gland can develop stone too which is white colored calcified mass. This mass causes pain at the meal times when salivary glands are stimulated. Thus, it causes pain while eating and otherwise it is painless. Alternatively, it can be a ranula, which is a type of cyst developing under the tongue area.I would advise you to arrange for a consultation with the dentist or pedodontist, a dentist who specializes in dental treatment of children for clinical examination and investigations like x-ray.

Are the marks causing your daughter any pain or discomfort? If they are painful, then it could be a bacterial infection or from trauma from some food item.

As you have rightly assumed, your daughter is going through the teething process. As new teeth are erupting in her mouth, she feels uncomfortable with the new feeling in her mouth. Because of this feeling, she is sticking out her tongue repeatedly. As she will get used to teeth in mouth, she will stop sticking out her tongue. She might experience excessive salivation and drooling, too.In addition, because of the irritation in her mouth and sore gums, she might be into habit of putting very odd thing that she can reach into her mouth. This causes stomach infection in many kids. Your daughter might have the stomach infection, too. Her excessive crying, screaming and sleeplessness can also be attributed to teething process as she herself is annoyed and irritated with the process.I would advise you to visit a pediatrician if she develops diarrhea and you can apply Orajel on the sore gums to make teething little easier for her.I hope this information helps you.

As you describe there is hot flushes, (hot flash across chest and upper back.)cold sweats , head ache an nausea. As you have hiatus hernia, and G.E.R.D. also when it is more it can elicit like this also, due to hyperacidity. Ofcourse it is also possible when there is fever associated with gastritisi it can be confirmed if you get fever in next few hours. Other possibility is jaundice confirmed by yellow urine and yellow eyes. But as it is mostly suggesting gastric symptoms i advise you to consult a gastro enterologist for diagnosis and treatment. You may have to go for gastroscopy besides other routine tests for confermation. Wishing for a quick recovery.

Any advice?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for writing to Healthcare Magic.I understand that yours daughter is suffering from Atopic dermatitis. Its important that the skin is not dried completely soon after bathing. Also its recommended that you do not use hot water to bathe. It should be lukewarm. Though this sounds silly , its important information. Also as soon as child is towel dried, its important to apply the cream for hydration all over body. This will help lock the moisture in skin. Use of full cotton cloths, socks. Avoid food items she is allergic to.Hope you find this information useful"},{"Patient":"I went to the doctors last thursday to have mirena taken out as it did not work for me.

I see you are taking good care of your child, nice to see that.Aches in the calf muscles is unusual. Kids usually don't have that, unless he is playing around a lot, running, jumping.

If he is having pain only one leg and its persisting even after giving tablets, or if he is having pain that is persisting even after taking medication, my advice will be to show a pediatrician. Yes, you can give Disprin for pain over the calf muscles. it is advisable. Its a prescription medication and for kids it depends of body weight how much we can give.

After eating she is fine again for about 4hrs.","Doctor":"Hello,Read your concernThere are many causes for which your grandaughter may have these symptoms.Please get her blood sugar level checked to rule out diabetes which may cause such symtoms.Also ,such symptoms may be seen in a condition known as insulinoma which is a tumour of the beta cells of the pancrease. This tumour is characterised by whipple s triad where signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia are seen with blood glucose levels lower than 45mg/dl. The characteristic feature is improvement of the symptoms on administration of glucose . This leads me to advice you to get the blood glucose, insulin and c-peptide levels tested.These will help us to rule out other conditions of hypoglycaemia as well.A proinsulin level is also adviced , if possible.Diagnostic imaging test would include USG,CT scan or an MRI to trace the tumour,if any.It will be appreciated if you could provide more details about her symptoms at the time of tremor.As for eg: does she get cold and clammy , irritated , anxious, does she sweat a lot  etc. These will be of help too.Hope you get back with the Blood reports.Take care.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr.Pallavi Jain"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old has had a high fever for almost 48 hours.

Of note - my lower right side has not been problematic in about 2 days.","Doctor":"Hello,erinlynn0730, You mention about having difficulty with bowel movements periodically. If you are constipated and have hard stool and strain during defication. it is possible to have hemorrhoids or fissure from which you can bleed. With fissure or tear in the lining of the very end of rectum, you get severe burning sensation. If you have internal hemorrhoids, they can prolapse or protrude after straining and you could feel a lump. If you don't have these and are having bright red blood , you need to see a colorectal surgeon or a gastroenterologist to have endoscopy, either sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to rule out ulcerative colitis or bleeding polyps. If you have a family history of colon cancer , you need to have colonoscopy for sure. The other problem associated with right lower abdominal pain and bleeding is acute diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis, pockets from the colon due to infection. Usually there may be fever , chills, bloody dirrhea and right sided abdominal pain. Hope this gives you some idea for what to discuss with your own doctor.

It ferls light sharp shooing pains. I keep belching and it hurts when I move. I have had a bowel movement but my stomach hurts when I go also when I urinate. It hurts when I eat as well. This is the second time this has happened to me. Last time it lasted a week and I went to the ER and after a scan they found nothing wrong.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Many conditions can result in pain around umbilicus (belly button). The possible causes are 1. Irritable bowel syndrome. 2. Appendicitis. 3. Gaseous distension. 4. Inflammatory bowel disease. 5. Gastric ulcer. You are probably suffering from pain due to gaseous distension without any organic (intestinal) obstruction. It results in sharp colicky pain aggravated by any movement. It can occur due to eating food like meat, cluster beans, dairy products etc., Stretching of the intestine due to gas will increase the pain due to increased intestinal movements, Most people try to relieve pain by belching. Minimal gas may not be prominent in scan as the intestines normally have gas shadows. Only gas accumulation due to obstruction will be prominent  in scan pictures. Simethicone, an inert anti foaming agent can relieve the symptoms. But, if the symptoms persist or if it impairs the ability to perform normal activities then you should consult your treating Doctor. I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My daughter is 9 month old now. She born fair and stayed fair till 2nd month.

Most probably it is because of muscle weakness which causes him to move his eyes in such a way. He would soon develop weak muscles if he continue using computer or put lot of strain on his eyes.

Doctor has recently advised her omnacortil forte syrup twice a day for a week. Is it good to give such strong medicine for a week? what is it purpose ? Regards","Doctor":"Hi...Omnacortil is an oral steroid. You have not mentioned how much the doctor has mentioned to give. It all depends on how much dose has been asked to give. But I feel rather then oral steroids twice  week - inhaled corticosteroids are far far better and safer.Suggestions:1. There are certainly alternative management therapies in allopathy now-a-days. Medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100% controllable.2. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your paediatrician I would have suggested the use of Foracort metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Levolin and this can used as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Budecort. The technique is very important and very crucial for the drug to be delivered correctly to the lungs. Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines. So I suggest you consult your paediatrician for this.3. Triggers can be environmental changes/ dust/ talcum powder/ seasonal changes/ un-cleaned a/c vents/ cold weather etc....we can specifically say this is the cause - unless we observe the kid closely - best person is the parent.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Generally it takes 3 months for the scar creation which is strong enough to hold your abdomen. However complete scar creation process and tissues remodeling is over after a year from the surgery.

You should also know that when you do wear abdominal belt, back muscles (so important for spine stabilization) are getting weaker and weaker. So such belt should be used only temporarily (when lifting or bending). And after 3 months of surgery it should be not used at all. Hope this will help.

But i m worried tht she may hav edward (psychological prolem) please advice? she still can t sit are speak...she is 1 yr 4 months","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. You are not wrong in your concern regarding the cleft palate and club foot being a part of a syndrome associated with mental or psychological problem.It is very difficult to assess online or ask you to assess her condition and find out the syndrome. As she is not reaching the milestones of sitting by herself or speaking a few small words, there does seem to be a need of a consultation by a pediatrician.Thus, I would recommend you to take your sister's daughter to a pediatrician for full physical and mental assessment and finding out all the symptoms associated with syndrome and the syndrome itself.I hope this information helps you.

Problem is that when he sleeps, suddenly he wakes up from sleep with coughing followed by sign of choking of saliva in his throat for a while. It is happening almost every night for last 2 weeks.I am very much worried about the problem. Please advice.Imrose Mohit from Dhaka,Bangladesh.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Adenoids are lymphoid tissues that all fetuses have but as soon as the children grow, the tissue shrinks, decreases in size and disappears. If it persists like it has in your son, it causes problems like sleep apnea, breathing problems, snoring, breathing from mouth, teeth development abnormalities etc. In such case, where adenoids are not disappeared on their own, a small surgical procedure is performed by ENT surgeon to remove them and manage all the associated problems. Thus, I would recommend you to visit an ENT specialist and go for further investigations and discussing procedures for management regarding enlarged adenoids.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM. I wish your son feels better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"My three year old boy had a high fever yesterday (103).

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Patient Details : Patient : Miss. Drishty Padhy Age : 10 Years and studying in Standard IV. Gender : Female currently lives in Orissa Case Histroy : My niece Miss. Drishty Padhi, Age -10 years, fell down lying in the back side while playing with friends. She had kept two small stones in her back pocket of the trouser. The stones got smashed after she felt. The right back was swollen after the injury. There are no fever after that incidence till now. This happened on 2nd July 2011. The injury was in the right hip/thigh. There are absolutely no issues in left hip ,thigh and leg.Then we consulted in our company hospital and consulted Ortho pedics specialists in V SS Medical College,Burla. X-Ray and Digital x-rays on Hip, backbone and pelvis did not show any abnormalities. Doctor advised some medicines and to put the Skin Traction for few days. After taking medicine for about a month, putting skin traction for 4/5 hours in a day , situation did not improve. Problem was she was not able to walk, not able to lift the right leg for a inch , pain during travel in car/bike with slow zerking also, pain in right thigh and hip. Then we went to SCB Medical college, Cuttack. Dr. N C Mahapatra, Asst. Professor in Orthopedics dept, seen the patient and advised to a MRI in Spine, both Hips, Pelvis etc. We did two MRIs in August 3rd August 2011. One in Hip, Pelvis etc and other one in Spine. The results of MRIs are given below : 1. MRI - LUMBO--SACRAL SPINE : MRI L.S.SPINE SUGGESTIVE OF :- APPARANTLY NORMAL MRI STUDY OF L-S SPINE & NO SPINAL CANAL STENOSIS 2. MRI- BOTH HIPS & PELVIS : MRI BOTH HIPS SUGGESTIVE OF :- RIGHT INF. LABRAL TEAR WITH GREATER TROCHANTERIC BURSITIS. After the above result of MRI scan, Dr. NCM advised for further rest with some medicines and advised to consult a doctor with Orthopaedic - Paediatrics specialization. We could find that Dr. Debabrata Padhy of Apollo Hospital,Bhubaneswar is a specialist in Orthopadics-Padiatrics. Immediately we consulted him and took my daughter to Dr.Padhy. Dr. Padhy scrutinized all the X-ray , Digital X-ray and MRI Scan reports very carefully. He physically checked the patient too. Then he advised complete skin traction for 24 hours for 15 days with some medicines. Then we put the patient in 24 hour skin traction for 15 days/20 days. After the skin traction was opened we could see a dramatic improvement in her leg. She could able to walk with a smooth chapel comfortably just like normal walk. Without the chappel she was facing problem in lifting the legs. Still the pain in the righ thigh and hip persisted though she is able to walk with the smooth chappel. The pain persists during any travels in bike , car or train with little zerking. Again we took her to Appoplo Bhubaneswar and consulted Dr. Padhy. Dr.Padhy then suggested some blood tests, eg.Vit D3, Calcium-Serun Phosphorous, inorganic-Serum. Alkaline Phosphatase-Serum/Plasma,RA Factor-Quantitaive. All the results of these tests came normal range. Upon seeing the test reports, Dr. Padhy further wanted to ensure for any neurology or rheumatology issues. He then referred to Dr. A Nanda ( Padiatrics-Neurology specialisation) and Dr. P Pradhan( Rheumatology specialist) in Apollo hospital. Both the doctors tested the patient critically and there are no abnormalities in Neurology or rheumatology. There were only some deficiencies of Vit D for which they have given medicines. Again they have prescribe some medicines and advised the patient to take rest. All of them have confirmed that there are no clinical issues. Present Situation : Presently my niece is able to walk with that sponge chapel properly. She is facing the following problems : a) difficulty in lifting the right leg for a inch also. b) Pain in the right thigh and right hip upon touching. c) Not able to walk properly without the chapel. d) Pain in hip, right thigh with little zerking during travel in Bike,Car or train. She is not going to school since last 3 months though she is a brilliant student. One Observation : When she is in asleep, if we touch and press the right thigh, there is no reaction from her. But if we press the right hip then she feels little pain. Request : Since this is already 3 months, and the kid is suffering a lot, my sincere request to you to critically analyze the case and give me a feedback for further action.","Doctor":"Hi....I understand your concern these are my suggestions and this is what I feel about your niece case.The inflammation of the hip joint is the reason for the pain which she is experiencing while jerking moment and also while lifting the leg. This means that whenever she tries to do the above activities the bone of the femur head is going and touching the particular Bursa which is inflamed and is causing pain. This is why she is avoiding lifting the leg and the jerking movement is causing the contact of the two surfaces and resulting in pain.The only viable solution for this is absolute bed rest as long as the pain persists along with skin traction, Vitamin D supplements and medicine to relieve the pain and when required.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Our 15 year old daughter has been having difficulty bearing weight on her knee as it collapses.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

She has not been eating much in 2 weeks and is complaining of chills and burning sensations throughout her body and has a loss of appetite . Tests have shown her infection has gone away in her stomach . Can you tell me what s causing these symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello, ckouchis28, You mention that your mother has been hospitalized more than once for treatment of diveticulitis. I am assuming that she did not require any surgical procedures such as drainage or temporary colostomy bag. I know that we use a combination of drugs given intravenously while in hospital to get the infection under control. If she also had a rupture or perforation with abscess then they may do drainage procedure. If the infection is real bad , even after they take out that portion of the large bowel , they may do a temporary colostomy. After 3-6 months when all the infection is cleared , they can re-attach the bowel. I don't think that was the case in your mother. After any severe illness and after antibiotics , the appetite will be lost for sometime. She needs to have good nourishment to build her immune system working again. I suggest that you give her Probiotics which help to build up good bacteria. A good yogurt without fruit (Flavor is O.K.) few times a day would be helpful. Also, a good Super B-Complex Vitamin with C daily is good. These will improve her appetite. If she is experiencing any diarrhea or blood in the stools , she needs to have stool tested for C.Difficile toxins which can happen after antibiotic therapy. She will improve with time and there is also the age factor that determines the length of time for recovery. I wish her the very best."},{"Patient":"regarding the motion / car sickness for children this grandchild of mine is 22 mos. her father (our son) as well as I (grandma) would also suffer from it. what can be done for the infant? eat very little before traveling, and watch the intake? thanks, for ur help","Doctor":"Hi..the best medicine for this is Promethazine, but this is not licensed to be used till 3 years of age.

She was kept in the ICU to observe whether the size of the clot may increase due to an ongoing bleed.Since she was discharged and allowed to be at home, I am assuming the risk of bleeding is significantly over. It may still occur though and you have to look for warning signs like vomiting, unconsciousness, drowsiness, etc.If she is crying continuously when awake with no normal intervals when she is conscious, alert and understanding things, you need to get a repeat CT scan to look for rebleeding which may then either be managed conservatively or by surgery.If the crying episodes are few and she has normal behaviour in between, I would suggest to wait and watch as there is not much to worry about at this stage.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"my child is 11.5 months old , he is on breast feeding also, i had loose motions 2 days back , he also got the same from yesterday , i gave him sporlac powder twice , but he is steel getting watery greenish yellow potty with bad smell, he does not like to eat anything except breast feeding, what should i give & avoid ?","Doctor":"Hi....Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

The bumps that you are explaining around mouth of your daughter does not seem to be related to history of hemangioma or eczema as the symptoms of both are different and do not include presence of bumps that you have explained.These bumps might be due to presence of viral infection in the body or an allergic reaction to some allergen that you are not aware of. It is difficult to reach a confirmed diagnosis without physical examination of the bumps regarding its size, texture, area of spread etc. Thus, I would advise you to visit a dermatologist or pediatrician for physical examination of the bumps and further investigations.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

What could be the cause of her swollen gums and how can we reduce it?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As the swollen gums are associated with the presence of fever, it seems that your daughter is suffering from Acute Herpetic Gingivostomatitis, which is a very common viral infection occuring in mouth of kids. If she is having pain in chewing and swallowing and refusing to eat because of it, the diagnosis can be almost confirmed.If this is the case, then only supportive therapy can be given to reduce pain and discomfort while body's immunity takes over and the condition heals itself in 7-14 days. I would recommend you to visit a dentist or a pedodontist, a specialist who excels in oral diseases of children for examination of the gums as it is not possible to confirm the diagnosis without clinically examining the oral cavity of the child.

Most common are rectal lesions such as hemorrhoids,fisurae,angiodislypasie or polyps, and less common but possible are malignancies. If bleeding happens again colonoscopy or irigography should be performed.Prednisolon has many side efects, its dosage should be adjusted if these sideeffects are intensive.

Children are usually given medicines and doses according to their age and weight. The adult doses for Ibuprofen is 400 to 600 mg 2-3 times a day while the dose of Acetaminophen for adults is 500 mg up to 3 times a day.Infant tylenol is Acetaminophen suspension only. However, as the child ages, his weight increases and thus for adequate effects of the medicines, dose has to be increased. 100 mg/5 ml for Ibuprofen and 160 mg/5 ml for Acetaminophen is not that high dose that can cause any side effects of overdose to your child.

Is it an abscess?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that your son is suffering from an abscess as the CAT scan is negative for any disorder such as dislocated shoulder.From the location of the pain and swelling, it seems that your son is suffering from an infection related to the tooth in the lower jaw. As he is 6 years old, this is the time that first permanent molar erupts in the oral cavity. It is possible that the abscess might be related to that tooth.When he moves his head, the swelling might get pressured causing pain. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity for focus of infection. If the dentist rules out any problem in the oral cavity, an ENT specialist should be seen for ear infection.For relief in pain, you can give him Ibugesic syrup 5 ml up to three times a day until you get an appointment of the dentist.

When the teeth are about to erupt in oral cavity, the gums become little sore and kids tend to put things in mouth frequently to soothe the sore gums. This tendency to put every odd thing in mouth, makes kids at this age prone to stomach infections. As he is gagging, retching and had vomited, it might be the possibility of him associated with teething. In such case, I would recommend you to visit a pediatrician to see if he requires a course of antibiotics.In addition, the drooling of saliva because of excessive salivation due to eruption of new teeth in mouth. It will stop in some days as the kid will get used to new teeth in oral cavity. In addition, the sore gums and irritation due to erupting teeth can make a child cranky and he may scream a lot. This will also subside soon. If the gums seem too sore, you can apply Orajel to his gums to soothe them.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

The virus of chicken pox can transmit to another person even before the infected person presents with the clinical lesion. As your daughter has lesions now, the virus may have transmitted already to the son and thus, it is late to do anything to prevent your son from getting the infection. Even if he shows with the lesion, it is not fatal to life and can be managed with supportive therapy for lesions and fever. As this is a viral infection, it usually resolves on its own within 7 days. In case your son has not got the infection, you can try to keep separate rooms for your son and daughter and make sure that your daughter or any of her belongings do not come in contact with your son.

She s had quite a few falls as she has recently starred walking and someone told me she could have damaged the teeth from a fall .","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern and think of two possibilities for the greyish line you have described on the front teeth.Firstly, if you took iron supplements during pregnancy or after childbirth, it may have entered the child's bloodstream in uterus or through breast milk. The front teeth are developing in the uterus and matures in bone during initial months after birth, which may cause development of such lines. However, if this was the case, the line should have been present when the tooth erupted into oral cavity. As she has history of falling, it is quite a possibility that she may have damaged her front teeth. The teeth may not break or crack but the pulp inside the tooth may have died making the tooth appear dark. Invariably, this pulp would be infected and should be treated as the tooth is going to stay in oral cavity till your daughter ages 8-9 years. If this is the case, then she might need to go for pulpectomy procedure for the affected teeth.One more possibility is presence of plaque on the teeth due to inadequate oral hygiene and lack of proper toothbrushing. This can be removed by ultrasonic scaling procedure performed by the dentistIn any case, I would recommend you to visit a dentist for examination of the line as confirmed diagnosis can be made only after physically looking at the teeth and the line you have described. If it is developmental, then no treatment is needed and it will be gone with the milk tooth shedding. In case of any other reason, treatment will be required as described.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Please type your query here...MY QUERY IS THAT MY YOUNGER SISTER HAS A SICKNESS WHICH IS CALLED HYPERTROPHY OF ADENOIDS I ASKED DOCTORS THEY SAID THERE IS NO TREATMENT ACCEPT SURGERY PLEASE CAN YOU GIVE SOME OTHER TREATMENT","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Adenoids are lymphoid tissues in children which are situated behind the nasal cavity. Usually, this lymphoid tissue is reduced in size and disappears on its own as the child ages. However, sometimes that is not the case the the tissue persists which causes breathing difficulty, speaking difficulty, snoring, abnormal development of teeth, mouth breathing, frequent ear infections etc. Unfortunately, medicines cannot cure it and the only permanent solution to all the above mentioned problems is surgical removal of this lymphoid tissue which has not disappeared on its own. It is a very common surgery performed in children and has very high success ratio. So please do not worry about the procedure. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

From the description of your query, I understand that the inside of the cheek of your child is cut as it is scratched by something she put i her mouth. In addition, some scratch is present even on the outside of the cheek.If the inside of the cheek is cut, she might develop an ulcer aat that place which are very painful. Having food can also be difficult in such situation due to burning and pain felt inside. I would advise you to apply local Benzocaine gel (Mucopain) to the area where the oral cavity is cut for faster healing. It should be applied 3-4 times a day. If you apply it before meals, she will have relief in burning while having food. It might take about a week for complete healing.If the outside of the cheek is scratched and the injury is not major, do not worry about it. Just clean the area with antiseptic such as Dettol and let it heal on its own in a week. Children's immunity is high and these injuries usually do not cause any complications. However, if she develops pain, fever, the area swells or bleeds, then a pediatrician should be seen as these are the signs of infection to the injured area.I hope this information helps you.

Let me know the associated symptoms along with mentioned. Do you have acidic belching/ abdominal discomfort/ excessive flatulence/ gargling sound in abdomen/ abdominal bloating after taking meals? Are you getting burning sensation in upper abdomen and retrosternal in location? With the available described symptoms, there appears to be possibility of functional dyspepsia. Functional dyspepsia is a functional disorder of gastrointestinal tract and Organic disease must be ruled out. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for ultrasound imaging,  serum amylase and lipase, thyroid profile, blood sugar level. You should also go for urea breathe test for H. Pylori. If Urea breathe test is found to be positive then you have to take complete eradication therapy for H. Pylori bacteria. Meanwhile, you should take proton pump inhibitors along with prokinetics for relief of your symptoms. You should also take antispasmodics. Your blood sugar must be in controlled range. You should avoid tomatoes, citrus fruits, tea, coffee, chocolates and oily spicy foods.

In contrary to our beliefs the more potent allergens are carried through air (like smoke, dust, pollens etc) rather than foods.

This is mainly spread by oral route; the cysts, which are not seen by naked eye, get contaminated with food. This is uncommon in a only milk fed baby as there is very less chance of contamination of feed. May be any member of your family is a asymptomatic carrier who needs treatment. Prepare baby's feed in a properly washed utensil, use cup and spoon or paladie, avoid using feeding bottles, and wash your hands as per WHO recommendation ( available in WHO website) before preparing feeds.

As your child has been biting on the lower lip for a long time, it is possible that a traumatic ulcer is developing inside the lower lip. The white skin may break out and you will be able to see the ulcer at its place.I would recommend you to start applying local Benzocaine gel (Mucopain) over the area 3-4 times a day.

There is no need to use antibiotics (LIKE METROGYL) unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

I suggest you start complimentary feeding apart form breast feeding by 6 months of age. At this age you can start giving Cerelac stage one rice or Nestum rice stage 1 etc. All are same in calories and energy. Only thing is palatability which is subjective for each kid. Other home-made food options will be - 1. Daal and rice well cooked and made into a porridge along with ghee2. Boiled apple or banana and mashed into a paste.3. Any made cereal porridge preparation with additional ghee added.Remember certain principles like -1. Add one food material / cereal or fruit per week. This will be useful because if he develops vomiting or diarrhoea, we will know what to avoid.2. Add vegetables and fruits made into a paste surely to avoid constipation.3. Do not add too much sugar as it may cause diarrhoea.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome.

I have consulted a paediatrician who advised 4ml azithromycin (Pratham100) once a day and 4.5ml P-125 SOS every 6 hours. Fever is reaching about 102 degree after 3 hours of taking P-125. This is happening for last 24 hours. Another doctor has prescribed MONOCEF-O and P-125 sos. Now I am need to know which medicine is better and less side effects. So far I did not started MONOCEF. Please advise as soon as possible. P.S. In last 20days back my baby was suffering from diarrhea. Aristogyl was given. Now the problem has resolved.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. VIRAL INFECTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE ANTIBIOTICS AT ALL. PLEASE DO NOT USE EITHER AZITHROMYCIN OR MONOCEF-O. BOTH ARE ANTIBIOTICS AND BOTH ARE REQUIRED HERE.For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

There are certainly alternative management therapies in allopathy now-a-days. Medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100% controllable.2. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your paediatrician I would have suggested the use of Budecort metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Levolin and this can used as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Budecort. The technique is very important and very crucial for the drug to be delivered correctly to the lungs. Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines. So I suggest you consult your paediatrician for this.3. Triggers can be environmental changes/ dust/ talcum powder/ seasonal changes/ un-cleaned a/c vents/ cold weather etc....we can specifically say this is the cause - unless we observe the kid closely - best person is the parent.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

I tried with Johnson & Johnson brush one day ..and a finger brush another day..I think I was brushing gently..she is now so scared of brushing and crying a lot.What should I do ? Is this normal..Should I stop brushing","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. There can be one of two possibilities for bleeding gums in children. If the bleeding is localized around the first molar tooth that is erupting in your daughter's oral cavity, the gum around the tooth might be little sore that can cause some bleeding and pain. Sometimes food ingested can get lodged in this gum collar causing infection which can make a child cry due to pain while brushing. If this is the problem, then the bleeding will subside as soon as the tooth will erupt completely and the gum around it will recede to expose the entire crown of the tooth. You can apply Orajel over the sore gum to soothe the area.Alternatively, if she is having bleeding from more than one areas in the mouth, then it is possible that she is suffering from gingivitis which may occur due to inadequate oral hygiene which causes accumulation of bacteria, plaque and calculus around the neck of the teeth and in the gum margin making the gums inflamed. In this case, you should visit a dentist who can clean the areas with mechanical scaling. The gingivitis will resolve after the scaling and she will not cry. You should not stop brushing but you can use the toothbrush that is specially made for kids under the age of 2 years. These toothbrushes are specially made for deciduous teeth according to the shape and size of teeth and soft enough so that they don't hurt gums. In addition, you should use a toothpaste that is made for kids (Kidodent) as the fluoride level is such that is the toothpaste that it protects the teeth against decay and the flavor is palatable to kids which makes it easy to convince them to brush.I hope this information helps you.

We gave her tylenol for her fever and Oragel for her gums. My question is what can cause white bumps on her inner lips? We first observed them on Sunday and they were small, today the seem to have gotten larger.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Teething is a difficult time period for some kids if the gums are thick. However, it is not a phenomenon that should be normally associated with fever or while raised lesions on the inner lip.It seems that your daughter is suffering from viral infection like chickenpox or herpes. You should go to a pediatrician for physical examination of the kid and to check for lesions that may be present elsewhere on the body but you may not have noticed yet.

However, the dribbling is not a concern as it is very limited. My daughter is under a speech and language therapist but we are still waiting for an assessment to be conducted in a nursery environment. Her speech is Okay to be fair. However, compared to her piers it is delayed.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As your daughter is three years old, this is the age she might be getting lots of baby teeth in her mouth. Due to this new development, it is normal that kids at this age stick their tongue out often and also experience excessive salivation. It will stop as soon as all teeth will develop, her mouth will grow and she will get accustomed to teeth in mouth.As your daughter is already under speech and language therapist, you can wait for their assessment as sometimes kids develop speech later but there is nothing abnormal about it. In addition, you can get her tongue checked by the dentist for any long frenulum that may tie the tongue and not let it move freely to talk. If the tongue is normal, her hearing is fine and the speech therapist passes her as fine, then there is nothing to worry about and you should wait for her to develop speech and language.I hope this information helps you.

His canines are poking through right now and he has some teeth coming in on the bottom. His Pediatrician just checked for ulcers, sores, thrush and my child checks out fine. He said the back of his throat is a little red but he s negative for strep. Is this grabbing at the tongue normal or does it come with teething?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As your child is getting teeth, the tip of the tongue is touching the new thing (teeth) developing in his mouth often. This is a common reaction of any person when something new is put in mouth. As the tongue is in constant contact with teeth, he keeps sticking his tongue out due to the foreign body feeling. As he will get accustomed to the teeth, he will stop doing this. In addition, he might also experience excessive saliva secretion and drooling which is also normal. As the pediatrician has already checked for sores, ulcers, thrush etc., there is really nothing to worry about.I would also like to advise you to start brushing his teeth with soft toothbrush specially available for kids under 2 years of age. Cleaning his tongue is also essential.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HCM.

Could it have anything to do with the body-wide rash he has. The rash has gotten better in the past 24 hours with lotion and Claritin but the tongue bumps are new today.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. If your kid is suffering from a generalized allergic reaction in the whole body area, then the enlarged tongue and papillae of tongue (bumps you are mentioning to) can be due to allergic reaction only. As the overall reaction will come under control with Claritin, tongue will regain normalcy, too. If the overall rashes are due to viral infection, then tongue problem will also take about a week to be back to normal as that is the time any viral infection takes to come under control. If your son is complaining of pain or burning sensation in tongue, then you can apply local Benzocaine gel (Mucopain) over the area about 3-4 times a day, especially before meals. If the tongue does appear normal in a week, then you should see a dentist for examination of the tongue and specific treatment for tongue.I hope this information helps you.

The accident of falling down your daughter suffered from may  cause injuries in the chin and other areas of the body that are hurt, but the fall itself cannot cause fever. Fever is a sign of infection which can be due to the cold as you pointed out. It is also possible that the sore neck might be due to throat infection if she has problems in swallowing food. If the sore neck is associated with the movements of the neck, then it can be associated with the fall. However, in external injury case, I would advise you to do heat compressions over the area to relax the sore muscles. Also, if she has problems in mouth opening or any area around mouth swells, I would recommend you to visit a dentist or oral surgeon for possible bone injuries to the areas. Acetaminophen can be given for pain and fever relief. You can give the dose you might be giving for simple pain or fever episodes. I cannot suggest the dose here as age of the child is not mentioned. In addition, you should also visit a Pediatrician or ENT specialist for cold and possible sore throat.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

If you are giving any milk other than breastfeeding please stop.I  was expecting that there should have been a history of cow's milk and formula feed (this too contains cow's milk protein) given to the baby. I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. 3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, i have a 3 year old girl who has complained of a upset stomach and sore throat.

The birth weight of child is 2.7 kg. the child was floopy and has low muscles tone.The child has a breathing problem which automatically recovered after 4 hours.The child was not able to suck the milk of his mother so she is on pipe feeding. The doctor suspect of muscles distrophy and CPK was found 1358 on first day. On 6th day CPK was retested and found 206 and the condition of child is better by almost 25%. So, my question is Can we rule out muscle distrophy and if yes, what may be the other causes?","Doctor":"Hi...the most important here is to know the neuromuscular development of your baby. at this age your baby should be able to go up and down stairs with one step at a time (like adults). Look whether he is able to get up to a standing position from sitting position without any support. If these parameters are normal then there are no need for screening ( if you don't have any family history of muscle dystrophies).  Now coming to the birth history , what I am interested to know is whether your baby cried immediately after birth or not. if the Apgar score is available in the discharge then you can look at it. Apgar of less than 6 at 1min or 5 min would indicate birth asphyxia, and then we can attribute the floppiness to that. CPK gets hiked in birth asphyxia but that is CPK MB not whole CPK. so recheck the report please. if he had really birth asphyxia then kindly visit and reevaluate from a pediatric neurologist.

At this age you should concentrate more on solid foods rather than milk. give 3 to 4 meals per day.one banana, one egg per day. don't use mixer grinder. make the paste with hand. and very importantly don't use bottle to feed milk...use cup and spoon.

A common cause of painful hematuria is urinary bladder stones may be due to increased calcium in urine. but there are also many other serious causes of passing blood in urine such as IgA nephropathy, hemolytic uraemic syndrome, HSP, glomerulonephritis, bladder rhabdomyosarcoma (a type of bladder cancer).

Thanks for choosing H.C.M.F. I have got some doubts about your approach to the doctors. Whether you have consulted gastroenterologist, and orthopedic surgeon , do you have any tests done or not. What is the location of the abdominal pain. if it is upper abdomen, may be of gastric , liver, gallbladder, or pancriatic. middle may be due to worms, or of renal origin, lower may be due to renal, urinary system, appendicitis, if female gynic problem. If not approached a specialist so far i advise you to consult a gastroenterologist, and orthopedic surgeon, for diagnosis and treatment. You may have to get gastroscopy , U.Sscaning besides other routine tests for confermation. Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.

Is that normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome To Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern regarding to your child’s health.The method which you used to check your child’s sugar level that was for random blood sugar.  As it is 53, it is very less than normal range of random blood sugar.  So, it is called hypoglycemia and it is little bit a dangerous condition.In hypoglycemia, child cannot live in normal condition. But, according to your question, I feel that your child would be normal at your friend’s home after getting the number 53 in glucometer. So, I think that glucometer might be doubtful and is not showing proper result.

If the stool consistency is not normal you should visit your doctor.Moreover good appetite and gaining normal weight ( at 6 months her weight should be double her birth weight) is also an indicator of normal digestion and absorption.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

She continues to have the temperature after the Motrin we give her wears off.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Nothing to worry about your child’s health. As you gave your child Tylenol, that is proper for him. But please inform the mg of the drug on healthcaremagic which you gave to him. Though 250 mg of Tylenol, 3 times in a day, at the interval of 7-8 hours is a proper dose. It will help to decrease the fever. Give cold sponge if fever will increase higher than 100 degree. Tylenol will also help to decrease the headache.If I would come across to these type of patients in my clinic, I would definitely suggest Syrup Meftal-Spas 5 ml 3 times per day (if no allergy) for relief in abdominal pain.

I went thru several cases of pancreatitis before it was discovered that I had a sluggish gall bladder, it was removed, but the pain feels very much like it did in those incidents. I am not running a fever and have restricted liquids and foods since yesterday afternoon and have been taking percocet and ibuprofen to help deal with the pain. Does this sound like it could be another case of pancreatitis or could it be something else and what can I do from home? I got laid off last year and have no insurance and would like to avoid racking up the kind of medical bills I had with the other bouts of pancreatitis. Thanks - Jodi","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.From your history there is no Pancreatitis, only you had sluggish gall bladder, which was already removed. Your classical symptoms of pain in the left upper abdomen going through to the back can be due to Gastritis for which Upper GI endoscopy should have been done. Get Endoscopy done if not yet done. The treatment required by you is as follows. I would advise the following in such a patient:Zantac 12 hourly.Pepcid every 3 to 4 hours when on empty stomach. Add Domperidone or such motility regulators.Soft bland diet. No aerated colas / soda/ drinks.Early dinner. No late nights.Treatment for anxiety (as prescribed / needs a prescription by your Doctor)Lying in a reclining positionWalk around after dinner.Think of the factors which increased the present problem, GERD, anxiety and try to avoid. If no relief, get Upper GI endoscopy done and get prescription for added Medicines. EKG for the heart n a safer side to rule out cardiac problems. This helps all my patients and should help you hopefully."},{"Patient":"Good day. I have been feeling some sort of discomfort or pain at my lower abdomen , around the belt line for a while now. The pain is on my left which is your right. About 5 years ago, the pain was severe and I went to see a doctor thinking it was appendicitis but it was not. The pain subsided for a while but sometimes comes and goes. The pain is not sharp like appendicitis but just gives me serious discomfort that sitting down sometimes in one place is a little difficult and uncomfortable. My palms would be sweaty sometimes at that point Also I have been having this nagging back pain for a couple of months now. I dont notice in particular how i walk whether i bend a lot or not. I crack my back a lot like am cracking my fingers. Its quite disturbing. Would appreciate your feedback.","Doctor":"There are several reason for abdominal pain. It is also possible that sometimes this pain can spread to the back. However it is also possible that your pain could also be originating from the back. It is important that a doctor can take a detailed history and examine you to find out. Also investigations such as an abdominal ultrasound and spine x ray may be able to provide more information about the cause. It is advisable that you stop cracking your back as this may put unnecessary strain on the spine and if there is pain may effect it."},{"Patient":"My 7 year old son woke up in the morning with a swollen face. I rushed him to the ER and they diagnosed with viral parotitis and ruled out mumps due to the fact he has had both immunizations (MMR). No blood test was done. I followed up with primary care doc the following day and they too agreed with the viral parotitis diagnostic. No tests were done. The following day he woke up with a rash all over body. Their are bumps spiratic all over his body (not a lot but bumps but all over here and there) some are small with a whitehead and some are just red. Under both of his armpits are covered in large red bumps under the skin (dime or nickel sized). I m taking him to the doctor again tomorrow. Do you agree with the viral parotitis diagnostic even considering the rash? Why aren t they doing a blood test or virus test? I m concerned about something more serious like meningitis etc.) He is healthy, no allergies, and hasnt been sick much in his life (other than 2 ear tubes surgeries from repeat ear infections). Thank you, Concerned Mother","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The body rashes that have suddenly appeared seem to be viral in origin. Thus, the presence of rashes in fact confirms the diagnosis of the doctor of your son suffering from viral parotitis. Meningitis symptoms include more severe central nervous system related symptoms, so please do not worry about it as your son is not presenting any symptoms of meningitis. The diagnosis of parotitis is very easy due to its specific swelling location and the age of the child. So it does not require tests to be done every time for diagnosis. In addition, it resolves in about 7-10 days without any specific treatment and providing only symptomatic treatment as and when needed. I hope this information clears your doubts.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that the swollen lips and upset stomach are different entities that your daughter is suffering from. Swollen lips seem to be an allergic reaction to some allergen your daughter might have been exposed to. Stomach upset can also be an allergic reaction to some food item she is allergic to. However, allergic reactions are not associated with high fever. Thus, association of fever indicates presence of bacterial infection of the stomach.For swollen lips, she can take Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) once a day for about 5 days. This will help in reducing the swelling. If the swelling does not reduce or increase in intensity during these 5 days of course, you should visit a dentist for finding out the reason of the swelling. In addition, as the diarrhea and vomiting are severe, you should not wait to consult a physician or pediatrician for the treatment of the infection as dehydration may ensue and cause more complications. Make sure that she keeps drinking fluids. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Lump is at front, on the bony part above his left eye.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand the concern. The bump or swelling over the bony area after hurting it hard is usual. As the swelling is reducing along with pain, you should not worry about adverse consequences. It seems that the injury and swelling will heal by body's natural healing mechanism. You can keep applying cold compresses. If the child is in pain, you can give him Paracetamol (Crocin) syrup 2.5 ml twice a day if needed.However, if he develops symptoms like dizziness, confusion, fever, tremors, problems with vision, then you should seek emergency care.I hope this information helps you.

He isn t eating as much as he normally does and has complained last week of having a headache for a few days. He does seem a bit pale to me as well.","Doctor":"Dear Parent,Thank you for your question.  Sorry to hear your son has become lethargic over the past 3 weeks.  How old is your son?If a child suddenly becomes more lethargic and tired over the course of a few weeks, this should be investigated at your family doctor.The most common cause is a viral infection.  Children who get infections such as Glandular Fever can be lethargic for some time.  Other viruses can also cause children to become more tired and lethargic.  This would be indicated if he had a sore throat or a fever at the onset of the illness. There are other causes such as anaemia.  Does your son have a varied diet with plenty of iron-rich vegetables?  If not, this may be the problem.  Does your son attend school - if so does he have any problems at school?  Children who feel low or are depressed or stressed can often have a poor appetite and lethargy.  There are other more rare causes of this problem which would become clear during the investigations.I would recommend that you visit your family doctor for him to have some blood tests.  These should check his full blood count (to check for anaemia, infections and other blood conditions), as well as test for Glandular Fever and test his thyroid function.  If his headache wakes him at night, is worst in the mornings or is occurring every day, a head MRI scan should also be included in the investigations.I hope you find this helpful, and the problem gets resolved soon.

Sometimes, she goes to the bathroom and in less than 20 minutes she has to go again. Every night she wakes up to use the restroom more than once. Sometimes we have to get out of the car and park in random places so that she can urinate. Sometimes, she would say that she doesn t have the need to do it. While a couple of seconds before she cried because of the need to go to the bathroom. She doesn t take any medication and is a very healthy child. what can it be? Is this something I should worry about?","Doctor":"Dear parent,  Many thanks for your question with healthcaremagic.com.  There are many causes for frequent urination in a child.  The most common cause is behavioural.  She may have just got used to going to the bathroom regularly, and you may have to gradually encourage her to increase the time between visits until she increases her ability to hold her urine.However, before you can label it as a behavioural problem, you have to rule out the other, more serious causes of frequent urination.  For this she will need a few tests at your family doctor.1) You need to rule out a urine infection - for this she will need a urine test. 2) You need to check for diabetes - the symptoms of this are usually frequent urination, thirst and weight loss.  For this she would need a urine and blood sugar test.3) You need to check that her bladder and kidneys are all structurally normal.  For this she would need an ultrasound scan.  If the results of the above are all fine, you can then be reassured that it is nothing to worry about, and just work on her gradually increasing the amount of time she can hold her urine.I hope this helps you, good luck with the tests.

Could these be pinworms? I ve never seen this in his diapers before. He s also had projectile vomit a few times which is unlike him. He does happen to be teething. Is this coincidental?","Doctor":"Dear Parent,Many thanks for your question on healthcaremagic.com.  Your description does indeed sound like Pinworms.  These little worms can often be seen on the surface of the stool.  To be more sure, you may see other symptoms of pinworms.  They often cause the anus to be sore and itchy, so you may find that your son seems uncomfortable and has some redness around his anus.  If you check at night, you may even see some of the pinworms around his back passage. Pinworms are treated with a single dose of an anti-parasitic medication.  You should be able to get this from your family doctor.Pinworms do not usually cause children to be systemically unwell, so the vomiting is unlikely to be related.  He could have a co-incidental virus, or it could be related to his teething.  Ensure he is well hydrated at all times with plenty of fluids.  If the vomiting becomes regular or you are worried he is becoming dehydrated, he may need some more investigations.I hope this answer helps, if you require any further clarification or have further questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for choosing H.C.M.F. Don't worry about the stomach pain, it may be due to gastric irritation due to type of food you had at some time during these 3 months. It can be corrected by using P.P.I, and antacids with the advise of your doctor. The numbness in the hands and feet should be taken care of , i advise you to consult a physician, to exclude any possibilities of post partumaclemptia, though occur immediately after delevery, it can occur at any time below 4 months after delevery,there may be increase in B.P., or proteine in the urine are the confirming factors. It is only to exclude the condition. The numbness also could be due to anaemea  , neuritis etc. Wishing for a quick recovery, if you have any doubts you can approach the H.C.M.F. Best regards."},{"Patient":"My 8 month old has been running a fever for the past few days ranging from 101 to 105 F. His nose is really stuffy, his breath smells a little funky and his ears are full of earwax. His doc put him on antibodics for a viral and bacterial infection and he s been on that for 3 days now. Should I be worried about his temp? He s cutting his first tooth right now if that matters.","Doctor":"Dear parent,At this age, it is very common for children to get viral/bacterial infections while they are building their immune systems.  Normal healthy children can have up to 8 viral respiratory tract infections every year at this age, and fever is usually a symptom!  Symptoms from a viral infection can last for up to 14 days, however if the fever is persisting for longer than 5 days, this is a reason to get another review with your local pediatrician.   It is very difficult to say without seeing your child if you need to be worried about his temperature.  However, here are some things that can you can look for yourself which help you decide if you have to be worried.  If he has any of the following symptoms, these are red flag symptoms that mean that he needs to be checked by a doctor in person again.1)Colour - pale/mottled2)Activity - High pitched continuous crying, difficult to rouse, not responding to you / not smiling3)Breathing - breathing heavily or faster than usual4)Hydration - passing less urine than usual or not tolerating fluids5)Rash6)Neck pain / headache / dislike of being in bright lights7)Swelling or redness of a limb or joint or pain when you move his arms or legs.If after giving him some Acetaminofen or Ibuprofen, his temperatures are coming down, and he becomes active and playful, you can be more reassured that the temperature is just a symptom of his current infection.  Let him get plenty of rest, give him regular fluids and he should soon get better.My final piece of advice is:  Go with your gut feeling, if you are worried that he is not improving, it is always best to get him checked out by a doctor in person again."},{"Patient":"My Daughter was completed 4 months.

Bottle milk is not advisable.You can also start all fresh fruit juices without mixing milk.After doing these for 10 to 15 days if she is comfortable you can start some solid food like rice-dal by crushing also soft fruits by crushing.I don’t advise to give any type of biscuits to any child.You should give breast milk to her up to 11 months for her good health."},{"Patient":"My 28 month old is not talking.....he is very affectionate....loves to hug and kiss.....he plays well with others....concentrates and focuses well whe nhe is playing or watching tv...is good at puzzles and hide and seek....Im just nervous about his speech.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. If your child can hear well and obeys what you say, then he is only having speech problems. It might be a problem related to the muscles related to tongue that may not allow free movements of tongue necessary for pronunciation of words. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of his tongue and to check if his tongue movements are fine. If tongue is the problem, then oral surgeon can help with the problem. If tongue is fine, then speech therapist can help. You and other family members should take care not to use signs to explain him thins and not to accept his signals in place of words. Work with him to speak little words aloud and slowly. However, if your son has problems with hearing too, then his tongue may be fine and he is not talking because he does not know what to speak in absence of hearing ability. In that case, ENT specialist should be consulted for problems related to ear.I hope this information guides you well. Thank you for choosing HCM.

It seems that your son is suffering from an allergy to some substance in the food items that cause him to experience the symptoms you have described. As you have rightly suggested, it is very difficult to ascertain what substance he is allergic to and what food items to avoid in future. I recommend you to go for a blood test for allergy that will identify what substance is acting as an allergic to your son and he will have to take care to avoid those items in food.It is important to find out the allergen as every next allergic episode may be severe than the previous one causing complications and health hazards. If he feels such reaction in future. he can take an antihitamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) to control the reaction. Make sure you keep these medicines available to him when needed.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

This can also spred from the lungs to other parts of the body as in your case. It is also possible that tb can spread to your intestines  and uterus which can also cause some symptoms like you have described. It is important that you see a doctor, carry some investigations so that your current status of the tb infection can be determined.

I must say this concerns me, the spot is not near a tooth at all. sincerely Barbara","Doctor":"Hello Barbara,I can understand your concern. A dark spot on the gum can be just melanin pigmentation and nothing else. Melanin is a colored substance produced by body that is responsible for color of skin, black coloration of gums etc. If your daughter is not having any discomfort or pain, you can accept it as you accept any other birth mark and not worry about it. However. if the mark changes over time, ulcerates and starts to bleed or presents with symptoms like itching, burning or discomfort of any type, it is necessary to visit a dentist for examination and further investigations regarding it.I hope this information helps you.

Do you have any recommendatons","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. A very thick pad of gum sometimes causes troubled and late teething as teeth cannot break through the gum due to thickness of gum and causes pressure over gum making them inflamed. If little part of tooth has erupted, it may cause food impaction in the gum surrounding the tooth causing infection. In such case, child can have fever and other problems that you have described. Based on the weight of your kid, you should give him Amoxicillin Suspension (Kidmox) in the dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day three times a day. Crocin syrup (Paracetamol) can also be given in the same dose three times a day. If you had mentioned the weight of your kid, I could tell you the exact dose to be given.

I think this is very normal behavior for a 3 year old boy but my sister in law seems to think this means he has been molested. He shows no other signs of molestation but I was wondering if sticking out his tounge is an indicator","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Sticking out tongue and blowing spit bubbles in a 3 year old is not a sign that he has been molested. It is a myth. It has probably originated in old times because at this age, kids are not usually aware of molestation and they cannot know if they are or have been molested. So when they stick tongue out and make spit bubbles, the myth makes parents to be aware regarding the surroundings of their kids and stay conscious regarding the molestation.Age 3 is the age when mouth and teeth grow actively and this produces excessive saliva in kids. The kids tend to make bubbles out of this excess saliva as a game. You can explain the child that these are not good manners and should be stopped. There is really nothing to worry about.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for chsooing HealthcareMagic.

I kept treating it with generic tylenol for children. 4 days into this I noticed she peed only once that day and was not eating like normal. He attitude was normal she was playful but I then noticed when I brushed her teeth her gums started bleeding. I finally took her to the doctor and she tested positive for strep...are the swollen gums a sympton of strep. The doctor did advise that since she has tears when she cries. I am just worried that I should take her back to the doctor, Should wait it out once she finishes her antibiotic and see if she still has these symptoms!! HELP my child has never been sick :(","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The deciduous or milk teeth start developing at the age of 6 months in children. As your daughter is 2 years old now, she might have about 8 to 10 teeth in the mouth. At this age, it is usually difficult to convince the child to brush their teeth and make them co-operate with you in brushing their teeth. Thus, plaque and calculus accumulate around teeth making gums inflamed and infected. This may cause bleeding while brushing. In addition, if new teeth are in the process of developing, the gums may be sore causing bleeding.My advise to you is to wait until the antibiotic course is over as bleeding from gums is not that severe a disease that requires immediate attention. After she is healthy otherwise, take her to the dentist or pedodontist (dentist who specializes in treating children's dental problems) for scaling, mechanical cleaning of teeth to remove plaque and calculus and making gums healthier and stronger. Half yearly visit of a dentist along with proper oral hygiene will keep this problem at bay in future.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

I am afraid that he might have some kind of metabolic disorder ?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As your son is otherwise healthy and not showing any signs of disease or discomfort, it does not seem that he is suffering from any pathology regarding the tongue.Do you clean his tongue with a thin, cotton cloth while bathing? It is necessary to clean the tongue of newborns or small kids in order to keep it free of debris and bacteria along with coating on the tongue. In addition, some food item that you might be giving him can cause the tongue to turn brown. I do not advise giving a course of antibiotic again unless it i not removed by proper cleaning. If he had infection, he might be presenting with fever, malaise etc. that may have needed antibiotics to clear the infection.If cleaning and changing diet does not help, you should see a pedodontist (dentist who specializes in treating oral cavity problems of kids) to ascertain the cause of the problem and staring treatment.I hope this information helps.

Thanks, Brian","Doctor":"Hello Brian,I can understand your concern. As your son is starting erupt teeth, he might be producing excessive saliva as a body's response to a new development in mouth. This is completely normal and nothing to worry about. As the mouth will grow with advancing age of the kid and more teeth will start to develop, you will not find excessive saliva and drooling a problem. You can clean the excess saliva with a thin cotton cloth time to time with little pressure so that rashes do not appear with repeatedly rubbing cloth over the area. Sticking tongue out is also a response to developing new teeth and growing tongue size, which will stop eventually.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

As your daughter is suffering from Dermatomyositis, chances are more that the spots you have found are related to this condition only. To differentiate them from other ulcers, while other kids of oral ulcers are very painful, the ulcers associated with dermatomyositis are not painful. However, some cases present with painful ulcers, too. They are more like the spots and not ulcers and I assume that is what you have observed.

You may start with mashed fruits and mashed vegetables. for 1-2 weeks and gradually start cereals ( rice) , pulses , wheat and dairy products. Non vegetarians can start poultry and flesh rich in iron. The gap to be covered is for iron , energy , proteins ,  Vit A in that order.

Jaundice and liver problems can cause increased level of bilirubin in blood which is called hyperbilirubinemia. This can cause developmental problems in teeth and the teeth may appear malformed, stained and prone to decay. If the teeth seems decayed, you should consult the dentist for determining the extent of the caries and deciding treatment so that further decay can be stopped. Deciduous or milk teeth stay in mouth till the age of 12 years, the front teeth till 9 years so taking care of them is necessary for proper eruption of permanent teeth and decreasing chances of pain and discomfort to the child. In addition, you should expect some more teeth erupting with the same problems depending on the stage of development of teeth when the jaundice has struck in. As the jaundice will be cured, the effect on erupting teeth will stop and the permanent teeth will erupt fine.I would still advise to consult dentist twice a year at least so that the eruption and effects on teeth can be followed up by dentist in colloboration with the pediatrician treating for jaundice.I hope this answer helps you.

What should I do","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put  the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If  still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

It would have been helpful if you had mentioned what medicines are being given to him and if it includes antifungal medications. Sometimes, use of antibiotics can also cause development of fungal growth on tongue. Other causes may include presence of bacterial infection causing hairy tongue and possible upper respiratory tract infection. I would advise you to go for analysis of tongue swab in the laboratory. It can be done with the help of a dentist. Based on the analysis result, confirmed diagnosis can be reached and treatment can be started. I hope this information helps you.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

He has been on keflex for three days and this morning would be his fourth day but he could not keep the keflex down I think more because of a throat reflex issue with the spitting which made him throw up than a stomach issue.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Your son must be experiencing pain while swallowing due to infection in throat. This might cause pooling of saliva in the mouth that he is not able to swallow without pain causing him to avoid swallowing altogether if not needed. So the amount of saliva produced in mouth may be normal, but its defective swallowing might make it pool out of mouth.For complete relief of the throat infection, he will have to complete the entire course of the antibiotics. By the time the course is finished, he should be feeling fine regarding the throat and saliva problems. If not, you should consult your ENT specialist again for further advise.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

How many days per month does he cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does his sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does he feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing (IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT TURN OUT OT BE ASTHMA ON THE LONG RUN) and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.

He also said she has a yeast infection around the vaginal and anal area. He prescribed Diflucan 100 MG (2 tablets). She will see him again next week when the test results come back.

My cervix wasnt strong enough to hold my baby full term. My baby was 11inches and 13.6ounces. Because he was so little and i was not further along, laws state that doctors could not help him. So they let me hold him until his heart stopped beating. He lived for 41 minutes. My question is, is it possible for a baby of his size that was born at 21weeks able to live for 41 minutes? If so how is this possible?","Doctor":"Hi,I am sorry to hear that you have to go through a premature labor. Hope you are coping well.To answer your question, the lungs of premature baby are very poorly developed (technically very less surfactant) -so the baby can breath for a few minutes to some hours maybe, but then the cardiopulmonary system gives up, and the baby succumbs. If the baby is atleast a minumum of 650 grams (also depends on various other factors, like lung maturity, developmental assessment of various sytems, absense of heart and other gestational developmental problems), the neonatologist may make a judgemental decision,after discussion with the parents, to give assisted care, till baby reaches term. If baby is less than 600 grams, the available medical didactic is not developed to support its survival to term.

That oil gets infected and causes simple acne or pustular acne. You can treat/prevent this is all 3 stages:1.excess oil - wash with soap and water twice, avoid fatty foods (though not possible in 8 year old),use face scrubs atleast one a day2.blocked pores - nauturally open pores and let oil pore out by applying gingelly oil, mildly before sleep. you can take steam bath atleast once, use steam vaporiser (preferably with neem and turmeric in the solution).3.preventing infection - use turmeric to clease the face (excellent antibiotic) and/or wash face with soap and water.

Here are some signs to watch for:1.Straining to pass stools – your baby may strain just for a few minutes, or he may strain for hours or days.2.Painful stools – if stooling seems to be hurting baby in any way, even if it does not appear unusually large.3.Large, hard stools – this is a sign, but only if baby is straining or in pain. Large, hard stools that pass easily are not considered constipation.What you can do:1.Stop feeding him whatever foods you have started so far.2.Introduce a food that you know won’t constipated him. Some good suggestions include pureed peaches, prunes, or any green vegetable.If your baby will not take these foods, or if these foods don’t work well enough, try some diluted prune juice through a sippy cup.3.Offer water more frequently.4.Once baby’s stools become more regular again, start adding some of those starter foods again, but in smaller amounts, and less often.5.You will need to determine how much of these “loosening” foods your baby needs to keep him regular.Hope your baby can feel good soon and if i was helpful in some wayBest regards"},{"Patient":"Our paediatrician had recommended usage of levolin 0.63 for our daughter (she is 2 years 5 months old now) when she has severe cough and it does not subside.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hi there my 30 months old boy was born before time and was diagnosed with tonsillitis at 9 months and i started noticing lumps in his neck when he was about 14 months then after taking antibiotic they became small now he got flu i noticed they are bigger then normal","Doctor":"Hi...seems like your child has got recurrent tonsillitis. It might even be a viral sore throat or a streptococcal infection. I suggest you see your pediatrician and get a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If it is positive then the kid will require antibiotics. If it is negative then it might be viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics at all.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Warm saline gargles will be soothing and will give a lot of relief if the kid can do that.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My baby is 8 months old.

Her bottom is red and getting rashy (which she never has diaper rash!). Should I switch her from vitamin d milk to lactaid?","Doctor":"Hi...I went through the history points you have provided - I was expecting that there should have been a history of cow's milk and formula feed (this too contains cow's milk protein) given to the baby. I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. 3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

Also the doctos to which we have consulted suggested not to give him milk for another 2-3 days not even mother feed. he said he has diarreaha due to lactose intolrence","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.1. This is not infective diarrhea.2. This is not lactose intolerance either.3. In any exclusively breast fed baby, presence of reducing substances in the stool sample is normal. One cannot diagnose lactose intolerance based on this.What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastro-colic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

Flapping hands and even feet sometimes when excited is quite common among little children. As long as she is interactive, eating well, playing and engaging in activities with no apparent difficulties in her daily routine I don't think you need to worry. Children find different ways of expressing their excitement when they're young like running around the house, hopping, singing, flapping their arms, kicking their legs etc. This behavior, through observation and peer group interactions slowly gets refined. You needn't worry about her having trouble at school especially since shes a bright little girl. Your concern for her social interactions in school is completely understandable but I'd like to assure you she will have no issues with this. I hope you are now convinced and less anxious for your grand child. Please feel free to get in touch with me for any further queries and clarifications you might have.

After using the drugs for more than a month one can get gastric hyperacidity symptoms like pain in the upper abdomen.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

Do you have fever/ spasmodic abdominal pain/ nausea or vomiting/ acidic belching? With the available described symptoms, there could be possibility of acute viral gastroenteritis. Myalgia is an integral prodromal symptom of viral infection. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ pediatrician and should go for thorough check up. You should also go for complete blood count, ultrasound imaging, and serum electrolytes. Viral infection has also some effect on liver and that's why loss of appetite and fatigue is very common with viral infections.You should take complete antibiotic therapy, antispasmodics, probiotics, antipyretics. You should maintain your hydration by taking potassium rich liquids. Avoid milk and all milk related products.

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi my daughter is 11 months shes underweight by 1.5 kgs . She was born 2.5 kgs. Now she s just 6.25 .

If your stool is black like a tar and has strange smell (not like regular stool, more like digested iron) this can indicate bleeding from peptic ulcer.

Upper right abdominal pain can be also caused by gallstones, however usually it radiates to the back, gives nausea and vomiting. It appears after a meal.
