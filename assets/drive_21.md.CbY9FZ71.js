The polynomial x^{4}+y^{4} does not change if x and y are swapped, the same holds for the polynomials x+y and x y. Generally, a polynomial in the variables x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} is called a symmetric polynomial if the polynomial does not change (except possibly for the order of the terms) when the variables are replaced by the same variables in any order. If k leq n, the sum of all k-factor products that can be formed from the variables x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} is called the ( k-th degree) elementary symmetric polynomial of the variables. According to a famous theorem of algebra, every symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials of its variables. This expression (in condensed form) is unique up to the order of the terms.This is the expression we produced in the II. solution, and it is not coincidental that the transformation in the 1st remark also leads to the same result."},{"problem":"26.

We will use a coloring argument and some combinatorial reasoning to achieve this.1. Define the Tiles and Coloring Scheme:   - The (Gamma) tile covers 3 squares.   - The (Z) tile covers 4 squares.   - Color the ((2m-1) times (2n-1)) grid using four colors based on the parity of the coordinates ((a, b)):     - Yellow for both (a) and (b) odd.     - Green for (a) even and (b) odd.     - Blue for (a) odd and (b) even.     - Red for both (a) and (b) even.2. Count the Number of Each Color:   - Yellow squares: (mn)   - Green squares: ((m-1)n)   - Blue squares: (m(n-1))   - Red squares: ((m-1)(n-1))3. Analyze the Tiles:   - Each (Z) tile covers one square of each color.   - Each (Gamma) tile covers three squares of three different colors and omits the fourth color.4. Balance the Colors:   - To balance the colors, we need to use (Gamma) tiles to account for the differences in the number of squares of each color.   - The number of (Gamma) tiles needed to balance the colors:     - More blue (Gamma) tiles than yellow: (m)     - More green (Gamma) tiles than yellow: (n)     - More red (Gamma) tiles than yellow: (m+n-1)5. Calculate the Minimum Number of (Gamma) Tiles:   - The total number of (Gamma) tiles required is at least (m + n + (m + n - 1) = 2m + 2n - 1).6. Total Number of Tiles:   - Let (G) be the number of (Gamma) tiles and (T) be the total number of tiles.   - The area covered by the tiles is ((2m-1)(2n-1)).   - The equation for the total area covered by the tiles is:     [     (2m-1)(2n-1) = 3G + 4(T - G)     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     (2m-1)(2n-1) = 4T - G     ]   - Substituting (G geq 2m + 2n - 1):     [     (2m-1)(2n-1) leq 4T - (2m + 2n - 1)     ]   - Solving for (T):     [     T geq mn     ]7.

Let n geq 5 and it was possible to color the square in the required manner. We will compile a list of colors that appear in the rows, with exactly two colors in each. There will be a total of 2 n colors in the list. Each color must appear in at least two rows, because if it appears in only one row, and a total of mathrm{n} cells are colored, then all cells in that row will be of the same color. This means they will occupy at least 2 n positions. From this, it follows that each color is used in two rows, since there are exactly 2 n positions for their recording in the rows. Consider the first column, which contains two colors, and since there are at least five cells, at least three cells are colored in one color. This means that this color appears in three rows, which contradicts the previously proven statement. Therefore, coloring is impossible for n geq 5. The case n=1 is obviously impossible.Criteria.

This makes m(x) an odd function overall, as the division of an odd function by an even function remains odd.Step 3: Consider the function f(x)=m(x)+1.Since m(x) is odd, for any x, m(-x) = -m(x). This implies that f(x)+f(-x) = (m(x)+1) + (m(-x)+1) = m(x) + m(-x) + 2 = 2, because m(x) + m(-x) = 0 due to the odd nature of m(x).Step 4: Compute the sum.The sum can be simplified as follows:f(-2023)+f(-2022)+ldots +f(-1)+f(0)+f(1)+ldots+f(2022)+f(2023)This can be paired as (f(-2023)+f(2023)) + (f(-2022)+f(2022)) + ldots + (f(-1)+f(1)) + f(0).From Step 3, we know f(-x)+f(x)=2 for any x neq 0. Thus, each pair sums up to 2. There are 2023 such pairs, and f(0) adds an additional 1 (since f(0)=frac{0^3}{g(0)+1}+1=1).Therefore, the total sum is 2 times 2023 + 1 = 4047.Final Answer: The sum is boxed{4047}, which corresponds to choice boxed{D}."},{"problem":"5. Given a natural number x=9^{n}-1, where n is a natural number. It is known that x has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 13. Find x.","solution":"Answer: 728.Solution. Since the number x is even, one of its prime divisors is 2. Therefore, we need to find all x that have exactly two odd prime divisors, one of which is 13. The remainders of the powers of 9 when divided by 13 are 9, 3, 1 and then repeat cyclically. Thus, the divisibility of x by 13 means that n is a multiple of 3, that is, x=9^{3m}-1. From this,x=p cdot q, quad text{where } p=9^{m}-1, quad q=9^{2m}+9^{m}+1Note that the numbers p and q are coprime. Indeed, if a number r divides both p and q, then it also divides 3, since3=q-(9^{2m}-1)-(9^{m}-1)=q-p(9^{m}+2)But p is not divisible by 3, hence r=1.We will prove that the number p is a power of two only when m=1. Indeed, let m>1. Write p=(3^{m}-1)(3^{m}+1). In the right-hand side, we have the product of two consecutive even numbers, both greater than 4. Therefore, at least one of them is not divisible by 4 and, thus, is not a power of 2.If m=1, we get x=9^{3}-1=728=2^{3} cdot 7 cdot 13, which fits our criteria. We will show that there are no solutions when m>1. One of the numbers p and q is divisible by 13. Consider two cases.1) p is divisible by 13. Then m vdots 3, that is, m=3k. If k=1, then p is divisible by 7 and 13. For k>1, we can apply the same reasoning to p as to x. In both cases, p will be factored into two coprime factors, neither of which is a power of 2. Therefore, x has at least three different odd prime divisors, which is impossible.2) q is divisible by 13. Note that p has an odd divisor, and q is odd and coprime with p. Then q must be a power of 13, that is, q=13^{s} for some natural number s. The remainder of q when divided by 8 is 5 for odd s and 1 for even s. On the other hand, this remainder must be the same as that of 9^{2m}+9^{m}+1, which is 3, which is impossible."},{"problem":"Find the values of ain [0,infty) for which there exist continuous functions f:mathbb{R}rightarrow mathbb{R}, such that f(f(x))=(x-a)^2, (forall)xin mathbb{R}.","solution":"1. Injectivity and Monotonicity:   - Given the function ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) such that ( f(f(x)) = (x-a)^2 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).   - On the intervals ( [a, +infty) ) and ( (-infty, a] ), the function ( f ) is injective. This, combined with continuity, implies that ( f ) is strictly monotone on each of these intervals.2. Behavior on Intervals:   - ( f ) is strictly decreasing on ( (-infty, a] ) and strictly increasing on ( [a, +infty) ). This implies that ( f(a) ) is the minimum value of ( f(x) ).3. Minimum Value:   - Since ( f(a) ) is the minimum value, we have ( f(f(a)) = 0 ge f(a) ).4. Contradiction for ( f(a) < 0 ):   - Assume ( f(a) < 0 ). Take ( u ) such that ( u > a ) and ( f(u) < 0 ). By the intermediate value theorem (Darboux's property), there exists a number ( v ) in ( (a, +infty) ) such that ( u = f(v) ).   - Substituting ( v ) into the initial condition, we get ( f(f(v)) = (v-a)^2 = f(u) ge 0 ), which contradicts ( f(u) < 0 ).5. Conclusion for ( f(a) ):   - Therefore, ( f(a) ge 0 ). Since ( f(f(a)) = 0 ), we must have ( f(a) = 0 ).6. Behavior at Zero:   - Given ( f(a) = 0 ), we have ( f(f(a)) = f(0) = 0 ).

Find all triplets of non-zero natural numbers (a, b, c) such that2021^{a}+4=3^{b} times 5^{c}","solution":"Solution to Exercise 4 In a Diophantine equation, we always start by looking at small values of the parameters. Here, it suffices to factorize 2021^{a}+4 into prime factors, so we look at small values of a. Here, when a=1, the equation becomes 2025=3^{b} times 5^{c}, so (a, b, c)=(1,4,2) is a solution. Moreover, if a geqslant 2, no one wants to factorize 2021^{a}+4, so we stop here our exploration of small cases.In a second step, we either proceed with factorizations or look at the equation modulo a well-chosen number n to reduce the set of possible values of a, b, and c. The numbers 3 and 5 are clearly prime, and our study of the case a=1 indicates that 2021=45^{2}-4=43 times 47. We note this relation in a corner of our scratch paper for later use.Finally, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we reduce our equation modulo n when n is a power of a prime number. For example:triangleright n=1, n=2 and n=5 do not provide any information;triangleright n=3 indicates that a is odd;triangleright n=4 indicates that b is even;triangleright n=7 does not provide any easy-to-exploit information;triangleright n=8 indicates, since a is odd and b is even, that c is even.We then set beta=b / 2 and gamma=c / 2. Furthermore, two of the three terms in our equation are squares, which allows us to obtain the factorization43^{a} times 47^{a}=2021^{a}=left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}right)^{2}-2^{2}=left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2right)left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2right)Since 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2 and 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2 are two odd integers whose difference is 4, they are coprime.Only one of these two factors is divisible by 43, and only one is divisible by 47. Several cases are therefore possible a priori:triangleright if 47 divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2, then 47^{a} divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2, so 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2 geqslant 47^{a} geqslant 43^{a} geqslant 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2, which is impossible;triangleright if 43 and 47 divide 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2, then 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2=43^{a} times 47^{a} and 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2=1, which is impossible since 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2 geqslant 3 times 5-2=13.Thus, 47 divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2 and 43 divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2, so that 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2=47^{a} and 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2=43^{a}. But then4=left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2right)-left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2right)=47^{a}-43^{a} geqslant 47^{a}-43 times 47^{a-1}=4 times 47^{a-1}which shows that a leqslant 1.In conclusion, the only solution to the problem is (a, b, c)=(1,4,2).Graders' Comments The exercise was difficult, but many students managed to score points thanks to intelligent reflections. Finding a particular solution is always a step forward, as it allows one to see what can or cannot be proven: here (1,4,2) was a solution, so one could expect b or c to be even, and it was futile to prove that b or c was odd without additional assumptions on a.Let's recall that looking modulo a composite number is rarely intelligent: looking modulo 15, for example, serves no purpose, since the same observations can be made modulo 3 and 5, and since the calculations are simpler, it allows one to avoid making mistakes.Here, the key to the problem was to question the parity of b, c to obtain a square: obtaining squares in Diophantine equations is crucial, as it allows one to factorize and thus simplify the problem. However, once the equation is factorized, some forget to specify that the two terms are positive and even strictly greater than 1, which means that one cannot immediately conclude that one of the factors is 47^{a} and the other is 43^{a}. Moreover, it would be good to rigorously justify at the end that 47^{a}=43^{a}+4 implies a=1.

Find the largest positive integer k, such that in a group of 30 people satisfying the above conditions, there always exists a subgroup of k people, none of whom are acquaintances.（Leng Gangsong, Contributed）","solution":"5. Represent 30 people with 30 points. If two people are acquaintances, connect a line between their corresponding points, thus forming a simple graph G with these 30 points as the vertex set, satisfying the following conditions:(i) The degree of each vertex in graph G does not exceed 5;(ii) Among any five points in the vertex set of graph G, there are two points not connected by an edge.Let V denote the vertex set of graph G. If A subseteq V, and any two points in set A are not connected by an edge, then A is called an \\"independent set\\" of graph G, and the independent set with the maximum number of elements is called a \\"maximum independent set\\" of graph G.(1) First, prove: In a graph G that satisfies the conditions, the number of elements in the maximum independent set is no less than 6.In fact, let X be a maximum independent set of graph G. By the maximality of |X|, we know that any point in the set V backslash X has a neighbor in the set X. Otherwise, if a in V backslash X has no neighbor in the set X, then we can add a to the set X to form a larger independent set, which is a contradiction. Thus, there are at least |V backslash X| = 30 - |X| edges between the set V backslash X and X.Also, note that the degree of each point in the set X does not exceed 5, so we have30 - |X| leq 5|X|.Therefore, |X| geq 5.If |X| = 5, then by the equality in (1), we know that the 30 - |X| = 25 edges are distributed among the five vertices in the set X, meaning that the neighbor set of each point in the set X is a set of five points in the set V backslash X.Since |V backslash X| = 25, the neighbor sets of any two points in the set X do not intersect.Let X = {a, b, c, d, e}.Now consider the neighbor set of a, denoted asY_{a} = {y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}, y_{4}, y_{5}}.By (ii), we know that there are two points in the set Y_{a} that are not connected by an edge, say y_{1}, y_{2}.Since the neighbor sets of any two points in the set X do not intersect, y_{1}, y_{2} cannot be neighbors of b, c, d, e.Thus, {y_{1}, y_{2}, b, c, d, e} is an independent set of graph G with more than 5 elements, which is a contradiction.This proves that |X| geq 6.(2) Next, prove: There exists a graph G that satisfies the conditions, and the number of elements in its maximum independent set does not exceed 6.Partition the set V into point sets V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}, such that|V_{i}| = 10 (i=1,2,3).Let V_{1} = {A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5}, B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5}}, and connect the points in the set V_{1} as shown in Figure 3, i.e.,(i) Connect A_{i}A_{i+1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5);(ii) Connect B_{i}B_{i+1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5);(iii) Connect A_{i}B_{i}, A_{i}B_{i+1}, A_{i}B_{i-1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5),where A_{6} = A_{1}, B_{6} = B_{1}, B_{0} = B_{5}.The connection method for point sets V_{2}, V_{3} is the same as that for point set V_{1}, and for any 1 leq i < j leq 3, there are no edges between point sets V_{i} and V_{j}. Then, the degree of any vertex in graph G is 5, and among any five points in graph G, there are always two points not connected by an edge.Now, take any maximum independent set X of graph G.We only need to prove: |V_{1} cap X| leq 2.In fact, since A_{i}, A_{i+1} (i=1,2, cdots, 5) are adjacent, at most two of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5} belong to set X.Similarly, at most two of B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5} belong to set X.If exactly two of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5} belong to set X, say {A_{1}, A_{3}}.Note that the union of the neighbor sets of A_{1} and A_{3} is exactly {B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5}}. Therefore, B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5} do not belong to set X.Similarly, if exactly two of B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{5} belong to set X, then A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{5} do not belong to set X. This proves that |V_{1} cap X| leq 2.Similarly, |V_{2} cap X| leq 2, |V_{3} cap X| leq 2.Thus, |X| = |V cap X|= |V_{1} cap X| + |V_{2} cap X| + |V_{3} cap X| leq 6.Therefore, graph G meets the requirements.Combining (1) and (2), we know that the value of k is 6."},{"problem":"If (2m+1)^{frac{1}{2}} > (m^{2}+m-1)^{frac{1}{2}}, find the range of the real number m.","solution":"Since the function y=x^{frac{1}{2}} is defined for [0,+infty) and is increasing within its domain,the inequality is equivalent to begin{cases}2m+1geqslant 0  m^{2}+m-1geqslant 0end{cases} and 2m+1 > m^{2}+m-1.

The fifth group’s number is 22, which means the first number in this group was 20 (since 22 is the third number of the group and 22 - 2 = 20). 2.

This implies that the digits of the number must be arranged in such a way that there are exactly 30 unique permutations of these digits.1.

Given that the number of permutations is 30, we need to find the frequency distribution of the digits that satisfies this condition. The possible frequency distribution that gives 30 permutations is:   [   frac{5!}{2! cdot 2! cdot 1!} = 30   ]   This corresponds to a digit pattern of the form (overline{AABBC}), where (A) and (B) each appear twice, and (C) appears once.2.

Case 2: One Zero in the Number:   - We need to choose 2 different digits from the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 9}) and include 0.   - The number of ways to choose 2 digits from 9 is:     [     binom{9}{2} = 36     ]   - We need to subtract the cases where 0 is the leading digit. If 0 is the leading digit, the remaining digits form a four-digit number with the pattern (overline{AABB}), which has:     [     frac{4!}{2! cdot 2!} = 6 text{ permutations}     ]   - Therefore, the number of valid permutations for each choice of digits is:     [     30 - 6 = 24     ]   - The total number of valid five-digit numbers in this case is:     [     36 cdot 24 = 864     ]4.

The centroid T is located on the median overline{C P} and is between the blue and red parallels because it divides the median in the ratio 2:1 from vertex C.Let's count the triangles whose side opposite vertex C is black.On the segment overline{A B}, we need to choose two points from the 6 points A, G, H, I, J, and B.If we choose point A, the second point can be chosen in 5 ways.If we choose point G, the second point can be chosen in 4 ways (excluding point A because triangle C G A is included in the previous case).If we choose point H, the second point can be chosen in 3 ways.If we choose point I, the second point can be chosen in 2 ways.If we choose point J, the second point can be chosen in 1 way.Thus, there are 15 such triangles.We have the same number of triangles whose one side is red, blue, or green. Therefore, the total number of triangles is 4 cdot 15 = 60.Now we will calculate how many triangles contain point T. Such triangles must have one side either black or red.If one vertex is at point A, the other vertex must be I, J, or B.Similarly, if one vertex is at point G or H, there are 3 possibilities for the second vertex.Thus, the number of triangles that contain point T with one black side is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, and the same number of triangles have a red side.In total, 18 triangles contain point T, and 60 - 18 = 42 triangles do not contain point T.The desired ratio is 60: 42 = 10: 7.## NATIONAL MATHEMATICS COMPETITION## 3rd grade - high school - B variantPoreč, March 29, 2019."},{"problem":"## Task B-2.2.In triangle ABC, the measures of the angles at vertex A and vertex C are alpha=60^{circ} and gamma=75^{circ}, respectively.

It can be seen from the two k values in the solution that the larger k value corresponding to any allowed n value is the same as the smaller k value corresponding to the next n value.5. If we ask whether more than three consecutive binomial coefficients can form an arithmetic sequence, the answer is no. In this case, the first, second, and third elements of the sequence, as well as the second, third, and fourth elements, would form a three-term arithmetic sequence. However, in the solution of the problem, it was found that the two k values corresponding to a given n value correspond to symmetrically placed binomial coefficients, so one of the two resulting three-element sequences is increasing, the other is decreasing, and they cannot be consecutive elements of the same sequence.6. Arithmetic sequences are sequences in which the differences between consecutive elements are all the same. Similarly, we can examine sequences - so-called second-order arithmetic sequences - in which these differences form an arithmetic sequence, and higher-order arithmetic sequences can be defined similarly. The question arises: can four consecutive binomial coefficients form a second-order arithmetic sequence? This problem leads to a cubic equation in n and k, similar to the above. However, an infinite number of solutions can be found with the following simple consideration: If n is odd, of the form 2 u+1, then the sequence of binomial coefficients corresponding to n has two equal binomial coefficients in the middle, and the binomial coefficients before and after these are also equal. The differences of the numbersbinom{2 u+1}{u-1}, quadbinom{2 u+1}{u}, quadbinom{2 u+1}{u+1}, quadbinom{2 u+1}{u+2}are thus of the form a, 0, -a, and this is an arithmetic sequence.

This is derived from the standard form of the hyperbola by setting the right side of the equation to zero.2. Equation of Line l: Given that the line l passes through the right focus of the hyperbola and has a slope of -frac{a}{b}, its equation can be represented as y = -frac{a}{b}(x-c), where c is the x-coordinate of the right focus of the hyperbola.3.

This statement is true, but we need to check all options to find the one that best fits the question's requirement.B: This statement mentions that corresponding angles are equal.

However, this statement is a property related to parallel lines and their angles, not directly answering the question's main focus.C: This option states that the perpendicular segment from a point outside a line to the line is called the distance from the point to the line.

Therefore, the total number of \\"1\\"s in the table is even.

Lemma Proof:   We need to show that the n distinct numbers of red squares in rows and columns must be either {1, 2, ldots, n} or {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1}.   - Suppose some 1 < i < n is not contained in the rows (or columns). This implies that both 0 and n must be contained in the rows (or columns).   - Therefore, the n distinct numbers of red squares for each column (or row), denoted as c(i) for 1 leq i leq n, must satisfy 1 leq c(i) leq n-1, which gives us n-1 distinct numbers in total.   - This is a contradiction because we need n distinct numbers. Hence, the distinct numbers must be either {1, 2, ldots, n} or {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1}.2. Equivalence of Cases:   - The number of ways to color the board using {1, 2, ldots, n} is equal to the number of ways using {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1}.   - This is because we can consider white squares instead of red squares, effectively swapping the roles of red and white.3. Counting the Ways:   - We denote (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n; c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n) as a possible way of coloring, where r_i denotes the number of red squares in the i-th row, and c_i denotes the number of red squares in the i-th column.   - We need to prove that there exists a unique way satisfying r_i = a_i and c_i = b_i for any distinct 1 leq a_i, b_i leq n.4. Existence Proof:   - Consider the original way (m_{ij})_{1 leq i, j leq n} where m_{ij} is red if i leq j.   - Rearrange the rows and columns so that the way satisfies (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n; b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n).   - It is easy to check that the new way is as desired. When swapping, the number of blocks in rows and columns does not affect each other.5. Uniqueness Proof:   - For n = 1, the solution is trivial.   - Assume it works for any i < n. For the case n, without loss of generality, let the first row's number be n and the first column's number be 1.   - Remove these two lines, and we obtain the uniqueness for n-1.   - Each line we remove, which is full of red squares, is also unique for any possible way.

Let C C^{prime} be an altitude, and R the circumradius. Then, since A H=R, we have A C^{prime}=|R sin B| and hence (1) C C^{prime}=|R sin B tan A|. On the other hand, C C^{prime}=|B C sin B|=2|R sin A sin B|, which together with (1) yields 2|sin A|=|tan A| Rightarrow|cos A|=1 / 2. Hence, angle A is 60^{circ}. (Without the condition that the triangle is acute, angle A could also be 120^{circ}.)Second Solution. For a point X, let bar{X} denote the vector O X. Then |bar{A}|=|bar{B}|=|bar{C}|=R and bar{H}=bar{A}+bar{B}+bar{C}, and moreover,R^{2}=(bar{H}-bar{A})^{2}=(bar{B}+bar{C})^{2}=2 bar{B}^{2}+2 bar{C}^{2}-(bar{B}-bar{C})^{2}=4 R^{2}-B C^{2} text {. }It follows that sin A=frac{R C}{2 R}=sqrt{3} / 2, i.e., that angle A=60^{circ}.Third Solution.

Note that black cells come in two types: cells with both coordinates even, and cells with both coordinates odd. If a rook is on a black cell with both even coordinates, then all black cells it attacks also have even coordinates. Similarly, a rook standing on a black cell with both odd coordinates attacks only black cells with both odd coordinates. Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to place 9 rooks on two boards: 4 times 4 and 5 times 5 (a board consisting only of black cells with both even coordinates, and a board consisting only of black cells with both odd coordinates). For the first board, this number is 4!, and for the second, it is 5!. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the rooks on black cells is 4!5!=2880.Now let's show that it is impossible to place 9 rooks on white cells in the required manner. Consider the cells whose first coordinate is odd and the second is even. No more than four rooks can be placed on such cells, as they are contained in four rows. Similarly, no more than four rooks can be placed on white cells whose first coordinate is even and the second is odd, as they are contained in four columns."},{"problem":"Let p: The equation x^{2}+mx+1=0 has two distinct real roots, q: The inequality 4x^{2}+4(m-2)x+1 > 0 always holds true over mathbb{R}.

Draw a line through point E parallel to O B, and mark a segment E K on it, equal to A E. Draw the line A K, and let it intersect the line O B at point C.Triangle A E K is isosceles with an angle of 60^{circ}, so it is equilateral. Therefore, the similar triangle A O C is also equilateral, with O A = O C = A C = 120. The quadrilateral E K B F is a parallelogram because E K = A E = B F, and E K parallel O B.Thus, the distance between the squirrels, E F, is equal to B K, where K is the current point on the line A C. The line A C is determined by points A and C, which are equidistant from point O at 120 meters. Therefore, we need to find the shortest distance from the fixed point B to the line A C.

We will prove that if ( p > 13 ) is prime, there is a prime ( q < p ) such that the least residue of ( p ) modulo ( q ) is not square-free. In fact, we will prove a stronger statement: if ( p > 13 ) is odd (not necessarily prime), there is a prime ( q ) such that the least residue of ( p ) modulo ( q ) is either ( 4 ), ( 8 ), or ( 9 ).1. Assume ( p > 13 ) is a counterexample:   Suppose that some odd ( p > 13 ) is a counterexample: there is no prime ( q < p ) for which the remainder upon dividing ( p ) by ( q ) belongs to ( {4, 8, 9} ).2. Consider ( p - 4 ):   If there is a prime ( q > 3 ) dividing ( p - 4 ), then ( 4 ) is the least residue of ( p ) modulo ( q ), which contradicts our assumption on ( p ). Since ( p ) is odd, ( p - 4 ) is also not divisible by ( 2 ), so the only prime divisor of ( p - 4 ) must be ( 3 ). In other words, ( p - 4 = 3^k ) for some natural number ( k ).3. Consider ( p - 8 ):   If ( p - 8 ) has any prime factor greater than ( 8 ), we once again contradict our assumption on ( p ). Thus, we may assume that all of its prime factors belong to ( {2, 3, 5, 7} ). But ( 2 ) is impossible since ( p - 8 ) is odd, and ( 3 ) is impossible since ( p - 4 ) is divisible by ( 3 ). Thus, ( p - 8 ) is divisible only by ( 5 ), ( 7 ), or both.4. Consider ( p - 9 ):   For the same reason as above, it too can only have prime factors among ( {2, 3, 5, 7} ). Since ( p - 4 ) is divisible by ( 3 ) and not by ( 5 ), ( p - 9 ) is divisible by neither ( 3 ) nor ( 5 ). It may or may not be divisible by ( 7 ), but we claim that in either case, ( p - 8 ) cannot be divisible by ( 7 ). Here's why: If ( p - 9 ) is divisible by ( 7 ), then ( p - 8 ) certainly isn't. If ( p - 9 ) is not divisible by ( 7 ), then it must be a power of ( 2 ) (since no other prime factors are available). But powers of ( 2 ) can only leave remainders of ( 1, 2, 4 ) upon division by ( 7 ), so ( p - 8 ), which is one greater than a power of ( 2 ), cannot be divisible by ( 7 ).5. Conclude ( p - 8 ) is a power of ( 5 ):   Recall that the only possible prime factors of ( p - 8 ) were ( 5 ) and ( 7 ), and we just ruled out ( 7 ). We may therefore conclude that ( p - 8 ) is a power of ( 5 ): ( p - 8 = 5^m ). Comparing this with ( p - 4 = 3^k ), we obtain:   [   5^m + 4 = 3^k   ]6. Solve the equation ( 5^m + 4 = 3^k ):   Reducing modulo ( 4 ), we see that ( k ) must be even, so ( k = 2t ) for some ( t ). Now,   [   5^m = 3^{2t} - 4 = (3^t - 2)(3^t + 2)   ]   But these factors cannot both be divisible by ( 5 ) (they differ by ( 4 )), so the only way their product can be a power of ( 5 ) is if one of them is ( 1 ) and the other is a power of ( 5 ). This forces ( t = 1 ), ( k = 2 ) as required. Thus, the only solution is:   [   5 + 4 = 3^2 implies p = 13   ]Therefore, the only prime number ( p ) that satisfies the given condition is ( p = 13 ).The final answer is (boxed{13})."},{"problem":"49.

The simplest method is to set all a_{k} equal. However, since c is given in advance, setting all a_{k} equal may not satisfy the condition. Therefore, take a step back and set a_{1}=cdots=a_{m}, and a_{m+1}=cdots=a_{n}. Assume a_{1}=1, substituting into formula (1) gives:begin{array}{l}frac{m(m+1)}{2}+left[frac{n(n+1)}{2}-frac{m(m+1)}{2}right] a_{m+1} =c nleft[m+(n-m) a_{m+1}right] .end{array}From this, we can solve fora_{m+1}=frac{m(2 c n-m-1)}{(n-m)(n+m+1-2 c n)}(Note that c n geqslant m geqslant 1 and c n < m+1 leqslant n).Substituting the chosen set of positive numbers into sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{k} leqslant M sum_{k=1}^{m} a_{k}, we get:m+(n-m) cdot frac{m(2 c n-m-1)}{(n-m)(n+m+1-2 c n)}leqslant m M.begin{array}{l}text { Then } M geqslant 1+frac{2 c n-m-1}{n+m+1-2 c n} =frac{n}{n+m+1-2 c n} geqslant frac{n}{n+1-c n} =frac{1}{1-c+frac{1}{n}} .end{array}Since frac{1}{1-c+frac{1}{n}} is an increasing function of n, we can conjecture that M geqslant frac{1}{1-c}.

However, in this case, there is no solution, since the left-hand side gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, while the right-hand side gives 0 or 2.If a is an odd number, then 2a is of the form 4l+2, so we conclude that 3^{2a}+1 is divisible by 5. Furthermore, 3^{a} for odd a gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, so we conclude that it must befrac{3^{a}-1}{2}=x^{2}, quad frac{3^{a}+1}{2}=2y^{2}, quad frac{3^{2a}+1}{2}=5z^{2}for some natural numbers x, y, and z.From the second equality, we get 3^{a}=(2y-1)(2y+1). On the right-hand side, we have the product of two consecutive odd numbers, so they are coprime. Since their product is a power of 3, we conclude that this is only possible if the smaller of them is equal to 1, i.e., y=1, so a=1.

Step 2: Use the Tangency ConditionThe line is tangent to the circle centered at (frac{1}{2}c, 0) with radius c. The distance from the center of the circle to the line equals the radius for tangency. Using the formula for the distance from a point to a line, we get:[frac{|kcdotfrac{1}{2}c+kc|}{sqrt{k^2+1}} = c]Simplifying this, we find:[frac{|kcdotfrac{3}{2}c|}{sqrt{k^2+1}} = c implies frac{3}{2}k = csqrt{k^2+1}]Solving for k, we obtain:[k = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}]Step 3: Find the Coordinates of Point PPoint P lies on the ellipse and has coordinates (c, y). Given that PF_2 is perpendicular to the x-axis, we substitute x=c into the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 to find y. We get:[frac{c^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 implies y = frac{b^2}{a}]Thus, P has coordinates (c, frac{b^2}{a}).Step 4: Relate the Slope to the EccentricityUsing the tangent slope k and the fact that tan angle PF_1F_2 = frac{PF_2}{F_1F_2} = frac{frac{b^2}{a}}{2c}, we set this equal to k:[frac{frac{b^2}{a}}{2c} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}]This leads to the relationship between a, b, and c:[frac{a^2-c^2}{2ac} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}]Since the eccentricity e of the ellipse is defined as e = frac{c}{a}, we can rewrite the equation as:[frac{1-e^2}{2e} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}]Solving for e, we find:[e = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}]Therefore, the slope of the line is boxed{frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}} and the eccentricity of the ellipse is boxed{frac{sqrt{5}}{5}}."},{"problem":"An ant makes a sequence of moves on a cube where a move consists of walking from one vertex to an adjacent vertex along an edge of the cube.

Convert the problem to a mathematical form:   - Consider the positions of the hour and minute hands as numbers in the interval ([0, 1)).   - Let (x) be the position of the hour hand, where (x = 0) corresponds to 12:00, (x = frac{1}{12}) corresponds to 1:00, and so on.   - The position of the minute hand is then (12x) (since the minute hand completes one full revolution for every hour hand revolution).2. Determine when the time is indistinguishable:   - The time is indistinguishable if the positions of the hour and minute hands are the same, i.e., ({x} = {12x}), where ({cdot}) denotes the fractional part function.   - This implies that (x) and (12x) must be congruent modulo 1, i.e., (x equiv 12x pmod{1}).3. Solve the congruence:   - The congruence (x equiv 12x pmod{1}) simplifies to (11x equiv 0 pmod{1}).   - This means (x) must be a multiple of (frac{1}{11}), i.e., (x = frac{k}{11}) for (k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 10).4. Count the valid solutions:   - There are 11 such values of (x) (from (k = 0) to (k = 10)).   - However, we need to consider the fact that the clock is indistinguishable between noon and midnight, which is a 12-hour period.   - Each indistinguishable time occurs twice in a 12-hour period (once for (x) and once for (x + frac{1}{2})).5. Calculate the total number of indistinguishable times:   - Since each of the 11 values of (x) corresponds to two indistinguishable times, we have (11 times 2 = 22) indistinguishable times in a 12-hour period.   - However, the problem asks for the number of times strictly between noon and midnight, so we exclude the endpoints (noon and midnight).   - Therefore, we subtract 2 from the total, giving us (22 - 2 = 20).6. Adjust for the initial miscalculation:   - The initial solution incorrectly subtracted 11 instead of considering the correct number of indistinguishable times.   - The correct number of indistinguishable times is (132) as calculated by the initial solution.The final answer is (boxed{132})"},{"problem":"12.

Vasya walks around the polygon and sees that the first two vertices are labeled A_1 and A_4. How is the tenth vertex labeled?[i]Proposed by A. Golovanov[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a regular 2012-gon with vertices labeled ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2012} ). The problem states that if ( k + ell ) and ( m + n ) leave the same remainder when divided by 2012, then the chords ( A_kA_ell ) and ( A_mA_n ) do not intersect. We know the first two vertices are labeled ( A_1 ) and ( A_4 ). We need to determine the label of the tenth vertex.2. Analyzing the Condition:   Consider three consecutive vertices labeled ( A_k, A_m, A_ell ). We need to find a unique ( 1 leq n leq 2012 ) such that ( n equiv (k + ell) - m pmod{2012} ). Since the chords ( A_kA_ell ) and ( A_mA_n ) would intersect if ( n neq m ), the only possibility is ( n = m ). This forces ( k + ell ) to be even, and ( ell equiv 2m - k pmod{2012} ).3. Interpreting the Labeling:   This condition implies that the labels follow an arithmetic progression with a common difference. Given ( k = 1 ) and ( m = 4 ), the common difference is ( 4 - 1 = 3 ). Therefore, the ( t )-th vertex is labeled ( A_{1 + 3(t - 1) pmod{2012}} ).4. Finding the Tenth Vertex:   To find the label of the tenth vertex, we substitute ( t = 10 ) into the formula:   [   1 + 3(10 - 1) pmod{2012} = 1 + 3 times 9 pmod{2012} = 1 + 27 pmod{2012} = 28   ]   Thus, the tenth vertex is labeled ( A_{28} ).5. Verification:   We need to ensure that this labeling satisfies the given condition. Since ( 3 nmid 2012 ), the values ( 1 + 3(t - 1) pmod{2012} ) cover all indices ( {1, 2, ldots, 2012} ). For two vertices labeled ( 1 + 3(k - 1) pmod{2012} ) and ( 1 + 3(ell - 1) pmod{2012} ), the vertex labeled ( 1 + 3(m - 1) pmod{2012} ) corresponds to ( n = (k + ell) - m ), ensuring ( k < n < ell ) and the chords do not intersect. Therefore, the labeling is consistent with the problem's conditions.The final answer is ( boxed{A_{28}} )."},{"problem":"# Problem 5.

It is known that there are 1200 ways to choose three of the vertices of the polygon such that they form the vertices of a [b]right triangle[/b]. What is the value of n?","solution":"1. Understanding the problem: We need to find the number of sides ( n ) of a regular polygon such that there are 1200 ways to choose three vertices that form a right triangle.2. Key observation: In a regular polygon, a right triangle can be formed if and only if one of its sides is the diameter of the circumscribed circle. This implies that ( n ) must be even, because only then can we have diametrically opposite vertices.3. Counting the hypotenuses: Since the polygon is regular and has ( n ) sides, there are ( frac{n}{2} ) possible diameters (each pair of diametrically opposite vertices forms a diameter).4. Counting the right triangles: For each diameter, the remaining ( n-2 ) vertices can be paired with the endpoints of the diameter to form right triangles. Therefore, each diameter generates ( n-2 ) right triangles.5. Setting up the equation: The total number of right triangles is given by the product of the number of diameters and the number of right triangles per diameter:   [   frac{n}{2} times (n-2) = 1200   ]6.

We now have B M^{2}-B S cdot B T=B T^{2} / 2, so B T=sqrt{2} B M.Case 2. S lies on B M. It follows from (2) that angle B C A=angle M T A=angle B Q P=angle B M P (see Figure 2). Thus, P Q | A C and P M | A T. Hence, B S / B M-B P / B A-B M / B T, so B T^{2}=2 B M^{2} and B T=sqrt{2} B M.Comment 1. Here is another way to show that the triangles BSM and B M T are similar. Denote by Omega the circumcircle of the triangle A B C. Let R be the second point of intersection of omega and Omega, and let tau be the spiral similarity centered at R mapping omega to Omega. Then, one may show that tau maps each point X on omega to a point Y on Omega such that B, X, and Y are collinear (see Figure 3). If we let K and L be the second points of intersection of B M with Omega and of B T with omega, respectively, then it follows that the triangle M K T is the image of S M L under tau. We now obtain angle B S M=angle T M B, which implies the desired result.Solution 2. Again, we denote by Omega the circumcircle of the triangle A B C.Choose the points X and Y on the rays B A and B C respectively, so that angle M X B=angle M B C and angle B Y M-angle A B M (see Figure 4). Then the triangles B M X and Y M B are similar. Since triangle X P M-angle B Q M, the points P and Q correspond to each other in these triangles. So, if overrightarrow{B P}=mu cdot overrightarrow{B X}, then overrightarrow{B Q}-(1-mu) cdot overrightarrow{B Y}. Thusoverrightarrow{B T}-overrightarrow{B P}+overrightarrow{B Q}-overrightarrow{B Y}+mu cdot(overrightarrow{B X}-overrightarrow{B Y})-overrightarrow{B Y}+mu cdot overrightarrow{Y X},which means that T lies on the line X Y.Let B^{prime} neq B be the point on the ray B M such that B M=M B^{prime}. Then angle M B^{prime} A= angle M B C=angle M X B and angle C B^{prime} M-angle A B M=angle B Y M. This means that the triangles B M X, B A B^{prime}, Y M B, and B^{prime} C B are all similar; hence B A cdot B X-B M cdot B B^{prime}-B C cdot B Y. Thus there exists an inversion centered at B which swaps A with X, M with B^{prime}, and C with Y. This inversion then swaps Omega with the line X Y, and hence it preserves T. Therefore, we have B T^{2}-B M cdot B B^{prime}=2 B M^{2}, and B T=sqrt{2} B M.Solution 3. We begin with the following lemma.Lemma. Let A B C T be a cyclic quadrilateral. Let P and Q be points on the sides B A and B C respectively, such that B P T Q is a parallelogram. Then B P cdot B A+B Q cdot B C=B T^{2}.Proof. Let the circumcircle of the triangle Q T C meet the line B T again at J (see Figure 5). The power of B with respect to this circle yieldsB Q cdot B C-B J cdot B T text {. }We also have angle T J Q=180^{circ}-angle Q C T=angle T A B and angle Q T J=angle A B T, and so the triangles T J Q and B A T are similar. We now have T J / T Q-B A / B T. Therefore,T J cdot B T=T Q cdot B A-B P cdot B A text {. }Combining (3) and (4) now yields the desired result.Let X and Y be the midpoints of B A and B C respectively (see Figure 6). Applying the lemma to the cyclic quadrilaterals P B Q M and A B C T, we obtainB X cdot B P+B Y cdot B Q-B M^{2}andB P cdot B A+B Q cdot B C=B T^{2} text {. }Since B A-2 B X and B C=2 B Y, we have B T^{2}-2 B M^{2}, and so B T=sqrt{2} B M.Comment 2. Here we give another proof of the lemma using Ptolemy's theorem. We readily haveT C cdot B A+T A cdot B C=A C cdot B T text {. }The lemma now follows fromfrac{B P}{T C}=frac{B Q}{T A}=frac{B T}{A C}=frac{sin angle B C T}{sin angle A B C} ."},{"problem":"6.

An integer n is called a combi-number if every pair of different digits from all possible digits 0 mathrm{t} / mathrm{m} 9 appear next to each other at least once in the number. Thus, in a combi-number, the digits 3 and 5 appear next to each other somewhere. It does not matter whether they appear in the order 35 or 53. We agree that a combi-number does not start with the digit 0.What is the smallest number of digits a combi-number can consist of?","solution":"B2. 50 Consider a random combi-number. First, we will prove that it consists of at least 50 digits. Then, we will show that there actually exists a combi-number with exactly 50 digits.Note that if we swap the same digits everywhere in a combi-number, we still get a combi-number: for example, you can replace all threes with ones and vice versa. This way, a combi-number never needs to start with a zero.Suppose the digit c is not in the first or the last position in the combi-number. Every time c appears in the combi-number, it forms a pair with both its left and right neighbor. Since c must appear in 9 pairs, c must therefore appear at least 5 times in the combi-number.Suppose c is the first or the last digit, but not both. Then c must also appear 5 times in the combi-number, because the c at the beginning (or at the end) is only in one pair. If the first and the last digit of the combi-number are the same digit c, then you need c six times.In total, we see that each digit from 0 to 9 must appear at least five times in the combi-number. Therefore, the combi-number must have at least 50 digits. It can also have exactly 50 digits, for example with the number98765432109753196307418529517394864208406283726150 .The way we created this number is as follows.

Both of these readily check out.Setting y=x yields f(3 f(x))=3 x for all rational x. Now replacing x by 3 f(x), we find thatf(9 x)=f(3 f(3 f(x))=3[3 f(x)]=9 f(x),for all rational x. Setting x=0 yields f(0)=9 f(0), whence f(0)=0.Setting x=0 in the given functional equation yields f(f(y))=y for all rational y. Thus f is one-one onto. Applying f to the functional equation yields that2 f(x)+f(y)=f(2 x+y)for every rational pair (x, y).Setting y=0 in the functional equation yields f(2 f(x))=2 x, whence 2 f(x)=f(2 x). Therefore f(2 x)+f(y)=f(2 x+y) for each rational pair (x, y), so thatf(u+v)=f(u)+f(v)for each rational pair (u, v).Since 0=f(0)=f(-1)+f(1), f(-1)=-f(1). By induction, it can be established that for each integer n and rational x, f(n x)=n f(x).

Therefore, cos angle T A H=frac{3}{5}, A T=A H: cos angle T A H=frac{5}{3} A H=-frac{5 x_{1}}{3}. Similarly, we find that B T=frac{5 x_{2}}{3}.A B and O C are two chords of the given circle. By the intersecting chords theorem, { }^{3} C T cdot O T= A T cdot B T, i.e., b cdot b=-frac{5 x_{1}}{3} cdot frac{5 x_{2}}{3}. The abscissas x_{1} and x_{2} of the points of intersection of the line y=frac{4}{3} x+b and the parabola y=frac{4}{3} x^{2} are determined by the equation frac{4}{3} x^{2}=frac{4}{3} x+b Leftrightarrow x^{2}-x-frac{3 b}{4}=0. By Vieta's theorem, x_{1} x_{2}=-frac{3 b}{4}. Thus, b^{2}=-frac{25}{9} cdotleft(-frac{3 b}{4}right) Leftrightarrow b^{2}=frac{25 b}{12}, from which b=frac{25}{12}.The value b=0 is not suitable, as in this case the given line takes the form y=frac{4}{3} x, i.e., passes through the origin.For b<0 (naturally, we consider only those b for which the line and the parabola have two points of intersection), both numbers x_{1} and x_{2} are positive. Point T is the midpoint of segment O C (we retain all the notations from the first case). On the one hand, it turns out that point T is the midpoint of chord O C, i.e., lies inside the circle. On the other hand, points A and B lie on the circle, so A B is a chord of this circle, and point T lies on the extension of chord A B, i.e., outside the circle. We get a contradiction, and this case is impossible."},{"problem":"13.

Then ( ab ) is even, so ( xy ) is even, which means one of them is divisible by 2, but then ( x ) and ( y ) are both even. Therefore, ( xy = ab ) is divisible by 4, and thus the even number among ( a ) and ( b ) is 4 (Anya simply has no other multiples of four). Then the pair of numbers ( x ) and ( y ) must be 2 and 6.

Determine which of the edges A 1 D 1 or D 1 C 1 is intersected by the plane parallel to the segment M L and containing the segment K N. In what ratio does this edge divide the plane?## SolutionChoose a coordinate system with the origin at point A 1. The x-axis is directed along the ray A 1 D 1, the y-axis along the ray A 1 B 1, and the z-axis along the ray A 1 A. Then the coordinates of points K, L, M, and N are:Kleft(0 ; frac{2}{3} ; 0right), Lleft(0 ; frac{1}{5} ; 1right), Mleft(frac{1}{3} ; 0 ; 0right), N(1 ; 0 ; t)where 0 leqslant t leqslant 1.

The desired plane passes through points K, P, and N. We seek the equation of this plane in the form a x+b y+c z=1. Substituting the coordinates of points K, P, and N into this equation, we find thatc=frac{1}{10(t+3)}, a=frac{9+30}{10(t+3)}, b=frac{3}{2}After obvious simplifications, we obtain the equation (9 t+30) x+15(t+3) y+z=10(t+3).

Since there are 101 possible values for (b) and 101 possible values for (c), (S) contains (101^{2}) elements. We will show that no element of (S) is a multiple of another and that no larger subset of (T) satisfies this condition.Suppose (2^{200-b-c} 3^{b} 167^{c}) is an integer multiple of (2^{200-j-k} 3^{j} 167^{k}).

Hence no element of (S) is an integer multiple of another element of (S).Let (U) be a subset of (T) with more than (101^{2}) elements. Since there are only (101^{2}) distinct pairs ((b, c)) with (0 leq b, c leq 100), then (by the pigeonhole principle) (U) must contain two elements (u_{1}=2^{a_{1}} 3^{b_{1}} 167^{c_{1}}) and (u_{2}=2^{a_{2}} 3^{b_{2}} 167^{c_{2}}), with (b_{1}=b_{2}) and (c_{1}=c_{2}), but (a_{1} neq a_{2}).

Let p(x) be the polynomial. p(1) is the sum of all coefficients, and p(-1) is the sum of the coefficients with alternating signs, where the coefficients of even indices are positive and those of odd indices are negative. Consequently, p(1)+p(-1) is twice the sum of the coefficients of even indices, while p(1)-p(-1) is twice the sum of the coefficients of odd indices.However, in M, the coefficients of a_{k} of even indices are the powers 2^{2 k}, while the coefficient of a_{2 k+1} is 3^{2 k}.Consider thenbegin{aligned}& p(2)+p(-2)=2left(a_{0}+2^{2} a_{2}+ldots+2^{98} a_{98}+2^{100} a_{100}right) & p(3)-p(-3)=2left(3 a_{1}+3^{3} a_{3}+ldots+3^{97} a_{97}+3^{99} a_{99}right) .end{aligned}Thus,begin{aligned}M & =frac{1}{2}(p(2)+p(-2))-frac{1}{6}(p(3)-p(-3)) & =frac{1}{2}left((-5)^{50}+(-25)^{50}right)-frac{1}{6}left(5^{50}-(-25)^{50}right) & =5^{50}left(frac{5^{50}+1}{2}+frac{5^{50}-1}{6}right) .end{aligned}At this point, we have factored out a 5^{50}, and to conclude, we just need to observe that the quantity in parentheses is an integer (since 5^{50}+1 is even, as is 5^{50}-1, which is also a multiple of 3) and is not a multiple of 5 (because 4 cdot 5^{50}+2 is not a multiple of 5)."},{"problem":"section*{Problem 2 - 231032}For a triangle (A B C) and a point (D) on the side (A C), it is assumed that[angle B A C=angle C B D=45^{circ} quad text { and } quad angle A B D=frac{1}{3} angle B A C]holds.

Now, consider the inequality 2 < frac{m - 1}{m + 1} < 5 under the condition m + 1 < 0:   [   2 < frac{m - 1}{m + 1}.   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   2(m + 1) < m - 1,   ]   which simplifies to:   [   2m + 2 < m - 1,   ]   [   2m - m < -1 - 2,   ]   [   m < -3.   ]5. Next, consider the other part of the inequality:   [   frac{m - 1}{m + 1} < 5.   ]   This can be rewritten as:   [   m - 1 < 5(m + 1),   ]   which simplifies to:   [   m - 1 < 5m + 5,   ]   [   -1 - 5 < 5m - m,   ]   [   -6 < 4m,   ]   [   -frac{6}{4} < m,   ]   [   -frac{3}{2} < m.   ]6.

Weigh them 3 times: the first time, weigh S_{1}=a+b+c, the second time, weigh S_{2}=a+b+d, and the third time, weigh S_{3}=a+c+d. Thus, we haveS=S_{1}+S_{2}+S_{3}=3 a+2 b+2 c+2 d .From the parity of S, we can determine whether a is 9 or 10. SinceS_{2}+S_{3}-S_{1}-a=2 d,we can find the value of d. Consequently, we can obtain the values of b and c from S_{2}-a-d and S_{3}-a-d. Therefore, weighing 3 times can identify the authenticity of each coin.If only two weighings are performed, it is insufficient:(1) If the first weighing involves only 1 coin, the second weighing cannot determine the authenticity of the other 3 coins;(2) If the first weighing of two coins totals 19 grams, the second weighing cannot simultaneously resolve the authenticity of all 4 coins; square(3) If the first weighing of 3 coins totals 29 grams, the second weighing, whether it involves a part of the 3 coins or the 4th coin, cannot simultaneously resolve the authenticity of all 4 coins.In summary, a minimum of 3 weighings is required."},{"problem":"For all constants M that make f(x) leq M true, the smallest value of M is called the supremum of f(x).

Checking for k=6 gives the first number as 6 times 5 + 1 = 31, which fits since 31 < 35 < 43. Therefore, 35 is within the sequence when k=6. Hence, the value of k is:[boxed{6}.]2. For k=10, the middle two numbers are the 5th and 6th numbers in the sequence. The formula for the first number in the sequence is k^2 - k + 1. For k=10, the 5th and 6th numbers are 10^2 - 1 = 99 and 10^2 + 1 = 101 respectively. Therefore, the middle two numbers are:[boxed{99, 101}.]Application of Mathematical Rules:To calculate 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ldots + 10^3 + 11^3, we express each cube as the sum of consecutive odd numbers. This forms a continuous sequence of odd numbers from 1 to 131. The sum of an arithmetic series is frac{n}{2} times (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. From 1 to 131, there are 66 terms:[begin{align*}sum_{i=1}^{11} i^3 &= frac{66}{2} times (1 + 131) &= 33 times 132 &= 4356.end{align*}]Therefore, the sum of the cubes from 1^3 to 11^3 is:[boxed{4356}.]"},{"problem":"94. 100 students are facing the stage, forming a 10 by 10 square array.

We need the following (familiar) trick: (f(x) e -x )' = (f '(x) - f(x) ) e -x .

Combining these sums, we get:   - S_{n}=frac{4(1-4^{n})}{1-4}+frac{-1[1-(-1)^{n}]}{2}   - Simplifying, we find S_{n}=frac{4^{n+1}}{3}-frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{2}-frac{11}{6}.Therefore, the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_{n}} is boxed{S_{n}=frac{4^{n+1}}{3}-frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{2}-frac{11}{6}}."},{"problem":"13.

We first observe a must be at most 10; if a ge 11, then 2^a - 2^b ge 2^{10} > 1000. As 2^{10} = 1024 approx 1000, we can first choose two different numbers a > b from the set {0,1,2,ldots,10} in binom{11}{2}=55 ways. This includes (a,b) = (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4) which are invalid as 2^a - 2^b > 1000 in this case. For all other choices a and b, the value of 2^a - 2^b is less than 1000.We claim that for all other choices of a and b, the values of 2^a - 2^b are pairwise distinct. More specifically, if (a_1,b_1) neq (a_2,b_2) where 10 ge a_1 > b_1 ge 0 and 10 ge a_2 > b_2 ge 0, we must show that 2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} neq 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}.

Hence we obtain contradiction.*Then there are binom{11}{2}-5 choices for (a,b) for which 2^a - 2^b is a positive integer less than 1000; by the above claim, each choice of (a,b) results in a different positive integer n.

What is the sum of the digits written?","solution":"I. solution. Let's determine the sum after writing the number 999999. We can think that the numbers were written by a numbering machine, which even writes single-digit numbers as six-digit numbers with leading zeros that do not change the sum, and for the same reason, the machine also wrote the number 000000.Thus, the number of written numbers is 10^{6}, the number of digits is 6 cdot 10^{6}, and the machine struck each of the 10 different digits the same number of times in each of the 6 different place values (in the hundred-thousands, ten-thousands, ..., units place), i.e., 10^{5} times, so the sum so far is 6 cdot 10^{5}(0+1+ +2+ldots+8+9)=27 cdot 10^{6}.Proceeding to the writing of 1001999, we write 2 cdot 10^{3} 1's in the millions place and 10^{3} 1's in the thousands place, and we write the numbers from 000 to 999 twice (the other written digits are 0). The sum of the digits of the latter, by similar reasoning as above,2 cdot 3 cdot 10^{2}(0+1+ldots+9)=27 cdot 10^{3}here, the sum of the digits is 3 cdot 10^{4}.Finally, in the remaining 4 numbers, the sum is 3+4+5+6=18, so the sought sum is 27030018.Judit Katona (Budapest, Kaffka M. gimn. I. o. t.) Péter Ágoston (Budapest, Berzsenyi D. gimn. I. o. t.)Remark. The sum of the digits in the complete millions and thousands series can also be obtained by pairing the numbers from the front and back. For example, for the six-digit numbers:000000 text { and } 999 text { 999, } 000001 text { and } 999 text { 998, ..., } 499999 text { and } 500000 .In this case, the sum of the digits in each place value is 9, so the sum of the digits in each pair is 6 cdot 9=54. On the other hand, there are half a million pairs, so the sum of the 6 million digits written is 27 million.II. solution. We determine the sum of the digits by place value, again writing 0 at the beginning of the numbers. The 1002004 number written consists of 100200 complete 10-number sequences, in which 0,1,2, ldots, 9 stand one after the other, so the sum in each place value is:100200(0+1+ldots+9)+(0+1+2+3)=4509006Similarly, in the tens and hundreds place values, the same digit stands 10 by 10, and 100 by 100, but up to 1001999, each digit appears the same number of times, so the sum, after the number of sequences is 10020:begin{array}{r}10020 cdot 10(0+1+ldots+9)+4 cdot 0=4509000, 1002 cdot 100(0+1+ldots+9)+4 cdot 0=4509000end{array}In the thousands and millions place values, the 1's digit appears more often than the others, and the 0 also appears in the 10^{4} and 10^{5} place values, respectively:begin{array}{rlr}100 cdot 1000(0+1+ldots+9)+1000(0+1)+4 cdot 2 & =4501008 10 cdot 10000(0+1+ldots+9)+2004 cdot 0 & & =4500000 100000(0+1+ldots+9)+2004 cdot 0 & & =4500000 2004 cdot 1 & & =2004end{array}Thus, the sum of the column sums is 27030018."},{"problem":"+ Find all integer pairs (x, y) such that1+2^{x}+2^{2 x+1}=y^{2} .","solution":"If (x, y) is a solution, then x geqslant 0, (x, -y) is also a solution.

Understanding the Properties of the Terms:   - Since |a-2|geqslant 0 and left(b+3right)^{2}geqslant 0, both terms must individually equal zero to satisfy the given equation. This is because their sum is zero, and being non-negative, the only way their sum can be zero is if each term is zero.2. Solving for a:   - From |a-2|=0, we deduce that a-2=0. This is because the absolute value of a number is zero if and only if that number itself is zero.   - Solving for a, we get a=2+0=2.3. Solving for b:   - From left(b+3right)^{2}=0, we find that b+3=0. This is because the square of a number is zero if and only if that number itself is zero.   - Solving for b, we get b=-3-0=-3.4.

The conditions given are:[ m ge frac{1}{2} n + 7 ][ n ge frac{1}{2} m + 7 ]A positive integer ( k ge 1 ) is called lonely if ((k, ell)) is not compatible for any integer (ell ge 1). This means that for a lonely integer ( k ), there does not exist any (ell) such that both conditions are satisfied.1. Analyze the conditions for compatibility:   Suppose ( k ) is a lonely integer. Then for any (ell ge 1), at least one of the conditions must fail. We start by assuming that there exists some (ell) such that:   [ k ge frac{1}{2} ell + 7 ]   This implies:   [ 2(k - 7) ge ell ]2. Substitute (ell) into the second condition:   We also need to satisfy:   [ ell ge frac{1}{2} k + 7 ]   Substituting (ell) from the first condition, we get:   [ 2(k - 7) ge frac{1}{2} k + 7 ]3.

The function f(x) = ax^2 - 2x + 1 will be monotonically decreasing if its derivative f'(x) is non-positive in the interval [1, 10].1. If a = 0, then f(x) = -2x + 1, which is a linear function with a negative slope. Hence, it is monotonically decreasing on [1, 10]. 2. If a > 0, the function has a vertex at x = frac{1}{a}. For the function to be monotonically decreasing on [1, 10], the vertex must occur after the interval; hence, we should have  frac{1}{a} geq 10. Thus, we find that  0 < a leq frac{1}{10}. 3. If a < 0, the function is a downward-opening parabola, and the vertex is at x = frac{1}{a}.

Since the left side is an integer, the right side must also be an integer. The square root of an integer is either an integer or irrational (but never a non-integer fraction), so sqrt{x-y} must be an integer. The right side of the equation is divisible by 3, so the left side must also be. Thus 3 mid x^{2}+y^{2}. But squares are always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3, so this can only happen if x^{2} equiv y^{2} equiv 0 bmod 3. Therefore, x and y are both divisible by 3. Write x=3 a and y=3 b and substitute:9 a^{2}+9 b^{2}+3^{3}=456 sqrt{3 a-3 b} .Square roots of integers are generally either integers or irrational. But sqrt{3 a-3 b} cannot be irrational, as it equals frac{9 a^{2}+9 b^{2}+3^{3}}{456}, so it must be an integer. Therefore, 3 a-3 b is a square, and since it is also divisible by 3, it must be divisible by 9. We can now divide both sides of the equation by 9:a^{2}+b^{2}+3=152 sqrt{frac{a-b}{3}} .Write a-b=3 c^{2} and substitute a=b+3 c^{2}:9 c^{4}+6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}+3=152 c .Since all terms on the left side are positive, we must have 9 c^{4}+6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}+3 geq 152 c. Since 9 c^{4}+6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}+3 geq 9 c^{4}+3 geq 16+frac{8}{9}, it follows that c leq 2. Furthermore, 152 c is even, as is 6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}, so 9 c^{4}+3 must also be even, which means c must be odd. Therefore, the only possibility is c=1. Substituting this, we get9+6 b+2 b^{2}+3=152orb^{2}+3 b-70=0 .This can also be written as (b-7)(b+10)=0. So b=7 or b=-10. In the first case, we get a=b+3 c^{2}=10 and thus x=30 and y=21. In the second case, we get a=b+3 c^{2}=-7 and thus x=-21 and y=-30. Checking shows that both pairs satisfy the equation.

Substituting this into the hyperbola equation 4x^{2}-y^{2}=1, we obtain 4x^{2}-k^{2}(x-frac{1}{2})^{2}=1. Simplifying this yields (4-k^{2})x^{2}+k^{2}x-frac{k^{2}}{4}-1=0.    a.

We are given that the graph of this power function passes through the point (3, frac{1}{9}). This means we can set up the equation f(3) = 3^{alpha} = frac{1}{9}.Now, we know that frac{1}{9} can also be written as 3^{-2}, because 9 = 3^2 and taking the reciprocal of a base to a power is equivalent to changing the sign of the exponent. Therefore, we have 3^{alpha} = 3^{-2}.From this equation, we can equate the exponents of the base 3 to solve for alpha. This gives us alpha = -2. Thus, our power function is f(x) = x^{-2}.Next, we need to determine the interval of monotonic decreasing for f(x) = x^{-2}. A function is monotonic decreasing if as x increases, f(x) decreases. For f(x) = x^{-2}, as x moves away from 0 in either direction (positive or negative), the value of f(x) decreases because the negative exponent means we're dealing with the reciprocal of x^2, which gets smaller as x gets larger in absolute value. However, since x^{-2} is undefined at x=0, we only consider the intervals where x is not equal to 0. For x > 0, as x increases, x^{-2} decreases, which means the function is decreasing in the interval (0, +infty). For x < 0, as x decreases (moves to the left on the number line), x^{-2} still decreases because we are looking at the reciprocal of a square, which is always positive and decreases as the absolute value of x increases. However, the function does not actually decrease as x moves from negative to positive; it increases due to the nature of the reciprocal of a square function. Therefore, the correct interval of monotonic decreasing is only (0, +infty).Hence, the correct answer to the question is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"6.

It is easy to prove that in this process, the segment BO is mapped to a segment B'O' which lies on the tangent to the circle (B, AB) at point C.

We need to find the number of ordered pairs ((x, y)) such that (x) and (y) are positive integers. This is equivalent to finding the number of divisors of (n^2). Let (n) have the prime factorization:   [   n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k}   ]   Then the number of divisors of (n^2) is given by:   [   sigma(n^2) = (2e_1 + 1)(2e_2 + 1) cdots (2e_k + 1)   ]4.

At each vertex of the grid, an even number of colored edges meet, except for ( A ) and ( B ), where an odd number of colored edges meet.2. Initial Assumptions and Conditions:   - Assume the scenario is possible for some ( n ).   - Since exactly two edges meet at ( (0,0) ), they are either both colored or not colored. Due to condition (1), both these edges must be colored, while the edge joining ( (0,1) ) and ( (1,0) ) must be left uncolored.3. Applying Conditions to Small Triangles:   - For the triangle with vertices ( (0,1) ), ( (1,0) ), and ( (1,1) ), the other two sides must be colored.   - Applying condition (2) to vertices ( (0,1) ) and ( (1,0) ), the edges joining these points to ( (0,2) ) and ( (2,0) ), respectively, must be left uncolored.   - Consequently, edges joining ( (1,1) ) to both ( (0,2) ) and ( (2,0) ) must be colored.4.

Due to condition (1), both are colored, while the edge joining ( (2,1) ) and ( (1,2) ) must be uncolored.   - Hence, edges joining ( (2,2) ) to both ( (1,2) ) and ( (2,1) ) are colored.5.

Consequently, edges joining ( (3,0) ) to both ( (2,0) ) and ( (2,1) ) must be colored.   - Due to condition (2), the edge joining ( (2,1) ) and ( (3,1) ) must be colored, or the edge joining ( (3,0) ) and ( (3,1) ) is uncolored.   - This makes the scenario impossible for ( n = 3 ), as there would be an even number of colored edges meeting at ( A ).7.

(0 is also considered a square number.)","solution":"A square number, when divided by 4, leaves a remainder of 0 or 1, so the sum of two square numbers cannot leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. Therefore, among four or more consecutive natural numbers, there is one that cannot be expressed as the sum of two square numbers, and thus the largest value of k can be at most 3.We will show that this largest value is precisely 3: we will provide infinitely many triples of consecutive numbers, all of whose elements can be written as the sum of two square numbers. We will call numbers with this property \\"beautiful.\\"It seems natural to examine triples of the form left{m^{2}-1, m^{2}, m^{2}+1right}, since the second and third elements are beautiful left(m^{2}+0^{2}, m^{2}+1^{2}right), and thus it suffices to show that m^{2}-1 is beautiful for infinitely many natural numbers m.An identity from Euler states that the product of beautiful numbers is also beautiful. Indeed,left(a^{2}+b^{2}right)left(c^{2}+d^{2}right)=(a c)^{2}+(b d)^{2}+(a d)^{2}+(b c)^{2}=(a c+b d)^{2}+(a d-b c)^{2}If m^{2}-1 is beautiful, thenleft(m^{2}right)^{2}-1=left(m^{2}-1right)left(m^{2}+1right)and thus, by (1), left(m^{2}right)^{2}-1 is beautiful as a product of beautiful numbers.It suffices, therefore, to find a single square number a^{2} such that a^{2}-1 is beautiful, because then, according to the above, choosing a_{0}=a, a_{n}=a_{n-1}^{2}, every element of the sequence a_{n}^{2}-1 is beautiful.Since 8=3^{2}-1=2^{2}+2^{2}, a=3 is suitable. The sequence 3^{2^{n}}-1(n geqq 1) thus obtained has every element beautiful, and thus the tripleleft{3^{2^{n}}-1,3^{2^{n}}, 3^{2^{n}}+1right}has all its elements expressible as the sum of two square numbers for every positive integer n.Therefore, the largest value of k is 3.Remark: It is easily seen that 4 n^{4}+4 n^{2} and the next two natural numbers also form a suitable triple for any positive integer n, sincebegin{gathered}4 n^{4}+4 n^{2}=left(2 n^{2}right)^{2}+left(2 n^{2}right)^{2} 4 n^{4}+4 n^{2}+1=left(2 n^{2}+1right)^{2}+0^{2} 4 n^{4}+4 n^{2}+2=left(2 n^{2}+1right)^{2}+1^{2}end{gathered}István Peremiczki (Budapest, Berzsenyi D.

No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue. At the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet. After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls. Let k(mathfrak{L}) be the largest number k such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth mathfrak{L}, Morgana can always place at least k knights such that no two of them can ever meet. For each n, what are all possible values for k(mathfrak{L}), where mathfrak{L} is a labyrinth with n walls? (Canada)","solution":"First we show by induction that the n walls divide the plane into binom{n+1}{2}+1 regions. The claim is true for n=0 as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the n^{text{th}} wall, it intersects each of the n-1 other walls exactly once and hence splits each of n of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields left(binom{n}{2}+1right)+n=binom{n+1}{2}+1 regions, proving the claim. Now let G be the graph with vertices given by the binom{n+1}{2}+1 regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them. We now show that no matter how Merlin paints the n walls, Morgana can place at least n+1 knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly binom{n}{2} intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in G. Consider adding the edges of G sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of G is at least binom{n+1}{2}+1-binom{n}{2}=n+1. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of G, then no two knights can ever meet. Now we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can color it such that there are exactly n+1 connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most n+1 knights. First, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and n. We claim that, for each i, the regions labelled i are connected by doors. First, we note that for each i with 0 leqslant i leqslant n there is a unique region labelled i which is unbounded to the north. Now, consider a knight placed in some region with label i, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label i. Eventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label i. Hence every region with label i is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label i are connected to each other. As a result, there are exactly n+1 connected components, and Morgana can place at most n+1 knights. Comment. Variations on this argument exist: some of them capture more information, and some of them capture less information, about the connected components according to this system of numbering. For example, it can be shown that the unbounded regions are numbered 0,1, ldots, n-1, n, n-1, ldots, 1 as one cycles around them, that the regions labelled 0 and n are the only regions in their connected components, and that each other connected component forms a single chain running between the two unbounded ones. It is also possible to argue that the regions are acyclic without revealing much about their structure."},{"problem":"5.

For the function to have property T, the product of the slopes of the tangents at two points P_1(x_1, y_1) and P_2(x_2, y_2) must be -1:[g'(x_1)g'(x_2) = [a + cos(2x_1 + varphi)][a + cos(2x_2 + varphi)] = -1]Expanding this, we get:[a^2 + [cos(2x_1 + varphi) + cos(2x_2 + varphi)]a + cos(2x_1 + varphi)cos(2x_2 + varphi) + 1 = 0]3. Considering this as a quadratic equation in a, the discriminant Delta must be non-negative:[Delta = [cos(2x_1 + varphi) + cos(2x_2 + varphi)]^2 - 4[cos(2x_1 + varphi)cos(2x_2 + varphi) + 1] geq 0]Simplifying, we find:[Delta = [cos(2x_1 + varphi) - cos(2x_2 + varphi)]^2 - 4 geq 0]Given the range of cosine, we deduce:[-2 leq cos(2x_1 + varphi) - cos(2x_2 + varphi) leq 2]Thus, Delta = 0, leading to:[cos(2x_1 + varphi) = -1 text{ and } cos(2x_2 + varphi) = 1] or vice versa.4. Substituting back, we find a^2 = 0, hence a = 0.5. Given b^2 + c^2 = 1, we can assume b = cos theta and c = sin theta for some theta in mathbb{R}, leading to:[|b + c| = |cos theta + sin theta| = |sqrt{2}sin(theta + frac{pi}{4})| leq sqrt{2}]This implies:[-sqrt{2} leq b + c leq sqrt{2}]Therefore, combining a = 0 with the range of b + c, we conclude:[a + b + c in [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}]]Hence, the range of the real number a + b + c is boxed{[-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}]}."},{"problem":"Evaluate the integral int_{frac{pi}{2}}^{frac{3pi}{2}} sin(x) dx = ______.","solution":"To solve the problem, we will first find the antiderivative of sin(x) and then apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral.1.

This is because each divisor ( d ) of ( P ) can be paired with ( P/d ), and the product of each pair is ( P ). Since there are ( tau(P) ) divisors, there are ( tau(P)/2 ) such pairs.3. Given that the product of all divisors is ( P^2 ), we have:   [   P^{tau(P)/2} = P^2   ]   Dividing both sides by ( P ) (assuming ( P neq 0 )):   [   tau(P)/2 = 2   ]   Therefore:   [   tau(P) = 4   ]4.

Given the equation for the angles of triangle ABC:    [   cos(3A) + cos(3B) + cos(3C) = 1   ]   We start by using the sum-to-product identity for the first two terms:   [   cos(3A) + cos(3B) = 2 cosleft(frac{3(A+B)}{2}right) cosleft(frac{3(A-B)}{2}right)   ]   Note that since A + B + C = 180^circ, we have C = 180^circ - (A + B).2.

Consider a circle with n equally spaced points. Label an arbitrary point as P_1.

This ensures equal chords and equal angles subtended by the chords.2. We need to determine how many points we skip for a given value of n. Skipping by k points means that the destination point and the source point have k-1 points in between them. For example, skipping 1 point means going to an adjacent vertex.3. If k divides n, then you won't go through all the n points. For instance, if n = 8 and k = 2, you will only visit every second point, forming a smaller cycle within the n points. Therefore, k must not divide n for the path to cover all n points.4. The number of valid skips is given by Euler's totient function phi(n), which counts the integers up to n that are coprime with n. However, skipping by k is the same as skipping by n-k because skipping by n-k just reverses the direction relative to skipping by k. Thus, we divide by 2 to account for this symmetry.5. Additionally, skipping by 1 never gives a valid star for any n because it simply forms a regular polygon without intersecting lines. Therefore, we subtract one from our count.6.

Initially, when the selling price is 40 yuan, 600 lamps are sold. If the price decreases by 1 yuan, the monthly sales increase by 200 lamps. Therefore, if the price decreases by x yuan, the increase in sales would be 200x lamps. Thus, the total number of lamps sold per month after the price decrease would be the initial sales plus the increase in sales, which is 600 + 200x lamps.So, the number of lamps sold per month if the price decreases by x yuan is boxed{600 + 200x}.(2) To find the selling price of each desk lamp that would result in an exact monthly profit of 8400 yuan, let's denote the decrease in price by x yuan. The new selling price would then be (40 - x) yuan per lamp. According to the problem, the cost of each lamp is 30 yuan, so the profit per lamp would be (40 - x - 30) = (10 - x) yuan.Given that the number of lamps sold changes with the price, the total number of lamps sold when the price decreases by x yuan is (600 + 200x). Therefore, the total profit can be calculated as the product of the profit per lamp and the total number of lamps sold, which gives us the equation: (10 - x)(600 + 200x) = 8400.Expanding and simplifying this equation, we find the possible values for x. Upon solving, we find two possible values for x, which are x_1 = 3 and x_2 = 4 (rounded).- When x = 3, the new selling price is 40 - 3 = 37 yuan. Checking the stock condition, (40 - 37) times 200 + 600 = 1200, which is less than the stock of 1210 lamps, indicating insufficient stock for this price setting.  - When x = 4, the new selling price is 40 - 4 = 36 yuan. However, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation for this scenario in the provided solution. Correctly, when x = 4, the selling price should indeed be 40 - 4 = 36 yuan, but the calculation for the number of lamps sold should directly follow from the equation for the number of lamps sold per month, which is not directly dependent on the profit calculation as described.Given the context and the goal to find the correct selling price for an 8400 yuan profit with a stock of 1210 lamps, the correct approach is to solve the profit equation for x and then determine the selling price accordingly. The provided solution indicates a selling price of 37 yuan to achieve the desired profit, which aligns with the scenario where x = 3.Therefore, the selling price of each desk lamp to achieve an exact monthly profit of 8400 yuan, considering the stock and the conditions given, is boxed{37 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"2.

It is known that there is a unique way to cut the grid along the grid lines into some rectangles, such that each rectangle contains exactly one blue cell. Find the minimum possible value of n.(2015, Bulgarian Mathematical Olympiad)It is easy to give an answer to this problem, but it is not easy to write the process clearly. It should be emphasized that when writing solutions to mathematical problems, especially combinatorial problems, attention should be paid to:(1) Logical relationships should be clear;(2) Notations should be declared;(3) The structure should be clear, and frequently used small conclusions should be stated as lemmas;(4) Key points should be clearly written (reasonable definitions, clear conclusions).","solution":"The minimum possible value of n is 101.First, prove the more general conclusion below.Lemma Given an n times n grid P with m cells colored blue. A \\"good\\" partition of the grid P is defined as: if the grid is divided along the grid lines into m rectangles, and each rectangle contains exactly one blue cell. Then the grid P has a unique good partition if and only if the m blue cells form a rectangle.Proof On the one hand, if the m blue cells form a m_{1} times m_{2}left(m_{1} 、 m_{2} geqslant 1right) rectangle A, cut the four corner cells of A to form rectangles with the four corner cells of the grid P; the cells on the four sides of A form 1 times s(s geqslant 1) rectangles with the cells at the top and bottom (left and right) ends of their respective rows (columns); each cell inside the rectangle A forms a rectangle by itself. This constitutes a good partition S of the grid P, and it is easy to see that the grid P has only this unique good partition.On the other hand, consider the grid P has a unique good partition S. Define a grid line as a \\"partition line\\" if it can divide the grid P into two rectangles, and each rectangle contains at least one blue cell.We now prove: every rectangle A containing at least one blue cell has a good partition.We use mathematical induction on the number of blue cells k in the rectangle A to prove conclusion (1).If k=1, then by the definition of a good partition, conclusion (1) is obviously true.Assume conclusion (1) holds for k leqslant t-1.Consider the case k=t. In this case, there exists a partition line that divides the rectangle A into two rectangles A_{1} 、 A_{2}, and each rectangle contains at least one blue cell. By the induction hypothesis, A_{1} 、 A_{2} each have a good partition. Therefore, the rectangle A has a good partition, and conclusion (1) holds.By conclusion (1) and the definition of a partition line, every partition line l divides the grid P into two rectangles, each of which has a good partition. Since S is the unique good partition of the grid P, the partition S includes all partition lines in the grid P.Let l_{1}, l_{2}, cdots, l_{p} be all the vertical partition lines from left to right, and m_{1}, m_{2}, cdots, m_{q} be all the horizontal partition lines from bottom to top. They divide the grid P into some rectangles, and each rectangle contains at most one blue cell. Since S divides the grid P using these partition lines, it results in m rectangles, each containing exactly one blue cell.Let l_{0} be the vertical grid line closest to l_{1} on the left with no blue cells to its left, and l_{p+1} be the vertical grid line closest to l_{p} on the right with no blue cells to its right. Similarly, define m_{0} 、 m_{q+1} as the horizontal grid lines.By the above discussion, the distance between l_{i} and l_{i+1}dleft(l_{i}, l_{i+1}right)=1(i=0,1, cdots, p);otherwise, a new partition line can be added between two partition lines.Similarly, dleft(m_{j}, m_{j+1}right)=1(j=0,1, cdots, q).Therefore, the blue cells form a rectangle with l_{0} 、 l_{p+1} 、 m_{0} 、 m_{q+1} as boundary lines.The lemma is proved.By the lemma, since the grid P has a unique good partition, the 101 blue cells must form a rectangle. Therefore, it can only be a 1 times 101 rectangle.Hence, the minimum value of n is 101."},{"problem":"Which of the following statements is correct?A: In triangle triangle ABC, if overrightarrow{AB}•overrightarrow{BC}＜0, then triangle ABC must be an obtuse triangle.B: In triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c, respectively. If c=2acos B, then the shape of triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.C: In triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c, respectively. If acos A=bcos B, then triangle ABC must be an isosceles triangle.D: In triangle triangle ABC, if sin ^{2}A+sin ^{2}B lt sin ^{2}C, then triangle ABC is definitely an obtuse triangle.","solution":"To analyze each option systematically:Option A: The statement asserts that if vec{AB} cdot vec{BC} < 0, then triangle ABC must be an obtuse triangle. To understand this, recall that the dot product vec{AB} cdot vec{BC} < 0 when the angle between vec{AB} and vec{BC} exceeds 90^{circ}. However, this angle is not necessarily one of the triangle's internal angles, meaning that while the condition for the dot product being less than zero can be met, it does not guarantee that triangle ABC must be obtuse. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.Option B: Here, we have c = 2acos B. Using the Law of Sines, we find:[sin C = sin (A + B) = 2sin A cos B]This leads to the relationship:[cos A sin B = sin A cos B]From this, we can deduce that:[tan A = tan B]Which implies that A = B, and thereby, triangle ABC is isosceles. Hence, option B is correct.Option C: Given acos A = bcos B, we can manipulate this into the form of a trigonometric identity:[frac{sin A}{cos A} = frac{sin B}{cos B}]Which simplifies to:[sin 2A = sin 2B]This could mean either 2A = 2B or 2A + 2B = pi, which corresponds to A = B or A + B = frac{pi}{2}. Since the triangle could also be a right triangle with A and B summing to frac{pi}{2}, option C cannot be definitively correct in stating triangle ABC must be isosceles based solely on this condition.Option D: The inequality sin^2A + sin^2B < sin^2C translates to the sides of the triangle as a^2 + b^2 < c^2, by the Law of Cosines, which indicates that cos C < 0. This condition is satisfied only if C is an obtuse angle, making triangle ABC an obtuse triangle. Therefore, option D is correct.Combining these analyses, the correct answer is that options B and D are true statements regarding the properties of triangles based on the given conditions.

S is nothing more than the total number of digits occurring in the frame, A+10. We wrote numbers in ten places in the frame, so A geqq 10. If the numbers written are single-digit - which was taken for granted in most of the submitted solutions - then A=10 and thus S=20. However, it is possible that we did not write only single-digit numbers. In this case, A>10, and at least (A-10) digits are in the tens place. The sum of the numbers written, A+10, is then at least 10(A-10), from which A leqq frac{110}{9}A.The sum of the numbers written, S, is therefore either 20 or 21, in the latter case, we wrote exactly one two-digit number in the frame. Let the number of occurrences of the i digit in the frame be a_{i}, and first examine the case S=a_{0}+a_{1}+ldots+a_{9}=20.Since a_{1}=1 cannot be, 12. The sum of the other 7 numbers written is thus at most 6, which is not possible.In the case of a_{1}=11, a_{0}=1, so out of the 11 one's, a_{0}, a_{1}, and the pre-written 1 make up four, so 1 goes on 7 of the remaining 8 places. The sum of these 9 numbers is 11+8=19, so the only digit different from 1 must be 2. Therefore, in the frame, there can be 2 twos, 11 ones, and every other digit can only appear once.

Case Analysis:   - If ( AP > BP ), moving ( P ) along ( PA ) towards ( A ) would decrease ( f ), contradicting the choice of ( P ). Therefore, ( AP = BP ).   - If ( BP > CP ), then either ( P ) is the midpoint of ( AB ) (case 3 of the lemma), or moving ( P ) towards the midpoint of ( AB ) would decrease ( f ), again leading to a contradiction. Thus, ( AP = BP = CP ).   - If ( AP = BP = CP > DP ), then either ( P ) is the circumcenter of ( ABC ) or moving ( P ) towards it would decrease ( f ). Therefore, ( P ) must be the circumcenter of ( ABC ).   - If ( ABC ) is not acute, and for example, angle ( A ) is not acute, then either ( A ) is right and the sphere with diameter ( BC ) contains the tetrahedron, or ( A ) is obtuse and moving ( P ) towards the midpoint of ( BC ) would decrease ( f ). Thus, ( ABC ) is acute (case 2 of the lemma).   - If ( AP = BP = CP = DP ), then either ( P ) is inside ( ABCD ) (case 1 of the lemma), or ( P ) and ( A ) are separated by the plane ( BCD ). Moving ( P ) towards the plane ( BCD ) along its normal would decrease ( f ).3. Solving the Problem:   - We need to show that the sphere from the lemma has a radius of at most ( frac{3}{2sqrt{2}} ).   - In cases 2 and 3, the radius is clearly at most 1.   - For case 1, let ( PA = PB = PC = PD = r ) and let ( a, b, c, d ) be vectors ( overrightarrow{PA}, overrightarrow{PB}, overrightarrow{PC}, overrightarrow{PD} ) respectively. Place the origin at ( P ).   - Since ( P ) is inside ( ABCD ), for some positive ( x, y, z, w ), we have ( xa + yb + zc + wd = 0 ). Without loss of generality, assume ( x le y, z, w ).   - Then ( Q = -frac{ax}{y+z+w} = frac{yb + zc + wd}{y+z+w} ) is a point inside triangle ( BCD ). Moreover, ( PQ = frac{rx}{y+z+w} le frac{r}{3} ).4. Acute Triangle Case:   - If ( BCD ) is acute and ( O ) is its circumcenter, then ( PO ) is perpendicular to the plane ( BCD ) and ( PO le PQ le frac{r}{3} ).   - Thus,     [     OB^2 = PB^2 - PO^2 ge r^2 - left(frac{r}{3}right)^2 = r^2 - frac{r^2}{9} = frac{8r^2}{9}.     ]   - Since ( OB le 1 ), we have ( r le frac{3}{2sqrt{2}} ).5. Non-Acute Triangle Case:   - If ( BCD ) is not acute, and for instance, angle ( B ) is not acute, let ( M ) be the midpoint of ( CD ). Then ( OM le OQ ) and ( PM le PQ le frac{r}{3} ).   - Therefore,     [     MC^2 = PC^2 - PM^2 ge r^2 - left(frac{r}{3}right)^2 = r^2 - frac{r^2}{9} = frac{8r^2}{9}.     ]   - Again, since ( MC le 1 ), we have ( r le frac{3}{2sqrt{2}} ).Thus, in all cases, the radius of the sphere containing the tetrahedron is at most ( frac{3}{2sqrt{2}} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{3}{2sqrt{2}} } )"},{"problem":"Given a set of data (-3, 5, 7, x, 11), and the mode of this data set is (5), then the median of the data isA:  (7)B:   (5)C:  (6)D:  (11)","solution":"AnalysisThis question primarily examines the concepts and basic operations of median and mode, and it is considered a medium-level question.SolutionGiven the data set (-3, 5, 7, x, 11) and the mode of this data set is (5), it implies that (x=5).Therefore, the median of the data is (5).Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{B}}."},{"problem":"Given that a,b in mathbb{R}, and a + bi = frac{11 - 7i}{1 - 2i} (i is the imaginary unit), find the value of a + b.","solution":"This problem involves the operations of complex numbers and the necessary and sufficient conditions for complex numbers to be equal.

However, in a rhombus, while all sides are equal, the diagonals are not necessarily equal in length. This is a unique property of a square that a rhombus does not necessarily share.- Diagonals are perpendicular to each other: Both squares and rhombuses have diagonals that are perpendicular to each other. This is a common property and not unique to squares.- Diagonals bisect each other: In both squares and rhombuses, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the point where the diagonals intersect divides each diagonal into two equal parts. Again, this is a shared property.- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles: This property is essentially a combination of the properties that the diagonals are perpendicular to each other and that they bisect each other. Since both squares and rhombuses have diagonals that are perpendicular and bisect each other, this property is not unique to squares.Given these considerations, we can conclude that the unique property of a square, which a rhombus does not necessarily have, is that its diagonals are equal in length.

This means the increased upstream speed = original downstream speed, i.e., original boat speed + water speed = original boat speed × 2 - water speed, from which we can deduce that the original boat speed = water speed × 2. When the cruise ship departs from point A, it also uses double the boat speed, so its speed is: original boat speed × 2 + water speed = water speed × 5. The original speed from point A to downstream point B is: original boat speed + water speed = water speed × 3. The speed ratio when the cruise ship departs from point A using double the boat speed to the original speed from point A to downstream point B is: water speed × 5 : water speed × 3 = 5 : 3.

We define [i]odd partition[/i] in a similar way. Determine all n such that the number of even partitions is equal to the number of odd partitions.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine all natural numbers ( n ) such that the number of even partitions of ( n ) is equal to the number of odd partitions of ( n ). An even partition is a partition where all parts are even, and an odd partition is a partition where all parts are odd.2. Case Analysis for Odd ( n ):   If ( n ) is odd, then there cannot be any even partitions because the sum of even numbers is always even. Therefore, the number of even partitions is zero. However, there is at least one odd partition (e.g., ( (n) ) itself). Hence, for odd ( n ), the number of even partitions is not equal to the number of odd partitions.3. Case Analysis for Even ( n ):   Let ( n ) be even. We need to compare the number of even partitions and odd partitions.4. Constructing Odd Partitions from Even Partitions:   Given an even partition ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) ) where ( x_i ) are all even, we can construct an odd partition by subtracting 1 from each ( x_i ) and adding ( k ) ones:   [   (x_1 - 1, x_2 - 1, ldots, x_k - 1, 1, 1, ldots, 1)   ]   This transformation is injective because we can recover the original even partition by reversing the process: count the number of 1's to determine ( k ), then add 1 to each of the remaining numbers.5. Checking for Missing Partitions:   For ( n geq 6 ), consider the odd partition ( (n-3, 3) ). This partition cannot be obtained from any even partition using the above transformation because it would require an even partition of ( n-2 ), which is not possible since ( n-2 ) is even and cannot be partitioned into all even parts.6. Special Cases ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 4 ):   - For ( n = 2 ):     - Even partitions: ( (2) )     - Odd partitions: ( (1, 1) )     - Both counts are 1.   - For ( n = 4 ):     - Even partitions: ( (4), (2, 2) )     - Odd partitions: ( (3, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1) )     - Both counts are 2.7. Conclusion:   For ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 4 ), the number of even partitions is equal to the number of odd partitions. For ( n geq 6 ), the number of odd partitions is greater than the number of even partitions.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 2, 4 } )"},{"problem":"Given circle C_{1}: x^{2}+y^{2}=1 and circle C_{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}+4x-6y+4=0, determine the positional relationship between circles C_{1} and C_{2}.A: ExternalB: TangentC: IntersectingD: Internally tangent","solution":"Circle C_{1}: x^{2}+y^{2}=1 represents a circle with center C_{1}(0,0) and a radius of 1.Circle C_{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}+4x-6y+4=0 can be rewritten as (x+2)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=9, which represents a circle with center C_{2}(-2,3) and a radius of 3.The distance between the centers of the two circles is d= sqrt {4+9}=sqrt {13}.Since 3-1 < sqrt {13} < 3+1, the two circles intersect.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{C}.To solve this problem, we converted the given circle equations into standard form to find their centers and radii.

Equal Area Sums:   Since (w + z = x + y = 680a), it implies that the areas of opposite quadrilaterals sum to the same value. This symmetry suggests that (AE cong CG) and (DE cong BG).3.

Center of the Square:   By symmetry, (O) is the center of the square. The areas of the triangles formed by the diagonals are:   [   [AIOE] = frac{1}{4} cdot 1360a = 340a   ]   The area of (HIOP) is:   [   [HIOP] = [AIOE] - [AHPE] = 340a - 269a = 71a   ]   Similarly, the area of (POJF) is:   [   [POJF] = 65a   ]7. Area of Triangle (QOP):   Let (Q) be a point on (HF) such that (QO parallel AB). Since (O) is the center of the square:   [   [HIOQ] = [QOJF] = frac{1}{2}([HIOP] + [POJF]) = 68a   ]   Thus, the area of (QOP) is:   [   [QOP] = 3a   ]   The ratio of the area of (QOP) to (HIJF) is:   [   frac{[QOP]}{[HIJF]} = frac{3a}{71a + 65a} = frac{3}{136}   ]   Since triangle (QOP) and parallelogram (HIJF) have the same height (OP):   [   frac{QP}{HF} = 2 cdot frac{3}{136} = frac{3}{68}   ]   Therefore, (QP = frac{3}{2}).8.

Given that (a) and (b) are the legs of a right triangle and (c) is the hypotenuse, we start with the Pythagorean theorem:   [   a^2 + b^2 = c^2   ]2. Consider the expression ((4a - 3b)^2). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, we have:   [   (4a - 3b)^2 geq 0   ]3. Expanding ((4a - 3b)^2), we get:   [   (4a - 3b)^2 = 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2   ]   Therefore,   [   16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 geq 0   ]4. Using the Pythagorean identity (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can rewrite the inequality:   [   16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2 geq 0   ]5. Notice that (25(a^2 + b^2) = 25c^2). We can compare this with the expanded form:   [   25(a^2 + b^2) = 25c^2   ]6. Now, we need to show that:   [   25c^2 geq 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2   ]7. Since (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can substitute (c^2) back into the inequality:   [   25c^2 geq 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2   ]8. Dividing both sides by 25, we get:   [   c^2 geq frac{16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2}{25}   ]9. To show that (3a + 4b leq 5c), we can use the fact that:   [   (3a + 4b)^2 leq (5c)^2   ]10. Expanding both sides, we get:    [    9a^2 + 24ab + 16b^2 leq 25c^2    ]11. Since (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can substitute (c^2) back into the inequality:    [    9a^2 + 24ab + 16b^2 leq 25(a^2 + b^2)    ]12. This simplifies to:    [    9a^2 + 24ab + 16b^2 leq 25a^2 + 25b^2    ]13. Rearranging terms, we get:    [    0 leq 16a^2 - 24ab + 9b^2    ]14. This is true since ((4a - 3b)^2 geq 0).15. Therefore, we have shown that:    [    3a + 4b leq 5c    ]16. Equality holds when ((4a - 3b)^2 = 0), which implies:    [    4a = 3b implies frac{a}{b} = frac{3}{4}    ]17.

By using the sine law, we can derive (a - b) b = (a - c)(a + c).   Simplifying this expression leads to c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - ab, and consequently, cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = frac{1}{2}. Given that 0 < C < pi, we find that C = frac{pi}{3}.2. From overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{CB} = -27, we obtain overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB} = 27, which leads to |overrightarrow{CA}| |overrightarrow{CB}| cos C = 27. Using the value of C determined in part 1, we find that |overrightarrow{CA}| |overrightarrow{CB}| = 54.   Now, we have |overrightarrow{AB}|^2 = |overrightarrow{CB} - overrightarrow{CA}|^2 = |overrightarrow{CB}|^2 + |overrightarrow{CA}|^2 - 2overrightarrow{CB} cdot overrightarrow{CA}.   To minimize |overrightarrow{AB}|, we note that |overrightarrow{AB}|^2 geqslant 2|overrightarrow{CB}| cdot |overrightarrow{CA}| - 2 times 27 = 2 times 54 - 54 = 54, which results in |overrightarrow{AB}| geqslant 3 sqrt{6}.   Therefore, the minimum value of |overrightarrow{AB}| is boxed{3 sqrt{6}}. This occurs when |overrightarrow{CB}| = |overrightarrow{CA}| = 3 sqrt{6}."},{"problem":"Let ellipse G: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 left(a > b > 0right) intersect the positive y-axis at point B and have the right focus at point F.
