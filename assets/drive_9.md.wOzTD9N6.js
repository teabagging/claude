Suppose there exists an n-sided polygon satisfying the given conditions. Let the set of all its diagonals be T.From the given, we can construct a mappingf: T rightarrow T, l mapsto m=f(l),where l is the perpendicular bisector of m.If such an m is not unique, then choose any one.If there exist l_{1}, l_{2} such that f(l_{1})=f(l_{2})=m, then l_{1}, l_{2} are both perpendicular bisectors of m. Thus, l_{1}=l_{2}. This shows that f is injective. Since T is a finite set, f is a bijective mapping. Therefore, for each diagonal, there must exist a unique other diagonal that is its perpendicular bisector.As shown in Figure 19, let B, A, C be three consecutive vertices.Considering the diagonal BC, only the diagonals passing through point A can intersect it. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of BC must pass through point A. Thus, AB=AC.By the generality of the selection of points B, A, C, we know that all sides of the n-sided polygon are equal.As shown in Figure 20, let A, B, C, D be four consecutive vertices.If n>4, then AD is a diagonal, and its perpendicular bisector must pass through point B or C. Without loss of generality, assume the perpendicular bisector of AD passes through point B. Thus, BD=BA.Since AB=BC=CD, triangle BCD is an equilateral triangle, angle C=60^{circ}. This indicates that in any two consecutive interior angles of this polygon, one must be 60^{circ}. Therefore, the polygon has at least frac{n}{2} interior angles equal to 60^{circ}.By a well-known result, when n>3, any convex polygon has at most two interior angles equal to 60^{circ}.

Find f(1991) and the most general form for g.","solution":"f(1991) = -1992. g(x) is a polynomial in (x 2 + x) with integral coefficients. Solution Taking m = 1, and putting f(f(2)) = k, we get f( f(f(n)) + 1) = -n - k (*). Replacing m by f(f(m)) wet get f( f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) ) = - f( f( f(f(m)) + 1) - n. We can now interchange m and n to get f( f( f(f(m)) + 1) + n = f( f( f(f(n)) + 1) + m. Using (*), this gives f(-n-k) + n = f(-m-k) - m. Replacing -n-k by n and -m-k by m we get f(n) - f(m) = m - n for all m, n. Taking m = 0 and putting h = f(0), we get f(n) = h - n for all n. Applying this to the original relation gives h - m - f(f(n)) = -f( f(m+1)) - n. Taking n = m+1, we get h = -1. Hence f(n) = -(n+1) for all n. In particular, f(1991) = -1992. We want g to satisfy g(x) = g(-x-1) for all integers x. But since g(x) is a polynomial, it must satisfy the relation for all x. Put h(x) = g(x - ½). Then h(-x) = g(-x - ½) = g(x + ½ - 1) = g(x - ½) = h(x). So h(x) has only even powers of x. Hence g(x) = h(x + ½) has only even powers of (x + ½) and hence only power of (x + ½) 2 = x 2 + x + ¼. So we can certainly write g(x) as a polynomial in (x 2 + x). Since g(x) has integral coefficients, it is an easy induction to show that when g is written as a polynomial in (x 2 + x), the coefficients must be integers. Now suppose g is any such polynomial. Since x(x+1) = (-x-1)(-x-1 +1), we have that g(x) = g(-x-1).

Find the sum of the digits of 9A.","solution":"1. Let ( A ) be a natural number whose decimal digits form an increasing sequence. We can represent ( A ) as ( A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} ), where ( a_n, a_{n-1}, dots, a_0 ) are the digits of ( A ) and ( a_n < a_{n-1} < cdots < a_0 ).2. To find the sum of the digits of ( 9A ), we first express ( 9A ) in terms of ( A ):   [   9A = 10A - A   ]3. Consider the decimal representation of ( 10A ). If ( A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} ), then:   [   10A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10}   ]   This shifts all digits of ( A ) one place to the left and appends a zero at the end.4. Now, subtract ( A ) from ( 10A ):   [   9A = 10A - A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10} - overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10}   ]5. Perform the subtraction digit by digit:   [   overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10} - overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} = overline{(a_n)(a_{n-1} - a_n)(a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}) dots (a_0 - a_1 - 1)(10 - a_0)}_{10}   ]6. Since the digits of ( A ) form an increasing sequence, each subtraction ( a_{i-1} - a_i ) results in a non-negative digit, and the last term ( 10 - a_0 ) is also a non-negative digit.7. The sum of the digits of ( 9A ) can be calculated as follows:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_{i-1} - a_i) + (10 - a_0)   ]8. Notice that the sum of the differences ( (a_{i-1} - a_i) ) telescopes to ( a_n - a_0 ):   [   (a_n - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}) + cdots + (a_1 - a_0) = a_n - a_0   ]9. Therefore, the sum of the digits of ( 9A ) is:   [   a_n - a_0 + (10 - a_0) = a_n - a_0 + 10 - a_0 = a_n + 10 - 2a_0   ]10. Since ( a_n ) and ( a_0 ) are digits of ( A ) and ( a_n < a_0 ), the sum of the digits of ( 9A ) simplifies to:    [    9    ]The final answer is (boxed{9})."},{"problem":"Given three numbers a=log_{0.3}6, b=0.3^{6}, c=6^{0.3}, the relationship among these numbers is ( )A: b<c<aB: a<c<bC: b<a<cD: a<b<c","solution":"Since the logarithmic function y=log_{0.3}x is monotonically decreasing, we have a=log_{0.3}6leqlog_{0.3}1=0;  Furthermore, the exponential function y=0.3^{x} is monotonically decreasing, thus b=0.3^{6}6^0=1, which means c>1  Therefore, we have a<b<c,  Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{D}}."},{"problem":"Given the circle C: (x-4)^2+(y-3)^2=4 and two points A(-m,0), B(m,0) (m>0).

This statement {0} in varnothing suggests that the set containing 0 is an element of the empty set. This is also incorrect because, again, the empty set has no elements.C. The symbol subseteq denotes subset. {0} subseteq varnothing implies that the set containing 0 is a subset of the empty set. This is incorrect because the only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself.D. varnothing subseteq {0} correctly states that the empty set is a subset of the set containing 0.

Since the problem states that the two smaller rectangles are scaled-down versions of the original, the aspect ratio (ratio of the longer side to the shorter side) of the smaller rectangles must be the same as the original rectangle.4. Consider the first case where the cut is parallel to the longer side ( x ):   - The dimensions of the smaller rectangles are ( frac{x}{2} ) and ( y ).   - The aspect ratio of the smaller rectangles is ( frac{y}{frac{x}{2}} = frac{2y}{x} ).5.

This is the reasoning by recurrence.It should be noted that both parts of the proof are important, even if the first is often quite obvious. One must not forget to initialize the recurrence, that is, to prove that the property is true for n=0.

We start with the given equation x + 2y = 4.2. By the AM-GM inequality, we have x + 2y geqslant 2sqrt{2xy}.3. Substituting the given condition into the inequality gives 4 geqslant 2sqrt{2xy}.4. Simplifying, we find sqrt{2xy} leqslant 2, which implies 2xy leqslant 4.5. Therefore, xy leqslant 2.

We rewrite frac{4}{y} as frac{x + 2y}{y}, using the given x + 2y = 4.2. This gives frac{y}{x} + frac{x + 2y}{y} = frac{y}{x} + frac{x}{y} + 2.3. By the AM-GM inequality, frac{y}{x} + frac{x}{y} geqslant 2sqrt{frac{y}{x} cdot frac{x}{y}} = 2.4. Adding 2 to both sides of the inequality, we get frac{y}{x} + frac{x}{y} + 2 geqslant 4.5. Equality holds when frac{y}{x} = frac{x}{y}, which implies x = y. Substituting x = y into x + 2y = 4 gives x = y = frac{4}{3}.Therefore, the minimum value of frac{y}{x} + frac{4}{y} is boxed{4}."},{"problem":"Given the quadratic function about x: y=-(x-5)^{2}+1, when 2 lt x lt 6, the range of y is ______.","solution":"To solve for the range of y for the given quadratic function y=-(x-5)^{2}+1 when 2 < x < 6, we follow these steps:1. Identify the Vertex: The given quadratic function is in the vertex form y=a(x-h)^{2}+k where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola. For our function, h=5 and k=1, so the vertex is at (5,1). Since a=-1, the parabola opens downwards.2. Axis of Symmetry: The axis of symmetry is the line x=h, which for our function is x=5.3. Maximum Value: Because the parabola opens downwards and the vertex is the highest point within the range of x we are considering (2 < x < 6), the maximum value of y occurs at the vertex. Thus, when x=5, y=1.4. Minimum Value: To find the minimum value within the given range of x, we evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval. However, since x=6 is not included and the function decreases as we move away from x=5 towards x=2, we only need to calculate the value of the function at x=2:   [   y = -(2-5)^{2}+1 = -9+1 = -8.   ]Therefore, within the range 2 < x < 6, the function y has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -8.

We use the relationships x=rhocostheta and y=rhosintheta, and substitute these into the standard equation to get: (rhocostheta + 1)^2 + (rhosintheta - 1)^2 = 4. Expanding and simplifying, we get: rho^2cos^2theta + 2rhocostheta + 1 + rho^2sin^2theta - 2rhosintheta + 1 = 4, which simplifies to rho^2 + 2rho(costheta - sintheta) - 2 = 0.

Substituting theta = alpha into the equation gives us:rho^2 + 2rho(cosalpha - sinalpha) - 2 = 0.Let the points of intersection be A(rho_1, alpha) and B(rho_2, alpha). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is given by rho_1 + rho_2 = 2(cosalpha - sinalpha) = 2sqrt{2}sinleft(alpha - frac{pi}{4}right).Since the point M is the midpoint of AB, |OM| is half the sum of the radii of A and B. Therefore, |OM| = frac{|rho_1 + rho_2|}{2} = sqrt{2}| sinleft(alpha - frac{pi}{4}right)|.To maximize |OM|, we look for the maximum value of the absolute sine function, which is 1.

Clearly all members of the sequence must be divisors of its last member, 969 969. Using the decomposition into prime factors,969969=3 cdot 7 cdot 11 cdot 13 cdot 17 cdot 19 text {. }we thus see that the following holds:Each member a_{i} of the sequence a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} is the product of some (for i= 1 -of none, for i=k - of all) of the six distinct primes in the decomposition (1); furthermore, (for i<k ) the member a_{i+1} has, in addition to all the prime factors of a_{i}, also at least one new prime factor (since the sequence is to be increasing!). Conversely, each such finite sequence satisfies the conditions of the problem.From here it follows how one can describe each such sequence in an \\"economical manner\\": it is enough to list the new factors as they are turning up, that is, to give the sequence of ratiosfrac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}, frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}, frac{a_{4}}{a_{3}}, ldots, frac{a_{k-1}}{a_{k-2}}, frac{a_{k}}{a_{k-1}}into whose prime factorizations the six primes from (1) are distributed (at least one prime in each). The desired number of sequences is thus equal to the number of ways the six given primes can be distributed into one or several numbered nonempty groups (each corresponding to the prime factors of the ratios in (2), hence the order of the primes in a group is irrelevant). The word \\"numbered\\" means that the order of groups, on the other hand, does matter. For instance, for the distribution into two groups {3,11,19} and {7,13,17} we get, depending on the order in which the groups are considered, two possible sequence (1, u, u v) and (1, v, u v), where u=3 cdot 11 cdot 19 and v=7 cdot 13 cdot 17.We have thus arrived at the combinatorial problem of determining the value of P(6), where P(n) denotes the number of ways an n-element set X can be partitioned into any number of \\"numbered\\" nonempty subsets X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, ldots To compute P(6) we use the recurrence relationP(n)=left(begin{array}{l}n 1end{array}right) P(n-1)+left(begin{array}{l}n 2end{array}right) P(n-2)+cdots+left(begin{array}{c}n n-1end{array}right) P(1)+1valid for any n geqslant 2, which we now proceed to prove.We divide the desired partitions of the n-element set X into n groups according to the number j of elements in the first subset X_{1}(1 leqslant j leqslant n). This first subset X_{1}, having j elements, can be chosen in exactly left(begin{array}{l}n  jend{array}right) ways, and then the remaining set X^{prime}=X backslash X_{1} can be partitioned into nonempty numbered subsets X_{2}, X_{3}, X_{4}, ldots in P(n-j) ways. (This holds even for j=n, when we set P(0)=1, since there is nothing already left to partition.) The number of desired partitions of X whose first set X_{1} consists of exactly j elements is thus equal to left(begin{array}{l}n  jend{array}right) P(n-j), and the formula (3)already follows (the last term 1 on the right-hand side of (3) corresponds to the case of j=n ).From the obvious value P(1)=1 we thus compute by (3), in turn, P(2)=3, P(3)=13, P(4)=75, P(5)=541 and P(6)=4683.Conclusion.

By continuing this process, we will reach a moment when both distances are divisible by 2^{k}, which means they are 0 and 2^{k}, i.e., the grasshopper has fallen into a trap.Let N+1=2^{k} t, where t is an odd number greater than 1 (the power k can be equal to 0). We will call traps all squares with numbers that are multiples of t. If at any moment the grasshopper is not in a trap, then it is not in the middle between two traps (the middle between traps at and bt is frac{(a+b)t}{2}, which is either a trap or not an integer). This means that with any number we choose, the grasshopper can make a jump, avoiding the trap.Thus, we have proved that only when N is of the form 2^{k}-1 do we have a strategy for catching the grasshopper.Comment. Most participants noticed that when N=2^{k}-1, the grasshopper can be caught in a trap. For the completeness of the solution, it must also be explained why in other cases the grasshopper has a saving strategy."},{"problem":"7.

Total Combinations Without Restriction: First, we calculate the total number of three-digit numbers that can be formed without any restrictions. The first digit (hundreds place) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0), giving us 9 options. The second digit (tens place) can be any of the remaining 9 digits (including 0 this time), giving us 9 options. The third digit (ones place) can be any of the remaining 8 digits, giving us 8 options. Therefore, the total number of combinations without restrictions is 9 times 9 times 8.2. Divisibility by 3: For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since we are selecting 3 digits from 0 to 9, the total sum of all digits (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45) is divisible by 3. This means that any combination of 3 digits we select will have a sum that is also divisible by 3, as removing any 3 digits from the total sum will not affect its divisibility by 3.3.

Did they calculate correctly?[^0][^0]:    { }^{1} This problem was a puzzle in the 49th issue of Élet és Tudomány in 1965.","solution":"I. Solution. I. The representation of all numbers from 9 to 13 as the sum of two different numbers chosen from the integers 1 to 10:begin{aligned}& 9=1+8=2+7=3+6=4+5 & 10=1+9=2+8=3+7=4+6 & 11=1+10=2+9=3+8=4+7=5+6 & 12=2+10=3+9=4+8=5+7 & 13=3+10=4+9=5+8=6+7end{aligned}Representing 9 as 1+8, 10 can be obtained from the unused numbers as 3+7 and 4+6. In the first case, 12 and 13 can only be given by 2+10 and 4+9, respectively, and the remaining 5+6 forms 11, since the sum of the numbers 1 to 10 is equal to the sum of the numbers 9 to 13, so the sum of the two unused numbers in the first four representations always gives the remaining sum. In the second case, only the representations 11=2+9 and 13=3+10 are free for both terms.Representing 9 as 2+7, there are again two possibilities for 10: 1+9 and 4+6. In the first case, 12 can only be represented as 4+8, and therefore 13 only as 3+10, in the second case, 12=3+9 is uniquely determined, and therefore 13=5+8.Representing 9 as 3+6, either 10=1+9 or 10=2+8. In the first case, only 11=4+7 and 13=5+8 remain possible, in the second case, only 12=5+7 and 13=4+9. Finally, starting from the representation 9=4+5, three representations remain for 10, but only two for 12, making it more efficient to continue with the pairing. Taking 12=2+10, only 11=3+8 and 13=6+7 remain; if 12=3+9, then 13=6+7,11=1+10.Thus, we have developed every representation of the number 9 into complete pairs in every possible way, generating all desired groupings, and we have obtained the following 8 groupings:|  | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 || ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: || I. | 1+8 | 3+7 | 5+6 | 2+10 | 4+9 || II. | 1+8 | 4+6 | 2+9 | 5+7 | 3+10 || III. | 2+7 | 1+9 | 5+6 | 4+8 | 3+10 || IV. | 2+7 | 4+6 | 1+10 | 3+9 | 5+8 || V. | 3+6 | 1+9 | 4+7 | 2+10 | 5+8 || VII. | 3+6 | 2+8 | 1+10 | 5+7 | 4+9 || VII. | 4+5 | 1+9 | 3+8 | 2+10 | 6+7 || VIII. | 4+5 | 2+8 | 1+10 | 3+9 | 6+7 |Accordingly, the sums of the number pairs do not always uniquely determine the pairing of the numbers.II. The pair for the number 1 can be chosen in 9 different ways from the other numbers. Each of these pairings can be continued in 7 different ways by choosing the smallest of the remaining numbers as the first element of the next pair, because in this way the second number of this pair can always be chosen in 7 different ways from the remaining 7 numbers, so the number of such further developments is 9 cdot 7. Similarly, by choosing the smallest of the unpaired numbers as the first element of the third and then the fourth pair, the second element of the third pair can be chosen in 5 different ways, and the second element of the fourth pair in 3 different ways, so the number of further developments first rises to 9 cdot 7 cdot 5 and then to 9 cdot 7 cdot 5 cdot 3=945. This is the number of possibilities for the 5-pair arrangement, because we always considered every possibility for further development, these all differ from each other in at least one pair, and finally because the 4 pairs formed always determine the fifth pair as well. - According to this, the person calculated correctly.Pál László (Pécs, Zipernovszky K. Mechanical Engineering High School I. class) Csur Endre (Budapest, Könyves Kálmán High School II. class)Second solution to the second question of the problem. Two elements can be selected from n different elements in n(n-1) / 2 ways, because after selecting the first element of the pair in n ways, the second element can be chosen in n-1 ways, and the n(n-1) pairings thus obtained give every pair twice, e.g., as a, b and b, a. Therefore, if we perform the pairing of the 10 numbers written on the cards in such a way that we draw 2 cards at a time from a bag 4 times, each as the two elements of a pair, and also consider the remaining 2 numbers as a pair, this can be done infrac{10 cdot 9}{2} cdot frac{8 cdot 7}{2} cdot frac{6 cdot 5}{2} cdot frac{4 cdot 3}{2}ways.However, in this way we will get each of the 5-pair arrangements multiple times, specifically as many times as 5 different objects - here the pairs - can be arranged in a row. There are 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 possibilities for this, because by setting aside one object, the second can be placed in 2 ways relative to it: before it and after it, the third can be placed in 3 ways: before the first, before the second, and after the second, and so on. [^0]Now we can get the number of ways to arrange the 10 numbers into 5 pairs - if we do not consider the order of the pairs - by dividing the above number by the latter:frac{10 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6 cdot 5 cdot 4 cdot 3}{2^{4} cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5}=5 cdot 9 cdot 7 cdot 3=945Bárd Péter András (Budapest, Fazekas M.

Consider the given recurrence relation:   [   a_{n+1}^2 - a_{n+1} = a_n   ]   We need to determine all possible values of (a_1) for which there exists a sequence (a_1, a_2, dots) of rational numbers satisfying this relation.2. Assume (a_n = frac{x_n}{y_n}) where (x_n, y_n in mathbb{Z}) and (gcd(x_n, y_n) = 1). Then the recurrence relation becomes:   [   a_{n+1}^2 - a_{n+1} = frac{x_n}{y_n}   ]   Multiplying through by (y_n), we get:   [   y_n a_{n+1}^2 - y_n a_{n+1} - x_n = 0   ]3. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational solutions (a_{n+1} = frac{x_{n+1}}{y_{n+1}}) must satisfy (x_{n+1} mid x_n) and (y_{n+1} mid y_n). This implies that the numerators and denominators of the terms in the sequence form divisibility chains.4. Since (x_{n+1} mid x_n) and (y_{n+1} mid y_n), there exists a positive integer (M) such that for all (i, j > M), (|a_i| = |a_j|). This means the sequence eventually becomes constant in absolute value.5. Suppose the sequence becomes constant at some index (z). Then for all (n geq z), (a_n = a_{n+1}). Substituting (a_n = a_{n+1}) into the recurrence relation, we get:   [   a_n^2 - a_n = a_n   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   a_n^2 - 2a_n = 0   ]   [   a_n(a_n - 2) = 0   ]   Thus, (a_n = 0) or (a_n = 2).6. Now, we consider the cases where the sequence becomes constant at 0 or 2:   - If the sequence becomes constant at 0, then (a_z = 0) for some (z). By the recurrence relation, (a_{z-1} = 0). Continuing backwards, we find (a_i = 0) for all (i). Hence, (a_1 = 0).   - If the sequence becomes constant at 2, then (a_z = 2) for some (z). By the recurrence relation, (a_{z-1} = 2). Continuing backwards, we find (a_i = 2) for all (i). Hence, (a_1 = 2).7. Therefore, the only possible values for (a_1) are 0 and 2.The final answer is (boxed{0, 2})."},{"problem":"Problem 2.

If two of them are equal and the third has the opposite sign, then one of the numbers a+b-c, a+c-b, b+c-a is divisible by 3. In both cases, one of the seven numbers is divisible by 3 and, by assumption, is greater than 3, which contradicts its primality. Therefore, the smallest of the seven numbers in the condition can only be equal to 3. An example of such numbers: a=7, b=13, c=17, a+b-c=3, a+c-b=11, b+c-a=23, a+b+c=37.Grading criteria.

During the race, Z's position changed six times, X's position changed five times, and in the end, Y reached the finish line before X.What was the final result of the race?","solution":"To ensure the clarity of the task, let's first define the meaning of position and position change in the context of dead heats as follows: only actual overtakes are considered as position changes. That is, if, for example, X is in first place, Y is in second, and Y catches up to X, X's position remains first, and Y's remains second. A swap only occurs if Y also passes X. In this light, if X catches up to Y, and then they both overtake Z simultaneously, the order first becomes (Z Y X), then (Y Z X), and finally (Y X Z). Thus, Z's position changes twice, while the others' change once during this period. In this way, every position change is precisely an event between two competitors; furthermore, there is no dead heat, as among two adjacent competitors, the one who is overtaken is considered to be further ahead.Turning to the solution of the problem, according to the text, the order immediately after the start was X Y Z. If any of their positions changed once, it could only change to an opposite parity. Therefore, with an odd number of position changes, a competitor would end up in a position of opposite parity to their starting position, and with an even number of changes, in a position of the same parity.Since X was initially in first place and their position changed an odd number of times, they could only have finished in an even-numbered position, i.e., second. According to the last condition, Y overtook X, so Y must have been the winner, while Z took third place. The following example shows one possible sequence of position changes:[begin{array}{r}text { I } X X X Y Y Y Y Y y text { II } Y Z Y Y X Y X Y Y text { III } Z Y Z Z X Y X Yend{array}]It is clear that X's position changed five times, and Z's position changed six times - the latter was not necessary for the conditions (but would have led to a contradiction if Z's position had also changed an odd number of times).Note.

As soon as Cain chooses a pair from one of them, Seth mimics him by choosing the corresponding pair from the other.

To investigate the waste caused by the water leakage, Xiao Ming placed a graduated cylinder under the faucet to collect water.

Therefore, he obtained a set of data as shown in the table below:| Time t (minutes) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | ... ||---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|----|| Total water amount y (milliliters) | 7 | 12 | 17 | 22 | 27 | ... |(1) Investigation: Based on the data in the table above, determine which one of the functions y=frac{k}{t} and y=kt+b (where k and b are constants) can correctly reflect the functional relationship between the total water amount y and time t. Find the expression of y in terms of t.(2) Application:① Estimate how many milliliters of water will be in the cylinder when Xiao Ming measures it at the 20th minute.② A person drinks approximately 1500 milliliters of water per day.

This suggests a linear relationship rather than an inverse relationship. Therefore, the function y=kt+b is the appropriate model.To find the values of k and b, we use the given data points:- At t=1, y=7 gives us the equation k+b=7.- At t=2, y=12 gives us the equation 2k+b=12.Solving these equations simultaneously:1. Subtract the first equation from the second to find k:   [   (2k + b) - (k + b) = 12 - 7 implies k = 5   ]2.

This means that 30 minutes before the end of the operations, the operations in Operating Rooms I, II, and III were already in progress, otherwise, the total duration would have increased by no more than 20 minutes. Then, by the end of all operations, their total duration is 52 + 30 cdot 3 = 142 minutes. Therefore, the operation in Operating Room IV lasted 152 - 142 = 10 minutes.Comment. The durations of the operations can be (in minutes) (70; 36+s; 36-s; 10), where s in [0; 4] or (55+t; 55-t; 32; 10), where t in [0; 15]."},{"problem":"A study group found through a survey of the sales of a certain product in a store during a summer social practice activity that: The relationship between the daily sales price P(x) (in yuan) of the product over the past month (30 days) and time x (in days) approximately satisfies the function P(x) = 1 + frac{k}{x} (where k is a positive real number).

In the case of (2), find the minimum value of the daily sales revenue f(x) of the product (0 leq x leq 30, x in mathbb{N}^+).","solution":"1. To find the value of k, we use the given information about the daily sales revenue on the 10th day. We know that P(10) cdot Q(10) = 121 yuan. Substituting the given values into the equation for P(x), we have:   [   (1 + frac{k}{10}) times 110 = 121   ]   Simplifying this equation, we get:   [   110 + 11k = 121 implies 11k = 11 implies k = 1   ]   Therefore, the value of k is boxed{k = 1}.2. To choose the most suitable function model for the relationship between the daily sales quantity Q(x) and time x, we analyze the given data. The data shows that the sales quantity fluctuates and is not strictly monotonic, which means we should choose a non-monotonic function. Among the given options, only function model ②, Q(x) = a|x-25| + b, is non-monotonic.    Using the data points (10, 110) and (20, 120), we can set up a system of equations:   [   begin{cases}   15a + b = 110    5a + b = 120   end{cases}   ]   Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:   [   10a = -10 implies a = -1   ]   Substituting a = -1 into the second equation gives us:   [   -5 + b = 120 implies b = 125   ]   Therefore, the analytical expression of the function is boxed{Q(x) = 125 - |x-25|}.3. To find the minimum value of the daily sales revenue f(x), we consider the function Q(x) = 125 - |x-25|.

Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) in this interval is attained at x = 10, where f(x)_{min} = 121.   For 25 leq x leq 30, the function y = frac{150}{x} - x is decreasing. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) in this interval is attained at x = 30, where f(x)_{min} = 124.

(i) When the slope of line PA is frac{1}{2}, find the equation of the circumcircle of triangle MFN;   (ii) Let line AN intersect ellipse C at another point Q, find the maximum area of triangle PAQ.","solution":"(1) From the given information, we know that the foci of the ellipse C: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0) are on the x-axis. The eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, so a = sqrt{2}c. The distance between the right focus F and the left directrix is c + frac{a^2}{c} = 6sqrt{2}. Solving this equation gives c = 2sqrt{2}, so a = 4, and b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 8. Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{8} = 1}.(2) (i) From part (1), we know that the left vertex of the ellipse is (-4, 0) and the right focus is F(2sqrt{2}, 0). The equation of line PA is y = frac{1}{2}(x + 4), which simplifies to y = frac{1}{2}x + 2. Thus, M(2, 0). The slope of line MF, k_{MF}, is frac{0-2}{2sqrt{2}-0}=-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, so the slope of line NF, k_{NF}, is sqrt{2}. The equation of line NF is y = sqrt{2}(x - 2sqrt{2}) = sqrt{2}x - 4, so N(0, -4). The length of MN is 6, so the circumcircle of triangle MFN has center (0, -1) and radius 3.

Solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = k(x + 4)  frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{8} = 1 end{cases} gives x_1 = -4 and x_2 = frac{4 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}, so y_2 = frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}. Thus, P(frac{4 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}, frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}). The slope of line MF is -sqrt{2}k, and M(0, 4k), F(2sqrt{2}, 0). The slope of line NF is frac{1}{sqrt{2}k}, and the equation of line NF is y = frac{1}{sqrt{2}k}(x - 2sqrt{2}). Thus, N(0, -frac{2}{k}). The equation of line AN is y = -frac{1}{2k}x - frac{2}{k}. Substituting this into the equation of the ellipse gives (1 + frac{1}{2k^2})x^2 + frac{4}{k^2}x + frac{8}{k^2} - 16 = 0. Solving this equation gives x_1 = -4 and x_2 = frac{8k^2 - 4}{1 + 2k^2}, so y_2 = -frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}. Thus, Q(frac{8k^2 - 4}{1 + 2k^2}, -frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}). The slope of line PQ is frac{2k}{1 - 2k^2}, so the equation of line PQ is y - frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2} = frac{2k}{1 - 2k^2}(x - frac{4 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}). The distance between point A(-4, 0) and line PQ is d = frac{8|k|}{sqrt{1 + 4k^2}}.

According to the proportion in the statement, sales will vary to 300 - frac{3}{7} x bicycles.We consider the revenue function, where the variable is the price increase:f(x) = (600 + x) times left(300 - frac{3}{7} xright) = frac{1}{7} left(1,260,000 + 300 x - 3 x^2right)The critical points of f(x) are obtained by setting the derivative to zero: f'(x) = (1 / 7)(300 - 6 x). The unique critical point is x = 50, which indeed gives a maximum of the function f(x). Therefore, the solution to the question is: 650."},{"problem":"8.

Unfortunately, for all n where 3leq nleq8, when the lychees are distributed evenly into n groups, n-1 lychees remain. What is the smallest possible number of lychees that Jonah could have?","solution":"1. Let ( x ) be the number of lychees that Jonah currently has. According to the problem, for all ( n ) where ( 3 leq n leq 8 ), when the lychees are distributed evenly into ( n ) groups, ( n-1 ) lychees remain. This can be mathematically expressed as:   [   x equiv n-1 pmod{n} quad text{for} quad n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8   ]   This implies:   [   x + 1 equiv 0 pmod{n} quad text{for} quad n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8   ]   Therefore, ( x + 1 ) must be a common multiple of all integers from 3 to 8.2.

This is a fundamental property of triangle geometry, making this statement correct. Thus, it does not match the question's requirement for an incorrect statement.Option B: The statement that the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of a triangle intersect at one point, and this point is equidistant from the three vertices, describes the circumcenter of a triangle. This is another well-established fact in triangle geometry, indicating that this statement is also correct. Therefore, it does not fulfill the criteria for being the incorrect statement sought by the question.Option C: The statement that an isosceles triangle with an angle of 60^{circ} must be an equilateral triangle is based on the properties of triangles. In an isosceles triangle, if any angle is 60^{circ}, the other two angles must also be 60^{circ} to satisfy the total sum of 180^{circ} for the angles in a triangle. This means the triangle has three equal angles and, by definition, must also have three equal sides, making it equilateral. Hence, this statement is correct and does not match the question's requirement for an incorrect statement.Option D: The statement that every proposition must have a converse is a misunderstanding of logical structures in mathematics. While it's true that propositions can have converses, the statement that every theorem may not necessarily have a converse is misleading. Theorems can have converses, but whether those converses are true or not is a separate matter of proof. The incorrect part of this statement is the implication that the existence of converses is somehow optional or exceptional, which misrepresents mathematical logic.

Sum of the First 3 Terms: The sum of the first 3 terms is given by the formula S_{3} = a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{3})}{1-q}.

Prime Factorization of 2023:   [   2023 = 7 times 17^2   ]   This means that the prime factors of 2023 are 7 and 17.2.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to cover a 5 times 5 grid using S-Tetrominos (Z-Tetrominos) such that each square is covered by at most two tiles. We aim to find the maximum number of squares that can be covered by at least one tile.2. Coloring the Grid:   Consider a 5 times 5 grid. We can color the grid in a checkerboard pattern with black and white squares. Each S-Tetromino covers exactly four squares, and we need to ensure that no square is covered by more than two tiles.3. Counting the Black Squares:   Let's color the grid such that there are 12 black squares and 13 white squares. Each S-Tetromino will cover exactly one black square. Since there are 12 black squares, we can place at most 12 S-Tetrominos.4. Placing the S-Tetrominos:   Each S-Tetromino covers 4 squares. If we place 12 S-Tetrominos, they will cover 12 times 4 = 48 squares. However, since each square can be covered by at most two tiles, we need to ensure that no square is counted more than twice.5. Ensuring No Overlap:   To maximize the number of squares covered, we need to ensure that the overlap is minimized. If we place the S-Tetrominos such that each square is covered exactly once, we can cover 24 squares without any overlap.6. Example Configuration:   Consider the following configuration where each S-Tetromino is placed without overlapping:   \`\`\`   S-Tetromino 1: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)   S-Tetromino 2: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4)   S-Tetromino 3: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)   S-Tetromino 4: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)   S-Tetromino 5: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)   S-Tetromino 6: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)   \`\`\`7.

Therefore, the smallest number (k) sought in (a) is (k=3).(b) In every closed chain ((a, b),(b, c),(c, a)) made of 3 different stones of a domino game, (a, b), and (c) are three pairwise different numbers; for if (a=b), then ((b, c)) and ((c, a)) would be two identical stones; similarly, one disproves (a=c) and (b=c).The number of all those stones of a domino game that carry a pair of different numbers is (28-7=21). Since (21: 3=7), at most 7 chains can be formed in the required manner.That 7 chains can be formed in this way is shown by the example[begin{aligned}& (0,1),(1,2),(2,0) ; quad(0,3),(3,4),(4,0) ; quad(0,5),(5,6),(6,0) & (1,3),(3,5),(5,1) ; quad(1,4),(4,6),(5,2) ; quad(2,3),(3,6),(6,2) ; quad(2,4),(4,5),(5,2)end{aligned}]Therefore, the number (g) sought in (b) is (g=7).(c) As shown in (b), every closed chain made of three different stones of a domino game contains three pairwise different numbers. Conversely, for any three pairwise different numbers (a, b, c), there are exactly three stones with each pair of different numbers from these, and there is (according to the explanation of which closed chains are to be considered equal) exactly one closed chain from these three stones, namely the chain ((a, b),(b, c),(c, a)).Thus, there are exactly as many closed chains made of three different stones as there are sets of three pairwise different numbers from the numbers (0, ldots, 6).Selecting three elements from a set of six different numbers, without regard to the order of selection and without repeated selection of an element, corresponds to a combination of (n) elements of the (k)-th class with (n=6) and (k=3), i.e.,[binom{6}{3}=frac{7 cdot 6 cdot 5}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}=35]The number of chains sought is 35.Adapted from [5]"},{"problem":"The equation of the tangent line to the curve y=e^x-2x at point A (0,1) is ____.","solution":"To find the equation of the tangent line, we first calculate the derivative of the function, which gives us y'=e^x-2.

When we substitute z=frac{4}{3}-x here, we get x^{2}-frac{4}{3} x+frac{7}{9}=0, and for the discriminant of this equation, we have D=frac{16}{9}-frac{28}{9}=-frac{4}{3}<0, so there are no real solutions here.- x+y+z=-2, x+z=2 y :From here, it follows that 3 y=-2 and then x+z=2 y=-frac{4}{3}, and from the second equation in the problem statement, we get x z=frac{2-y^{2}}{2}=frac{7}{9}.

A polyhedron is called regular if all its faces are regular and congruent polygons to each other and all its polyhedral angles are also regular and congruent to each other { }^{2}. Investigate the possibility of constructing simple regular polyhedra with n-sided faces and m-sided angles and determine the possible number of their types, using the following considerations.Divide the entire space into f congruent regular n-sided angles with a common vertex S, with m angles at each edge, and express the magnitudes of their dihedral angles in terms of n and f. If a regular n-sided pyramid is constructed from the found magnitude of the dihedral angle, with the base being a regular n-sided polygon - a face of the desired polyhedron, then from such congruent pyramids, a regular polyhedron can be assembled (for example, a cube is assembled from six regular quadrilateral pyramids with a common vertex at the center of the cube). It can be proven that any regular polyhedron can be obtained by such a construction. (The last remark can be used without proof in solving this and the following problems.)## 44","solution":"36. Let the faces of a regular polyhedron be regular n-gons, and the polyhedral angles at the vertices be regular m-gonal angles; obviously, m geqslant 3, n geqslant 3. Divide the space into f congruent regular n-gonal angles with a common vertex S such that around each edge [S A) there are m angles. Then the magnitude of each of these f polyhedral angles is frac{4 pi}{f}. Since this magnitude is the difference between the sum of the magnitudes of its dihedral angles and the number pi(n-2), the sum of all dihedral angles of the n-gonal angle is frac{4 pi}{f} + pi(n-2) = frac{4 + nf - 2f}{f} pi. One dihedral angle has a magnitude that is n times smaller, i.e., frac{4 + nf - 2f}{nf} pi.On the other hand, since at each of the p edges of our n-gonal angles there are m congruent dihedral angles, the magnitude of each of them is frac{2 pi}{m}. Thus,begin{gathered}frac{2 pi}{m} = frac{4 + nf - 2f}{nf} pi 2nf + 2mf - mnf = 4m f = frac{4m}{2m + 2n - mn}end{gathered}## 168Since f > 0, m > 0, from (1) we have 2m + 2n - mn > 0,frac{2}{m} + frac{2}{n} > 1Thus, the division of space into congruent polyhedral angles is possible only if the numbers m geqslant 3 and n geqslant 3 satisfy the inequality (2). Clearly, only five cases are possible: 1) m=3 and n=3: frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{3} > 1. From (1) we get f=4, the polyhedron is bounded by 4 triangles - this is a tetrahedron. The corresponding values of the numbers a and p are obtained from the formulas in problems 27 and 28: for the tetrahedron a=6, p=4.2) For m=3, n=4 we get: frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{4} > 1, f=6.

For further increases in the values of m and n, the expression on the left side of the inequality (2) becomes even smaller, and it cannot be valid.

According to the problem, the difference in time is 0.5 hours, so we can set up the equation as follows:[frac{180}{v} = frac{180}{1.2v} + 0.5]To solve this equation for v, we first simplify the equation:[frac{180}{v} = frac{180}{1.2v} + 0.5]Multiplying every term by 1.2v to eliminate the denominators gives:[1.2 times 180 = 180 + 0.5 times 1.2v]Simplifying further:[216 = 180 + 0.6v]Subtracting 180 from both sides:[36 = 0.6v]Dividing both sides by 0.6 to solve for v:[v = frac{36}{0.6} = 60]Upon verification, substituting v=60 into the original equation confirms it satisfies the condition given in the problem.

Let t = x^2 - 5x + 6, the interval where t is decreasing is (-infty, frac {5}{2}] and where t is increasing is [frac {5}{2}, +infty).Since the base is frac {1}{4}, which is less than 1, the function y=log_{ frac {1}{4}} x is a decreasing function.

The length of the chord AB is given as 6, which means that the segment connecting the center of the circle to the midpoint of AB forms a right triangle with the half-length of AB and the radius r as its hypotenuse.1. The length of AB is 6, so half of this length, which is the perpendicular segment from the center to the chord, is 3. This gives us the equation 2sqrt{r^{2}-d^{2}}=6, leading to sqrt{r^{2}-d^{2}}=3.2. Squaring both sides of the equation sqrt{r^{2}-d^{2}}=3 gives us r^{2}-d^{2}=9.3. Rearranging the equation gives us d^{2}=r^{2}-9.4.

Consider the equation modulo 4:   [   3^x equiv (-1)^x pmod{4}   ]   [   5^z equiv 1^z equiv 1 pmod{4}   ]   Since ( 4^y equiv 0 pmod{4} ), we have:   [   (-1)^x equiv 1 pmod{4}   ]   This implies ( x ) must be even. Let ( x = 2a ).3. Next, consider the equation modulo 3:   [   4^y equiv 1^y equiv 1 pmod{3}   ]   [   5^z equiv 2^z pmod{3}   ]   Since ( 3^x equiv 0 pmod{3} ), we have:   [   1 equiv 2^z pmod{3}   ]   This implies ( z ) must be even. Let ( z = 2c ).4. Substituting ( x = 2a ) and ( z = 2c ) into the original equation, we get:   [   3^{2a} + 4^y = 5^{2c}   ]   Rearrange to:   [   4^y = 5^{2c} - 3^{2a}   ]   Factor the right-hand side:   [   4^y = (5^c - 3^a)(5^c + 3^a)   ]5. Notice that ( 5^c equiv 1 pmod{4} ) and ( 3^a equiv pm 1 pmod{4} ). This means one of ( 5^c - 3^a ) or ( 5^c + 3^a ) is divisible by 4, and the other is not. Therefore, one of them must be equal to 2.6. Case 1: ( 5^c + 3^a = 2 )   [   5^c + 3^a = 2   ]   This is impossible since ( 5^c geq 5 ) and ( 3^a geq 3 ) for positive integers ( a ) and ( c ).7. Case 2: ( 5^c - 3^a = 2 )   [   5^c - 3^a = 2   ]   It is easy to see that ( (a, c) = (1, 1) ) is a solution:   [   5^1 - 3^1 = 5 - 3 = 2   ]   We claim that this is the only solution. For the rest of the solution, we assume ( a, c > 0 ).8. Taking modulo 5:   [   -3^a equiv 2 pmod{5} implies 3^a equiv 3 pmod{5}   ]   The cycle of ( 3^a pmod{5} ) is ( 3, 4, 2, 1 ), which means:   [   a equiv 1 pmod{4}   ]   Let ( a = 4beta + 1 ).9. Taking modulo 16:   [   5^c - 3^{4beta + 1} equiv 2 pmod{16} implies 5^c equiv 5 pmod{16}   ]   The cycle of ( 5^c pmod{16} ) is ( 5, 9, 13, 1 ), which means:   [   c equiv 1 pmod{4}   ]   Let ( c = 4alpha + 1 ).10. Taking modulo 13:    [    5^{4alpha + 1} - 3^{4beta + 1} equiv 2 pmod{13} implies 3^{4beta + 1} equiv 3 pmod{13}    ]    The cycle of ( 3^a pmod{13} ) is ( 3, 9, 1 ), which means:    [    a equiv 1 pmod{3}    ]    Combining ( a equiv 1 pmod{4} ) and ( a equiv 1 pmod{3} ), we get:    [    a equiv 1 pmod{12}    ]    Let ( a = 12lambda + 1 ).11. Taking modulo 7:    [    5^c - 3^{12lambda + 1} equiv 2 pmod{7} implies 5^c equiv 5 pmod{7}    ]    The cycle of ( 5^c pmod{7} ) is ( 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1 ), which means:    [    c equiv 1 pmod{6}    ]    Combining ( c equiv 1 pmod{4} ) and ( c equiv 1 pmod{6} ), we get:    [    c equiv 1 pmod{12}    ]    Let ( c = 12alpha + 1 ).12. Finally, taking modulo 9:    [    5^c equiv 2 pmod{9}    ]    Since ( a, c > 0 ), from ( a = 12lambda + 1 ), we have ( lambda > 0 ), which means ( 3^{12lambda + 1} equiv 0 pmod{9} ). The cycle of ( 5^c pmod{9} ) is ( 5, 7, 8, 4, 2, 1 ), which means:    [    c equiv 5 pmod{6}    ]    This is a contradiction with ( c equiv 1 pmod{6} ).Since ( (a, c) = (1, 1) ) is the only solution to the above diophantine equation, we get that ( x = z = 2 ). Thus the only solution is ( boxed{(2, 2, 2)} )."},{"problem":"Let the random variable X be normally distributed as X sim N(3, sigma^2).

A section of the cube by a plane passing through its center and orthogonal to one of the diagonals is a regular hexagon. The radius of the inscribed circle of this hexagon is frac{a sqrt{6}}{4}, so a circle of radius frac{a sqrt{6}}{4} can fit inside the cube. We will show that a circle of a larger radius cannot fit inside the cube. First, note that it is sufficient to consider circles centered at the center of the cube. Indeed, if a circle of radius R is contained within the cube, then the circle symmetric to it with respect to the center of the cube is also contained within the cube. From the convexity of the cube, it follows that a circle of radius R, centered at the center of the cube and lying in a plane parallel to the plane of the original circle, is also contained within the cube. Consider a circle of radius R centered at the center of the cube and a sphere of the same radius and the same center. We are only interested in the case where R > a / 2 and the considered circle lies inside the cube. In this case, six spherical segments lie outside the cube. The radii of the circles lying at their bases are r = sqrt{R^2 - (a / 2)^2}, so r increases as R increases. Consider the cones whose vertices are at the center of the cube and whose bases are the circles at the bases of the spherical segments. If the plane Pi, containing the considered circle, intersects one of these cones, then part of the circle passes through the spherical segment and therefore partially lies outside the cube. Thus, we need to prove that if R > frac{a sqrt{6}}{4}, then the plane Pi intersects one of the cones. The plane Pi divides the rays emanating from the center of the cube and directed to the centers of the faces into two triplets (each triplet lies on one side of the plane Pi). Consider the plane Pi', which passes through the center of the cube and is perpendicular to one of the diagonals and divides these rays into the same two triplets. In the plane Pi', there is a circle of radius frac{a sqrt{6}}{4} that lies entirely inside the cube. It is easy to verify that the plane Pi'is tangent to three cones (corresponding to the triplet of rays that are the axes of these cones) along three rays OX, OY, OZ. The rays OX, OY, OZ lie strictly inside the cones corresponding to the circle of radius R > frac{a sqrt{6}}{4}.Thus, these rays lie on one side of the plane Pi, since the axes of the corresponding cones lie on one side of this plane. The planes Pi and Pi' have a common point (the center of the cube), so they intersect along some line. The rays OX, OY, and OZ form angles of 120^{circ} with each other, so no line can divide the plane Pi' in such a way that these rays lie in the same half-plane. Therefore, the plane Pi' intersects one of the cones if R > frac{a sqrt{6}}{4}."},{"problem":"The negation of the proposition P: \\"For all x in mathbb{R}, sin(x) geq 1\\" is (        )A: There exists an x in mathbb{R}, such that sin(x) geq 1B: For all x in mathbb{R}, sin(x)  1","solution":"Analysis: According to proposition P: \\"For all x in mathbb{R}, sin(x) geq 1\\", which is a universal proposition, its negation form is an existential proposition.

Let S_{n} denote the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_{n}}.

We aim to find the maximum value of S_8, the sum of the first 8 terms of the sequence.1. Adjacent Terms Analysis:   - If there exist two adjacent terms a_i and a_{i+1} where a_{i+1} geq 0, we have two cases based on the absolute difference condition:     - Case 1: If a_{i+1} - a_i = i, then a_{i+1} = a_i + i. This implies a_{i+1} geq i > frac{i-1}{2}, which contradicts the given condition that a_n leq frac{n-1}{2}.     - Case 2: If a_i - a_{i+1} = i, then a_i = a_{i+1} + i. This also leads to a contradiction as a_i geq i > frac{i-1}{2}.   - Therefore, it's impossible to have two consecutive non-negative numbers in the sequence.2. Sum of Consecutive Terms:   - When a_n geq 0, then a_{n+1} < 0 and a_{n+1} = a_n - n. Thus, a_n + a_{n+1} = 2a_n - n leq 2 times frac{n-1}{2} - n = -1.   - When a_{n+1} geq 0, then a_n < 0 and a_n = a_{n+1} - n.

Since AD and BA are perpendicular, B, A, and B' lie on the same line, and B'A = AB = 1. Since angle BAC = 120^circ, angle CAB' = 60^circ, and since CA = AB' = 1, the triangle CAB' is equilateral. The triangle CAD is also equilateral because CA = DA = 1 and angle CAD = 60^circ.

The general case follows.Case 1: ( n>2 ) even: After the first pass, in which 0 is transposed successively with ( 3,5, ldots, n-1 ), after which 0 is right after ( n ), and no other legal transposition can be performed. So ( n ) is not a solution in this case.Case 2: ( n=2^{k}-1 ) : Denote ( N=n+1, R=2^{r},[a: b]=(a, a+1, a+2, ldots, b) ), and concatenation by a comma. Let ( P_{r} ) be the permutation[[1: R-1],(0),[N-R: N-1],[N-2 R: N-R-1], ldots,[2 R: 3 R-1],[R: 2 R-1]]( P_{r} ) is formed by the blocks ( [1: R-1],(0) ), and other ( 2^{k-r}-1 ) blocks of size ( R=2^{r} ) with consecutive numbers, beginning with ( t R ) and finishing with ( (t+1) R-1 ), in decreasing order of ( t ). Also define ( P_{0} ) as the initial permutation.Then it can be verified that ( P_{r+1} ) is obtained from ( P_{r} ) after a number of legal transpositions: it can be easily verified that ( P_{0} ) leads to ( P_{1} ), as 0 is transposed successively with ( 3,5, ldots, n-1 ), shifting cyclically all numbers with even indices; this is ( P_{1} ).Starting from ( P_{r}, r>0 ), 0 is successively transposed with ( R, 3 R, ldots, N-R ). The numbers ( 0, N-R, N-3 R, ldots, 3 R, R ) are cyclically shifted. This means that ( R ) precedes 0, and the blocks become[begin{gathered}{[1: R],(0),[N-R+1: N-1],[N-2 R: N-R],[N-3 R+1: N-2 R-1], ldots,} {[3 R+1: 4 R-1],[2 R: 3 R],[R+1: 2 R-1]}end{gathered}]Note that the first block and the ones on even positions greater than 2 have one more number and the other blocks have one less number.Now ( 0, N-R+1, N-3 R+1, ldots, 3 R+1, R+1 ) are shifted. Note that, for every ( i )th block, ( i ) odd greater than 1, the first number is cyclically shifted, and the blocks become[begin{gathered}{[1: R+1],(0),[N-R+2: N-1],[N-2 R: N-R+1],[N-3 R+2: N-2 R-1], ldots,} {[3 R+1: 4 R-1],[2 R: 3 R+1],[R+2: 2 R-1]}end{gathered}]The same phenomenon happened: the first block and the ones on even positions greater than 2 have one more number and the other blocks have one less number. This pattern continues: ( 0, N-R+u, N-3 R+u, ldots, R+u ) are shifted, ( u=0,1,2, ldots, R-1 ), the first block and the ones on even positions greater than 2 have one more number and the other blocks have one less number, until they vanish. We finish with[[1: 2 R-1],(0),[N-2 R: N-1], ldots,[2 R: 4 R-1]]which is precisely ( P_{r+1} ).Since ( P_{k}=[1: N-1],(0), n=2^{k}-1 ) is a solution.Case 3: ( n ) is odd, but is not of the form ( 2^{k}-1 ). Write ( n+1 ) as ( n+1=2^{a}(2 b+1), b geq 1 ), and define ( P_{0}, ldots, P_{a} ) as in the previous case. Since ( 2^{a} ) divides ( N=n+1 ), the same rules apply, and we obtain ( P_{a} ):[left[1: 2^{a}-1right],(0),left[N-2^{a}: N-1right],left[N-2^{a+1}: N-2^{a}-1right], ldots,left[2^{a+1}: 3 cdot 2^{a}-1right],left[2^{a}: 2^{a+1}-1right]]But then 0 is transposed with ( 2^{a}, 3 cdot 2^{a}, ldots,(2 b-1) cdot 2^{a}=N-2^{a+1} ), after which 0 is put immediately after ( N-1=n ), and cannot be transposed again. Therefore, ( n ) is not a solution. All cases were studied, and so we are done.Comment: The general problem of finding the number of regular permutations for any ( n ) seems to be difficult.

It holds that varphi(1)=1. For all positive integers b, we have operatorname{ggd}(a, b)=1, so the equation becomes 1+b=1+varphi(b)+1, thus varphi(b)=b-1. Therefore, there is exactly one number in {1,2, ldots, b} that is not coprime with b; this must be b itself (since operatorname{ggd}(b, b)>1 unless b=1, but in that case varphi(b)=b). This implies that b is a prime number. The equation holds for all prime numbers. We conclude that (1, p) is a solution for all prime numbers p. Similarly, b=1 gives the solutions (p, 1).Now, we assume that a, b geq 2. Since operatorname{ggd}(b, b)>1, it follows that varphi(b) leq b-1. Therefore,operatorname{ggd}(a, b)=a+b-varphi(a)-varphi(b) geq a-varphi(a)+1Let p be the smallest prime divisor of a (which exists, since a geq 2). Since for all multiples of p, t p leq a, we have operatorname{ggd}(t p, a)>1, it follows that a-varphi(a) geq frac{1}{p} cdot a. Therefore,operatorname{ggd}(a, b) geq a-varphi(a)+1 geq frac{a}{p}+1The largest two divisors of a are a and frac{a}{p}. Since operatorname{ggd}(a, b) is a divisor of a that is at least frac{a}{p}+1, it must be equal to a. Thus, operatorname{ggd}(a, b)=a. By a completely analogous argument, we can prove that operatorname{ggd}(a, b)=b. Therefore, a=b.Now the equation becomes 2 a=2 varphi(a)+a, or a=2 varphi(a). We see that 2 mid a. Therefore, write a=2^{k} cdot m with k geq 1 and m odd. Then, by a known property of the varphi-function, we have varphi(a)=varphileft(2^{k}right) varphi(m)=2^{k-1} cdot varphi(m), so the equation becomes 2^{k} cdot m=2 cdot 2^{k-1} cdot varphi(m), or m=varphi(m). This implies m=1. Therefore, a=b=2^{k}, and the equation indeed holds.We conclude that the solutions are: (1, p) and (p, 1) for all prime numbers p, and left(2^{k}, 2^{k}right) for all positive integers k."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = sin^n x + tan^n x where n in mathbb{N}^*, then ()A: When n=2, the smallest positive period of f(x) is frac{π}{2}B: For all n in mathbb{N}^*, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, frac{π}{2})C: When n=2k-1 (k in mathbb{N}^*), f(x) is an odd functionD: When n=2k (k in mathbb{N}^*), the graph of f(x) is symmetric about x=frac{π}{2}","solution":"To analyze the given options for the function f(x) = sin^n x + tan^n x where n in mathbb{N}^*, we proceed as follows:Option A: When n=2, the smallest positive period of f(x) is frac{pi}{2}.For n=2, we have f(x) = sin^2 x + tan^2 x.

If m, n are two elements in S, then they can be divisible by at most four elements of T, so the fifth member of T is relatively prime to m and n. does not divide either. Also we can pick a prime p in T which divides m and a prime q in T which divides n. If p = q, then p is in S and has a common factor with m and n. If p and q are unequal, then pq is in S and has a common factor with m and n. The 50 even numbers 2, 4, ... , 100 are in S, except for 30, 60, 90, 42, 84, 66, 70, giving 43 members. The odd multiples of 3 are also in S - 3, 9, 15, ... , 99, giving a further 17 members. The multiples of 5 not divisible by 2 or 3 are in S - 5, 25, 35, 55, 65, 85, 95, giving a further 7 members. Finally, 7, 49, 77, 91, 11 are in S, giving a total of 72 members. We show that we cannot do better. Clearly 1 ∉ S.

Not more than one of these primes can be in S, for if two were in S, then the smallest number having a common factor with both is > 100. So we have a total so far of 1 + 20 = 21 exclusions. Suppose no prime > 10 is in S. Then 3 and 70 cannot both be in S, because there cannot be an element coprime to both. Similarly, at least one of (5,42), (7,30), (6,35), (10,21), (14,15), (28,45) is not in S. So we have an additional 1 (the other prime > 10) + 7 (one from each of 7 pairs) = 8 exclusions and hence a total of 29 exclusions, so S cannot have more than 71 members. So suppose there is a prime p > 10 in S. (1) If 7p ∈ S, then 30, 60, 90 ∉ S (because there is no available number coprime to both). If 7p ∉ S, then 7, 49, 77, 91 ∉ S (if 7 and p are in S, then 7p must be in S). (2) if 5p ∈ S, then 42, 84 ∉ S. If 5p ∉ S, then 5, 25 ∉ S. (3) one of 3p, 70 is not in S. (4) one of 6p, 35 is not in S. (5) if 5p and 7p are not in S, then 35 is not in S. If p = 11 or 13, then (1), (2), (3), (4) exclude 3+2+1+1 = 7 elements. If p = 17 or 19, then 7p ∉ S, so (1) excludes 4 elements and (1), (2), (3) exclude 4+2+1 = 7 elements. If p ≥ 23, then (1), (2), (5) exclude 4+2+1 = 7 elements.

Since q > 1, this implies that a_{n+1} > a_{n} for all n. This means that each term in the sequence is greater than the preceding term, which by definition means that the sequence {a_{n}} is increasing.

Condition for the Graph Not Passing Through the Origin:  For the graph of the power function fleft(xright)=(3m^{2}-2m)x^{3m} not to pass through the origin, the coefficient of x^{3m}, which is (3m^{2}-2m), must not be equal to zero. This is because if it were zero, the function would be f(x) = 0 for all x, which means the graph would be a line passing through the origin. Therefore, we have the equation:[3m^{2}-2m neq 0]2. Solving the Equation:  However, the solution provided directly states that 3m^{2}-2m=1. This seems to be a simplification or a misinterpretation of the condition for the function not to be identically zero. The correct interpretation should focus on the condition 3m lt 0 for determining the value of m. Let's correct the approach by focusing on the condition given in the solution:- The condition 3m lt 0 implies that m lt 0. This is because dividing an inequality by a positive number (in this case, 3) preserves the inequality's direction.3. Finding the Correct Value of m:  Given the corrected understanding, we still need to address the condition 3m^{2}-2m=1. However, since this condition was not derived from the problem's statement directly and seems to be an error, we should instead focus on the provided conclusion that m=-frac{1}{3} satisfies the condition for the graph not passing through the origin based on 3m lt 0.4.

Skew lines, by definition, are non-intersecting and non-parallel lines in three-dimensional space that do not lie on the same plane. Therefore, in a cube, the only possibility for skew lines is to pick one line from one pair of opposite edges of the cube and another line from another pair.For a cube, let's label its vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, with ABCDEFGH forming the cube sequentially, each letter representing a corner. A cube has 12 edges, and each edge can be paired with 4 edges that are neither parallel nor intersecting with it, which makes a total of 12 times 4 = 48 pairs of edges. However, each such combination of skew lines is counted twice, since, for instance, the pair of lines AB, EF and EF, AB are considered the same. So, we divide this number by 2, giving us 48 / 2 = 24 possible pairs.Each of the \\"Golden Skew Line Pairs\\" forms a triangle whose third side is a space diagonal of the cube.

Since the skew lines are edges of a cube, the angle between them must form an equilateral triangle with the space diagonal of the cube. Considering a cube with side length s, and using Pythagoras theorem, the space diagonal is ssqrt{3}, and since each side of the equilateral triangle is the length of the diagonal, ssqrt{3}, this confirms that the angles in question are 60°.Thus, all 24 pairs are indeed \\"Golden Skew Line Pairs,\\" and our answer is:[boxed{24}]"},{"problem":"3.

First, 1+2+3+4=10, 1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+4^{2}=30 and 1^{3}+2^{3}+3^{3}+4^{3}=100. Suppose that for some natural number n>3 we could express the sum 1^{n}+2^{n}+3^{n}+4^{n} as a number that would end with three zeros. This number would be divisible by 1000=8 cdot 125. Let's look at the remainder of each term in the mentioned sum when divided by 8. The term 1^{n} gives a remainder of 1, and the terms 2^{n} and 4^{n} give a remainder of 0, since n>3. Write 3^{n}=(2+1)^{n}= 2^{n}+n cdot 2^{n-1}+cdots+frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} cdot 2^{3}+frac{n cdot(n-1)}{2 cdot 1} cdot 2^{2}+n cdot 2+1.

We quickly see that the expression 2 n^{2}+1 has a remainder of 1 if n is an even number, since in this case 2 n^{2} is divisible by 8. If n is an odd number, we write n=2 k+1 and get 2 cdot(2 k+1)^{2}+1=8 k^{2}+8 k+3, from which we see that the remainder is 3.We have found: if the sum 1^{n}+2^{n}+3^{n}+4^{n} for any n>3 is divided by 8, we get a remainder of 2 or 4. Since this sum is not divisible by 8, we cannot write it as a number ending with more than two zeros for any natural number n.

Area of the Right Triangle:   The area of a right triangle with legs (m) and (n) is given by:   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2}mn   ]   We are given that this area is a prime number (p) not exceeding (80).

Understanding the problem: Alice starts at vertex ( A ) of a regular hexagon ( ABCDEF ) and moves either right or left with equal probability. We need to find the probability that after 35 moves, Alice is at either vertex ( A ) or ( C ).2. Analyzing the movement: In a regular hexagon, moving right or left from any vertex will move Alice to an adjacent vertex. The vertices are cyclic, so moving 6 steps in one direction will bring Alice back to the starting vertex.3. Distance and parity: To be at vertex ( A ) after 35 moves, Alice must have made an equal number of moves to the right and left, which is impossible since 35 is odd. Therefore, Alice cannot be at vertex ( A ) after 35 moves.4. Vertex ( C ): To be at vertex ( C ) after 35 moves, Alice must have moved 3 steps away from ( A ) (since ( C ) is 3 steps away from ( A ) in either direction). This means the net number of steps in one direction must be 3 more than the steps in the opposite direction. However, since 35 is odd, the net number of steps cannot be 3 (an odd number) because the total number of steps must be even to balance out the odd number of moves.5. Conclusion: Since Alice cannot be at vertex ( A ) or ( C ) after 35 moves due to the parity of the number of moves, the probability is 0.[boxed{0}]"},{"problem":"In the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system Oxyz, the coordinates of point A (2,3,4) with respect to the origin are (　　)A: (2,3,-4)B: (-2,3,-4)C: (-2,-3,-4)D: (2,-3,-4)","solution":"In the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system Oxyz, the coordinates of a point are given straightforwardly as its position relative to the origin.

In how many ways this set of points can be divided into two non-empty subsets with non-intersecting convex envelops?","solution":"To solve the problem of determining the number of ways to divide ( n ) points on a plane (with no three points collinear) into two non-empty subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls, we can proceed as follows:1. Understanding the Problem:   - We need to divide ( n ) points into two non-empty subsets such that their convex hulls do not intersect.   - This is equivalent to finding a line that separates the points into two groups.2. Defining the Function:   - Let ( f(n) ) be the number of ways to divide ( n ) points into two subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls.3. Base Case:   - For ( n = 2 ), there is only one way to divide the points into two subsets, each containing one point. Thus, ( f(2) = 1 ).4. Inductive Step:   - Consider adding a new point ( A_{n+1} ) to the set of ( n ) points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ).   - We need to count the number of ways to divide the ( n+1 ) points into two subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls.5. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: ( A_{n+1} ) and ( A_n ) are in the same subset.     - The number of ways to divide the remaining ( n ) points is ( f(n) ).   - Case 2: ( A_{n+1} ) and ( A_n ) are in different subsets.     - We can choose any of the ( n ) points to be in the same subset as ( A_{n+1} ), and the remaining points will be in the other subset.     - This gives us ( n ) ways to divide the points.6. Recurrence Relation:   - Combining the two cases, we get:     [     f(n+1) = f(n) + n     ]7. Solving the Recurrence:   - We start with ( f(2) = 1 ).   - Using the recurrence relation, we can compute ( f(n) ) for larger ( n ):     [     begin{align*}     f(3) &= f(2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3,      f(4) &= f(3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6,      f(5) &= f(4) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10,      &vdots      f(n) &= 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (n-1).     end{align*}     ]8.

Among these 20 planes only 6 surfaces will not cut into the cube.Secondly, to choose three vertices randomly, the four vertices planes each will be chosen 4 times, while the three vertices planes each will be chosen once.To conclude, the probability of a cutting in plane is frac {(6cdot 4+8cdot 1)}{(12cdot 4+8cdot 1)} = frac {32}{56} = boxed {textbf{(C)}}.-Vader10,Oct.6 2020-Minor LaTeX edit by ArcticturnSolution 2We will try to use symmetry as much as possible.Pick the first vertex A, its choice clearly does not influence anything.Pick the second vertex B. With probability 3/7 vertices A and B have a common edge, with probability 3/7 they are in opposite corners of the same face, and with probability 1/7 they are in opposite corners of the cube. We will handle each of the cases separately.In the first case, there are 2 faces that contain the edge AB. In each of these faces there are 2 other vertices. If one of these 4 vertices is the third vertex C, the entire triangle ABC will be on a face. On the other hand, if C is one of the two remaining vertices, the triangle will contain points inside the cube. Hence in this case the probability of choosing a good C is 2/6 = 1/3.In the second case, the triangle ABC will not intersect the cube if point C is one of the two points on the side that contains AB. Hence the probability of ABC intersecting the inside of the cube is 2/3.In the third case, already the diagonal AB contains points inside the cube, hence this case will be good regardless of the choice of C.Summing up all cases, the resulting probability is:[frac 37cdotfrac 13 + frac 37cdot frac 23 + frac 17cdot 1 = boxed{frac 47}]Solution 3 (Cheap solution, same approach as Solution 2)This problem can be approached the same way, by picking vertices, but with a much faster and kind of cheap solution: Pick any vertex A and a face it touches. For vertex B, out of the 7 remaining vertices, 4 of them aren't on the same face as the one chosen for vertex A, so vertex C can be placed anywhere and the plane will no matter what be in the cube. Therefore, the probability of choosing a valid vertex B is 4/7.Solution 4There are binom{8}{3}=56 ways to pick three vertices from eight total vertices; this is our denominator. In order to have three points inside the cube, they cannot be on the surface. Thus, we can use complementary probability.There are binom{4}{3}=4 ways to choose three points from the vertices of a single face. Since there are six faces, 4 times 6 = 24.Thus, the probability of what we don't want is frac{24}{56} = frac{3}{7}. Using complementary probability, [1- frac 37 = boxed{frac 47}]Solution 5 (Casework)This problem is fairly simple. Start with 2 points WLOG. Case 1: You pick 2 points that are diagonally across from each other but still on the same face. This happens with probability frac {3}{7}. We notice that 4 out of the 6 possible outcomes include a point inside the cube. Therefore, the probability of this happening is frac {2}{7}.Case 2: You pick 2 points that a directly across from each other. This happens with probability frac {3}{7}. We notice that 2 out of the 6 possible outcomes include a point inside the cube. Therefore, the probability of this happening is frac {1}{7}.Case 3: You pick 2 points that is a space diagonal of the cube. This happens with probability frac {1}{7}. Clearly, all of the points contain a point inside the cube, so our probability is frac {1}{7}.

To solve the problem, it is sufficient to verify that the numbers a=2, b=20 satisfy our equation.Let's explain how to find all integer solutions to this equation (although this was not required for solving the problem). Factorize the left-hand side of the equation:a^{2} b^{2}+a^{2}+b^{2}+1=a^{2}left(b^{2}+1right)+left(b^{2}+1right)=left(a^{2}+1right)left(b^{2}+1right)The equation will take the form left(a^{2}+1right)left(b^{2}+1right)=2005. Therefore, both left(a^{2}+1right) and left(b^{2}+1right) are divisors of the number 2005 (see fact 5).Find all positive divisors of the number 2005. To do this, factorize this number into prime factors: 2005= =5 cdot 401 (see fact 10). Now it is clear that all positive divisors of the number 2005 are 1, 5, 401, and 2005.Note that a^{2}+1 cannot be equal to 2005: otherwise, a^{2}=2004, but 2004 is not a perfect square.

Thus, Proposition A cannot be universally correct.- Proposition B: If alpha is perpendicular to gamma, and beta is perpendicular to gamma, this means both alpha and beta are orthogonal to the same plane gamma. While this suggests a certain spatial relationship, it does not guarantee that alpha and beta are parallel; they could intersect each other along a line.

Note that the minimum number of equilibrium cells is 0 (for example, if all cells are white).Let's find the maximum number of equilibrium cells.

We know that the numbers 0 and 9608 are achievable. We will prove that all numbers from 0 to 9608 are also achievable.For this, we will take a white board and gradually color it in a striped pattern. Since coloring one cell affects only the equilibrium of its neighbors, the number of equilibrium cells changes by no more than 4 with each newly colored cell. At the beginning of the process, this number is 0, and at the end, it is 9608. Therefore, the difference between two consecutive achievable numbers in the range from 0 to 9608 does not exceed 4.It remains to learn how to change the number of equilibrium cells by 1, 2, or 3. For this, we will prove two auxiliary statements.1) If the number r leqslant 5000 is achievable, then the numbers r+1, r+2, r+3 are achievable. Indeed, in this case, there is a lot of free (white) space on the board. You can place two blue cells far from the other blue cells, with exactly one white cell between them (see figure b) - this will increase the number of equilibrium cells by 1; this can be done even three times.2) If the number r geqslant 5000 is achievable, then the numbers r-1, r-2, r-3 are achievable. Indeed, in this case, there are many blue stripes on the board. You can repaint the leftmost cell of any of these stripes to white (see figure c), and the adjacent cell will no longer be equilibrium.

Therefore, the variance of the selected eggs ({s}_1^2) is smaller than the variance of the original batch (s^2).   - This leads to the conclusion that s^2 > {s}_1^2.2. Average Analysis:   - The average size (overline{x}) of the entire batch of eggs and the average size (overline{x}_1) of the selected eggs cannot be directly compared without additional information. The selection could be of larger, smaller, or mixed sizes relative to the average size of the original batch.   - Therefore, we cannot conclude whether overline{x}  overline{x}_1 without further details.Based on the analysis above, the only conclusion that must be true is that the variance of the original batch of eggs is greater than the variance of the selected eggs, which corresponds to option C: s^2 > {s}_1^2.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given the universal set U=mathbb{R}, the non-empty set A=left{xmiddle| frac{x-2}{x-(3a+1)} < 0right}, B=left{xmiddle| frac{x-a^{2}-2}{x-a} < 0right}.(1) When a= frac{1}{2}, find (complement_{U}B)cap A;(2) Let proposition p: x in A, proposition q: x in B.

To each of our m words, we associate 2^{60} words by replacing each letter Ш with У or Я (in all possible ways). Note that the resulting m cdot 2^{60} words consist of the letters У and Я and are pairwise distinct (for words derived from the same word, this is clear from the construction, and for words derived from two different words, it follows from the condition). Thus, m cdot 2^{60} leqslant 2^{100} and m leqslant 2^{40}.Remark. The estimate can be obtained in a different way.Method 1. Flip a coin 100 times. For each word, consider such an event: for every i, if at some position i there is the letter У, then a tail appeared on the i-th flip, and if the letter Я, then a head.

What is the house number of the fifth house from the beginning of the block?","solution":"I. solution: In the conventional numbering of houses on a street, house numbers always increase by 2, so the house numbers on a continuous segment form an arithmetic sequence. On one side, all house numbers are either odd or even. Let the number of the first house on the segment be a_{1}, and the number of houses be n, then the number of the last house is a_{n}=a_{1}+2(n-1), and thus their sum is:S_{n}=frac{left(a_{1}+a_{n}right) n}{2}=frac{left[2 a_{1}+2(n-1)right] n}{2}=left(a_{1}+n-1right) n=117and from thisa_{1}=frac{117}{n}-n+1Accordingly, n can only be one of the divisors of 117, and specifically 5 or a larger number, since there are at least 5 houses on the street segment, and also such that a_{1} is positive. Already at this point, writing 117 as a product of prime powers 117=3^{2} cdot 13, the divisors are: 1,3,9,13,39,117, among which only n=9 meets the requirements, and with this a_{1}=5. Thus, the fifth house bears the number 5+4 cdot 2=13. (This house is also the fifth from the end of the segment.)László Magdolna (Budapest, Martos Flóra Secondary School, 3rd year)II. solution: The sum is odd, so it can only be about the odd side of the street segment. And the number of houses on the segment is also odd, because the sum of an even number of odd addends is even. The sum of an odd number of consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence is equal to the product of the middle term (denoted by m) and the number of terms n=2 k-1. Thus, on the one handm n=117on the other hand, the middle (k-th) term of a 2 k-1=2(k-1)+1 term sequence in our case is at least 1+2(k-1)=2 k-1, i.e., m geq 2 k-1=n. According to this, 117=m n geq n^{2}, and thus n leq 10. However, n geq 5, so only 9 is the appropriate size among the divisors of 117 for n. From this, the sought house number is again 13.Gergely Márton (Pannonhalma, Bencés Secondary School, 3rd year)III. solution: Our row of houses is on the odd side. If we add up n odd numbers starting from 1, the sum is n^{2}. Since 117 is not a perfect square, the first house in our row cannot be 1. Thus, 117 must be writable as the difference of two square numbers: 117=b^{2}-c^{2}, where b is the number of houses from the beginning of the street to the end of our row, and c is the number of houses preceding our row. Nowb^{2}-c^{2}=(b-c)(b+c)=117=1 cdot 117=3 cdot 39=9 cdot 13based on the above, we select the solution similarly.Gergely Márton (Pannonhalma, Bencés Secondary School, 3rd year)Remarks. 1. Here, to speak simply, we assumed that there is a house on every plot. Of course, we always assumed that there are no merged or divided plots on the street segment (e.g., 11-13, or 7 / a).2.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a triangle (ABC) with an area of (92) square centimeters. We need to find the area of another triangle whose sides are the medians of triangle (ABC).2. Key Concept:   The area of a triangle formed by the medians of another triangle is (frac{3}{4}) of the area of the original triangle. This is a well-known result in geometry.3. Proof of the Key Concept:   - Let (D, E, F) be the midpoints of sides (BC, CA, AB) respectively.   - The medians of triangle (ABC) intersect at the centroid (G), which divides each median in the ratio (2:1).   - Construct a point (G') such that (BF) is parallel and equal to (DG'). Then (DFG'C) forms a parallelogram.   - The diagonals of parallelogram (DFG'C) bisect each other, so (H) is the midpoint of both (CF) and (DG').   - Since (BEGC) is a parallelogram, (angle AEG = angle ABC), (BC = EG), and (AE = EB). Thus, triangles (AEG) and (EBC) are congruent, implying (AG = EC).   - Therefore, triangle (ADG) has side lengths equal to the medians of triangle (ABC).   - The area ratio (frac{[ADG]}{[ABC]} = frac{2[ADH]}{2[ADC]} = frac{AH}{AC} = frac{3}{4}).4.

The study plan is as follows:1. We consider a quantity that we would like to see preserved by our transformation (lengths, ratios of lengths, geometric angles, oriented angles);2. We define the transformations that preserve this quantity and study their structure:- Center of a transformation: does such a transformation have a fixed point? If so, how to construct it?- \\"Degrees of freedom\\": can we determine a transformation from the given data of a certain number of points and their images? Conversely, for which n can we fix A_{1}, ldots, A_{n} and B_{1}, ldots, B_{n} such that there exists an appropriate transformation that maps A_{1} to B_{1}, ldots, A_{n} to B_{n}? (and what additional constraints must be imposed on these points to increase the degree of freedom n?)- Composition of two transformations of the same type- Decomposition of a transformation as a product of \\"elementary\\" factors.3. If we have two types of transformations (those that preserve the schtroumpfs and those that preserve the bagadas, for example), we study the relative position of the set of transformations that preserve the schtroumpfs and the set of transformations that preserve the bagadas, and how our composition law behaves with respect to them (see the diagram below).Additional points covered/not covered We emphasized the difference between a direct transformation and an indirect transformation (starting observation: axial symmetry is an isometry, it preserves angles but multiplies all oriented angle values by -1), this question playing an important role in the study of the number of degrees of freedom of a transformation. We studied the notion of interior similarity. We provided the construction of the Miquel point, from which we could deduce the theorem of the concurrence of the four circles at the Miquel point.The general study of axial symmetries (especially their composition) was not carried out. The existence of a center for every similarity was assumed.## Summary DiagramExercises covered In addition to the study of the various transformations that we tried to conduct as several small exercises, the following exercises were posed:"},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (1 - sin theta, 1) and overrightarrow{b} = (frac{1}{2}, 1 + sin theta), and overrightarrow{a} is parallel to overrightarrow{b}, find the acute angle theta equal to ______.","solution":"Since overrightarrow{a} is parallel to overrightarrow{b}, their corresponding components are proportional.

In one move, it is allowed to swap two adjacent chips if their numbers differ by no more than k. For what smallest k can a series of such moves result in a configuration where each chip is shifted one position clockwise relative to its initial position?(S. Berlov)","solution":"# Answer. 50.Solution. Example. The chip 50 is sequentially exchanged 99 times with the next one counterclockwise. We get the required arrangement.There are several ways to prove the estimate, below we provide two of them.The first way. Suppose that for some k<50 the required arrangement is obtained.At any moment, we consider the arc from chip 100 to chip 1 clockwise to be painted. Since chips 100 and 1 cannot be swapped in one move, each specific chip m (2 leqslant m leqslant 99) could only enter the painted arc or leave the painted arc by swapping with one of the chips 1 or 100.Since initially and at the end, chip m was not on the painted arc, it made an equal number of entries onto the painted arc and exits from the painted arc. For m leqslant 50, chip m could not swap with chip 100, so it could only enter or exit by swapping with chip 1. Upon entry, chip 1 moves 1 position clockwise, and upon exit - 1 position counterclockwise. We conduct similar reasoning for chips m geqslant 51, which cannot swap with chip 1.Thus, chips 1 and 100 will make an equal number of moves clockwise and counterclockwise, so they will remain in their positions. Contradiction.The second way. We will count the shifts of the chips relative to their initial position, with a shift clockwise being counted as positive and a shift counterclockwise as negative. Then, when two chips are swapped, +1 is added to the shift of one of them, and -1 to the other. Therefore, the sum of the shifts after the operations will be 0.We reason by contradiction: suppose that for k<50 each chip i is finally shifted one position clockwise, i.e., its shift is 1+100 t_{i} (here t_{i} is the integer \\"number of rotations\\" clockwise, in particular, if t_{i}<0, chip i made left|t_{i}right| rotations counterclockwise). Then the total shift of all 100 chips is 100left(t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}right)+100. Since it must equal 0, we have t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=-1.Since k<50, chips with numbers i and j, where j geqslant i+50, could not swap places, so their shifts at any moment are definitely less than 100 apart, meaning the \\"number of rotations\\" t_{i} and t_{j} are equal for j geqslant i+50. Hence, t_{1}=t_{51}, t_{2}=t_{52}, ldots, t_{50}=t_{100}. Then the sum t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=2left(t_{1}+right. left.+t_{2}+ldots+t_{50}right) is even, and thus not equal to -1. Contradiction.Remark 1. The last reasoning can be modified as follows.From this, t_{1}=t_{51}, t_{1}=t_{52}, ldots, t_{1}=t_{100}, t_{2}=t_{100}, t_{3}=t_{100}, ldots, t_{50}=t_{100}, thus all t_{i} are equal to t_{1}. Then t_{1}+t_{2}+ +ldots+t_{100}=100 t_{1} neq-1.Remark 2. The proof can be completed by contradiction in another way, replacing the last paragraph of the solution with the following reasoning.We will paint chips red for which t_{i} geqslant 0, and blue for which t_{i}<0. Clearly, at some point, a blue and a red chip must swap, since the difference in their shifts is at least 100. Since k<50, the pair of chips 1 and 51- are the same color, similarly pairs of chips 1 and 52, ldots, 1 and 100, 2 and 100, 3 and 100, ldots, 50 and 100- are the same color. Thus, all chips are the same color. We know that t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{100}=-1, so among the numbers t_{1}, ldots, t_{100} there are both non-negative and negative ones, i.e., there are both red and blue chips - contradiction.Comment.

The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1.3. We are given that ( overline{AN_2} : overline{N_2N_1} : overline{N_1D} = 3:3:1 ). This implies that ( N_2 ) is the centroid of ( triangle ABD ), ( N_1 ) is the centroid of ( triangle BEC ), and ( N_3 ) is the centroid of ( triangle CFA ).4.

Comparing log_{0.3}2 and 0: Since 0.3 < 1, the logarithm base 0.3 of any number greater than 1 will be negative.

For any integer i leqslant k, we set s_{i}=sqrt{d_{1}+d_{2}+ldots+d_{i}}. We say that an integer ell is good if s_{i}=i and d_{i}=2 i-1 for all i leqslant ell. Below, we will prove that every integer ell leqslant k is good.First, for any integer i geqslant 2, we already note thatd_{i}=s_{i}^{2}-s_{i-1}^{2}=left(s_{i}-s_{i-1}right)left(s_{i}+s_{i-1}right) geqslant s_{i}+s_{i-1} geqslant 2 .Consequently, d_{1}=s_{1}=1.Now consider a good integer ell leqslant k-1. We will prove that ell+1 is also good. Indeed, if s_{ell+1}+s_{ell} divides left(s_{ell+1}-s_{ell}right)left(s_{ell+1}+s_{ell}right)=d_{ell+1}, then it divides n. Therefore, there exists an integer m such thatd_{m}=s_{ell+1}+s_{ell} geqslant 2 s_{ell}+1 geqslant 2 ell+1Since d_{m}>d_{i} for all i leqslant ell, we deduce that m geqslant ell+1.

We conclude thatd_{ell+1}=left(s_{ell+1}-s_{ell}right)left(s_{ell+1}+s_{ell}right)=2 ell+1which means as expected that ell+1 is good.In conclusion, the divisors of n are the integers 1,3, ldots, 2 k-1. Conversely, if the divisors of n are the integers 1,3, ldots, 2 k-1, the integer n certainly fits.In particular, if k geqslant 2, the integer d_{k-1} is an odd divisor of n-d_{k-1}=2, so d_{k-1}=1 and k=2. Thus, either k=1, in which case n=1, or k=2, in which case n=3. In both cases, these values of n fit. The sought integers are therefore n=1 and n=3.Comment from the graders: This problem was rather difficult and was solved in its entirety by very few students: only about ten students obtained full marks.However, many students were able to earn points by trying to determine what the first divisors of the permutation should be.

Step 1: Show that ( a, b, c ) are all odd.   - If all of them are even, then the LHS is even but the RHS is odd, a contradiction.   - If two of them are even, then the LHS is a multiple of ( 4 ) but ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1 equiv 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ), which is a contradiction since a multiple of ( 4 ) cannot be ( 2 pmod{4} ).   - If one of them is even, then the LHS is even and the RHS is odd again, so we have another contradiction.   - Thus, ( a, b, c ) are all odd.4. Step 2: Conclude that ( 4 mid m ).   - Since ( a, b, c ) are odd, ( a^2, b^2, c^2 equiv 1 pmod{4} ).   - Therefore, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{4} ).   - Hence, ( 4 mid abcm implies 4 mid m ).5. Step 3: Assume for contradiction that there exists ( m neq 4 ) and positive integers ( a, b, c ) such that the condition is satisfied.   - Let ((A, B, C)) be the triplet with ( A + B + C ) minimized for this particular ( m ).   - Since ( 4 mid m ), we must have ( m geq 8 ).6. Step 4: Assume WLOG that ( A geq B geq C ).   - Note that ( m = frac{1}{ABC} + frac{A}{BC} + frac{B}{CA} + frac{C}{AB} ).   - Since ( frac{1}{ABC} leq 1 ), ( B leq A leq CA ), and ( C leq A leq BA ), we have that ( frac{1}{ABC}, frac{B}{CA}, frac{C}{AB} ) are all less than or equal to ( 1 ).   - Therefore, ( frac{A}{BC} geq m - 3 implies A geq (m - 3)BC ).7. Step 5: Rewrite the original equation as ( A^2 - (mBC)A + (B^2 + C^2 + 1) = 0 ).   - By Vieta's formulas, ( (mBC - A, B, C) ) is also a solution for this particular ( m ).   - We can verify that all entries are positive integers: ( mBC - A = frac{B^2 + C^2 + 1}{A} ), so ( mBC - A > 0 ) (and clearly ( mBC - A ) is an integer).   - Thus, ( (mBC - A, B, C) ) is indeed a positive integer solution for this particular ( m ).8. Step 6: Since ( A + B + C ) is minimal, we must have ( (mBC - A) + B + C geq A + B + C implies mBC geq 2A ).   - Since ( A geq (m - 3)BC ) as derived earlier, this means that ( mBC geq 2A geq (2m - 6)BC implies m geq 2m - 6 implies 6 geq m ).   - But since ( m geq 8 ), this is a contradiction!9.

Find the smallest natural number ending in the digit 6 that quadruples when its last digit is moved to the beginning of the number.","solution":"35. First solution. Let the number X satisfy the conditions of the problem:X=widehat{a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n-1} 6} quad text { and } quad 4 X=widehat{6 a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n-1}},where a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-1}, 6 are the digits of the number X. Since the last digit of X is 6, the last digit of a_{n-1} of the number 4 X is 4; thus, X=overline{a_{1} a_{2} ldots a_{n-2} 46}, which allows us to find the second-to-last digit a_{n-2}=8 of the number 4 X. Writing X now as ldots 846, we can find that a_{n-3}=3, and so on. We will continue this process until we get the digit 6 in the number 4 X, which can be considered as carried from the end of the number X. Thus, we find that the smallest possible number satisfying the condition of the problem is X=153846; in this case, 4 X=615384.Second solution. Since the desired number X ends with the digit 6, it can be written in the form X=10 x+6, where x is the number obtained from X by erasing the last digit 6.

Consider the colorings of a 5 times 5 table described in the problem (i.e., such that in each column and each row exactly one cell is colored).For convenience, let's introduce some notations. The top-left corner cell of the 5 times 5 table will be called A, and the bottom-right corner cell will be called B. Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored. To find this, we subtract from 120 the number of colorings of the first table where A or B is colored. To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not. This leads to the equation 120=a+96, i.e., a=24. Then b=24 as well.The number of colorings where both A and B are colored is the same as the number of ways to color the central 3 times 3 square. It is easy to see that there are exactly 3!=6 such ways (to choose the colored cell in its top row, there are 3 ways, in the middle row - 2 ways, and in the bottom row - 1 way).Thus, the answer to the problem is the number 120-(24+24-6)=78.## 7th grade"},{"problem":"A 45^circ arc of circle A is equal in length to a 30^circ arc of circle B.

Firstly, if a higher angle measure equals a lower angle measure, that means that the ratio of areas must be lower, cutting D and E.

Therefore, it is (A)-dragoonSolution 4Written by a 6th grader, please don't mind*Set Circle A's arc to 45 degrees. In a full circle, there is 360 degrees, so 360/45 = 8. If we set the arc to be pi degrees, then in total there will be 8 pi in the circumference of this circle, yielding 4 as the radius and 16pi as the area. Since the arc of 30 degrees in Circle B is also pi, and there are 12 30 degree arcs in a circle, there will be 12pi in the circumference of Circle B, yielding 6 as the radius and 36pi as the area.
