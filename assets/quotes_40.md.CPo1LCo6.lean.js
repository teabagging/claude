The distance d from the center O to line AB is d = frac{|2x_0-ty_0|}{sqrt{(y_0-2)^2+(x_0-t)^2}}.  Also, x_0^2 + 2y_0^2 = 4, t = -frac{2y_0}{x_0}.

We took ten consecutive natural numbers greater than 1, multiplied them, found all the prime divisors of the resulting number, and multiplied these prime divisors (taking each exactly once). What is the smallest number that could have resulted? Fully justify your answer.Solution. We will prove that among ten consecutive numbers, there must be a number that has a prime divisor different from 2, 3, 5, 7. Let's count how many of the ten consecutive numbers can have the specified four divisors. Out of ten numbers, exactly five are divisible by 2, and at least one of these five numbers is divisible by 3. (This fact can be taken for granted in the work, but let's recall one possible proof. The remainders from dividing six consecutive numbers by 6 form a set from 0 to 5, i.e., there is a number with a remainder of 0, which is divisible by both 2 and 3.) Further, the set of ten numbers contains at least three and no more than four numbers that are divisible by 3. If there are three such numbers, at least one of these three is divisible by 2 and has already been counted. If there are four such numbers, they have the form 3k, 3k+3, 3k+6, 3k+9. Depending on the parity of k, either 3k, 3k+6 or 3k+3, 3k+9 are divisible by 2. Thus, when considering numbers divisible by 3, we can add no more than two new numbers to the five even numbers already counted. Ten consecutive numbers contain exactly two numbers that are divisible by 5, one of which is even and has already been counted. Therefore, divisibility by 5 adds no more than one number to the seven already counted. Among ten consecutive numbers, no more than two are divisible by 7, one of which is even and has already been counted. Divisibility by 7 adds no more than one number to the eight already counted. Thus, among ten consecutive numbers, no more than nine have at least one of the divisors 2, 3, 5, 7, i.e., there is a number with a larger prime divisor and not divisible by any of the first four prime numbers. Therefore, in the product of ten numbers, there will be at least one divisor different from 2, 3, 5, 7, so the product of all prime divisors will be greater than 210. The smallest possible product is 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 11 = 2310.","solution":"Answer: 2310.## Municipal Stage of the All-Russian Mathematics Olympiad 2018-2019 Academic Year10th GradeGrading Criteria| Score | Points for || :---: | :---: | :--- || 7 | Complete solution, a correct algorithm of actions for Zhenya is provided, and all conditions are verified. || 6 | Complete solution, a correct algorithm of actions for Zhenya is provided, but it is not verified that the arrangement obtained by the algorithm satisfies all conditions. || 4 | An algorithm of actions for Zhenya is constructed, based on dividing the cells into pairs.

Continue simplifying using logarithmic properties:   = -log_{3}3 + frac{1}{3}log_{5}3 + frac{2}{3} + log_{6}2 + log_{6}34. Simplify the expression using log_{a}a = 1:   = -1 + frac{1}{3}log_{5}3 + frac{2}{3} + log_{6}2 + log_{6}35. Now we change the base of the remaining logarithms to base e and then apply the change of base formula:   = -1 + frac{ln3}{3ln5} + frac{2}{3} + frac{ln2}{ln6} + frac{ln3}{ln6}6. We can simplify the expression further by noticing that ln6 = ln(2 cdot 3) = ln2 + ln3:   = -1 + frac{ln3}{3ln5} + frac{2}{3} + frac{ln2}{ln2 + ln3} + frac{ln3}{ln2 + ln3}7. Finally, we simplify the expression by combining the last two terms:   = -1 + frac{ln3}{3ln5} + frac{2}{3} + frac{ln2 + ln3}{ln2 + ln3} = -1 + frac{ln3}{3ln5} + frac{2}{3} + 1 = boxed{frac{2}{3}}"},{"problem":"1.1.

Let ( a ) be the number of integers in the first group and ( b ) be the number of integers in the second group. Therefore, we have ( a + b = n ).2. Given that the average of the integers in the original list is 89, we can write the total sum of the integers in the original list as ( 89n ).3. The average of the integers in the first group is 73, so the total sum of the integers in the first group is ( 73a ).4. The average of the integers in the second group is 111, so the total sum of the integers in the second group is ( 111b ).5. Since the total sum of the integers in the original list is the sum of the integers in both groups, we have:   [   89n = 73a + 111b   ]6. Substituting ( n = a + b ) into the equation, we get:   [   89(a + b) = 73a + 111b   ]7. Simplifying the equation, we get:   [   89a + 89b = 73a + 111b   ]8. Rearranging the terms, we get:   [   89a - 73a = 111b - 89b   ]9. Simplifying further, we get:   [   16a = 22b   ]10. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:    [    8a = 11b    ]11.

Taylor's Formula for Functions of Two VariablesLet z=f(x, y) be a function of two variables x and y, continuous along with its partial derivatives up to the (n+1)-th order inclusive in a neighborhood of a given point M_{0}(a, b). Then, similarly to the case of functions of one variable (see Chapter VII § 12), the function of two variables can be represented as a polynomial of degree n in x-a and y-b and some remainder term:f(x, y)=f(a, b)+frac{1}{1!} d f(a, b)+frac{1}{2!} d^{2} f(a, b)+cdots+frac{1}{n!} d^{n} f(a, b)+R_{n}Here, it can be assumed that d x=x-a, d y=y-b.The polynomial appearing in this formula is called the Taylor polynomial of the function f(x, y). It represents an approximate value of the given function in the neighborhood of the point M_{0}(a, b).## Examples with Solutions"},{"problem":"In triangle triangle ABC, a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively, and c=-3bcos A.

From part (1), we know frac{tan A}{tan B} = -4. Let tan B = x, then tan A = -4x. Substituting these into the identity for tan C, we get:[frac{3}{4} = frac{-4x + x}{-4x^2 - 1}]Solving for x, we find x = frac{1}{2}, which means tan B = frac{1}{2} and tan A = -2. Therefore, sin A = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} and cos A = -frac{1}{sqrt{5}}.Given c = 2 and c = -3bcos A, we can solve for b:[b = frac{c}{-3cos A} = frac{2}{-3(-frac{1}{sqrt{5}})} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{3}]The area of triangle triangle ABC is given by S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A.

The system of equations is symmetric: if you swap x and y, for example, the third equation remains the same and the first two equations switch places. We can thus assume without loss of generality that x geq y geq z. The system then becomes:begin{aligned}& x^{2}-y z=y-z+1, & y^{2}-z x=x-z+1, & z^{2}-x y=x-y+1end{aligned}Subtracting the first two equations gives x^{2}-y^{2}+z(x-y)=y-x, or (x-y)(x+y+z+1)=0. This implies x=y or x+y+z=-1. Subtracting the second and third equations gives y^{2}-z^{2}+x(y-z)=y-z, or (y-z)(y+z+x-1)=0. This implies y=z or x+y+z=1.We now consider two cases: x=y and x neq y. In the first case, y neq z, because otherwise x=y=z and this would give 0=1 in the first equation, a contradiction. Thus, we have x+y+z=1, or 2x+z=1. Substituting y=x and z=1-2x into the first equation gives x^{2}-x(1-2x)=x-(1-2x)+1, which simplifies to 3x^{2}-x=3x, or 3x^{2}=4x. This gives x=0 or x=frac{4}{3}. With x=0, we get y=0, z=1, but this does not satisfy our assumption x geq y geq z. Thus, we are left with x=frac{4}{3}, which gives the triplet left(frac{4}{3}, frac{4}{3},-frac{5}{3}right). Checking shows that this is a solution.Now consider the case x neq y. Then x+y+z=-1, so it cannot also be true that x+y+z=1, so we see that y=z. Now x+y+z=-1 gives x+2z=-1, so x=-1-2z. The first equation becomes (-1-2z)^{2}-z^{2}=1, which simplifies to 3z^{2}+4z=0. This gives z=0 or z=-frac{4}{3}. With z=0, we get y=0, x=-1, but this does not satisfy our assumption x geq y geq z. Thus, we are left with z=-frac{4}{3}, which gives the triplet left(frac{5}{3},-frac{4}{3},-frac{4}{3}right).

If l is supposed to intersect both lines a and b, then it would mean that line l is contained in both planes alpha and beta.

As for b, since it is a skew line with respect to a, it will not be in the same plane as a, hence it cannot intersect l at the same point where a does (if at all). Thus, A is not necessarily correct.Now, we look at option B. If l does not intersect either a or b, this would mean that l is parallel to both a and b, implying a and b would be parallel to each other; however, this contradicts the fact that a and b are skew lines. Therefore, B cannot be correct.Considering option C, which states that l intersects at most one of a or b. This statement suggests that there is a possibility that l intersects neither of the lines, which leads back to the incorrect situation discussed in option B. Moreover, since alpha and beta are distinct planes that intersect at line l, and a is part of alpha while b is part of beta, it's possible for l to intersect with both at distinct points. Therefore, C is not necessarily correct either.Finally, we have option D. Given the information that a and b are skew lines and they lie in different planes alpha and beta respectively, the intersection line l of the two planes must intersect at least one of the lines a or b because l is the line along which planes alpha and beta intersect, implying that l is not parallel to a or b.

An antichain is a family of sets where no set is a subset of another.3. Constructing the Antichain:   Consider the sets A, B in mathcal{F}. If A cap B subset C for some C in mathcal{F}, then A cap B would be a subset of C, violating the given condition. Hence, the sets A cap B must form an antichain in mathcal{P}(X).4. Bounding the Size of mathcal{F}:   By Sperner's theorem, the size of the largest antichain in mathcal{P}(X) is binom{k}{lfloor frac{k}{2} rfloor}. Since mathcal{F} must form an antichain, we have:   [   |mathcal{F}| leq binom{k}{lfloor frac{k}{2} rfloor} + 1   ]Thus, we have shown the required inequality. Part (b)1. Understanding the Problem:   Now, the elements of mathcal{F} do not necessarily have k elements, but the condition A cap B notsubset C for any three distinct sets A, B, C in mathcal{F} still holds. We need to show that |mathcal{F}| leq binom{n}{lceil frac{n-2}{3} rceil} + 2.2. Generalizing the Antichain Argument:   The condition A cap B notsubset C implies that the sets in mathcal{F} must still form an antichain in the power set mathcal{P}(X). However, since the sets do not necessarily have k elements, we need to consider the largest possible antichain in mathcal{P}(X).3. Applying Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem:   The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem provides a bound on the size of a family of sets where any two sets intersect. For a set X of size n, the largest such family has size binom{n-1}{lceil frac{n-2}{3} rceil}.4. Bounding the Size of mathcal{F}:   Given the condition A cap B notsubset C, the sets in mathcal{F} must form an antichain. By the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, the size of the largest such family is binom{n}{lceil frac{n-2}{3} rceil}. Adding the additional sets that do not necessarily intersect, we get:   [   |mathcal{F}| leq binom{n}{lceil frac{n-2}{3} rceil} + 2   ]Thus, we have shown the required inequality.The final answer is boxed{binom{k}{lfloor frac{k}{2} rfloor} + 1} for part (a) and boxed{binom{n}{lceil frac{n-2}{3} rceil} + 2} for part (b)."},{"problem":"Given points A(-sqrt{3}, 0) and B(sqrt{3}, 0), a moving point P satisfies the condition that the product of the slopes of lines PA and PB is a constant -frac{2}{3}.

Determine whether line MN passes through a fixed point. If it does, find the coordinates of the fixed point. If not, explain the reason.","solution":"(1) Let moving point P be (x, y) (x neq pm sqrt{3}). Then, the product of the slopes k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} = frac{y}{x + sqrt{3}} cdot frac{y}{x - sqrt{3}} = -frac{2}{3} (x neq pm sqrt{3}). Simplifying, we get frac{x^2}{3} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1. Since x neq pm sqrt{3}, the equation of curve C is frac{x^2}{3} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1 (x neq pm sqrt{3}).(2) From part (1), we have A(-sqrt{3}, 0). When the slope of line MN does not exist, let the equation of line MN be x = t. Then, M(t, sqrt{2 - frac{2t^2}{3}}) and N(t, -sqrt{2 - frac{2t^2}{3}}). Since overrightarrow{AM} perp overrightarrow{AN}, we have (t + sqrt{3})^2 - (2 - frac{2t^2}{3}) = 0. Solving for t, we get t = -frac{sqrt{3}}{5} or t = -sqrt{3} (which is extraneous).When the slope of line MN exists, let the equation of line MN be y = kx + b. Let M(x_1, y_1) and N(x_2, y_2). Eliminating y from y = kx + b and the ellipse 2x^2 + 3y^2 = 6, we get (2 + 3k^2)x^2 + 6kbx + 3b^2 - 6 = 0. Then, x_1 + x_2 = -frac{6kb}{3k^2 + 2} and x_1x_2 = frac{3b^2 - 6}{3k^2 + 2}. Also, y_1y_2 = (kx_1 + b)(kx_2 + b) = k^2x_1x_2 + kb(x_1 + x_2) + b^2. Since overrightarrow{AM} perp overrightarrow{AN}, we have (x_1 + sqrt{3})(x_2 + sqrt{3}) + y_1y_2 = 0, which simplifies to (1 + k^2)x_1x_2 + (kb + sqrt{3})(x_1 + x_2) + b^2 + 3 = 0. Substituting the expressions for x_1 + x_2 and x_1x_2, we get 3k^2 - 6sqrt{3}kb + 5b^2 = 0, which factors to (sqrt{3}k - 5b)(sqrt{3}k - b) = 0. Thus, b = sqrt{3}k or b = frac{sqrt{3}}{5}k.If b = sqrt{3}k, the equation of line MN is y = k(x + sqrt{3}), which passes through point A(-sqrt{3}, 0), but is not inside the ellipse, contradicting the problem statement. If b = frac{sqrt{3}}{5}k, the equation of line MN is y = k(x + frac{sqrt{3}}{5}), which passes through the fixed point (-frac{sqrt{3}}{5}, 0).In conclusion, line MN passes through the fixed point boxed{(-frac{sqrt{3}}{5}, 0)}."},{"problem":"1.

[20] Let a, b, and c be complex numbers such that |a|=|b|=|c|=|a+b+c|=1. If |a-b|=|a-c| and b neq c, evaluate |a+b||a+c|.","solution":"Answer: 2 First solution.Since |a|=1, a cannot be 0 . Let u=frac{b}{a} and v=frac{c}{a}. Dividing the given equations by |a|=1 gives |u|=|v|=|1+u+v|=1 and |1-u|=stackrel{a}{|1-v|}. The goal is to prove that |1+u||1+v|=2.By squaring |1-u|=|1-v|, we get (1-u) overline{(1-u)}=(1-v) overline{(1-v)}, and thus 1-u-bar{u}+|u|^{2}= 1-v-bar{v}+|v|^{2}, or u+bar{u}=v+bar{v}. This implies operatorname{Re}(u)=operatorname{Re}(v). Since u and v are on the unit circle in the complex plane, u is equal to either v or bar{v}. However, b neq c implies u neq v, so u=bar{v}.Therefore, 1=|1+u+bar{u}|=|1+2 operatorname{Re}(u)|. Since operatorname{Re}(u) is real, we either have operatorname{Re}(u)=0 or operatorname{Re}(u)=-1. The first case gives u= pm i and |1+u||1+v|=|1+i||1-i|=2, as desired. It remains only to note that operatorname{Re}(u)=-1 is in fact impossible because u is of norm 1 and u=-1 would imply u=bar{u}=v.Remark: by the rotational symmetry of the circle, it is acceptable to skip the first step of this solution and assume a=1 without loss of generality.Second solution.Let a, b, and c, be the vertices of a triangle inscribed in the unit circle in the complex plane. Since the complex coordinate of the circumcenter is 0 and the complex coordinate of the centroid is frac{a+b+c}{3}, it follows from well-known facts about the Euler line that the complex coordinate of the orthocenter is a+b+c. Hence the orthocenter lies on the unit circle as well.

The number 20^{15}=2^{30} 5^{15} is divisible only by the prime numbers 2 and 5, so the sought number n must be of the form n=2^{a} 5^{b}, where a, b are natural numbers. Each of its positive divisors is thus of the form 2^{alpha} 5^{beta}, where alpha in{0,1, ldots, a} and beta in{0,1, ldots, b}, and from the theorem of the unique factorization of a natural number into a product of primes, it follows that for different alpha, beta we get different divisors.For each beta in{0,1, ldots, b}, consider now all divisors of the number n that are divisible by 5 exactly to the power of beta.

Substituting into the first equation of the system, we then haveb(b+1)(2 b+1)=30Since 30=2 cdot 3 cdot 5, we see that one solution is b=2. Since the function x(x+1)(2 x+1) is increasing on the set of positive numbers as the product of three increasing positive functions, this is the only solution.

Let a be an odd integer, given by its binary representation. Find simply, from this representation, the smallest integer n such that a^{n}-1 is divisible by 2^{2007}.","solution":". Euler's totient function of 2^{2007} is 2^{2006}, so n divides 2^{2006}: it is a power of 2. Let a=1+m cdot 2^{k}, where m is an odd integer. We havea^{n}=1+nleft(m cdot 2^{k}right)+frac{n(n-1)}{2}left(m cdot 2^{k}right)^{2}+cdots+binom{n}{p}left(m cdot 2^{k}right)^{p}+cdotsWhen n=2^{q} is a power of 2, binom{n}{p} is at least divisible by 2^{q-nu_{2}(p)}, and the p-th term of the expansion of a^{n} is divisible by 2^{q-nu_{2}(p)+k p} which is strictly greater than 2^{q+k} if p>1 (assuming k>1). The highest power of 2 that divides a^{n}-1 is therefore limited by the second term of a^{n}. It is thus 2^{q+k}. The number n sought is therefore 2^{2007-k} where k is the number of digits following the second-to-last 1 in the binary representation. For example, for 111000101, it is two.If k=1, we actually have a=-1+m cdot 2^{k^{prime}} with k^{prime}>1. We then have a development with the same terms but with opposite signs, but the same reasoning applies, and n=2^{2007-k^{prime}}, and k^{prime} is the number of 1s that follow the last zero in the binary representation of a, for example for 101011111, it is five."},{"problem":"The arithmetic square root of the real number 25 is ( )A: pm 5B: 5C: sqrt{5}D: pm sqrt{5}","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the definition of the arithmetic square root.

When a leq 0, f'(x) > 0 for all x > 0, so the function f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty).   When a > 0, to find the increasing interval, we set f'(x) > 0 which yields x > sqrt{2a}. Hence, the increasing interval for f(x) is (sqrt{2a}, +infty).   On the other hand, setting f'(x) < 0 yields 0 < x < sqrt{2a}, so the decreasing interval for f(x) is (0, sqrt{2a}).2. The given condition is equivalent to saying that for x in left[frac{1}{2}, 2right], the inequality a geq x - x^2ln x is always true.   Let H(x) = x - x^2ln x. Therefore, the minimum value of a is max H(x). We find the critical points by calculating the derivative of H(x):      H'(x) = 1 - 2xln x - x.      Setting H'(x) = 0 gives us a critical point at x = 1. Let m(x) = 1 - 2xln x - x, so that m'(x) = -3 - 2ln x.   Since x in left[frac{1}{2}, 2right], we have m'(x) = -3 - 2ln x < 0, indicating that m(x) is decreasing on this interval.   As a result, H(x) is increasing on left[frac{1}{2}, 1right] and decreasing on (1, 2]. Thus, the maximum value of H(x) occurs at x = 1.

Since (n^2) can only be congruent to (0, 1,) or (4 mod 5), we analyze these cases:   - If (n^2 equiv 0 mod 5), then (n^2 = 25k) for some integer (k). This implies (n^2) is a multiple of 25, which is not possible since (25p) is not a perfect square for prime (p).   - If (n^2 equiv 1 mod 5), then (n^2 = 25p + 1).   - If (n^2 equiv 4 mod 5), then (n^2 = 25p + 4).3.

Let ( p = m^2 - mn + n^2 + 1 ). We need to show that ( p ) divides both ( 3^{m+n} + (m+n)! ) and ( 3^{m^3+n^3} + m+n ).2. First, we claim that ( p ) is an odd prime number. Since ( p ) divides ( 3^{m+n} + (m+n)! ), and ( 3^{m+n} + (m+n)! ) is odd for ( m+n geq 2 ), ( p ) must be odd.3. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that ( p ) is composite. Then, ( p ) has a prime factor ( q ) such that ( q leq sqrt{p} leq m+n ). This implies ( q ) divides ( (m+n)! ). Since ( q mid p mid 3^{m+n} + (m+n)! ), it follows that ( q mid 3 ), so ( q = 3 ).4. However, if ( q = 3 ), then ( 3 ) divides ( p = m^2 - mn + n^2 + 1 ). But ( p equiv m^2 - mn + n^2 + 1 pmod{3} ). Since ( m ) and ( n ) are integers, ( m^2 equiv 0, 1 pmod{3} ) and similarly for ( n^2 ).

By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( 3^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Since ( p = m^2 - mn + n^2 + 1 ), we have ( 3^{m^3 + n^3} equiv 3^{(m^2 - mn + n^2)(m+n)} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Hence, ( p ) divides ( m+n+1 ).6. Now, we need ( p = m^2 - mn + n^2 + 1 leq m+n+1 ). This simplifies to:   [   m^2 - mn + n^2 leq m + n   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   (m-1)^2 + (n-1)^2 + (m-n)^2 leq 2   ]   The possible integer solutions to this inequality are ( (1,1) ), ( (1,2) ), ( (2,1) ), and ( (2,2) ).7.

Therefore,(n-2002 r)-(n-2003 s)=2003 s-2002 r=2003(r+s)-4005 r is a multiple of 9.Since 4005 is a multiple of 9 and 2003 is coprime with 9, r+s is a multiple of 9.If r=s=0, then n geqslant 9 times 2003 (because in this case b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{2003} are all divisible by 9). If r neq 0, then r+s=9, so at least one of r and s is no less than 5. In this case, we getn geqslant 5 times 2002 or n geqslant 5 times 2003.Since 10010=5 times 2002=4 times 2002+2002 times 1, and the sum of the digits of 4 and 2002 is the same, 10010 is the desired number."},{"problem":"6.2.

We can reason in different ways from here.First method. If Bimbo took one doughnut, then Little One took three doughnuts, and Karlson took nine doughnuts, so together they took 1+3+9=13 doughnuts. Thus, two doughnuts are left on the plate.If Bimbo had taken two doughnuts or more, then Little One would have taken six doughnuts or more, and Karlson would have taken 18 doughnuts or more, which is impossible.Second method. Let Bimbo take x doughnuts, then Little One took 3x doughnuts, and Karlson took 3 cdot 3x = 9x doughnuts. Then together they took x + 3x + 9x = 13x doughnuts.

This results in m(a_2 - a_1)^2 = 0. As m neq 0, we have a_2 = a_1, which contradicts the fact that {a_n} is not a constant sequence. So, T = 2 does not satisfy the conditions.Case 2: If T = 3, let a_n = begin{cases} 1, & n = 3k - 2  2, & n = 3k - 1  -3, & n = 3k end{cases} quad (k in mathbb{N}^*). Then, a_{n+3} = a_n always holds.From {a_2}^2 = a_1a_3 + m(a_2 - a_1)^2, we get m = 7. Thus, the condition becomes {a_n}^2 - a_{n+1}a_{n-1} = 7.It can be verified that the sequence {a_n} satisfies the condition for T = 3.Therefore, the smallest value of T that satisfies the conditions is boxed{3}."},{"problem":"1.

Subtracting the equation for i=3 from that for i=2 and dividing by (a 2 - a 3 ) we get: - x 1 - x 2 + x 3 + x 4 = 0. Hence x 2 = x 3 = 0, and x 1 = x 4 = 1/(a 1 - a 4 ).

First, we need to find the number of terms (n) in this sequence. Since the sequence is increasing by 2 each time (odd numbers), we can find n by using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d.Substituting a_n = 99, a_1 = 1, and d = 2 gives us:99 = 1 + (n - 1) cdot 2,which simplifies to:(n - 1) cdot 2 = 98,and further simplifies to:n - 1 = 49,giving us:n = 50.Now that we know there are 50 terms in this sequence, we can use the sum formula:S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = frac{50}{2}(1 + 99).Simplifying, we get:S_n = 25 times 100 = 2500.Therefore, the sum of the sequence 1+3+5+…+99 is boxed{2500}."},{"problem":"How many subsets does the set {0, 1, 2} have?","solution":"To solve this, we list the subsets of the set {0, 1, 2}:  emptyset, {1}, {2}, {0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}, {0, 1, 2}, totaling 8 subsets.

We deduce from this that the correct option is B.COMMENTARYIn the context of the SMC, when four of the given options have been eliminated, it is safe to conclude that the remaining option is correct. However, for a complete solution we need to give an argument to show that it is not possible to draw four straight lines so that there are exactly two points of intersection. We now give an argument to prove this.We show that the attempt to draw four straight lines on a flat piece of paper so that there are just two intersection points is bound to fail.Suppose that we aim to draw four straight lines so that there are only two points of intersection. Let these points be P and Q.For P to be a point of intersection, there must be at least two lines through P. Therefore we need to draw at least one line, say l, through P other than the line through P and Q.Similarly we need to draw at least one line, say m, through Q other than the line through P and Q.The lines l and m must be parallel since otherwise there would be a third point of intersection.We can now add the line through P and Q, say n, without creating another intersection point. However, any other line through P would not be parallel to m and hence would create a third intersection point. So we cannot draw such a line. Similarly we cannot draw another line through Q without creating a third intersection point.So, having drawn the lines l and m, the only line we can add without creating a third intersection point is n. It follows that we cannot draw four straight lines in such a way that there are exactly two intersection points.FOR INVESTIGATION9.1 Show that four straight lines can be drawn on a flat piece of paper with exactly six points of intersection.9.2 Show that it is not possible to draw four straight lines on a flat piece of paper with more than six intersection points.9.3 What are the possibilities for the number of intersection points when five straight lines are drawn on a flat piece of paper?9.4 For n geq 6, what are the possibilities for the number of intersection points when n straight lines are drawn on a flat piece of paper?"},{"problem":"The graph of the function f(x)=kx-k-a^{x-1} (a > 0 and a neq 1) always passes through a fixed point ______.","solution":"Given the function f(x)=kx-k-a^{x-1}, with a > 0 and a neq 1, we want to find a point through which its graph always passes.Let's set x=1 and plug it into the function:[begin{align*}y & = f(1) & = k(1) - k - a^{1-1} & = k - k - a^0 & = 0 - 1 & = -1.end{align*}]Therefore, no matter the value of k, the function f(x) always passes through the point (1, -1).

Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we know that ( AI = 2IX ). Since ( IX = r ) (the inradius), it follows that ( AI = 2r ). Therefore, ( AT' = frac{AI}{2} = r ).3.

By Feuerbach's theorem, the nine-point circle of ( triangle ABC ) is tangent to the incircle of ( triangle ABC ) at a unique point.

We will use the given rules:1. If ( a ) is removed, then ( 2a ) must also be removed.2. If ( a ) and ( b ) are removed, then ( a + b ) must also be removed.Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:1. Removing the smallest number:   - If we remove 1, then we must also remove 2 (since ( 2 times 1 = 2 )), 3 (since ( 1 + 2 = 3 )), and so on. This will lead to removing all numbers in the set ( A ). Therefore, removing 1 is not optimal.2. Removing even numbers:   - Consider removing the even numbers ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2(n-1) ). This removes ( n-1 ) numbers. According to the rules, removing these numbers does not force us to remove any additional numbers because:     - ( 2a ) for any ( a ) in the set of even numbers is already included in the set of even numbers.     - The sum of any two even numbers is also an even number, which is already included in the set of even numbers.3. Sum of remaining numbers:   - The sum of the set ( A ) is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{2n-1} k = frac{(2n-1) cdot 2n}{2} = n(2n-1)     ]   - The sum of the removed even numbers is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2k = 2 sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = 2 cdot frac{(n-1)n}{2} = n(n-1)     ]   - Therefore, the sum of the remaining numbers is:     [     n(2n-1) - n(n-1) = n(2n-1) - n^2 + n = n^2     ]4. Verification of optimality:   - By Lemma 1, removing 1 leads to removing all numbers, which is not optimal.   - By Lemma 2, removing the even numbers ( 2, 4, ldots, 2(n-1) ) leaves us with a sum of ( n^2 ).   - By Lemma 3, any other combination of removed numbers will result in a sum of the remaining numbers that is less than ( n^2 ).Thus, the optimal way to remove numbers is to remove the even numbers ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2(n-1) ), which leaves the sum of the remaining numbers as ( n^2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n^2 } )"},{"problem":"5.5.

What is the circumference of the region in which they overlap?","solution":"1. Understanding the Geometry:   - Each disk has a radius of 1.   - The circumference of each disk passes through the center of the other disk.   - This implies that the distance between the centers of the two disks is equal to the radius, which is 1.2. Forming the Equilateral Triangle:   - The distance between the centers of the disks is 1.   - The radius of each disk is also 1.   - Therefore, the line segment connecting the centers of the disks and the radii to the intersection points form an equilateral triangle with each side of length 1.3. Calculating the Central Angle:   - In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is (60^circ).   - The central angle subtended by the arc of the circle at the center of the disk is (120^circ) (since the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference).4. Calculating the Length of One Arc:   - The circumference of a full circle is (2pi times text{radius} = 2pi times 1 = 2pi).   - The length of the arc corresponding to (120^circ) is:     [     text{Arc length} = frac{120^circ}{360^circ} times 2pi = frac{1}{3} times 2pi = frac{2pi}{3}     ]5.

Differentiate f(x) to find the slope of the tangent line at any point x on the curve. The derivative of f(x) is:[f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}e^{1-x} = -e^{1-x}]2. Let the point of tangency be (x_0, y_0). At this point, the slope of the tangent line, denoted as k, is equal to f'(x_0), and the y-coordinate, y_0, is equal to f(x_0). Therefore, we have:[k = -e^{1-x_0}][y_0 = e^{1-x_0}]3. The equation of the tangent line can be expressed using the point-slope form, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line and m is the slope of the line. Substituting k for the slope and (x_0, y_0) for the point, we get:[y - e^{1-x_0} = -e^{1-x_0}(x - x_0)]4.

If it contains 3 integers, they must be chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.   - No matter how we choose 3 integers from this set, at least one pair will have a difference of 1, 2, or 6.   - This contradicts the condition that no two integers in the sequence differ by 1, 2, or 6.   - Hence, it is impossible to have more than 576 integers in such a sequence.(blacksquare)The final answer is (boxed{576})."},{"problem":"If f(x) satisfies the relation f(x)+2fleft( dfrac {1}{x}right)=3x, then the value of f(2) is ( ).A: 1B: -1C: -dfrac {3}{2}D: dfrac {3}{2}","solution":"Since f(x) satisfies the relation f(x)+2fleft( dfrac {1}{x}right)=3x,we have begin{cases}f(2)+2fleft( dfrac{1}{2}right)=6,①  fleft( dfrac{1}{2}right)+2f(2)= dfrac{3}{2},②end{cases},Subtracting 2×② from ① gives -3f(2)=3,Therefore, f(2)=-1,Hence, the correct choice is boxed{B}.From the given conditions, we can derive begin{cases}f(2)+2fleft( dfrac{1}{2}right)=6,①  fleft( dfrac{1}{2}right)+2f(2)= dfrac{3}{2},②end{cases}, from which we can find the value of f(2).This question tests the method of finding function values, which is a basic problem.

The minimum value is n.If a graph can be obtained from a complete graph of n vertices through operations, then this graph is called \\"permissible\\"; if any two points in a graph are connected by a path, then this graph is called \\"connected\\"; if the vertices of a graph can be divided into two sets V_{1} and V_{2}, such that each edge is between a vertex in V_{1} and a vertex in V_{2}, then this graph is called \\"bipartite\\".Assume that operations are performed on graph G, which contains a cycle of length 4, A B C D. Deleting edge A B, the new graph obtained is denoted as H, then:(1) If G is connected, then H is also connected;(2) If G is not bipartite, then H is also not bipartite.In fact, for conclusion (1), assume that there is a path I connecting points X, Y in graph G. If I does not include the deleted edge A B, then X and Y are still connected by path I in H. If I includes A B, then in H, the path connecting X and Y can be obtained by replacing A B with the three edges A D, D C, C B. Therefore, H is also connected.For conclusion (2), consider its contrapositive. If graph H is bipartite, i.e., its vertices can be divided into two sets V_{1} and V_{2}, such that each edge is between a vertex in V_{1} and a vertex in V_{2}. Since B C, C D, D A are edges in H, then A, C belong to one of the sets V_{1} or V_{2}, and B, D belong to the other set. In graph G, if the vertices are divided into the same two sets V_{1} and V_{2} as in H, then edge A B satisfies being between a vertex in V_{1} and a vertex in V_{2}. Therefore, graph G is also bipartite.Since the complete graph K_{n} is connected and K_{n} is not bipartite (because it contains a triangle), any permissible graph H is connected and not bipartite. In particular, H contains a cycle, because a graph without a cycle is bipartite.It is easy to see that a permissible graph has at least n edges.On the one hand, a connected graph with n vertices has at least n-1 edges.

Constructing the sequence:   - We start by placing the highest story building (9 stories) first.   - Next, we place two 8-story buildings, ensuring that they are separated by the 9-story building.   - Then, we place four 7-story buildings, ensuring that each pair of 7-story buildings is separated by an 8-story building.   - We continue this pattern until we place the 1-story buildings.3. Pattern and calculation:   - For each story level (i) (where (i) ranges from 1 to 9), the number of buildings with (i) stories is (2^{9-i}).   - Summing these up, we get the total number of buildings:     [     sum_{i=0}^{8} 2^i = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^8     ]   - This is a geometric series with the first term (a = 1) and common ratio (r = 2).

The slope of l_1 is sinalpha, and the slope of l_2 is 2. For these lines to coincide by translation, we need sinalpha = 2, which is impossible as the sine function's range is [-1, 1]. Therefore, option A is incorrect.- Option B (Perpendicularity): Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. The slope of l_1 is sinalpha, and the slope of l_2 is 2. The product of their slopes is 2sinalpha. This product can be equal to -1 if sinalpha = -frac{1}{2}. Since sinalpha can indeed be -frac{1}{2} (for example, when alpha = 7pi/6), option B is incorrect because it's possible for them to be perpendicular.- Option C (Isosceles Right Triangle): The question here is whether l_1 or l_2 can form the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with the x-axis. This is possible for l_1 if sinalpha = 1 or sinalpha = -1, which corresponds to alpha = pi/2 or alpha = 3pi/2 respectively. This is not fulfilling the same criteria for l_2 since its slope is fixed at 2. Thus, l_2 cannot form an isosceles right triangle with the x-axis. Consequently, option C is incorrect.- Option D (Rotation): This option posits that the lines can coincide by rotating l_1 around a certain point on itself. Since rotation can change the direction of a line without affecting its slope, l_1 can be rotated to align with l_2, provided they go through the same point before and after rotation. The slopes are irrelevant here because rotation can achieve any desired angle, provided a common point exists. This can indeed be accomplished by rotating l_1 around the point of intersection with l_2, making option D the correct answer.Therefore, the correct answer is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Carla wrote on the blackboard the integers from 1 to 21.

Step 1: Establishing SufficiencyWe first examine the statement \\"sin x = -1\\" to determine if it is a sufficient condition for \\"cos x = 0\\".- Given sin x = -1, we substitute this into the trigonometric identity:(-1)^2 + cos^2x = 1 implies 1 + cos^2x = 1.- Simplifying the equation, we find that cos^2x = 0, which implies cos x = 0.Thus, when sin x = -1, it necessarily follows that cos x = 0. This establishes the sufficiency of the condition. Step 2: Examining NecessityNext, we evaluate whether \\"cos x = 0\\" is a necessary condition for \\"sin x = -1\\".- Given cos x = 0, we substitute this into the trigonometric identity:sin^2x + (0)^2 = 1 implies sin^2x = 1.- This implies that sin x = pm 1, which means sin x can be either 1 or -1.Since sin x can be 1 in addition to -1, the condition \\"cos x = 0\\" does not necessarily imply that \\"sin x = -1\\". Therefore, the necessity of the condition is not established. ConclusionFrom the analysis above, we conclude that \\"sin x = -1\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"cos x = 0\\" because whenever sin x = -1, cos x must be 0.

We will show that m=2k.First, we observe that if there is a line that contains at least (2k+1) of the 3k points, then the points cannot be divided into k groups of three such that the points in each group form the vertices of a triangle. This immediately follows from the fact that any three points of a triangle can have at most two points on any line, so k different triangles can have at most 2k points on any line.If there is no line that contains more than 2k of the 3k points, then we will prove by complete induction on k that the points can be divided into k groups of three such that the points in each group form the vertices of a triangle. If k=1, then by our condition, the three points are not collinear, so they form the vertices of a triangle, and the statement is true. We also prove the case k=2 separately because in the inductive step, we will use the fact that the number of points is at least 6. If no three of the points are collinear, then we can divide them into two groups in any way, and the points in each group will form the vertices of a triangle. If exactly four of the points, say A, B, C, and D, lie on a line e, and the remaining two, E and F, do not lie on e, then, for example, {A, B, E}, {C, D, F} is a valid arrangement (Figure 1). Finally, if no four of the points are collinear, but, for example, A, B, and C lie on a line e, then we choose two points from the remaining three, say D and E. We can assume that the intersection point of lines DE and e is not A. If the sixth point is F, then, for example, {A, D, E}, {B, C, F} is a valid arrangement (Figure 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_f5f6b500f3e58067f824g-1.jpg?height=220&width=420&top_left_y=828&top_left_x=836)Figure 1![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_f5f6b500f3e58067f824g-1.jpg?height=319&width=466&top_left_y=1155&top_left_x=819)Figure 2Suppose the statement is true for k=n>1. Let there be given 3(n+1) distinct points such that at most 2(n+1) of them lie on a line. Consider the lines that contain at least two of the points. Let the number of these lines be N. (The number of such lines is finite, since the inequality N leq binom{3n+3}{2} clearly holds.) Let these lines be ell_{1}, ell_{2}, ldots, ell_{N}, and choose the numbering such that if |ell_{i}| is the number of given points on line ell_{i}, then for all i=1,2, ldots, N-1, the inequality |ell_{i}| geq |ell_{i+1}| holds (the numbering is not unique because there can be lines that contain the same number of points).First, we show that |ell_{3}| < 2n+2. If |ell_{3}| geq 2n+2, then the points on ell_{1} and ell_{2} would be at least 2(2n+2) = 4n+4. Since n>1, we have 6n > 3n+3, and this contradiction implies that |ell_{3}| < 2n+2. Next, we show that |ell_{2}| < 2n+2. If |ell_{2}| geq 2n+2, then the points on ell_{1} and ell_{2} would be at least 2(2n+2) = 4n+4. Since n>1, we have 6n > 3n+3, and this contradiction implies that |ell_{2}| < 2n+2. Finally, we show that if i geq 2, then |ell_{i}| leq 2n. Choose two points arbitrarily from the points on ell_{1} and add a third point from the points on ell_{2} that is not on ell_{1}. These three points clearly form a triangle. For the remaining (3n+3)-3=3n points, the inductive hypothesis holds because no 2n of them lie on a line. Since only the lines ell_{i} contain at least two of the points, the number of remaining points on ell_{1} is at most (2n+2)-2=2n, the number of remaining points on ell_{2} is at most (2n+1)-1=2n, and for the other lines, |ell_{i}| leq 2n holds. Therefore, these points can be divided into n groups of three such that the points in each group form the vertices of a triangle. Hence, the 3n+3 points can also be divided into groups that satisfy the conditions, and this completes the proof of our statement."},{"problem":"# Task 4. 25 pointsA novice economist-cryptographer received a cryptogram from the ruler, which contained another secret decree on the introduction of a commodity tax on a certain market.

Unfortunately, the economist-cryptographer decrypted the cryptogram with an error - the digits in the amount of tax revenue were determined in the wrong order. Based on the incorrect data, a decision was made to introduce a per-unit tax on the producer in the amount of 90 monetary units per unit of the product. It is known that the market demand is given by Q d=688-4 P, and the market supply is linear.

For those with whom M shook hands, we can have at most m(20-m) handshakes: m people, each with at most (20-m) handshakes. For the others (including M), we can count at most m handshakes, and since there are (20-m) of them, we again get at most m(20-m) handshakes. In total, this is 2 m(20-m), but since we counted each handshake twice, the number of handshakes can be at most m(20-m). This is maximized when m=10, so in the company, there can be at most 100 handshakes. This exact number of handshakes would occur, for example, if there were 10 women and 10 men in the company, and every woman shook hands with every man.

Identify the constraints and properties of the points (E, F, G, H):   - Given that (angle AEB = 90^circ), point (E) lies on the circle with diameter (AB).

Therefore, the \\"possible area\\" is the area of triangle ABC: t.The segments x, y, z can form a triangle if the sum of any two values is greater than the third, i.e.,x<frac{1}{2}, quad y<frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad z<frac{1}{2}The points P for which the corresponding x, y, z values satisfy the conditions (2) lie within the triangle triangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}, defined by the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle, as shown in the hatched area of the figure.Thus, the favorable area is frac{t}{4}, and the sought probability isv=frac{overline{4}}{t}=frac{1}{4}Zsombok Zoltán (Bp., IV., Konyves Kalman g.

This implies that angle C is acute. However, for triangle ABC to be an acute triangle, all angles A, B, and C must be acute. The condition given only ensures C is acute, not necessarily A and B. Therefore, option A does not guarantee triangle ABC is an acute triangle.Option B:If sin A = cos B, then we can say sin A = sin (frac{pi}{2} - B). This leads to two possibilities: A = frac{pi}{2} - B or A + B = frac{pi}{2}. Neither of these conditions directly implies that triangle ABC is a right triangle, as they do not guarantee one of the angles is exactly frac{pi}{2}. Thus, option B is incorrect.Option C:Given a^{2}tan B = b^{2}tan A, we can rewrite this as sin^{2}A cdot frac{sin B}{cos B} = sin^{2}B cdot frac{sin A}{cos A}. Simplifying, we get sin A cos A = sin B cos B, which leads to sin 2A = sin 2B. This implies A = B or A + B = frac{pi}{2}. While A = B suggests triangle ABC could be isosceles, the condition A + B = frac{pi}{2} does not necessarily make triangle ABC isosceles. Therefore, option C is incorrect because it does not guarantee triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.Option D:For triangle ABC, angles (A-B), (B-C), (C-A) are within (-pi, pi).

Therefore, the foci of the hyperbola are on the x-axis, and we have a=1. Let's assume its equation is x^2 - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,  Given that the hyperbola passes through the point (sqrt{5}, 4),  we have 4 - frac{4}{b^2} = 1. Solving this, we get b^2 = 4,  Thus, the equation of the hyperbola G is x^2 - frac{y^2}{4} = 1;  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{x^2 - frac{y^2}{4} = 1}.  From the equation of the parabola, we can determine its focus, which gives us the right vertex of the hyperbola G. Analyzing the position of the foci of the hyperbola and the value of a, we can set its equation as x^2 - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. Substituting the coordinates of the point (sqrt{5}, 4) into the equation of the hyperbola, we get 4 - frac{4}{b^2} = 1. Solving this, we find the value of b^2, and substituting the value of b^2 into the equation of the hyperbola gives us the answer.

Given that ( a = 20 ), ( b ) divides ( c ), and the numbers ( a, b, c ) are in harmonic progression, we start with the harmonic progression condition:   [   frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{c} = frac{2}{b}   ]   Substituting ( a = 20 ):   [   frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{c} = frac{2}{b}   ]2. Suppose ( c = bk ) for some integer ( k ). Then the equation becomes:   [   frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{bk} = frac{2}{b}   ]3. To eliminate the fractions, multiply through by ( 20bk ):   [   20bk left( frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{bk} right) = 20bk left( frac{2}{b} right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   bk + 20 = 40k   ]4.

This gives the sequence ( (20, 30, 60) ).   - For ( k = 4 ):     [     20 = 4(40 - b) implies 20 = 160 - 4b implies 4b = 140 implies b = 35     ]     Then ( c = bk = 35 times 4 = 140 ).

Then:     [     5r + 4s = 100     ]   - To maximize ( r ), let ( s = 0 ):     [     5r = 100 implies r = 20     ]   - Thus, ( r+s+t+u = 20 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20 ).3. Verification and conclusion:   - We have found that the minimum value of ( r+s+t+u ) is 20.   - To verify the maximum value, we need to check if there is any combination that can exceed 20 while satisfying the constraints ( r ge s ge t ge u ge 0 ).   - Given the constraints and the equation, the maximum value of ( r+s+t+u ) cannot exceed 25, as shown in the initial solution.Therefore, the bounds for ( r+s+t+u ) are:[boxed{20 le r+s+t+u le 25}]"},{"problem":"Early spring is the peak season for influenza A virus.

For 3 bottles of the first brand and 2 bottles of the second brand, the cost is 80 yuan:   3x + 2y = 802. For 1 bottle of the first brand and 4 bottles of the second brand, the cost is 110 yuan:   x + 4y = 110Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of x and y:- Multiply the second equation by 3 to eliminate x:  3(x + 4y) = 3 cdot 110 Rightarrow 3x + 12y = 330- Subtract the first equation from this result to solve for y:  (3x + 12y) - (3x + 2y) = 330 - 80 Rightarrow 10y = 250 Rightarrow y = 25- Substitute y = 25 into the first equation to solve for x:  3x + 2(25) = 80 Rightarrow 3x + 50 = 80 Rightarrow 3x = 30 Rightarrow x = 10Therefore, the price per bottle of the first brand of disinfectant is 10 yuan, and the price per bottle of the second brand is 25 yuan.boxed{x = 10, y = 25}# Part 2: Purchasing Plans for 4000ml of DisinfectantLet:- m be the number of bottles of the first brand,- n be the number of bottles of the second brand.Given that 200m + 500n = 4000, we can rearrange this equation to find a relationship between m and n:m = 20 - frac{5}{2}nConsidering that both m and n must be integers and both brands need to be purchased, we find the following plans by substituting different values of n:- When n = 2, m = 20 - frac{5}{2} cdot 2 = 15,- When n = 4, m = 20 - frac{5}{2} cdot 4 = 10,- When n = 6, m = 20 - frac{5}{2} cdot 6 = 5.Thus, the possible purchasing plans are:1. Purchase 15 bottles of the first brand and 2 bottles of the second brand;2. Purchase 10 bottles of the first brand and 4 bottles of the second brand;3. Purchase 5 bottles of the first brand and 6 bottles of the second brand.boxed{text{Plans: (1) 15 and 2, (2) 10 and 4, (3) 5 and 6}}# Part 3: Duration of Disinfectant SupplyLet:- p be the number of bottles of the first brand purchased,- q be the number of bottles of the second brand purchased,- t be the number of days the disinfectant can last.Given that 10p + 25q = 2500 and 200p + 500q = 10000t, we can solve for t:1. From the first equation, solve for p:   p = frac{500 - 5q}{2}2. Substitute this expression for p into the second equation:   200 times frac{500 - 5q}{2} + 500q = 10000t3.

Understanding the Move:   - Each move consists of a counterclockwise rotation of pi/4 radians about the origin followed by a translation of 10 units in the positive x-direction.   - We need to determine the particle's position after 150 such moves.2. Rotation and Translation:   - A rotation by pi/4 radians counterclockwise followed by a translation of 10 units in the positive x-direction can be represented as a combination of transformations.   - The total rotation after 150 moves is 150 times frac{pi}{4} = 37.5pi radians.   - Since 2pi radians is a full rotation, we reduce 37.5pi modulo 2pi:     [     37.5pi mod 2pi = 1.5pi     ]   - This means the particle has effectively rotated 1.5pi radians counterclockwise, which is equivalent to -pi/2 radians (or pi/2 radians clockwise).3.

Each move rotates the particle about P by pi/4 radians.   - To find P, consider the image P' of P after rotating about the origin O by pi/4 radians counterclockwise. The distance OP = OP', and angle POP' = pi/4.   - The translation of 10 units in the positive x-direction means P'P = 10 units.4. Coordinates of P:   - The positive y-axis bisects the isosceles triangle OPP', so the x-coordinate of P is 5.   - To find the y-coordinate, consider the point Q = (5, 5), where PQ = OQ = 5sqrt{2}.   - Thus, P = (5, 5 + 5sqrt{2}).5. Final Position After 150 Moves:   - The particle starts at (5, 0) and ends up at a point 5 + 5sqrt{2} units directly to the left of P.   - Therefore, the final coordinates are:     [     (text{-}5sqrt{2}, 5 + 5sqrt{2})     ]6.

First solution. Notice that if (x, y) is a solution of the observed system, then the pairs (-x,-y), (y, x), and (-y,-x) are also solutions. Since the system must have exactly two solutions, some of these pairs must be equal. In the case (x, y)=(-x,-y), we get x=y=0, which is clearly not a solution. In the case (x, y)=(-y,-x), we get x=-y, i.e., x+y=0, and clearly this is not a solution either. Therefore, only (x, y)=(y, x) remains, i.e., x=y. Then the first equation reduces to (2 x)^{2}=12, i.e., x= pm sqrt{3}(=y), and from the second equation we get 2(a+1)=2 x^{2}=6, i.e., a=2. Thus, the only such value of the parameter a is a=2, and then the system has solutions (x, y) in{(sqrt{3}, sqrt{3}),(-sqrt{3},-sqrt{3})}.Second solution. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get 2 x y=10-2 a. In the case a=5, it would follow that x=0 or y=0, and by substituting this into the first equation, we would get 4 solutions: (x, y) in{(0,2 sqrt{3}),(0,-2 sqrt{3}),(2 sqrt{3}, 0),(-2 sqrt{3}, 0)}. Therefore, the value a=5 does not work for us. We further assume a neq 5. Then we can express y=frac{5-a}{x}. Substituting this into the second equation, we get x^{2}+left(frac{5-a}{x}right)^{2}=2(a+1), i.e., x^{4}-2(a+1) x^{2}+25-10 a+a^{2}=0. Introduce the substitution x^{2}=t. For the previous equation to have exactly two solutions for x, the equation after the substitution: t^{2}-2(a+1) t+25-10 a+a^{2}=0 must have exactly one solution t, which means its discriminant must be 0. The discriminant is 4(a+1)^{2}-100+40 a-4 a^{2}=48 a-96, so it is equal to zero only for a=2. Then we have t=frac{2(a+1)}{2}=3 and from there x= pm sqrt{t}= pm sqrt{3}, and then y=frac{3}{x}= pm sqrt{3}.

Let's proceed step-by-step.1. Define the Set ( S ):   Let ( S ) be the set of rational numbers reachable from ( 0 ) by applying the operations ( x mapsto frac{1}{x} ), ( x mapsto -x ), and ( x mapsto 1 - x ).2. Reachability from ( 0 ):   We need to show that all rational numbers can be reached from ( 0 ) using these operations. We start with ( 0 ) and apply the operations iteratively.3. Subgroup Analysis:   Consider the subgroup ( langle a rangle subset F ) where ( F ) is the free group generated by the operations. If ( q in S ), then ( q + mathbb{Z} in S ). This implies that if ( 0 in S ), then ( mathbb{Z} in S ), and consequently, ( left{frac{1}{n} mid n in mathbb{Z}^{times}right} in S ).4. Euclidean Algorithm and Induction:   We use the Euclidean algorithm to show that all rationals can be reached. We prove this by strong induction on ( M(q) = max(|a|, |b|) ) where ( q = frac{a}{b} ) and ( (a, b) = 1 ).   - Base Case: When ( q = 0 ), we have reached the base case.   - Inductive Step: For ( q neq 0 ), one of the sets ( left(q + mathbb{Z}, frac{1}{q} + mathbb{Z}right) ) contains an element with a strictly smaller ( M )-value. Each rational number has a finite ( M )-value and hence a finite number of steps away from ( 0 ).5. Coloring Analysis:   We have established that all rationals can be reached from ( 0 ). Now, we need to analyze the parity of the path connecting two arbitrary rationals.    - Parity Preservation: The operation ( a ) preserves parity when acting on all rationals except for ( 0 ), while ( a^{-1} ) preserves parity when acting on all rationals except for ( 1 ).   - Homomorphism to ( C_2 ): Consider the homomorphism from ( F ) to ( C_2 ) defined by the generators ( a = 1, b^2 = 1 ). This homomorphism helps us determine the parity of an element of ( F ).6. Conclusion:   By considering the parity and the homomorphism, we conclude that there are exactly two valid colorings of the rational numbers. These two colorings correspond to the two possible ways to color ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) differently and extend this coloring to all rationals while maintaining the required conditions.The final answer is ( boxed{2} )"},{"problem":"cos(420^{circ}) + sin(330^{circ}) equals (    )A: 0B: -1C: dfrac{1}{2}D: 1","solution":"First, we simplify the angles:- cos(420^{circ}) = cos(360^{circ} + 60^{circ}) = cos(60^{circ})- sin(330^{circ}) = sin(360^{circ} - 30^{circ}) = -sin(30^{circ})Then, we calculate the values:- cos(60^{circ}) = dfrac{1}{2}- -sin(30^{circ}) = -dfrac{1}{2}Adding these values together:dfrac{1}{2} - dfrac{1}{2} = 0Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"7.

To understand the behavior of ( f ), we can explore the values of ( f ) for small ( n ):   - ( f(1) = 4 )   - ( f(2) = f(1) = 4 )   - ( f(3) = f(1) + 2 = 6 )   - ( f(4) = f(2) = 4 )   - ( f(5) = f(2) + 2 = 6 )   - ( f(6) = f(3) = 6 )   - ( f(7) = f(3) + 2 = 8 )   - ( f(8) = f(4) = 4 )   - ( f(9) = f(4) + 2 = 6 )   - ( f(10) = f(5) = 6 )   - ( f(11) = f(5) + 2 = 8 )   - ( f(12) = f(6) = 6 )   - ( f(13) = f(6) + 2 = 8 )   - ( f(14) = f(7) = 8 )   - ( f(15) = f(7) + 2 = 10 )3. From the above values, we observe that ( f(n) ) depends on the number of ones in the binary representation of ( n ). Specifically, if ( g(n) ) is the number of ones in the binary representation of ( n ), then:   [   f(n) = 2 + 2g(n)   ]4. We need to find the number of positive integers ( k ) less than 2014 for which ( f(k) = 8 ). Setting ( f(k) = 8 ), we get:   [   2 + 2g(k) = 8 implies 2g(k) = 6 implies g(k) = 3   ]5. Therefore, we need to count the number of integers ( k ) less than 2014 that have exactly 3 ones in their binary representation.6. The binary representation of 2014 is ( 11111011110_2 ). This is an 11-bit number. We need to count the number of ways to place 3 ones in an 11-bit number.7. The number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 11 for the ones is given by the binomial coefficient:   [   binom{11}{3} = frac{11 times 10 times 9}{3 times 2 times 1} = 165   ]8.

How does the volume of the convex body determined by these points compare to the volume of the cube?","solution":"Planes passing through the center of a cube and parallel to its faces divide both the cube and the resulting convex body into eight congruent parts, because the individual parts are mirror images of each other with respect to these planes. Therefore, it is sufficient to examine one eighth of the original cube.In one eighth of the cube, the points dividing the midlines of the cube's faces in the ratio 1:3 exactly bisect the edges of the small cube (Figure 1), and these six midpoints form a regular hexagon (proof of this can be found, for example, in the 1848th problem of the first volume of the Collection of Geometric Problems). This regular hexagon divides the volume of the small cube in half, because the two parts of the cube defined by the plane of the hexagon are interchanged by reflection in the center of the cube (on Figure 1, vertices marked with the same letter are mirror images of each other with respect to the center of the cube).Since in each eighth of the original cube exactly half of its volume belongs to the new body, the body defined by the points dividing the midlines in the ratio 1:3 - which is bounded by 6 squares and 8 regular hexagons as shown in Figure 2 - has a volume that is half of the original cube.Based on the work of Bence Seress (Budapest, Árpád Gymnasium, 8th grade)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_cc8376967bf524a2b8b0g-1.jpg?height=756&width=412&top_left_y=652&top_left_x=867)"},{"problem":"NT3. Find all pairs of positive integers (x, y) such that 2^{x}+3^{y} is a perfect square.","solution":"Solution. In order for the expression 2^{x}+3^{y} to be a perfect square, a positive integer t such that 2^{x}+3^{y}=t^{2} should exist.Case 1. If x is even, then there exists a positive integer z such that x=2 z. Thenleft(t-2^{z}right)left(t+2^{z}right)=3^{y}Since t+2^{z}-left(t-2^{z}right)=2^{z+1}, which implies g c dleft(t-2^{z}, t+2^{z}right) mid 2^{z+1}, it follows that operatorname{gcd}left(t-2^{z}, t+right. left.2^{z}right)=1, hence t-2^{z}=1 and t+2^{z}=3^{y}, so we have 2^{z+1}+1=3^{y}.For z=1 we have 5=3^{y} which clearly have no solution. For z geq 2 we have (modulo 4) that y is even. Let y=2 k. Then 2^{z+1}=left(3^{k}-1right)left(3^{k}+1right) which is possible only when 3^{k}-1=2, i.e. k=1, y=2, which implies that t=5. So the pair (4,2) is a solution to our problem. Case 2. If y is even, then there exists a positive integer w such that y=2 w, andleft(t-3^{w}right)left(t+3^{w}right)=2^{x}Since t+3^{w}-left(t-3^{w}right)=2 cdot 3^{w}, we have operatorname{gcd}left(t-2^{z}, t+2^{z}right) mid 2 cdot 3^{w}, which means that g c d(t- left.3^{w}, t+3^{w}right)=2. Hence t-3^{w}=2 and t+3^{w}=2^{x-1}. So we have2 cdot 3^{w}+2=2^{x-1} Rightarrow 3^{w}+1=2^{x-2}Here we see modulo 3 that x-2 is even. Let x-2=2 m, then 3^{w}=left(2^{m}-1right)left(2^{m}+1right), whence m=1 since operatorname{gcd}left(2^{m}-1,2^{m}+1right)=1. So we arrive again to the solution (4,2).Case 3. Let x and y be odd. For x geq 3 we have 2^{x}+3^{y} equiv 3(bmod 4) while t^{2} equiv 0,1(bmod 4), a contradiction. For x=1 we have 2+3^{y}=t^{2}. For y geq 2 we have 2+3^{y} equiv 2(bmod 9) while t^{2} equiv 0,1,4,7(bmod 9). For y=1 we have 5=2+3=t^{2} clearly this doesn't have solution. Note.

Find the envelope of the trajectories of a material point thrown from the origin with a velocity v_{0} in a fixed vertical plane. The curve from problem 38.6 is called the safety parabola.","solution":"38.6. Let's direct the O y axis vertically upwards, and the O x axis along the horizontal component of the velocity v_{0}. Then at time t, the material point has coordinates x(t)=v_{0} cos alpha cdot t, y(t)=v_{0} sin alpha cdot t-frac{g t^{2}}{2}, where alpha is the angle at which it was launched. For example, if the point is launched vertically upwards, then y(t)=v_{0} t-frac{g t^{2}}{2}, so y(t) is maximal at t=frac{v_{0}}{g} and at this time y(t)=frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}. If we assume that the envelope is a parabola, then it should be given by the equation y=frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}-k x^{2}. To find k, we will calculate the greatest possible coordinate of the intersection of the trajectory with the O x axis (the greatest range of the shot). If yleft(t_{0}right)=0 and t_{0} neq 0, then t_{0}=frac{2 v_{0} sin alpha}{g}. At this time, xleft(t_{0}right)=frac{2 v_{0}^{2} sin alpha cos alpha}{g}=frac{v_{0}^{2} sin 2 alpha}{g}. Therefore, the greatest range of the shot is frac{v_{0}^{2}}{g}. Accordingly, for k we get the equation y=frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}-kleft(frac{v_{0}^{2}}{g}right)^{2}=0, from which we find k=frac{g}{2 v_{0}^{2}}.Now let's prove that the parabola y=frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}-frac{g}{2 v_{0}^{2}} x^{2} is indeed the envelope of the considered family of trajectories. For this, it is sufficient to prove that any trajectory lies below this parabola and has one common point with it, i.e., for all t the inequalityfrac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}-frac{g cos ^{2} alpha}{2} t^{2} geqslant v_{0} sin alpha cdot t-frac{g t^{2}}{2}holds, and for some t it turns into an equality.

After each collision, the magnitude of the velocity of the bead with mass m_{2} decreases.

This means ( m ) can be written as ( m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} ), where ( a_i ) are the digits of ( m ).2. We need to find the sum of all the digits of the product ( (10^n - 1)m ), where ( d leq n ).3. First, consider the expression ( 10^n - 1 ). This is a number consisting of ( n ) digits, all of which are 9. For example, if ( n = 3 ), then ( 10^3 - 1 = 999 ).4. Now, multiply ( m ) by ( 10^n - 1 ):   [   (10^n - 1)m = (10^n - 1) cdot m   ]5. Expanding the product, we get:   [   (10^n - 1)m = 10^n cdot m - m   ]6. Let ( m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} ). Then:   [   10^n cdot m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} cdot 10^n   ]   This shifts the digits of ( m ) to the left by ( n ) places, adding ( n ) zeros at the end.7. Subtracting ( m ) from this, we get:   [   (10^n cdot m) - m = overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d} cdot 10^n - overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d}   ]8. This can be written as:   [   overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d000 ldots 0} - overline{a_1a_2 ldots a_d}   ]9. When we perform this subtraction, the result is a number where each digit of ( m ) is subtracted from 9, and there are ( n - d ) nines in the middle. For example, if ( m = 123 ) and ( n = 5 ), then:   [   (10^5 - 1) cdot 123 = 99999 cdot 123 = 12300000 - 123 = 12299877   ]10. The sum of the digits of this result can be broken down into three parts:    - The sum of the digits of ( m ) subtracted from 9.    - The ( n - d ) nines in the middle.    - The sum of the digits of ( m ).11. For each digit ( a_i ) of ( m ), the corresponding digit in ( 999 ldots 9 - m ) is ( 9 - a_i ). Therefore, the sum of these digits is:    [    sum_{i=1}^d (9 - a_i)    ]12. The ( n - d ) nines in the middle contribute:    [    9(n - d)    ]13. Adding these together, we get the total sum of the digits:    [    sum_{i=1}^d (9 - a_i) + 9(n - d) + sum_{i=1}^d a_i    ]14. Simplifying, we get:    [    9d - sum_{i=1}^d a_i + 9(n - d) + sum_{i=1}^d a_i = 9d - sum_{i=1}^d a_i + 9n - 9d + sum_{i=1}^d a_i = 9n    ]15.

Using the First Given Condition: From a_{1} + a_{5} + a_{9} = 6, we can express a_{5} and a_{9} in terms of a_{1} and d:   [   a_{1} + (a_{1} + 4d) + (a_{1} + 8d) = 6   ]   Simplifying, we find that a_{5} = a_{1} + 4d = 2.4. Using the Second Given Condition: From S_{11} = -11, we know that the sum of the first 11 terms is:   [   frac{11(a_{1} + a_{11})}{2} = -11   ]   Since a_{11} = a_{1} + 10d, we can substitute and find that 11a_{6} = -11, which gives us a_{6} = -1.5. Determining the Common Difference: Knowing a_{5} = 2 and a_{6} = -1, we can calculate the common difference d:   [   d = a_{6} - a_{5} = -1 - 2 = -3   ]6. Conclusion on the Maximum Value of S_{n}: Since d  5. Therefore, S_{n} reaches its maximum value when n = 5.7.

Intersection with the y-axis: Setting x=0 in the given quadratic function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + b, we find the intersection point with the y-axis to be (0, b).2. Determining the Discriminant (Delta): For the quadratic equation x^2 + 2x + b = 0 to have real roots (i.e., for the graph to intersect the x-axis at two points), the discriminant Delta must be greater than 0. The discriminant is given by Delta = B^2 - 4AC, where A=1, B=2, and C=b. Thus, Delta = 4 - 4b.3. Condition for Delta: For Delta > 0, we have 4 - 4b > 0. Solving this inequality gives b < 1. Additionally, since the graph intersects the y-axis at (0, b) and not the origin, b neq 0.4. Conclusion for Part (1): The range of real number b is all real numbers less than 1 but not including 0. Formally, this is written as boxed{{b | b < 1 text{ and } b neq 0}}.# Part (2): Fixed Point of Circle C1. General Equation of Circle C: The general equation for a circle in the plane is x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Given that circle C passes through the intersection points of the quadratic function and the coordinate axes, we can relate this general equation to the given function.2. Relation to Quadratic Function: Setting y=0 in the circle's equation gives x^2 + Dx + F = 0. Since this must match the quadratic equation x^2 + 2x + b = 0, we can equate coefficients to find D = 2 and F = b.3. Finding E: Setting x=0 in the circle's equation gives y^2 + Ey + F = 0. Knowing one root is b, we substitute y=b into the equation to find E = -b - 1.4. Equation of Circle C: Substituting the values of D, E, and F back into the general equation of the circle, we get the specific equation for circle C: x^2 + y^2 + 2x - (b + 1)y + b = 0, for b < 1 and b neq 0.5. Fixed Points: Rewriting the equation of circle C as x^2 + y^2 + 2x - y - b(y - 1) = 0 and setting y=1, we solve the system:   - x^2 + y^2 + 2x - y = 0   - y = 1      This leads to two solutions: (x, y) = (0, 1) and (x, y) = (-2, 1).6.

How large can  |textbf{P}| be?","solution":"1. Base Case: ( n = 1 )   For ( n = 1 ), the set ( S ) has ( p^1 = p ) elements. The only partition of ( S ) into nonempty parts of sizes divisible by ( p ) is the set itself. Thus, there is exactly one partition, and ( |textbf{P}| = 1 ).2. Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( n = k )   Assume that for a set ( S ) of cardinality ( p^k ), the maximum number of partitions ( |textbf{P}| ) is ( frac{p^k - 1}{p - 1} ).3. Inductive Step: Prove the statement for ( n = k + 1 )   Consider a set ( S ) of cardinality ( p^{k+1} ). Number the elements of ( S ) from ( 0 ) to ( p^{k+1} - 1 ). Let the first partition ( P_1 ) be:   [   {0, 1, dots, p-1}, {p, p+1, dots, 2p-1}, dots, {p^{k+1} - p, p^{k+1} - p + 1, dots, p^{k+1} - 1}   ]   This partition divides ( S ) into ( p^k ) parts, each of size ( p ).4. Constructing New Partitions:   For each residue ( i pmod{p} ), define a new partition by taking the integer ( equiv k + (m-1)i pmod{p} ) from the ( m )-th part of ( P_1 ). Collect these integers over all ( m ) and put them into one part. This process generates ( p ) new partitions for each partition of the ( p^k ) parts.5. Applying the Inductive Hypothesis:   Consider the ( p^k ) parts as a new set of cardinality ( p^k ). By the inductive hypothesis, there is a family of partitions of these ( p^k ) parts into groups of ( p ) parts, with size ( frac{p^k - 1}{p - 1} ), where any two groups that occur in any of the partitions can only share at most one part in common.6. Combining Partitions:   For each of these partitions of the ( p^k ) parts, we can generate ( p ) partitions of the original set ( S ) using the same argument as the ( n = 2 ) case on each group of ( p ) parts. Therefore, the total number of partitions is:   [   1 + frac{p(p^k - 1)}{p - 1} = frac{p^{k+1} - 1}{p - 1}   ]7. Conclusion:   By induction, the maximum number of partitions ( |textbf{P}| ) for a set ( S ) of cardinality ( p^n ) is ( frac{p^n - 1}{p - 1} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is (boxed{frac{p^n - 1}{p - 1}})."},{"problem":"If circle O: x^2+y^2=4 and circle C: x^2+y^2+4x-4y+4=0 are symmetric with respect to line l, then the equation of line l is.","solution":"Since the centers of the two circles are O(0, 0) and C(-2, 2) respectively, according to the problem, line l is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the centers of the two circles.The midpoint of CO is (-1, 1), and the slope of CO is -1, hence the slope of line l is 1.

Substituting these into the equation, we get y_2 = 6x_2 and y_1 = 6x_1. Since x_2 > x_1, it follows that y_2 > y_1. This means that as x increases, y also increases. Therefore, option A does not meet the requirement.- Option B: For y=-6x, using the same approach with x_1 and x_2 where x_2 > x_1, we substitute these into the equation to get y_2 = -6x_2 and y_1 = -6x_1. Since x_2 > x_1, it follows that y_2 < y_1. This indicates that as x increases, y decreases. Therefore, option B meets the requirement.- Option C: For y=frac{6}{x}, as x increases, the value of frac{6}{x} decreases because the denominator of the fraction is getting larger, making the overall value smaller. However, this behavior is consistent across all quadrants where x is positive or negative, and thus, it does not uniquely meet the requirement as it is not decreasing in every quadrant due to the positive slope in negative x values.- Option D: For y=-frac{6}{x}, as x increases, the value of -frac{6}{x} increases in the sense that it becomes less negative (moves towards zero from the negative side) for positive x and decreases for negative x. This does not meet the requirement as specified because the question asks for a decrease as x increases in a straightforward manner.Given the analysis above, the function where the value of y decreases as x increases is found in Option B.

Given Conditions and Setup:   - Points ( M ) and ( N ) are chosen inside triangle ( ABC ) such that:     [     angle BAM = angle CAN, quad angle ABM = angle CBN     ]   - The product conditions are:     [     AM cdot AN cdot BC = BM cdot BN cdot CA = CM cdot CN cdot AB = k     ]     for some real ( k ).2. Using the Given Product Conditions:   - We have:     [     AM cdot AN cdot BC = k, quad BM cdot BN cdot CA = k, quad CM cdot CN cdot AB = k     ]3. Summing the Products:   - Adding these three equalities, we get:     [     AM cdot AN cdot BC + BM cdot BN cdot CA + CM cdot CN cdot AB = 3k     ]4.

For which n in the range 1, 2, ... , 10 is the integral from 0 to 2π of f n (x) non-zero? Solution","solution":": 3, 4, 7, 8. Note first that since cos x = cos(2π - x), the integral is twice the integral over 0 to π, so it is sufficient to consider the smaller range. cos(nπ/2 - x) = (-1) n cos(nπ/2 + x). So cos(nπ/2 - x)) = cos(nπ/2 + x) for n even, and - cos(nπ/2 + x) for n odd. Hence for n = 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, f n (π/2 - x) = - f n (π/2 + x) and so the integral over 0 to π is zero. It remains to consider the cases n = 3, 4, 7, 8. I cannot see a neat way of proving them non-zero. What follows is an inelegant proof using cos a cos b = (cos(a+b) + cos(a-b) )/2 repeatedly. So cos x cos 3x = 1/2 cos 4x + 1/2 cos 2x. So f 3 (x) = 1/2 cos 2 2x + 1/2 cos 2x cos 4x = 1/2 cos 2 2x + 1/4 cos 2x + 1/4 cos 6x. The integral of the first term is positive and the integrals of the second and third terms are zero. So f 3 has non-zero integral. Similarly, f 4 (x) = (cos x cos 2x) (cos 3x cos 4x) = 1/4 (cos x + cos 3x)(cos x + cos 7x) = 1/4 cos 2 x + 1/8 (cos 2x + cos 4x + cos 6x + cos 8x + cos 4x + cos 10x). All terms except the first integrate to zero and the first has a non-zero integral. Hence f 4 has non-zero integral. Similarly, f 7 (x) = cos x (cos 2x cos 3x) (cos 4x cos 5x) (cos 6x cos 7x) = 1/8 cos x (cos x + cos 5x)(cos x + cos 9x)(cos x + cos 13x) = 1/8 cos x( cos 2 x + cos x cos 5x + cos x cos 9x + cos 5x cos 9x)(cos x + cos 13x) = 1/16 cos x (1 + cos 2x + cos 4x + cos 6x + cos 8x + cos 10x + cos 4x + cos 14x)(cos x + cos 13x) = 1/32 cos x (cos x + cos x + cos 3x + 2cos 3x + 2cos 5x + cos 5x + cos 7x + cos 7x + cos 9x + cos 9x + cos 11x + cos 13x + cos 15x + cos 11x + cos 15x + 2 cos 9x + 2 cos 17x + cos 7x + cos 19x + cos 5x + cos 21x + cos 3x + cos 23x + cos x + cos 27x) = 1/32 ( 3cos 2 x + other terms), where the other terms all have the form cos ax cox bx with a and b unequal and hence integrate to zero. So f 7 has non-zero integral. Finally, f 8 (x) = 1/16 (cos x + cos 3x)(cos x + cos 7x)(cos x + cos 11x)(cos x + cos 15x) = 1/32 (1 + 2 cos2x + 2cos 4x + cos 6x + cos 8x + cos 10x)(cos x + cos 11x)(cos x + cos 15x) = (4 cos x + 5 cos 3x + 4 cos 5x + 4 cos 7x + 4 cos 9x + 2 cos 11x + 2 cos 13x + 2 cos 15x + cos 17x + cos 19x + cos 21x)(cos x + cos 15x) = 1/64 (6 + other terms). So f 8 has non-zero integral. A neater approach is due to Xiannan Li First establish by induction that the sum over all 2 n terms cos(+-A+-B+-C + ... ), where we take every possible sign combination, is just 2 n cos A cos B ... .Now observe that the integral of cos mx is zero if m is non-zero and 2π if m is zero. Thus the integral given is non-zero iff there is some sign combination for which 1 +- 2 +- 3 +- ... +- n = 0. If n = 4k, we have (1 + 4k) - (2 + 4k-1) + ... - (2k + 2k+1) = 0. If n = 4k+3, we have (1 - 2 + 3) + (4 + 4k+3) - (5 + 4k+2) + ... - (2k+1 + 2k+2) = 0. If n = 1 or 2 mod 4, then 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 is odd, so there cannot be a sign combination. Thus the integral is non-zero iff n = 0 or 3 mod 4. 46th Putnam 1985 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 7 Jan 2001 Last updated 4 Aug 03"},{"problem":"(3) Let x, y, z in [0,1], then the maximum value of M=sqrt{|x-y|}+sqrt{|y-z|}+ sqrt{|z-x|} is qquad","solution":"(3) sqrt{2}+1 Hint: Let 0 leqslant x leqslant y leqslant z leqslant 1, then M=sqrt{y-x}+ sqrt{z-y}+sqrt{z-x}.Sincebegin{aligned}sqrt{y-x}+sqrt{z-y} & leqslant sqrt{2[(y-x)+(z-y)]} & =sqrt{2(z-x)},end{aligned}we have M leqslant sqrt{2(z-x)}+sqrt{z-x}=(sqrt{2}+1) sqrt{z-x} leqslant sqrt{2}+1.Equality holds if and only if y-x=z-y, x=0, z=1, i.e., x=0, y=frac{1}{2}, z=1.text { Hence } M_{max }=sqrt{2}+1 text {. }"},{"problem":"For positive integers n, let s(n) be the sum of the digits of n. Over all four-digit positive integers n, which value of n maximizes the ratio frac{s(n)}{n}?[i]Proposed by Michael Tang[/i]","solution":"1. Let ( n ) be a four-digit number, so ( 1000 leq n leq 9999 ).2. Let ( s(n) ) be the sum of the digits of ( n ). We want to maximize the ratio ( frac{s(n)}{n} ).3. Consider the effect of increasing ( s(n) ) by 1. This can be done by increasing one of the digits of ( n ) by 1, which increases ( n ) by 1, 10, 100, or 1000 depending on the position of the digit.4. We need to compare ( frac{s(n)+1}{n+a} ) with ( frac{s(n)}{n} ), where ( a ) is 1, 10, 100, or 1000.5. The inequality ( frac{s(n)+1}{n+a} > frac{s(n)}{n} ) simplifies to:   [   (s(n)+1)n > s(n)(n+a)   ]   [   s(n)n + n > s(n)n + s(n)a   ]   [   n > s(n)a   ]6. For ( a = 1 ), the inequality ( n > s(n) ) must hold. Since ( s(n) leq 36 ) (the maximum sum of digits for a four-digit number), this inequality is always true for four-digit numbers.7. For ( a = 10 ), the inequality ( n > 10s(n) ) must hold. This is not always true for four-digit numbers.8. For ( a = 100 ), the inequality ( n > 100s(n) ) must hold. This is not true for any four-digit number since ( s(n) geq 1 ) and ( n leq 9999 ).9. Therefore, the value of ( n ) that maximizes ( frac{s(n)}{n} ) must be no greater than ( 1000 + 100 = 1100 ).10. To find the exact value, we need to check the values of ( n ) close to 1000 and 1100. The sum of the digits of 1000 is 1, and the sum of the digits of 1099 is 19.11. Calculate the ratios:    [    frac{s(1000)}{1000} = frac{1}{1000} = 0.001    ]    [    frac{s(1099)}{1099} = frac{19}{1099} approx 0.0173    ]12.

Using given condition on f(x): Given that f'(x) + frac{2}{x}f(x) > 0, we can substitute this into our expression for g'(x):[g'(x) = x^2f'(x) + 2xf(x) = x^2left(f'(x) + frac{2}{x}f(x)right) > 0.]Thus, we see that g(x) is strictly increasing on the interval (0, +infty).3.

Analyzing varphi(x): Differentiating varphi(x) gives [varphi'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}.]Setting varphi'(x) = 0 yields x = e. This is a critical point. For x in (1, e), varphi'(x) > 0, indicating varphi(x) is increasing. For x in (e, +infty), varphi'(x) < 0, indicating varphi(x) is decreasing. Therefore, varphi(x) reaches its maximum at x = e, which gives varphi_{max} = frac{1}{e}.6.

Our task is to determine the limit of the sequence beta_{n}.First, we calculate the value of operatorname{tg} beta_{n}. We will show by complete induction that operatorname{tg} beta_{n}=1-frac{1}{n+1}. If n=1, then operatorname{tg} beta_{1}=operatorname{tg} alpha_{1}=frac{1}{2}. Suppose that n geq 2 and we have already proven the relation operatorname{tg} beta_{n-1}=1-frac{1}{n}. Then, based on the addition formula of the tangent function:begin{aligned}operatorname{tg} beta_{n} & =operatorname{tg}left(beta_{n-1}+alpha_{n}right)=frac{operatorname{tg} beta_{n-1}+operatorname{tg} alpha_{n}}{1-operatorname{tg} beta_{n-1} operatorname{tg} alpha_{n}}=frac{frac{n-1}{n}+frac{1}{2 n^{2}}}{1-frac{n-1}{n} cdot frac{1}{2 n^{2}}}=frac{frac{2 n^{2}-2 n+1}{2 n^{2}}}{frac{2 n^{3}-n+1}{2 n^{3}}}= & =frac{nleft(2 n^{2}-2 n+1right)}{(n+1)left(2 n^{2}-2 n+1right)}=1-frac{1}{n+1}end{aligned}Thus, for every positive integer n, operatorname{tg} beta_{n}=1-frac{1}{n+1}. We also know that 0<beta_{1}<frac{pi}{4}. If n geq 2 and 0<beta_{n-1}<frac{pi}{4}, then 0<beta_{n}=beta_{n-1}+alpha_{n}<frac{pi}{2} and since operatorname{tg} beta_{n}<1, it follows that 0<beta_{n}<frac{pi}{4}. Therefore, all elements of the sequence beta_{n} lie between 0 and frac{pi}{4}, and operatorname{tg} beta_{n} is strictly increasing and approaches 1.

Let's start by evaluating ( f(x) ) at ( x = 2 ) and ( x = -2 ):   [   f(2) = 2^3 - (k-3)2^2 - 11 cdot 2 + (4k-8) = 8 - 4(k-3) - 22 + 4k - 8   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   f(2) = 8 - 4k + 12 - 22 + 4k - 8 = -10   ]   [   f(-2) = (-2)^3 - (k-3)(-2)^2 - 11(-2) + (4k-8) = -8 - 4(k-3) + 22 + 4k - 8   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   f(-2) = -8 - 4k + 12 + 22 + 4k - 8 = 18   ]3. Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem:   Since ( f(2) = -10 ) and ( f(-2) = 18 ), and the polynomial is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between ( -2 ) and ( 2 ). Since we are looking for integer roots, we need to check the values ( -1, 0, 1 ).4. Check integer roots ( -1, 0, 1 ):   [   f(-1) = (-1)^3 - (k-3)(-1)^2 - 11(-1) + (4k-8) = -1 - (k-3) + 11 + 4k - 8   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   f(-1) = -1 - k + 3 + 11 + 4k - 8 = 3k + 5   ]   Setting ( f(-1) = 0 ):   [   3k + 5 = 0 implies k = -frac{5}{3}   ]   Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( k = -frac{5}{3} ) is not valid.   [   f(0) = 0^3 - (k-3)0^2 - 11 cdot 0 + (4k-8) = 4k - 8   ]   Setting ( f(0) = 0 ):   [   4k - 8 = 0 implies k = 2   ]   [   f(1) = 1^3 - (k-3)1^2 - 11 cdot 1 + (4k-8) = 1 - (k-3) - 11 + 4k - 8   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   f(1) = 1 - k + 3 - 11 + 4k - 8 = 3k - 15   ]   Setting ( f(1) = 0 ):   [   3k - 15 = 0 implies k = 5   ]5. Verify the roots for ( k = 5 ):   For ( k = 5 ):   [   f(x) = x^3 - (5-3)x^2 - 11x + (4 cdot 5 - 8) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 11x + 12   ]   We need to check if this polynomial has integer roots. Using the Rational Root Theorem, the potential roots are ( pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, pm 4, pm 6, pm 12 ).   Checking ( x = 1 ):   [   f(1) = 1^3 - 2 cdot 1^2 - 11 cdot 1 + 12 = 1 - 2 - 11 + 12 = 0   ]   So, ( x = 1 ) is a root. We can factor ( f(x) ) as:   [   f(x) = (x-1)(x^2 - x - 12)   ]   Solving ( x^2 - x - 12 = 0 ):   [   x^2 - x - 12 = (x-4)(x+3)   ]   So, the roots are ( x = 1, 4, -3 ), which are all integers.The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 5 } )"},{"problem":"## Task ConditionFind the point M^{prime} symmetric to the point M with respect to the line.begin{aligned}& M(-1 ; 0 ;-1) & frac{x}{-1}=frac{y-1.5}{0}=frac{z-2}{1}end{aligned}","solution":"## SolutionFind the equation of the plane that is perpendicular to the given line and passes through the point M.

We will prove that non-adjacent strings of length n are in one-to-one correspondence with strings of zeros and ones of length n-1. From this, it will follow that there are 2^{n-1} such strings.Take an arbitrary number k that is not in the first position, and draw arrows from it to the numbers k-1 and k+1 that are to its left. From all numbers except the first, at least one arrow goes out, so there are at least n-1 arrows. On the other hand, no number except the first can have two arrows entering it. If the first number is 1 or n, then no more than one arrow can enter it. In 1 and n, which are not in the first position, no arrows can enter. Thus, there are no more than n-1 arrows. Therefore, there are exactly n-1 arrows. From this, it follows that the entire directed graph is the union of two chains (one of which can have zero length), converging to the first number. In one of the chains, the numbers are always decreasing and it has the form n rightarrow n-1 rightarrow ldots, and in the other, they are increasing and it has the form 1 rightarrow 2 rightarrow ldots Replace each number except the first with one if it belongs to the first chain, and with zero otherwise.

Let's break down the solution step by step.1. Understanding the Parabola and Its Elements: The parabola {C}_{1}:{y}^{2}=2x has its focus F and a directrix l. For any point P on the parabola and a corresponding point Q on the directrix such that PQ is parallel to the x-axis, the property |PQ| = |PF| holds due to the definition of a parabola.2. Given Condition: It is given that |PQ| = |QF|. This implies that the distance from P to Q is equal to the distance from Q to F.3. Determining the Shape of triangle PQF: Given |PQ| = |QF|, and knowing from the parabola's property that |PQ| = |PF|, we can conclude that all sides of triangle PQF are equal. Therefore, triangle PQF is an equilateral triangle.4. Analyzing the Relationship Between |PF| and |PQ|: Since PQ parallel x-axis, and we know that triangle PQF is equilateral, the lengths of the sides of the triangle are equal. Thus, |PF| = |PQ|.5. Calculating |PF|: The focus of the parabola {C}_{1}:{y}^{2}=2x is at (frac{1}{4}, 0), which means the distance from the vertex O (origin) to the focus F is frac{1}{4}. Since triangle PQF is equilateral and PQ parallel x-axis, the length of |PF| is four times the distance from O to F, which is 4 times frac{1}{4} = 1. However, considering the equilateral triangle's properties and the given parabola, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation of |PF| based on the standard solution provided. The correct approach should involve using the properties of an equilateral triangle and the specific parabola equation to find the exact length of |PF|. Given the conditions, the calculation provided in the standard solution does not accurately reflect the steps needed to find |PF|. Instead, the focus on determining |PF| should directly relate to the geometric properties and the given equation of the parabola.Given the discrepancy in the explanation and calculation, and adhering strictly to the provided solution without introducing new ideas, the final answer, according to the standard solution, is marked as:boxed{A}However, it's important to note that the explanation provided in the standard solution regarding the calculation of |PF| does not align with the typical geometric and algebraic analysis expected for such a problem.

If the numbers are arranged as shown in the table - first fill the first k columns, row by row, with numbers from 1 to k n, and then fill the remaining n-k columns with the remaining numbers (in any order, as long as the condition of increasing numbers in each row is satisfied) - then the sum of the numbers in the k-th column will be equal to 1 / 2 k n(n+1).begin{array}{|rrrr|r|rr|}hline 1 & 2 & cdots & k-1 & k k+1 & k+2 & cdots & 2 k-1 & 2 k & & 2 k+1 & 2 k+2 & cdots & 3 k-1 & 3 k & & cdots & cdots & cdots & cdots & & (n-1) k+1 & ldots & cdots & n k-1 & n k & ldots & n^{2} hlineend{array}Estimate.

Clearly, this is a one-to-one transformation of the set of tables of numbers 1,2, ldots, n^{2} that satisfy the condition of the problem. Under this transformation, each number in the k-th column of the new table A^{prime} is equal to the number in the same row and in the (n+1-k)-th column of the old table A; therefore, the sum of the numbers in the k-th column of the table A^{prime} is nleft(n^{2}+1right)-S, where S is the sum of the numbers in the (n+1-k)-th column of A.

Note that y cannot be divisible by x, otherwise the least common multiple of x and y would be y, which is less than 1+2x+3y. In particular, x>1.Next, the least common multiple of x and y is divisible by x and y, so 1+2x+3y is divisible by x and y, which means 1+2x is divisible by y and 1+3y is divisible by x. From the divisibility of 1+2x by y, it follows that 1+2x=ky geq y, which together with the assumption x leq y implies k=1, y=2x+1. Then, from the divisibility of 1+3y=6x+4 by x and x>1, it follows that 4 is divisible by x and the possibilities are x=2,4. Checking shows that the solution in this case is x=4, y=9.Now consider the case x geq y>1. From the divisibility of 1+3y leq 1+3(x-1)=3x-2 by x, it follows that 1+3y=x or 1+3y=2x.
