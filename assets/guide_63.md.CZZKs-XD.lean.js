As in your case, only a few fractures like scaphoid bone fractures of the wrist may not show at the time of injury but maximum fractures are easy to diagnose. As you have a brittle bone disease it is better to go for CT SCAN to diagnose the fracture without wasting time. And of course splintage is a must and for a longer duration in your case than a person without brittle bone disease. Take anti-inflammatory analgesics, calcium, vitamin D supplements and get the CT SCAN done. and for arm and shoulder use ice packs. Hope I have answered your query.

In this case, there may be a previous history of high blood pressure or angina or high cholesterol.There is sometimes a history of shortness of breath as well(3)liver or kidney disease can also cause this complication(4)varicose veins- dilated veins in the legs can cause swelling. If these are present and there are no indicators of any of the above, then this is a possible cause.It would be best for him to be assessed. If there are no heart symptoms, no history of kidney or liver disease, the assessment does not need to be as an emergency but should be done.It would require physical examination and blood tests.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, Dr. Need your consult about swelling of the leg .

You may add over the counter fiber supplement like Metamucil to your daily diet to prevent constipation.

Renerve plus is a product containing some vitamins and minerals. Vitamins and minerals have no place in the treatment of disc problem. Some of the components may help a little in decreasing numbness and tingling sensation. For low back pain, the two most important medications are 1- Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen (Advil) or Diclofenac sodium (Voltaren) and 2- a muscle relaxing agent such as Baclofen or Tizanidine (Sirdalud). You should take the medication for 3-5 days, along with a relative rest. If the pain reduced significantly then you should refer for exercise training (especially back and abdomen) which is the most important treatment to prevent recurrence of low back pain. If pain did not reduce with medication, physiotherapy might be needed.  In some cases, spinal manipulation performed by a physiatrist or chiropractor could help. Hope I have answered your query.

I would also like to know is only on my toe or will it be all over my body?","Doctor":"Hi, (Actually, the proper spelling is Rheumatism, not romatism). Rheumatism is not a single disease, it is a group of disorders that cause inflammation in joints, muscles and/or other soft tissues. There are several diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, SLE, Scleroderma, Psoriasis, Gout, etc. and all of them are a kind of Rheumatism. Overall, the diagnosis of a Rheumatic disease is based on your history, examination and lab tests. You should only refer to an Internist or a Rheumatologist for proper diagnosis. Some Rheumatic disorders only involve one joint and some others involve other joints and even other parts of the body such as kidney, heart, etc. The major treatment for these disorders are the drugs that reduce inflammation in the joints. Although other treatments also exist. In most cases, rheumatic diseases cannot be totally cured, but with the help of proper medication the pain and other problems will go away and the disease will be off for a long time. I suggest that if the doctor that you saw was not an Internal Medicine specialist or a Rheumatologist, you refer to another doctor to be sure that your problem is rheumatologic.

He was followed by CT scans for a couple of years but not for the last 3 as nothing had changed previously. Last year at the age of 12 he lost a signficant amount of weight (18 lbs) but had started Citalopram 10 mg just prior and they felt it to be related to that until blood tests showed him to be neutropenic. We were also told IF it was the med things would level off and weight would return. Well they havent and since that time appetite has been decreased more so than previously, gets chilled easily (teeth chatter) will occ have a fever of 100-102 which lasts only a few hours and returns to normal. We have checked blood sugars as well and noted him to have a few minimally low blood glucose readings 72 to 68 at the lowest, he develops hives all over his body which seem to just occur randomly and sometimes take days to clear even with benadryl. We took him to MD for eval. She suspected anemia and possibly a virus causing the hives and said it would pass. She did blood tests only to appease us however Ferritin came back oddly high at 312 along with elevated CRP and neutropenia again. We questioned liver involvement and she didn t agree, we went to another MD as more symptoms had developed of joint pains who felt a referral to GI should be done and ordered additional blood tests which showed again elevated CRP, ALT, AST and Ferritin 278 and again is noted to be neutropenic. Mono tests were negative as was RA and Lupus. We continue to wait to get in to see the specialist and in the meantime he has developed cramping in arms, legs and abdomen (all over not just the right side) continues with chills, has worsening fatigue, tips of fingers were cold and blue for a few hours on two occasions now and then return to normal, feels dizzy at times. What could this be? Does this sound like hemochromatosis which the doctors seem to know nothing about or is something else being missed?","Doctor":"Hello, Consult a rheumatologist and get evaluated.

The next morning, I was sore in the chest area, but did not really think much of it, and attributed that sore-ness to my punches during the class. I went to ikea and lifted a 14kg item to the car (*I am female, 5 1 & 60kg, mid-late 20 s), as it wasn t very too far, about 200-250m. That night, I went salsa dancing, and the soreness got worse, but there wasn t any pain. The next morning, I woke up to an extreme pain down the side of my left shoulder blade, and it seemed to continue under my underarm in a somewhat linear form....to just above my left breast; the surrounding area was very sore. Sitting up, bending down, even walking, was painful.... breathing was a little bit painful, but only deep breath s really hurt. Sneezing, couging and laughing was extremely painful! The day after that (day 3) was the worst- pain worsened, and the whole area was very sore as well, along with the pain. The soreness started leaving/lifting from the 4th day, and the pain as well started lifting but a lot slower. Its now just over two weeks from the fall/ikea trip, and I still feel a sharp pain in my left chest, a spot above my left boob, whenever I sneeze, but not at any other time. There is a slight pain/discomfort on one small portion (2-3 inches) of my left shoulder blade- like a soreness- tight muscle ache, more than a pain. Sorry for the long introduction, but would you have any idea what could be wrong, and how long it would take for me to heal, as well as, when is it safe for me to continue my kickboxing classes? If I should I consult a physio/chiro/doctor- which would be best? Thanks so much for taking the time to read this!

A few years ago she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. This past year she began feeling pain in her neck and shoulder and was told it was spinal stenosis. She has successfully used Prostigmine for years to help with her muscle weakness, however it become unavailable this past summer so she switched to Mestinon for 6 months. She did not do very well on the Mestinon. Her muscles were weak and she was not as mentally sharp as she normally is – I kept thinking her sodium was low. During the 6 months she was on the Mestinon she fell out of her wheel chair and hit her head on the bathroom sink giving her mild subdural hematoma. An MRI was done and everything looked ok. After all this her neck dropped forward. Over about a 3 month period her head dropped and is causing her pain and discomfort and making eating and swallowing difficult due to the forward position of her neck. Her facial muscles are not weak. Her neurologist performed an EMG and there was evidence of mild exacerbation of MG symptoms. Meanwhile we found some Prostigmine and switched her from Mestinon back to Prostigmin. Her mind clarity improved immediately and her muscle strength improved enough so that she is again able to transfer herself from chair to wheelchair, but her head is still dropped. She tried IVIG treatment but that did not help. She’s considering plasma apheresis which helped her about 30 years ago during a difficult MG period.

I got up and came downstairs, I was just making a drink when I felt like I was going to faint - I fainted as a child a lot, but this was different, in the past when I fainted, I would come round and then eventually been able to get back up again and continue my day. This time before I fainted I had intensely loud ringing and buzzing in my ears, I managed to make it to the sofa, but I fainted as soon as I layed down. I came round - but only semi-awake, I managed to put my legs on cushions above my head, but over the next 15-30 minutes I broke out in a drenching hot-cold sweats and after that I fainted again, maybe another 1 or 2 times - whilst still laying down. After about 30 minutes I suddenly need to go to the toilet, but I was still unwell and could not get off the sofa for quite a while, but the need to go was intense. Eventually I managed to crawl upstairs to the toilet and went to the loo - there was a lot of stool - normal - no diarrhoea, but I still felt unwell.

The origin can be the muscles (in most cases), tendons, joint capsules or the joints themselves. As you mention that you cannot walk without assistance, the damage is significant. Please check the area and see if there are any bruises, swelling or local warmness/redness. If there are, you should refer to an orthopedist or ER to have x-rays and a detailed exam. -If you do not detect any of the above things, and it is less than 48 hours since the symptoms, you can use ice massage every 3-4 hours for 5 minutes. Do not apply the ice directly on the area, rap the ice in something and use its cooling effect indirectly. In the first step and the first 2-3 days, use acetaminophen to reduce pain. You can add other medication such as ibuprofen or diclofenac and change ice massage to hot massage after the 3rd day.

Recently, I ve been experiencing a mild pain on the site and upon deep palpation I felt a marble size cyst like in the injured part. What is this and why is it painful?","Doctor":"Hi, You mentioned a rather severe trauma to the left thigh at upper thigh. A dull pain and cystic like sensation in deep palpation is suggestive of a hematoma or a post-traumatic cyst formation within the deep muscles. In some cases a partial muscle rupture does not heal completely and the pain persists for quite a long time. What is especially important in your case in which area of the upper thigh is traumatized? this is important because there are important nerves at medial and posterior parts of the upper thigh but not very remarkable ones at anterior and lateral sides. Overall, I suggest that first you take a sonography of the soft tissue at the trauma site. The result of the sonography will guide the physician for their next steps towards you complete improvement. Meanwhile, one of the helpful things that you can do is a regular stretching of the traumatized muscles (at least 10 times a day, each time 15-20 seconds of stretch, best to be done after a warm up).

Did they took an X-ray? It was necessary. If not you have to refer back and have them a second look. If there is a significant local tenderness, possibility of a fractured bone exists and they should order an X-ray. If a fracture is already ruled out, he should have relative rest, with limitation of walking and even limitation of weight bearing during walking. Also, he can use a few days of a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drug such as Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, etc... Another method that can be used (if no fracture exists) is gentle massage of the foot in warm water with a very small amount of salt dissolved within it. Assuming that there is no fracture, the problem should be resolved in 7-10 days.

Is there any medicine for this.","Doctor":"Hi, Swollen ankles and swollen feet are common and usually not cause for concern, particularly if you have been standing or walking a lot. But feet and ankles that stay swollen or are accompanied by other symptoms could signal a serious health problem. Well, if you don't recall injury then swelling of the ankles and feet is often an early symptom of venous insufficiency, a condition in which blood inadequately moves up the veins from the legs and feet up to the heart. Normally, the veins keep blood flowing upward with one-way valves. When these valves become damaged or weakened, the blood leaks back down the vessels and fluid is retained in the soft tissue of the lower legs, especially the ankles and feet. Chronic venous insufficiency can lead to skin changes, skin ulcers, and infection. You should treat this with elastic stockings, keeping the leg elevated and in severe cases you should see a vascular surgeon for further treatment. Hope I have answered your query.

The diagnosis of gout is made by its typical clinical history and the analysis of joint fluid that is inflamed. So if your joint was aspirated the test is more important for the diagnosis of gout.

Will try sleeping again with stockings removed. I am also on a CPAP maching. Have not been gettinc adequate sleep lately. Going for sleep therapy session(s)starting this Friday at Henry Ford Hospital in West Bloomfield Michigan. Should I be concerned? Are there are other possible problems which may have excasperated the problem? Thank you. PS, my BP is averaging about 140/75, pulse stable at about 55bpm.. HDL AND LDL are under control with meds.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. One of the reasons for swelling in the legs may be due to your hypertension medications especially if you are taking calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine or Nifedipine. Talk to your doctor and see if the medications have to be changed. Consult your cardiologist and get your heart checked with ECG, ECHO, TMT etc. Get blood tests done. See if your kidney is working well with renal function tests like- urea, creatinine. Seek emergency medical care if you have leg swelling and any of the following signs or symptoms, which may indicate a blood clot in your lungs or a serious heart condition: i. Chest pain ii. Difficulty breathing iii. Shortness of breath with exertion or lying flat in bed iv. Fainting or dizziness v. Coughing blood Certain medical conditions can also result in a swollen ankle or leg. These include: i. being overweight ii. venous insufficiency, in which problems with valves of the veins prevents blood from flowing back to the heart iii. rheumatoid arthritis iv. blood clots in the leg v. heart failure vi. kidney failure vii. leg infection viii. liver failure ix. lymphedema, or swelling caused by a blockage in the lymphatic system x. previous surgery, such as pelvic, hip, knee, ankle, or foot surgery To treat a swollen ankle or leg at home, remember the acronym RICE: i. Rest. Stay off your ankle or leg until you can get to the doctor or until the swelling goes away. ii. Ice. Put ice on the swollen area as soon as you can for 15 to 20 minutes. Then repeat every three to four hours. iii. Compression. Wrap your ankle or leg snugly, but be sure not to cut off circulation. Support stockings may be an option. iv. Elevation. Raise your ankle or leg above your heart (or as far above your heart as possible). Two pillows will usually give you the correct elevation. This encourages fluid to move away from your leg.

Please provide these answers to any doctor that you seek his/her advice in the future. Overall, based on the provided information, a thigh pain referring to the bottom of the leg most commonly originates from a nerve, a muscle or joint. I summarize them here: 1- Nerve: It is possible that you have a disk protrusion at a low back area. Sometimes a protruded disk induces pressure to the adjacent nerve and causes thigh pain. In some cases there is no low back pain. Also, if the sciatic nerve is irritated by any cause, it causes the same problem (this is a rare cause). 2- muscle: a tight muscle area (Trigger Point) in some of the gluteal and thigh areas can cause posterior thigh pain with radiation to the leg. 3- Joint: There are small joint above and below any vertebral bone. We call them facet joint. If the facet joint of the L5 vertebra (the fifth vertebra) is irritated or damaged by any cause, it can cause thigh pain, which is sometimes not accompanied by a low back pain. In conclusion, if your problem is for only a few days you can take a 3-5 day course of an anti-inflammatory medication (such as Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, ...) and an anti-spasm medication (such as Baclofen), (certainly if you don't have any contraindication to use them. If you have the problem for more than 2 weeks you should be visited by a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation specialist, Orthopedist, or Rheumatologist for a more accurate diagnosis.

I have well controlled high BP and my colest. levels are great. I do have several Gall stones but they mostly do not bother me. I have had several kidney stones in the past. I am currently 61 years old. I have an arthritis doctor as well for treatment of drymouth and I have osteo arth. in most of my joints for which I take no meds. I have a ruptured disk and premature spinal stenosis which was diagnosed by a back doctor by MRI. The stenosis makes my legs very weak when walking any distance and I cling to a grocery kart with much desire. But I have one other pain which scares me as it is intense and severe though short lived when it occures. I have had it for years. It occures usually when I bend over or twist around (as when in a car seat). It happens at night sometimes when I sit up or roll. It is almost predictable but I am obsessively cautious when I move. It feels like an ice pick stabbing me or even a tearing sensation usually right at the diaphram level or at the very bottom of my rib cage. More often on the left side, sometimes on the right. More lately I have bee hit with these pains a little high between the ribs. Am I having muscles ripping apart? The pain sometimes feels like a charlie horse which I have experienced very rarely in my legs. The pain may last only 2 or 3 seconds or it may last 10 or 12, but either way it forces me to hold my breath and not move except to stretch my body upward. My doctor says only that it is likely something muscular-skeletal, but that is as far as I get with this. I am confused about this and wonder if my muscles are falling apart. Do I have multiple hernias?","Doctor":"Hello, Consult a pulmonologist and get evaluated. As a first line management you can take analgesics like paracetamol or aceclofenac for pain relief.

As you did not mention a history of direct trauma, I assume that these bruises have been developed by themselves. this problem is not related to Lyme, radicular low back pain, increased blood pressure and anemia. This is not a problem that you can ignore or treat by yourself. You should refer to an internal medicine specialist first to check for coagulation problems (disorders that increase the tendency to bleeding.) He/She will order some lab data such as PT, PTT, BT, CBC with Plt and may be Protein S an Protein C. Also, check your urine to see if its color is changed to orange or red.

Worst when at lower left rib area, towards side, around 3 rib up from bottom, but also moves to pectoral area (less stabbing) either directly above or below nipple area - am male, 38 in good general health, bp & heart ok","Doctor":"Hi, As you are in a good general health and you did not mention a history of trauma, this is almost certainly a benign and self-limiting problem. The most common cause of your problem is a local spasm or a trigger point in the muscles between the ribs (intercostal muscles). This is not a serious problem and usually resolves after 1-2 weeks or less. If the problem persists for more than 2 weeks, I advise to take a plain x-ray and look at the rib bones (most probably will not be necessary). Meanwhile, you can look for a possible source of the pain by palpating all the areas at lower rib region. If you found a tender spot, you can use local heat as well as gentle massaging (better with a relaxing gel such as Mineral Ice gel (or any gel that has Menthol in it)). Again, this could be self-limiting but it persists for more than 2 weeks a more detailed exam, as well as an X-ray, could be necessary. Hope I have answered your query.

My life is grand, full of love and happiness. However, about eight months ago, it was like the light s were just turned off on me -- massive fatigue set in, a significant loss in my ability to focus and concentrate, body aches, an occasionally racing heart. I d never had any problems like this before. I went to a doctor, who ran a series of blood tests, which revealed an elevated hematocrit -- not severely elevated, but well above normal. That yielded the diagnosis of polycythemia which, if you know anything about, is a condition almost always caused by something else. A CT scan of my abdomen revealed a 3-cm gallstone, a 2.7-cm hemangioma on my liver, but everything else looked good. My EKG was good. Everything else was normal. I m set to do a sleep study in a couple of weeks to rule out sleep apnea, a condition I am doubtful that I have. But I feel terrible almost all the time -- severe fatigue, tremendous difficulty concentrating and focusing (and, of course, getting my work done), body aches (especially in the left shoulder), etc. My doctor last week prescribed Vyvanse to help boost energy levels and focus, and that seems to help a little bit, but only a little bit. I m doing my very best to keep it all together for my sons, who have no idea I m feeling this way. In 1992, I had a congenital blockage removed from my right kidney, resulting in function of about 15% on that side. In 2010, I was diagnosed with Chrone’s Disease, but have had no problems – and taken no rela ted medications – since that initial illness. I have suffered for several years with erectile dysfunction, which is treated, usually effectively, with Viagra. I am on no other medications, have never had any troubles with depression or anxiety. I am absolutely determined to feel better. I have far too much I want and need to do in this, not least of all raise three good men.

He is active and is not on any medication at this time. He is 6 4 , 195# and works out 3-4 times weekly.","Doctor":"Hi, First of all, be assured that bruises in the calf region are not related to your son's ablation at all. You did not mention that since when the bruises are developed but assuming that they are recent, the most probable cause could be a non-traumatic overstretch of the calf muscles during work out. This is not considered significant and it should be resolved after a few days up to 2 weeks (according to the extent of intramuscular hemorrhage.) There is one other thing that you should be aware. If these bruises are repeating and he had multiple episodes of this problem in various areas, history of repeated nose bleeding, history of red-colored urine (hematuria) then a series of blood tests should be done to rule out any coagulation disorder. Considering the fact that your son does not receive a specific medication and if he has not the above-mentioned problems, then you should not worry at all. Only if it is less than 48 hours since the beginning of the bruises you can use ice massage for 3-4 minutes every few hours for a few times. If it is more than 48 hours you should start gentle stretching of the calf muscle. If painful, acetaminophen should be enough as an analgesic. Hope I have answered your query.

You mentioned that you have developed peripheral neuropathy but your nerve conduction studies are OK! Peripheral neuropathies are diagnosed by performing Nerve Conduction Studies, so I assume that your neurologist has found some clues for a neuropathy but you were at early days, so the Nerve Conduction Studies were still normal. Although Gabapentin and Amitriptyline that you are getting are good choices to relieve pain, they might need several days up to 3 weeks to show maximum effect. There is one serious situation that you should be noted: You mentioned that your legs are going numb. This could be a symptom of a specific type of neuropathy called Acute Indiopathic Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP), formerly known as Guillan Barret Syndrome (GBS). It is very important that this type of neuropathy is ruled out in your situation because it has specific treatments that should be done by hospitalization. On the other hand this type of neuropathy can potentially affect heart and respiratory systems and sometimes become dangerous. Also be noted that at early (even first few weeks) after this problem Nerve Conduction Studies could be normal. So, my advice to you is going to an experienced neurologist or a hospital which has a neurology ward. They will examine you, especially your muscle powers and reflexes, most probably repeat the Nerve Conduction Tests (EMG and NCS) and sometimes some blood or other lab tests to rule in or rule out the above mentioned disorder (AIDP). Please, do not rely on those medications for the pain. They are important but your more important symptoms are numbness and weakness of the limbs. Hope I have answered your query.

It feels tight throughout entire leg. i am able to walk on it however to left my leg (i am not able sit with legs cross or to lift leg up to put on a sock or tie a shoe). Along with these symptoms I have had unexplained itchiness in legs (Top of thighs, back of knees and tops of feet) I did see my family dr She ordered Hip x-rays that showed no fractures and slight narrowing in hip joints. Blood test were done: Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate was 44 mm/mr RA Quant (CPAL) was ANA Screen (CPAL) was negative. The dr s diagnosis was that I have bursitis in my hips. I was given a cortizone injection yesterday afternoon. No follow-up. I ve been takeing Aleve daily and Aleve PM at night for the last 4 months - no relief HELP!","Doctor":"Hi, I wish you gave us some other important information such as your age, your sex, the duration of the symptoms, whether you have concomitant low back pain or not, whether you feel any weakness in your legs. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate of 44 can be normal or abnormal according to your age. Anyway, based on your provided information, it seems there are some other possibilities which are more probable than bursitis of the hip (which is actually not a common finding). I will summarize some of them for you: - A disk protrusion between the lower lumbar vertebra sometimes causes pain which is felt in the hip and the legs but not at the low back itself. One simple test is that you can lie down on the floor with both legs stretched and then raise one of your legs slowly (with extended knee), up to about 70 degrees, if you felt a pain radiating to the back of your thigh or leg, the test is positive and there's a possibility to have a lumbar disk problem (We call this test as SLR): plan: A more detailed exam and possibly a lumbosacral MRI (according to findings) - A trigger point (some sort of muscle tightening) in one or more of your hip muscles. The pain of hip trigger point can refer to the lower limb and sometimes mistaken by disk problem. Plan: A detailed exam by a neurologist, orthopedist or physiatrist then physiotherapy: if positive for trigger points you need repeated stretching of those muscles as well as some physiotherapy sessions. Dry needling ( a technique that the therapist pierces tiny needles into the muscle repeatedly) could be of great help. - Irritation or local inflammation of the soft tissues at hip region could also become problematic sometimes. This also can be diagnosed easily during your exam.: plan: a few days of rest as well as taking an anti-inflammatory medication such as Ibuprofen, Diclofenac. My Overall suggestions: 1- Provide me with the other information that I mentioned above 2- Do the SLR test that I explained earlier 3- see if there are one or more points in your hip, gluteal area or low back that are sensitive to pressure and become painful: if you have some, report them 4- If you already have taken a lumbosacral MRI or EMG test, give me the results.

The accident(s) required a fusion at c3-4 due to instability. Before the surgery I had sensations that felt like bugs crawling up and down my arms. However, the c3-4 surgery was not to address this issue as the cause was not found. It s been eight years since the surgery and these symptoms have increased, also I have numbness on the inner side of my left wrist halfway up my forearm and down to the tip of my thumb. This numbness started when I got out of bed almost two years ago and leaned on my right elbow to get out. This sent extreme nerve pain from the right side of my neck down to the tip of my thumb. In addition, I have had the same bug crawling issues with my legs for about six years which usually coincide with the arm issue about a third of the time. However, the leg issues have recently started to occur on their own. The pain is excruciating and the bug crawling is agonizing. I ve had many nerve tests of which only one indicated an issue at c-5 and was told by one doc that I don t have MS. I ve had chiro, pt, massage, epidurals, and rfa so many times I can t count them all. Do you have any suggestions or advice?","Doctor":"Hello, Consult a neurosurgeon and get evaluated.

Pain and stiffness behind the knee are usually due to Baker's cyst. Baker's cyst can also cause swelling behind the knee and also stiffness and discomfort while flexing the knee. There are times when Bake's cyst goes away by itself but at times it needs to be treated. Visit ER, get all tests for RA done and get diagnosed. RA or any injury to the knee commonly triggers Baker's cyst formation due to excess secretion of synovial fluid. Physical therapy, steroid injections or drainage are effective in treating Baker's cyst. Get evaluated and treated at the earliest.

If this is so, it is hernia. The pain is due to recent injury. If this is hernia, you will surgery.If there is a swelling which neither gets enlarged or reduces, this is then a hematoma. Confirm by clinical evaluation, ultrasonography and so on.

He suggested that I see a rheumatologist which I did and he ran all the autoimmune blood work everything came back ok except my hematology sedimentation rate was 18 and not below 10. He diagnosed me with mild inflammation and/or osteoarthritis. He suggested I take anti-inflammatory drugs so he gave me samples of Vimovo and Duexis and now he recommended Nabumetone.
