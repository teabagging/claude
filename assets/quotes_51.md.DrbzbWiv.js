Therefore the number is at most 6cdot 27 = 162. Out of the numbers 1 to 162 the one with the largest sum of digits is 99, and the sum is 9+9=18. Hence the sum of digits will be at most 18.Also, each number with this property is divisible by 6, therefore it is divisible by 3, and thus also its sum of digits is divisible by 3. Thus, the number is divisible by 18.We only have six possibilities left for the sum of the digits: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, but since the number is divisible by 18, the digits can only add to 9 or 18. This leads to the integers 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108 being possibilities. We can check to see that boxed{1} solution: the number 54 is the only solution that satisfies the conditions in the problem.Solution 2We can write each integer between 1 and 999 inclusive as overline{abc}=100a+10b+c where a,b,cin{0,1,dots,9} and a+b+c>0.The sum of digits of this number is a+b+c, hence we get the equation 100a+10b+c = 6(a+b+c). This simplifies to 94a + 4b - 5c = 0. Clearly for a>0 there are no solutions, hence a=0 and we get the equation 4b=5c. This obviously has only one valid solution (b,c)=(5,4), hence the only solution is the number 54.Solution 3The sum of the digits is at most 9+9+9=27. Therefore the number is at most 6cdot 27 = 162. Since the number is 6 times the sum of its digits, it must be divisible by 6, therefore also by 3, therefore the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. With this in mind we can conclude that the number must be divisible by 18, not just by 6. Since the number is divisible by 18, it is also divisible by 9, therefore the sum of its digits is divisible by 9, therefore the number is divisible by 54, which leaves us with 54, 108 and 162. Only 54 is 6 times its digits, hence the answer is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"4.

First, we notice that the denominator of the fraction can be factored by successive extraction into the product (m+2)(n-1).

Let's present two possible approaches to solving such a question.In the first method, we use the decompositionV=frac{a+3 b}{a b}=frac{1}{b}+frac{3}{a}and the obvious estimates0 < frac{1}{b}+frac{3}{a} < 4 quad text{for} quad a, b > 0.For a>6, frac{3}{a}<frac{1}{2}, which means V<frac{3}{2}.

The number V=3+frac{1}{b} is an integer only for b= pm 1, and it is positive only for b=1. In the original variables, we get two solutions (m, n)=(-1,2) and (m, n)=(-1,0).triangleright a=2. The number V=frac{3}{2}+frac{1}{b} is a natural number only for b= pm 2; the corresponding solutions are (m, n)=(0,3) and (m, n)=(0,-1).triangleright a=3. The number V=1+frac{1}{b} is a natural number only for b=1, then (m, n)=(1,2).triangleright a=4.

Using the identity for the sum of tangents in a triangle:   [   tan frac{lambda_B}{2} cdot tan frac{lambda_C}{2} + tan frac{lambda_C}{2} cdot tan frac{lambda_A}{2} + tan frac{lambda_A}{2} cdot tan frac{lambda_B}{2} = 1   ]   we substitute (sqrt{frac{r_1}{r}}, sqrt{frac{r_2}{r}}, sqrt{frac{r_3}{r}}) for (tan frac{lambda_A}{2}, tan frac{lambda_B}{2}, tan frac{lambda_C}{2}) respectively.4. This gives us the equation:   [   sqrt{frac{r_1}{r}} cdot sqrt{frac{r_2}{r}} + sqrt{frac{r_2}{r}} cdot sqrt{frac{r_3}{r}} + sqrt{frac{r_3}{r}} cdot sqrt{frac{r_1}{r}} = 1   ]5. Substituting ( r_1 = 1 ), ( r_2 = 4 ), and ( r_3 = 9 ) into the equation, we get:   [   sqrt{frac{1}{r}} cdot sqrt{frac{4}{r}} + sqrt{frac{4}{r}} cdot sqrt{frac{9}{r}} + sqrt{frac{9}{r}} cdot sqrt{frac{1}{r}} = 1   ]6. Simplifying each term:   [   frac{sqrt{1 cdot 4}}{r} + frac{sqrt{4 cdot 9}}{r} + frac{sqrt{9 cdot 1}}{r} = 1   ]7. This reduces to:   [   frac{2}{r} + frac{6}{r} + frac{3}{r} = 1   ]8. Combining the terms:   [   frac{2 + 6 + 3}{r} = 1   ]9. Simplifying further:   [   frac{11}{r} = 1   ]10.

If the former case occurs, without loss of generality, let B=G, C=H, then the other pair of adjacent elements with the same order, whether it is A B, C D or D E, will lead to at least 3 elements being in the same position, which is a contradiction.

For a detailed solution, please refer to the 7th issue of \\"Intermediate Mathematics\\" in 2010.After solving this problem, one naturally thinks about what the result would be for a convex n-sided polygon. Thus, we arrive at the following generalization.Generalization: Color the n sides and each diagonal of a convex n-sided polygon such that any two segments sharing a common point are of different colors. Find the minimum number of colors required.Without loss of generality, we can assume that this convex n-sided polygon is a regular n-sided polygon.Let's take a regular pentagon as an example to find the solution approach.Since any two of the five segments B A, B C, C A, B D, B E have a common point, at least five colors are needed.A coloring method that meets the requirements of the problem for a convex pentagon with the minimum number of colors (equal to 5) can be constructed.As shown in Figure 1, the same color groups are[begin{array}{l}{A B, C E}, {B C, A D}, {C D, B E}, {D E, A C}, {E A, B D},end{array}]and different groups are of different colors.This is a coloring method with 5 colors.Analyzing this coloring method, it can be understood as (assuming the colors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)A B, C E form an angle of frac{0 times 180^{circ}}{5} with A B, so C E, A B are colored with color 0;B E, C D form an angle of frac{1 times 180^{circ}}{5} with A B, so B E, C D are colored with color 1;B D, A E form an angle of frac{2 times 180^{circ}}{5} with A B, so B D, A E are colored with color 2;B C, A D form an angle of frac{3 times 180^{circ}}{5} with A B, so B C, A D are colored with color 3;D E, A C form an angle of frac{4 times 180^{circ}}{5} with A B, so D E, A C are colored with color 4.Below, we use the above approach to solve the generalized problem.Let A, B, C be three adjacent vertices of a regular n-sided polygon, and B A, B C, C A and the n-3 diagonals drawn from point B, these n segments, any two of which have a common point.By the problem's requirement, at least n colors are needed.We can design a coloring method such that using n colors can meet the requirements.For this, let there be 0, 1, cdots, n-1 colors.Color the sides and diagonals that form an angle of frac{k cdot 180^{circ}}{n} (k=0,1, cdots, n-1) with the side A B with the k-th color, which will meet the requirements."},{"problem":"Kanel-Belov A.Y.The periods of two sequences are 7 and 13.

Condition for Collinearity: Given that overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are collinear, there exists a scalar k such that:   overrightarrow{{e}_{1}}+lambdaoverrightarrow{{e}_{2}} = kleft(-frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{{e}_{1}}-overrightarrow{{e}_{2}}right)4. Equating Components: From the equation above, we can match the coefficients of overrightarrow{{e}_{1}} and overrightarrow{{e}_{2}} on both sides to get a system of equations:   -frac{1}{3}k = 1 quad text{and} quad lambda = -k5. Solving for k and lambda: Solving the first equation gives us k = -3. Substituting k = -3 into lambda = -k yields:   lambda = -(-3)   lambda = 3Therefore, the real number lambda that satisfies the given conditions is boxed{3}."},{"problem":"5. On the table, there are 30 red and 50 green stones.

From the right triangle A D C: angle C=90^{circ}-alpha, and from the right triangle E C B: angle E B C=90^{circ}-angle C=alpha.Thus, B E is the height and the angle bisector of triangle F B C, which means this triangle is isosceles and B E is its median, i.e., F E = E C.

Eliminating x_{3}, we get:7 x_{1}+4 x_{2}=100 text {. }First, we find the non-negative solutions to this indeterminate equation. x_{1}=0, x_{2}=25 is a particular solution.

Applying a 10% discount: After marking up the price, a 10% discount is applied. The discount is 10% of the marked-up price, which is 0.1 times 1.3x = 0.13x.

When x=0 and y=a+1-f(1), the equation becomes f(a)=f(0)+a-1+f(1). Similarly, if x=0 and y=b+1-f(1), we have f(b)=f(0)+b-1+f(1), so f(0)+a-1+f(1)=f(0)+b-1+f(1), hence a=b. We have shown that the function f is injective. To use this property, we set y=0, then f(f(x+1)-1)=f(x), and since the function is injective, f(x+1)=x+1 Longrightarrow f(z)=z for all z where we have made the change of variable z=x-1. We verify that the function f: x mapsto x is indeed a solution to the equation.## Remark 4.In functional equations, showing that a function is injective goes hand in hand with finding an equality of the form f(\\"bidule\\")=f(\\"machin\\") to deduce \\"bidule\\" = \\"machin\\".It is necessary that such equalities be non-trivial for them to constitute progress in the exercise, which implies that \\"bidule\\" or \\"machin\\" must contain f. Thus, functional equations containing nested fs are the most conducive to using the notion of injectivity.A simple idea that works well to obtain equalities of the form f(\\"bidule\\")=f(\\"machin\\") is to eliminate all the output variables. In the previous exercise, we did this by setting y=0.This kind of reasoning that motivates variable changes is valuable, as it saves time by avoiding trying 10 useless substitutions. However, there will always be functional equations that will require you to try many substitutions blindly until you find the right ones.## Surjective and Bijective FunctionsDefinition 5. We say that a function f: E rightarrow F is surjective if for every t in F, there exists a in E such that f(a)=t. In other words, a function is surjective if every element of the codomain has at least one preimage.Definition 6. A function is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective.## Remark 7.A function is therefore bijective if every element of the codomain has a unique preimage.## Remark 8.To show that a function is surjective, we generally try to reduce it to an equation of the form f(A)=B, where A and B are expressions that depend on a variable x. If B covers the entire codomain of f as x covers the same set, then f is surjective."},{"problem":"## Task 4 - 060724In a cylindrical container (a straight circular cylinder with a horizontal base), there is water.

Therefore, the sides of these triangles are proportional:frac{A B}{D C}=frac{A P}{D P}=frac{B P}{P C}Now consider triangles A K P and D C P. By the condition A K=frac{A B}{2}, D M=frac{D C}{2}, so frac{A K}{D M}=frac{A B}{D C}. As a result, we have frac{A K}{D M}=frac{A P}{D B}. Therefore, triangle A P K is similar to triangle D P M by an equal angle and proportional sides. Then the angle A P K is equal to the angle D P M as angles in similar triangles, lying opposite proportional sides.By the problem's condition, K L and"},{"problem":"During a baby's \\"first grab\\" ceremony, there are 4 educational items, 3 living items, and 4 entertainment items placed in front of him.

A path connecting her house to the school is then a sequence of \\"block crossings,\\" with 8 in the horizontal direction (to the right) and 5 in the vertical direction (up). Thus, to define a path, she only needs to decide the order in which she will make these crossings.In this way, imagine 8 cards printed with the letter D and 5 cards printed with the letter C. Any permutation of these cards can be interpreted as a path to be traveled by Júlia.

Once this letter is placed, 12 empty spaces remain for the second letter C. Once this letter is placed, 11 empty spaces remain for the third letter, 10 spaces for the fourth letter, and finally 9 spaces for the fifth letter C. Now, once the five letters C are placed, any permutation of these letters among themselves does not change the distribution of the letters in the row. Since the number of permutations of five objects is (5! = 120), by the multiplication principle, the number of ways to arrange the 13 cards is[frac{13 times 12 times 11 times 10 times 9}{120} = 1287]## List 2"},{"problem":"12.1.

In the first five solutions we will only prove thatangle A I O=90^{circ} Longrightarrow b+c=2 a text {. }Let us see how this solves the problem. This lemma implies that s=216. If we let E be the foot of I on A B, then A E=s-B C=72, consequently the inradius is r=sqrt{97^{2}-72^{2}}=65. Finally, the area is s r=216 cdot 65=14040.First Solution. Since O I perp D A, A I=D I. Now, it is a well-known fact that D I=D B=D C (this is occasionally called \\"Fact 5\\"). Then by Ptolemy's Theorem,D B cdot A C+D C cdot A B=D A cdot B C Longrightarrow A C+A B=2 B C .Second Solution. As before note that I is the midpoint of A D. Let M and N be the midpoints of A B and A C, and let the reflection of M across B I be P; thus B M=B P. Also, M I=P I, but we know M I=N I as I lies on the circumcircle of triangle A M N. Consequently, we get P I=N I; moreover by angle chasing we haveangle I N C=angle A M I=180^{circ}-angle B P I=angle I P C .Thus triangles I N C and P I C are congruent (CI is a bisector) so we deduce P C=N C. Thus,B C=B P+P C=B M+C N=frac{1}{2}(A B+A C) .Third Solution. We appeal to Euler's Theorem, which states that I O^{2}=R(R-2 r).Thus by the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle A I O (or by Power of a Point) we may write(s-a)^{2}+r^{2}=A I^{2}=R^{2}-I O^{2}=2 R r=frac{a b c}{2 s}with the same notations as before. Thus, we derive thatbegin{aligned}a b c & =2 sleft((s-a)^{2}+r^{2}right) & =2(s-a)(s(s-a)+(s-b)(s-c)) & =frac{1}{2}(s-a)left((b+c)^{2}-a^{2}+a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}right) & =2 b c(s-a) .end{aligned}From this we deduce that 2 a=b+c, and we can proceed as in the previous solution.Fourth Solution. From Fact 5 again (D B=D I=D C), drop perpendicular from I to A B at E; call M the midpoint of B C. Then, by A A S congruency on A I E and C D M, we immediately get that C M=A E. As A E=frac{1}{2}(A B+A C-B C), this gives the desired conclusion.Fifth Solution. This solution avoids angle-chasing and using the fact that B I and C I are anglebisectors. Recall the perpendicularity lemma, whereW X perp Y Z Longleftrightarrow W Y^{2}-W Z^{2}=X Y^{2}-X Z^{2} .Let B^{prime} be on the extension of ray C A such that A B^{prime}=A B. Of course, as in the proof of the angle bisector theorem, B B^{prime} | A I, meaning that B B^{prime} perp I O. Let I^{prime} be the reflection of I across A; of course, I^{prime} is then the incenter of triangle A B^{prime} C^{prime}. Now, we have B^{prime} I^{2}-B I^{2}=B^{prime} O^{2}-B O^{2} by the perpendicularity and by power of a point B^{prime} O^{2}-B O^{2}=B^{prime} A cdot B^{prime} C. Moreover B I^{2}+B^{prime} I^{2}=B I^{2}+B I^{prime 2}=2 B A^{2}+2 A I^{2} by the median formula. Subtracting, we get B I^{2}=A I^{2}+frac{1}{2}(A B)(A B-A C). We have a similar expression for C I, and subtracting the two results in B I^{2}-C I^{2}=frac{1}{2}left(A B^{2}-A C^{2}right). Finally,B I^{2}-C I^{2}=frac{1}{4}left[(B C+A B-A C)^{2}-(B C-A B+A C)^{2}right]from which again, the result 2 B C=A B+A C follows.Sixth Solution, outline. Use complex numbers, setting I=a b+b c+c a, A=-a^{2}, etc. on the unit circle (scale the picture to fit in a unit circle; we calculate scaling factor later). Set a=1, and let u=b+c and v=b c. Write every condition in terms of u and v, and the area in terms of u and v too. There should be two equations relating u and v: 2 u+v+1=0 and u^{2}=frac{130}{97}^{2} v from the right angle and the 144 to 97 ratio, respectively. The square area can be computed in terms of u and v, because the area itself is antisymmetric so squaring it suffices. Use the first condition to homogenize (not coincidentally the factor left(1-b^{2}right)left(1-c^{2}right)=(1+b c)^{2}-(b+c)^{2}=(1+v)^{2}-u^{2} from the area homogenizes perfectly... because A B cdot A C=A I cdot A I_{A}, where I_{A} is the A-excenter, and of course the way the problem is set up A I_{A}=3 A I.), and then we find the area of the scaled down version. To find the scaling factor simply determine |b-c| by squaring it, writing in terms again of u and v, and comparing this to the value of 144 .Seventh Solution, outline. Trigonometric solutions are also possible. One can you write everything in terms of the angles and solve the equations; for instance, the angle A I O=90^{circ} condition can be rewritten as frac{1}{2} cos frac{B-C}{2}=2 sin frac{B}{2} sin frac{C}{2} and the 97 to 144 ratio condition can be rewritten as frac{2 sin frac{B}{2} 2 sin frac{C}{2}}{sin A}=frac{97}{144}. The first equation implies sin frac{A}{2}=2 sin frac{B}{2} sin frac{C}{2}, which we can plug into the second equation to get cos frac{A}{2}."},{"problem":"In triangle A B C, side A B is equal to 2, and angles A and B are equal to 60^{circ} and 70^{circ}, respectively.

Consequently, for each term we can express:   frac{1}{f(n)+1} = frac{1}{f(n)} - frac{1}{f(n+1)}.   Summing up from k=1 to n, we get a telescoping series:   sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{f(k)+1} = left[frac{1}{f(1)} - frac{1}{f(2)}right] + left[frac{1}{f(2)} - frac{1}{f(3)}right] + cdots + left[frac{1}{f(n)} - frac{1}{f(n+1)}right] = frac{1}{f(1)} - frac{1}{f(n+1)} < frac{1}{f(1)} = frac{1}{2}.

By solving the system of equations (begin{cases} y=kx+m  dfrac{x^{2}}{8} + dfrac{y^{2}}{4} = 1 end{cases}), and eliminating (y), we get ((2k^{2}+1)x^{2} + 4kmx + 2m^{2} - 8 = 0). Let (M(x_{1},y_{1})) and (N(x_{2},y_{2})), then (x_{1} + x_{2} = -dfrac{4km}{2k^{2}+1}) and (x_{1}x_{2} = dfrac{2m^{2}-8}{2k^{2}+1}). The slope of line (AM) is (k_{1} = dfrac{y_{1}-4}{x_{1}} = k + dfrac{m-4}{x_{1}}); the slope of line (AN) is (k_{2} = dfrac{y_{2}-4}{x_{2}} = k + dfrac{m-4}{x_{2}}). (k_{1} + k_{2} = 2k + dfrac{(m-4)(x_{1} + x_{2})}{x_{1}x_{2}} = 2k + dfrac{(m-4)(-4km)}{2m^{2}-8} = dfrac{16k(m-1)}{2m^{2}-8}). Since the angle bisector of (angle MAN) is on the (y)-axis, (k_{1} + k_{2} = 0). Thus, (dfrac{16k(m-1)}{2m^{2}-8} = 0). Given (|AM| neq |AN|), (k neq 0), hence (m=1).

Let's represent the desired number in the form 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits, and a neq 0. Since the number 100a + 10b + c + d must be divisible by 10, either c + d = 0 or c + d = 10. The first case is only possible when c = d = 0, and for this case, the conditions of the problem are not satisfied; hence, we only consider the second case.

Given Conditions and Initial Setup:   - We need to find all polynomials ( f(x) ) with integer coefficients and leading coefficient equal to 1.   - ( f(0) = 2010 ).   - For each irrational ( x ), ( f(x) ) is also irrational.2. Form of the Polynomial:   - Let ( f(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k ) with ( a_n = 1 ) (leading coefficient is 1) and ( a_0 = 2010 ).3. Behavior with Rational and Irrational Inputs:   - Given ( x in mathbb{Q}^c implies f(x) in mathbb{Q}^c ), meaning if ( x ) is irrational, then ( f(x) ) must also be irrational.   - This implies ( x in mathbb{Q} iff f(x) in mathbb{Q} ).4. Choosing a Large Prime ( p ):   - Take a large prime ( p ) such that ( p > sum_{k=0}^n |a_k| ).   - Note that ( f(x) to infty ) as ( x to infty ).5. Rational Root Theorem Application:   - Consider ( f(x) = p + 2010 ). Since ( f(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, by the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of ( f(x) - (p + 2010) = 0 ) must be a divisor of the constant term.   - The possible rational roots are ( x in {pm 1, pm p} ).6. Eliminating Impossible Cases:   - From the choice of ( p ), ( f(x) = pm 1 ) is impossible because ( p > sum_{k=0}^n |a_k| ).   - By taking ( p ) large enough, the case ( f(x) = -p ) is also not possible.7. Conclusion for ( x = p ):   - Therefore, ( x = p ) must be a solution, implying ( f(p) = p + 2010 ).   - Since ( p ) is arbitrary and can be chosen to be any large prime, ( f(p) = p + 2010 ) holds infinitely often.8. Polynomial Identity:   - This implies ( f(x) - (x + 2010) ) has infinitely many distinct roots, so it must be the zero polynomial.   - Therefore, ( f(x) = x + 2010 ).9. Verification of Other Forms:   - The suggestion that ( f(x) = cx + 2010 ) where ( c ) is an integer does not hold because the leading coefficient must be 1, and ( c neq 1 ) would violate the given condition.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = x + 2010 } )."},{"problem":"4.

The circle with diameter MN passes through the vertex C, because the angle at vertex C is a right angle. The point that is symmetric to point C with respect to the diameter MN is also a point on the circle with diameter MN. Let this point be P'. From CP' perp MN and MN | AB it follows that CP' perp AB. Since MN is the midline of the triangle ABC, we conclude that the point P' lies on the side AB. Therefore, P' equiv P and CP is the altitude of the triangle ABC drawn to the hypotenuse.

Find P(X geq 1).Given: If a random variable Z follows a normal distribution N(mu, sigma^2), then P(mu - 3sigma < Z < mu + 3sigma) = 0.9974, 0.9974^{10} approx 0.9743.(2) The quality indicators of 10 products sampled in a day are as follows:| 9.85 | 10.12 | 10.02 | 9.89 | 10.21 ||--------|---------|---------|--------|---------|| 10.26| 9.91 | 10.13 | 10.17| 9.94  |If a quality indicator greater than 10.10 is considered as a first-class product, now 4 products are randomly selected from the above 10 products.

Initial Considerations:   - For ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), the set ( A_n ) is empty because there are no positive integers greater than 1 and less than ( n ). Hence, ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ) are not solutions.   - We consider ( n > 2 ).2. Key Step:   - We need to show that for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), ( p mid n ). Suppose otherwise, i.e., there exists a prime ( p < sqrt{n} ) such that ( p nmid n ).   - Since ( gcd(p^2, n) = 1 ) and ( p^2 < n ), ( p^2 in A_n ). This contradicts the fact that ( A_n ) consists only of primes. Therefore, for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), ( p mid n ).3. Sufficiency of the Condition:   - We need to show that if ( p mid n ) for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), then all elements of ( A_n ) are prime.   - Pick any ( t in A_n ). We will show that ( t ) is prime.   - Clearly, ( t > sqrt{n} ) because ( p mid n ) for all ( p leq sqrt{n} ).   - If ( t ) is not prime, then let ( q ) be its smallest prime factor. Since ( q leq sqrt{t} < sqrt{n} ), ( q mid n ), which contradicts ( q in A_n ). Hence, ( t ) must be prime.4. Finding ( n ):   - We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), ( p mid n ).   - For ( n > 40 ), we have ( n < pi(sqrt{n})! ). This is because ( n! > left(frac{n}{2}right)^{frac{n}{2}} ) and ( pi(n) > frac{n-1}{2 ln n} ).   - Therefore, it is not possible to have all primes ( p < sqrt{n} ) dividing ( n ) for ( n > 40 ), as otherwise ( n geq prod_{p leq sqrt{n}} p > pi(sqrt{n})! > n ), a contradiction.   - Thus, ( n leq 40 ).5.

Each brick can be oriented so it contributes 4'', or 10'', or 19'', to the total height of the tower.  How many different tower heights can be achieved using all ninety-four of the bricks?","solution":"Solution 1We have the smallest stack, which has a height of 94 times 4 inches. Now when we change the height of one of the bricks, we either add 0 inches, 6 inches, or 15 inches to the height. Now all we need to do is to find the different change values we can get from 94 0's, 6's, and 15's. Because 0, 6, and 15 are all multiples of 3, the change will always be a multiple of 3, so we just need to find the number of changes we can get from 0's, 2's, and 5's.From here, we count what we can get:[0, 2 = 2, 4 = 2+2, 5 = 5, 6 = 2+2+2, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 2+2+2+2, 9 = 5+2+2, ldots]It seems we can get every integer greater or equal to four; we can easily deduce this by considering [parity](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Parity) or using the [Chicken McNugget Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Chicken_McNugget_Theorem), which says that the greatest number that cannot be expressed in the form of 2m + 5n for m,n being [positive integers](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Positive_integer) is 5 times 2 - 5 - 2=3. But we also have a maximum change (94 times 5), so that will have to stop somewhere. To find the gaps, we can work backwards as well. From the maximum change, we can subtract either 0's, 3's, or 5's. The maximum we can't get is 5 times 3-5-3=7, so the numbers 94 times 5-8 and below, except 3 and 1, work. Now there might be ones that we haven't counted yet, so we check all numbers between 94 times 5-8 and 94 times 5. 94 times 5-7 obviously doesn't work, 94 times 5-6 does since 6 is a multiple of 3, 94 times 5-5 does because it is a multiple of 5 (and 3), 94 times 5-4 doesn't since 4 is not divisible by 5 or 3, 94 times 5-3 does since 3=3, and 94 times 5-2 and 94 times 5-1 don't, and 94 times 5 does.Thus the numbers 0, 2, 4 all the way to 94 times 5-8, 94 times 5-6, 94 times 5-5, 94 times 5-3, and 94times 5 work. That's 2+(94 times 5 - 8 - 4 +1)+4=boxed{465} numbers. That's the number of changes you can make to a stack of bricks with dimensions 4 times 10 times 19, including not changing it at all.Solution 2Using bricks of dimensions 4''times10''times19'' is comparable to using bricks of dimensions 0''times6''times15'' which is comparable to using  bricks of dimensions 0''times2''times5''. Using 5 bricks of height 2'' can be replaced by using 2 bricks of height 5'' and 3 bricks of height 0''. It follows that all tower heights can be made by using 4 or fewer bricks of height 2''. There are 95+94+93+92+91=465 ways to build a tower using 4 or fewer bricks of height 2''. Taking the heights mod 5, we see that towers using a different number of bricks of height 2'' have unequal heights. Thus, all of the boxed{465} tower heights are different."},{"problem":"3.1.3.

Since D(m, 2m+3) = D(m, 3), we consider the cases D(m, 3) = 1 and D(m, 3) = 3 (i.e., 3 mid m).First, assume that D(m, 3) = 1. Therefore, m must divide 4n+1. Similarly, since n mid (2m+3)(4n+1) and n and 4n+1 are relatively prime, we have n mid 2m+3.The initial equation can be written asfrac{2m+3}{n} cdot frac{4n+1}{m} = pwhere the left side is the product of two natural numbers. Since p is a prime number, we have two cases: one of them is 1, and the other is p or vice versa.In the first case, we have 2m+3 = np and 4n+1 = m. Substituting, we get 2(4n+1) + 3 = np, or (p-8)n = 5.

Substituting, we get 4(2m+3) + 1 = mp, or m(p-8) = 13. From p-8 = 1 and p-8 = 13, we would get p = 9 or p = 21, which are not prime numbers, so this case has no solutions.Now, assume that 3 mid m.

We need to verify if this polynomial satisfies both conditions.3. First, check the condition ( P(2017) = 2016 ):   [   P(2017) = 2017 - 1 = 2016.   ]   This condition is satisfied.4. Next, check the condition ( (P(x) + 1)^2 = P(x^2 + 1) ):   [   P(x) = x - 1 implies P(x) + 1 = x - 1 + 1 = x.   ]   Therefore,   [   (P(x) + 1)^2 = x^2.   ]   On the other hand,   [   P(x^2 + 1) = (x^2 + 1) - 1 = x^2.   ]   Since both sides are equal, the second condition is also satisfied.5. Now, we need to show that ( P(x) = x - 1 ) is the only polynomial that satisfies both conditions. Assume ( P(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ). From the functional equation:   [   (P(x) + 1)^2 = P(x^2 + 1),   ]   the degree of the left-hand side is ( 2n ), and the degree of the right-hand side is ( n ). Therefore, ( 2n = n ), which implies ( n = 0 ). This means ( P(x) ) is a constant polynomial.6. However, since ( P(2017) = 2016 ), the constant polynomial must be ( P(x) = 2016 ). But this does not satisfy the functional equation ( (P(x) + 1)^2 = P(x^2 + 1) ).7. Therefore, the only polynomial that satisfies both conditions is ( P(x) = x - 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{P(x) = x - 1} )."},{"problem":"Solve the following system of equations:begin{aligned}x+y+z & =2 x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3} & =20 x^{7}+y^{7}+z^{7} & =2060end{aligned}","solution":"I. solution. We introduce the following notations:s_{k}=x^{k}+y^{k}+z^{k} quad(k geqq 0)anda=x y+x z+y z, quad b=x y zOur \\"strategy\\" is as follows: We know the value of x+y+z. We will show that for any natural number k, s_{k} can be expressed using this value, as well as a and b. Since we know the values of s_{3} and s_{7}, we will get two equations for a and b. It turns out that this system of two equations with two unknowns is very easy to solve.First, let's write down the cubic equation whose roots are precisely x, y, and z:(u-x)(u-y)(u-z)=0Expanding and rearranging this, we get the equationu^{3}=2 u^{2}-a u+bIf x, y, z is a solution triplet of the system of equations in the problem, then any of them will be a root of (4), and indeed, by multiplying the powers of u in (4), we get the equationsu^{k}=2 u^{k-1}-a u^{k-2}+b u^{k-3} quad(k geqq 3)This means thatbegin{aligned}x^{k} & =2 x^{k-1}-a x^{k-2}+b x^{k-3} y^{k} & =2 y^{k-1}-a y^{k-2}+b y^{k-3}, z^{k} & =2 z^{k-1}-a z^{k-2}+b z^{k-3}, quad k geqq 3end{aligned}Adding these three equations, we get the relationships_{k}=2 s_{k-1}-a s_{k-2}+b s_{k-3,} quad k geqq 3Thus, we can sequentially calculate the values of s_{3}, s_{4}, s_{5}, s_{6}, s_{7} using a and b, since s_{0}=3, s_{1}=2 are given, and from this,s_{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=(x+y+z)^{2}-2(x y+x z+y z)=4-2 aLet's see what (5) gives for s_{3}!s_{3}=2 s_{2}-a s_{1}+b s_{0}=2(4-2 a)-2 a+3 bAccording to (2), s_{3}=20, substituting this and simplifying, we get the relationship b=4+2 a.Our initial plan thus simplifies significantly: s_{k} can now be expressed using only a:s_{k}=2 s_{k-1}-a s_{k-2}+(4+2 a) s_{k-3}, quad k geqq 3Applying this for k=4,5,6,7:begin{aligned}s_{4} & =2 s_{3}-a s_{2}+(4+2 a) s_{1}=40-a(4-2 a)+2(4+2 a)=48+2 a^{2} s_{5} & =2 s_{4}-a s_{3}+(4+2 a) s_{2}=2left(48+2 a^{2}right)-20 a+(4+2 a)(4-2 a)=112-20 a s_{6} & =2 s_{5}-a s_{4}+(4+2 a) s_{3}=2(112-20 a)-aleft(48+2 a^{2}right)+(4+2 a) cdot 20= & =304-48 a-2 a^{3} . s_{7} & =2 s_{6}-a s_{5}+(4+2 a) s_{4}=2left(304-48 a-2 a^{3}right)-a(112-20 a)+ & +(4+2 a)left(48+2 a^{2}right)=800-112 a+28 a^{2}end{aligned}Since the value of s_{7}=2060 is known, we get a quadratic equation for a. After simplification, we get a^{2}-4 a-45=0, from which a_{1}=-5 or a_{2}=9. The latter does not provide real solutions for x, y, z because 0 leqq s_{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4-2 a=-14 is impossible. Thus, we get only one real solution for a and b: a=-5, quad b=-6. The cubic equation is therefore:u^{3}-2 u^{2}+6=0and its solutions are 1, -2, and 3. The possible solutions to our system of equations are the six permutations of these three numbers:begin{array}{llllll}x_{1}=3 ; & x_{2}=3 ; & x_{3}=1 ; & x_{4}=1 ; & x_{5}=-2 ; & x_{6}=-2 y_{1}=1 ; & y_{2}=-2 ; & y_{3}=3 ; & y_{4}=-2 ; & y_{5}=3 ; & y_{6}=1 z_{1}=-2 ; & z_{2}=1 ; & z_{3}=-2 ; & z_{4}=3 ; & z_{5}=1 ; & z_{6}=3end{array}It is easy to verify that for these triplets, s_{1}=2, s_{3}=20, s_{7}=2060, so they are indeed solutions to the system of equations.Remark. It is interesting to note that although s_{7} is a seventh-degree polynomial, we were able to express it as a quadratic polynomial in a, while s_{1} and s_{3} are only quadratic (products of second-degree terms). We were able to reduce the degree now because we knew the values of s_{1} and s_{3}. The same situation occurs with s_{5}, where the right-hand side is only linear in a. However, the degree does not decrease for s_{4} or s_{6}. It is easy to verify that if we continued to express s_{k} in terms of a (without knowing the value of s_{7}), for even k, we would always get a polynomial of degree frac{k}{2} in a, with the coefficient of a^{k / 2} alternating between +2 and -2, and for odd k, the degree would decrease: it would be frac{k-3}{2} in a. Thus, for example, a system of equations where the value of s_{11} is given instead of s_{7} is theoretically solvable, but not always if s_{10} is given, since it would require solving a fourth-degree equation, and there is no general method for solving a fifth-degree equation. (This is true regardless of the specific values of s_{1} and s_{3}.)II. solution. Let a=x y+y z+z x and b=x y z again. This time, we will determine the coefficients of the cubic polynomialu^{3}-2 u^{2}+a u-bwhose roots are the solutions x, y, z of the system of equations.

Since (3-pi) will be a positive number because pi is about 3.14, this term is 4(pi - 3)^4.For the term (0.008)^{-frac{1}{3}}, we can rewrite 0.008 as 2^{-9} because 0.008 = frac{1}{125} = frac{1}{5^3} = left(frac{2}{10}right)^3 = (2^{-1} times 5^{-1})^3 = 2^{-3} times 5^{-3} = (2 times 5)^{-3} = 10^{-3} = 2^{-9}.

We start by considering the expression (frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d}) where (a, b, c, d) are positive integers.2. If (b = d), we can simplify the expression as follows:   [   frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d} = frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^b} = frac{2^b(2^{a-b} - 1)}{2^b(2^{c-b} - 1)} = frac{2^{a-b} - 1}{2^{c-b} - 1}   ]3. For the fraction (frac{2^{a-b} - 1}{2^{c-b} - 1}) to be an integer, (2^{a-b} - 1) must be divisible by (2^{c-b} - 1). This implies:   [   2^{a-b} equiv 1 pmod{2^{c-b} - 1}   ]4. By properties of modular arithmetic, this means that the order of 2 modulo (2^{c-b} - 1) must divide (a-b). The order of 2 modulo (2^{c-b} - 1) is precisely (c-b). Hence, (c-b) must divide (a-b).5. If (c-b) divides (a-b), then (frac{2^{a-b} - 1}{2^{c-b} - 1}) is an odd number.6. Now, consider the case where (b > d) and (c-d = a-b). We get:   [   frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d} = frac{2^b(2^{a-b} - 1)}{2^d(2^{c-d} - 1)} = 2^{b-d} cdot frac{2^{a-b} - 1}{2^{c-d} - 1} = 2^{b-d}   ]   Hence, all powers of 2 can be represented.7. Furthermore, any number of the form (2^m cdot N) where (m in mathbb{N}) and (N) is of the form (frac{2^{a-b} - 1}{2^{c-d} - 1}) can also be represented.8. We now check by hand that all numbers from 1 to 10 can be represented using the given form.9. Next, we check for 11. Since 11 is odd, it can only be represented in the form (frac{2^{a-b} - 1}{2^{c-d} - 1}). For this to be true, 11 must divide (2^{a-b} - 1).10. By Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), (a-b) must be a multiple of 10 because (2^{10} equiv 1 pmod{11}). However, this cannot happen since 10 does not divide (a-b), leading to a contradiction.11.

Transverse common tangents (external tangents passing between the circles)In this case, there are two direct common tangents and two transverse common tangents, making a total of four common tangents.Therefore, the number of common tangents to the circles Q_1 and Q_2 is boxed{4}."},{"problem":"[ Investigation of a quadratic trinomial ] [ Methods for solving problems with parameters ]For which values of the parameter a are both roots of the equation (2-a) x^{2}-3 a x+2 a=0 greater than 1 / 2?","solution":"When a2 the coefficient of x^{2} and the constant term have different signs, meaning one of the roots is negative.

(1)Since they have a common focus, we know that c^2 = 2b^2 + 1, which implies a^2 - b^2 = 2b^2 + 1.   (2)Combining (1) and (2), we get a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 1,Therefore, the equation of the ellipse C_1 is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}.(2) Since line l is tangent to C_1 at a point in the first quadrant, the slope of l must exist and be negative.

Axis of Symmetry: The general form of a quadratic function is y=a(x-h)^2+k, where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola, and the line x=h is the axis of symmetry. For our function, h=-3, so the axis of symmetry is the line x=-3. Therefore, statement B is correct.3. Behavior of y when x > -4: Since the parabola opens downwards, as x moves away from the axis of symmetry (in either direction), y decreases.

So 1 is not in G, and hence must be in F. It must be the smallest element of F and so f(1) = 1. Hence g(1) = 2. We can never have two successive integers n and n+1 in G, because if g(m) = n+1, then f(something) = n and so n is in F and G. Contradiction. In particular, 3 must be in F, and so f(2) = 3. Suppose f(n) = k. Then g(n) = f(k) + 1. So |N f(k)+1 ∩ G| = n. But |N f(k)+1 ∩ F| = k, so n + k = f(k) + 1, or f(k) = n + k - 1. Hence g(n) = n + k. So n + k + 1 must be in F and hence f(k+1) = n + k + 1. This so given the value of f for n we can find it for k and k+1. Using k+1 each time, we get, successively, f(2) = 3, f(4) = 6, f(7) = 11, f(12) = 19, f(20) = 32, f(33) = 53, f(54) = 87, f(88) = 142, f(143) = 231, f(232) = 375, which is not much help.

Given that point B has coordinates (1, -2), we can directly infer that the x-coordinate of point A, m, will be equal to the x-coordinate of point B, which is 1. Thus, m = 1.3. Similarly, since the y-coordinate changes sign when reflected across the x-axis, the y-coordinate of point A, n, will be the negative of the y-coordinate of point B, which is -2. Therefore, n = -(-2) = 2.Putting it all together, we find that the coordinates of point A are (m, n) = (1, 2).Therefore, the answer is: boxed{1; 2}."},{"problem":"Martin has written a five-digit number with five different digits on a piece of paper, with the following properties:- by crossing out the second digit from the left (i.e., the digit in the thousands place), he gets a number that is divisible by two,- by crossing out the third digit from the left, he gets a number that is divisible by three,- by crossing out the fourth digit from the left, he gets a number that is divisible by four,- by crossing out the fifth digit from the left, he gets a number that is divisible by five,- if he does not cross out any digit, the number is divisible by six.What is the largest number Martin could have written on the paper?(M.

The number overline{a c d e} is divisible by two, so the digit e is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8,2. The number overline{a b d e} is divisible by three, so the sum a+b+d+e is divisible by three,3. The number overline{a b c e} is divisible by four, so the number overline{c e} is divisible by four,4. The number overline{a b c d} is divisible by five, so the digit d is 0 or 5,5. The number overline{a b c d e} is divisible by six, which means it is divisible by both two and three, i.e., the digit e is even (which we already know from the first condition) and the sum a+b+c+d+e is divisible by three.Combining the second and fifth conditions, we get that the digit c is also divisible by three. Therefore, the digit c is 0, 3, 6, or 9. We see that the digits c, d, e are subject to individual conditions, while the digits a and b are not.

Rationality Condition:   If ( sqrt{frac{2005}{x+y}} + sqrt{frac{2005}{y+z}} + sqrt{frac{2005}{z+x}} ) is an integer, then each term ( sqrt{frac{2005}{x+y}}, sqrt{frac{2005}{y+z}}, sqrt{frac{2005}{z+x}} ) must be rational. This is because the sum of irrational numbers cannot be rational unless each term is rational.2. Rationality of Square Roots:   For ( sqrt{frac{2005}{x+y}} ) to be rational, ( frac{2005}{x+y} ) must be a perfect square. Let ( frac{2005}{x+y} = k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). Then, ( x + y = frac{2005}{k^2} ).3. Possible Values of ( k ):   Since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers, ( x + y ) must be a positive integer. Therefore, ( k^2 ) must be a divisor of 2005. The prime factorization of 2005 is ( 2005 = 5 times 401 ). The divisors of 2005 are 1, 5, 401, and 2005. Thus, ( k^2 ) can be 1, 5, 401, or 2005. However, only 1 is a perfect square.4. Values of ( x + y ), ( y + z ), and ( z + x ):   Since ( k^2 = 1 ), we have ( x + y = 2005 ), ( y + z = 2005 ), and ( z + x = 2005 ).5. Solving the System of Equations:   We have the system of equations:   [   begin{cases}   x + y = 2005    y + z = 2005    z + x = 2005   end{cases}   ]   Adding all three equations, we get:   [   (x + y) + (y + z) + (z + x) = 3 times 2005 implies 2(x + y + z) = 3 times 2005 implies x + y + z = frac{3 times 2005}{2} = 3007.5   ]   This is not possible since ( x, y, z ) are integers. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.6. Re-evaluation:   Since ( k^2 = 1 ) is the only perfect square divisor of 2005, we must have made an error in our initial assumption. Let's consider the possibility of different values for ( x, y, z ) that satisfy the integer condition.7. Correct Solution:   The correct solution involves finding specific values of ( x, y, z ) such that the sum of the square roots is an integer.

Assume the Contrary: We start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. Assume that in triangle ABC, angle B > 90^{circ}. This is our initial assumption that we will show leads to a contradiction.2. Use Given Information: Given that AB=AC, we know that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle. By the properties of an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Therefore, from AB=AC, we deduce angle B = angle C. Since we assumed angle B > 90^{circ}, it follows that angle C > 90^{circ} as well. Thus, angle B + angle C > 180^{circ}.3. Identify the Contradiction: Considering the sum of angles in a triangle, we know that angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^{circ}. However, from our assumption and subsequent deduction, we have angle B + angle C > 180^{circ}. Adding angle A to both sides, we get angle A + angle B + angle C > 180^{circ}, which contradicts the established fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is exactly 180^{circ}.4. Conclude by Rejecting the Assumption: Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must not be valid. Therefore, we conclude that our initial assumption that angle B > 90^{circ} is false. Hence, angle B  90^{circ}, deduce angle B = angle C > 90^{circ} leading to angle B + angle C > 180^{circ}, identify the contradiction with the sum of angles in a triangle, and conclude that angle B < 90^{circ}.

Since widehat{A B E}=45^{circ}, we obtain by the sum of the angles in triangle A B E that 180^{circ}=widehat{A B E}+widehat{B A E}+widehat{A E B}=45^{circ}+2 cdot widehat{A E B}, so widehat{A E B}=frac{135^{circ}}{2}=67.5^{circ}. Since widehat{C B E}=45^{circ}, we obtain by the sum of the angles in triangle C B E that 180^{circ}=widehat{C B E}+widehat{B C E}+widehat{C E B}=45^{circ}+2 cdot widehat{C E B}, so widehat{C E B}=frac{135^{circ}}{2}=67.5^{circ}.In particular, we have widehat{A E B}=widehat{C E B}=67.5^{circ}.Finally, since F, E, C are collinear, we getwidehat{F E A}=180^{circ}-widehat{A E C}=180^{circ}-(widehat{A E B}+widehat{B E C})=180^{circ}-135^{circ}=45^{circ}"},{"problem":"Betty Lou and Peggy Sue take turns flipping switches on a 100 times 100 grid.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have a 100 times 100 grid where initially all switches are \\"off\\".   - Betty Lou flips a horizontal row of switches on her turn.   - Peggy Sue flips a vertical column of switches on her turn.   - The goal is to have an odd number of switches turned \\"on\\" in each row and column.2. Analyzing Smaller Grids:   - Consider a smaller grid, say 2 times 2. If we want an odd number of switches \\"on\\" in each row and column, we can achieve this by flipping one row and one column. This results in 3 switches being \\"on\\" (one switch will be flipped twice, turning it back \\"off\\").   - For a 3 times 3 grid, we can achieve 5 switches being \\"on\\" by flipping two rows and two columns.3. Generalizing the Pattern:   - For an n times n grid, if we flip n-1 rows and n-1 columns, we will have (n-1)^2 switches \\"on\\" because each row and column will have n-1 switches \\"on\\" and the intersection of these rows and columns will be flipped twice, turning them back \\"off\\".   - To ensure that each row and column has an odd number of switches \\"on\\", we need to flip one additional switch. This can be done by flipping one more row or column, resulting in (n-1)^2 + 1 switches \\"on\\".4. Applying to the 100 times 100 Grid:   - For a 100 times 100 grid, following the pattern, we flip 99 rows and 99 columns.   - This results in 99^2 = 9801 switches \\"on\\".   - To ensure each row and column has an odd number of switches \\"on\\", we flip one additional switch, resulting in 9801 + 1 = 9802 switches \\"on\\".Conclusion:[boxed{9802}]"},{"problem":"## Task ConditionWrite the canonical equations of the line.6 x-7 y-z-2=0x+7 y-4 z-5=0","solution":"## SolutionCanonical equations of a line:frac{x-x_{0}}{m}=frac{y-y_{0}}{n}=frac{z-z_{0}}{p}where left(x_{0} ; y_{0} ; z_{0}right)_{text {- are coordinates of some point on the line, and }} vec{s}={m ; n ; p} - its direction vector.Since the line belongs to both planes simultaneously, its direction vector vec{s} is orthogonal to the normal vectors of both planes.

If the day of the week was Monday or Tuesday and the date was odd, they each ate three portions of ice cream. If the day of the week was Friday, the number of portions each ate was equal to the date on the calendar. Ice cream was forbidden on all other days and under other conditions. What is the maximum number of portions of ice cream that Vova could have eaten in February under these conditions?","solution":"# Answer: 110Solution. February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, and so on. Moreover, if Monday falls on an even date in one week, the following Monday will fall on an odd date, and vice versa. This means that the same day of the week falls on an even date twice and an odd date twice, regardless of which day of the week the month starts. Therefore, for Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, Kirill and Vova will eat 4 cdot (7+3) = 40 portions of ice cream. For the four Fridays, the number of portions eaten will be x, x+7, x+14, and x+21, where x is the date on which the first Friday falls. The maximum number of portions will be eaten when the first Friday is on February 7. Then x + x + 7 + x + 14 + x + 21 = 42 + 4x = 42 + 28 = 70, and in total, Vova will eat 70 + 40 = 110 portions of ice cream."},{"problem":"8.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is less than or equal to 12 times 2=24<28, a contradiction.(4) If 8 edges A_{1} A_{2}, A_{1} A_{3}, cdots, A_{1} A_{9} are drawn from point A_{1}, the subgraph formed by the 8 points A_{2}, A_{3}, cdots, A_{9} has no triangle.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have an 8 times 8 board with 64 squares.   - Two houses (squares) are neighbors if they share a side or a vertex.   - The game involves filling each square with a number equal to the number of its neighboring squares that are still blank.   - We need to show that the sum of all 64 numbers written on the board does not depend on the order of filling and calculate this sum.2. Analyzing the Neighboring Relationship:   - Each square on the board can have up to 8 neighbors.   - The number of neighbors for each square depends on its position:     - Corner squares have 3 neighbors.     - Edge (non-corner) squares have 5 neighbors.     - Interior squares have 8 neighbors.3. Counting the Total Number of Neighbor Pairs:   - Each pair of neighboring squares will be counted twice (once for each square in the pair).   - Therefore, we need to count the total number of neighbors for all squares and then divide by 2.4. Calculating the Total Number of Neighbors:   - There are 4 corner squares, each with 3 neighbors: 4 times 3 = 12.   - There are 24 edge squares (excluding corners), each with 5 neighbors: 24 times 5 = 120.   - There are 36 interior squares, each with 8 neighbors: 36 times 8 = 288.   - Summing these, we get the total number of neighbors: 12 + 120 + 288 = 420.5. Dividing by 2 to Account for Double Counting:   - Since each pair of neighbors is counted twice, we divide the total by 2: frac{420}{2} = 210.6. Conclusion:   - The sum of all the numbers written on the board is 210, and this sum does not depend on the order in which the squares are filled.The final answer is boxed{210}"},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively, and it is given that b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}=bc.

Monotonicity Condition: The function f(x) is required to be monotonic on R. This implies that f(x) has to either always increase or always decrease, without changing direction.2. Conditions on a: For the function log_a x to be defined, a > 0 and a neq 1. Additionally, for the quadratic function 2ax^2 - x - frac{1}{4} to be monotonically decreasing for x leq 1, the coefficient of x^2 (which is 2a) must be positive, indicating a > 0, and derivative of this quadratic function must be negative or zero.3. Quadratic Function Analysis for x leq 1: The quadratic function is y = 2ax^2 - x - frac{1}{4}. The derivative of this function, y' = 4ax - 1, must be non-positive (i.e., 4ax - 1 leq 0) for the function to be monotonically decreasing. At x=1, this gives 4a - 1 leq 0 or a leq 1/4. Since a > 0, this further implies 0  1.5. Solving for a Given Monotonicity Across R: From the conditions for the quadratic function to be monotonically decreasing and the logarithmic function to be monotonically increasing, we find that a must satisfy 1/8 leq a leq 1/4. This comes from the intersection of conditions including the behavior of the derivative of the quadratic function at x=1 and the conditions for the logarithmic function's domain and monotonicity.Therefore, combining all these conditions, we conclude that the range of a for which f(x) is monotonic on R is:boxed{left[frac{1}{8}, frac{1}{4}right]}"},{"problem":"1.

For f(m), this is m = -frac{-2}{2} = 1. This means the vertex of the parabola, or the point where it achieves its minimum or maximum value, is at m=1.- However, since we're considering m in [2,3], the interval does not include the vertex. Given the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is to the left of our interval, f(m) is monotonically increasing in [2,3].Therefore, the minimum value of f(m) in the interval [2,3] is at the left endpoint, f(2) = 2^2 - 2cdot2 + 6 = 4 - 4 + 6 = 6.

If there is a knight in cell (i, j_{1}), then c(j_{1}) > r(i), and consequently, c(j_{2}) > r(i). Therefore, there is also a knight in cell (i, j_{2}). Thus, the number of knights in column j_{2} is no less than that in column j_{1}, which contradicts c(j_{2}) > c(j_{1}).Next, we prove that all residents in the same row are either all knights or all villains (such an arrangement is called a \\"striped arrangement\\").For the resident in cell (i, j) of the i-th row, since r(i) is independent of j, whether the resident in cell (i, j) is a knight or a villain depends only on c(j).

We get the only solution n=2.Another solution. We will examine the factorization n^{2}+6 n=n(n+6).

We can easily verify that n(n+6) is indeed a square of an integer in this case.If the greatest common divisor of the numbers n and n+6 is 3, then n=3 m for some odd m. If n(n+6)=9 m(m+2) is a square, then the coprime numbers m and m+2 must also be squares. However, such two squares do not exist.If the greatest common divisor of the numbers n and n+6 is 6, then n=6 m for some m.

Solution","solution":": 39. Put m = m'd, n = n'd, with m' and n' coprime. Then m' + n' divides dm'n'. It cannot divide m' or n', so it must divide d. In particular, m' + n' <= d. We have m + n < 100, so (m' + n') 2 < 100, so m' + n' <= 9. So the possibilities are: m' = n' = 3, hence m' = 1, n' = 2, d = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24; m' + n' = 4, hence m' = 1, n' = 3, d = 4, 8, 12, 16; m' + n' = 5, hence m' = 1, n' = 4, d = 5, 10, or m' = 2, n' = 3, d = 5, 10 or 15; m' + n' = 6, hence m' = 1, n' = 5, d = 6; m' + n' = 7, hence m' = 1, n' = 6, d = 7, or m' = 2, n' = 5, d = 7, or m' = 3, n' = 4, d = 7; m' + n' = 8, hence m' = 3, n' = 5, d = 8; or m' + n' = 9, hence m' = 4, n' = 5, d = 9. Thus we get the following 23 pairs: 3, 6 6, 12 9, 18 12, 24 15, 30 18, 36 21, 42 24, 48 4, 12 8, 24 12, 36 16, 48 5, 20 10, 40 10, 15 20, 30 30, 45 6, 30 7, 42 14, 35 21, 28 24, 40 36, 45 The following 12 pairs are disjoint: 3, 6 4, 12 5, 20 7, 42 8, 24 9, 18 10, 40 14, 35 15, 30 16, 48 21, 28 36, 45 so any set with 39 elements must contain one of these pairs (to avoid it, its complement would have to have 12 elements, one from each pair). On the other hand, each of the 23 pairs contains at least one of 6, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 36 42, 48, so the subset of the other 38 elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50} does not contain any of the 23 pairs. 11th Chinese 1996 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 22 June 2002"},{"problem":"From the positive integers, m,m+1,dots,m+n, only the sum of digits of m and the sum of digits of m+n are divisible by 8. Find the maximum value of n.","solution":"1. Identify the range of numbers:   We are given a sequence of positive integers starting from ( m ) to ( m+n ). We need to find the maximum value of ( n ) such that only the sum of the digits of ( m ) and ( m+n ) are divisible by 8.2. Consider the sum of digits modulo 8:   Let ( S(x) ) denote the sum of the digits of ( x ). We need ( S(m) equiv 0 pmod{8} ) and ( S(m+n) equiv 0 pmod{8} ), but for all ( k ) where ( 1 leq k leq n-1 ), ( S(m+k) notequiv 0 pmod{8} ).3. Analyze the sequence in blocks of 10:   Consider a block of 10 consecutive numbers, ( 10a, 10a+1, ldots, 10a+9 ). The sum of the digits of these numbers will vary, but at least one of them will have a sum of digits divisible by 8. This is because the sum of digits changes as we move from one number to the next.4. Extend the block to 18 numbers:   Similarly, consider the next block of 10 numbers, ( 10a+10, 10a+11, ldots, 10a+19 ). Again, at least one of these numbers will have a sum of digits divisible by 8.5. Determine the maximum ( n ):   To ensure that only the first and the last numbers in the sequence have sums of digits divisible by 8, we need to find the maximum span where this condition holds. From the analysis, we see that within any block of 18 numbers, there will be at least two numbers whose sum of digits is divisible by 8.6. Calculate the maximum ( n ):   If ( m ) is such that ( S(m) equiv 0 pmod{8} ) and ( S(m+n) equiv 0 pmod{8} ), the maximum ( n ) can be ( 17 ) because within any block of 18 numbers, there will be at least two numbers with sums of digits divisible by 8. Therefore, the maximum ( n ) is ( 17 - 2 = 15 ).7. Verify with an example:   For example, if ( m = 9999992 ), then ( S(9999992) = 9+9+9+9+9+9+2 = 56 equiv 0 pmod{8} ). Similarly, ( S(9999992 + 15) = S(10000007) = 1+0+0+0+0+0+7 = 8 equiv 0 pmod{8} ).

Since the equation frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{4} = 1 already provides us with b^2 = 4, we can find a^2 using the relation c^2 = a^2 + b^2.Starting with c = 2sqrt{3}, we square both sides to get c^2 = 4cdot 3 = 12.Using the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2, we substitute in c^2 = 12 and b^2 = 4:12 = a^2 + 4.Now we need to solve for a^2:a^2 = 12 - 4 = 8.Taking the square root of both sides, since a > 0, we get a = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}.

Therefore, the total number of different coloring methods is 4 times 3 times 3 times 3 = 108.However, the correct answer provided is 24. This indicates that there might have been a misunderstanding in the translation or interpretation of the solution.

Note that the length of segment X^{prime} Y^{prime} is also equal to half the perimeter of triangle A B C, i.e., A P = X^{prime} Y^{prime}. Since X^{prime} M = M A, it follows that M P = M Y^{prime}.

Similarly, point Q lies on gamma, so gamma is circumscribed around triangle P A Q. Therefore, X^{prime} = X, Y^{prime} = Y, and X Y = 1 / 2.Solution 2. Mark point I - the center of circle omega. Since angle A P I = angle A Q I = 90^{circ}, points A, P, I, Q lie on the same circle gamma, constructed on segment A I as the diameter. Let M and N be the midpoints of segments A B and A C respectively, and X^{prime} and Y^{prime} be the points of intersection of lines B I and C I with line M N respectively. We will prove that X^{prime} and Y^{prime} lie on gamma.Note that angles P B I and M B X^{prime} are equal as vertical angles, and angles C B I and M X^{prime} B are equal because lines B C and M N are parallel. Since B I is the angle bisector of angle P B C, angle M B X^{prime} = angle M X^{prime} B, so triangle B M X^{prime} is isosceles and B M = M X^{prime}. In triangle A B X^{prime}, median X^{prime} M is equal to half the side, so this triangle is right-angled with a right angle at X^{prime}. Thus, angle A X^{prime} I = 90^{circ}, so X^{prime} lies on gamma, hence X^{prime} = X. Similarly, triangle A C Y^{prime} is right-angled and Y^{prime} = Y. Then X Y = X M + M N + N Y = 1 / 2.Remark. Essentially, the solution proves the known fact that the projection of vertex A onto the bisector of an internal or external angle lies on the midline of the triangle.Solution 3.

Since x is positive, x = c. Similarly, y = b. Therefore, X Y = a + b + c = 1 / 2.Solution 4. As in the second solution, note that circle gamma is constructed on A I as the diameter. Let omega^{prime} be the image of circle omega under a homothety with center A and coefficient 1 / 2. Since A I is the diameter of gamma, circles gamma and omega^{prime} have a common center.Under the same homothety, triangle A B C transforms into triangle A M N, so omega^{prime} will be tangent to lines A P, A Q, and X Y. Thus, X Y, A P, and A Q are three chords of circle gamma that are tangent to the concentric circle omega^{prime}. Therefore, their lengths are equal. As proven in the first solution, the length of segment A P is equal to half the perimeter of triangle A B C, so the length of X Y is also equal to half the perimeter, i.e., 1 / 2."},{"problem":"Isosceles trapezoid ABCD has side lengths AB = 6 and CD = 12, while AD = BC.

From c(a + d) = b(a + d) = 0, we get a = - d or b = c = 0. The second cannot be true, since we are given that a,b,c,d are nonzero. This means a = - d, so f(x) = frac {ax + b}{cx - a}.The only value that is not in the range of this function is frac {a}{c}. To find frac {a}{c}, we use the two values of the function given to us. We get 2(97)a + b = 97^2c and 2(19)a + b = 19^2c. Subtracting the second equation from the first will eliminate b, and this results in 2(97 - 19)a = (97^2 - 19^2)c, so[frac {a}{c} = frac {(97 - 19)(97 + 19)}{2(97 - 19)} = 58 .]Alternatively, we could have found out that a = -d by using the fact that f(f(-b/a))=-b/a."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=log_{2}|x|+x^{2}, the solution set of the inequality f(ln x)+f(-ln x) lt 2 is ()A: (frac{1}{e}, 1)B: (frac{1}{e}, e)C: (1, e)D: (frac{1}{e}, 1) cup (1, e)","solution":"To solve the given problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Understanding the Domain of f(x):   The function f(x)=log_{2}|x|+x^{2} is defined for all x except x=0. Thus, its domain is (-infty, 0) cup (0, +infty).2. Identifying the Symmetry of f(x):   We observe that f(-x)=log_{2}|-x|+(-x)^{2}=log_{2}|x|+x^{2}=f(x). This shows that f(x) is an even function, meaning it is symmetric about the y-axis.3. Simplifying the Given Inequality:   Given f(ln x)+f(-ln x) lt 2, and knowing that f(x) is even, we can simplify this to 2f(ln x) lt 2. Dividing both sides by 2, we get f(ln x) lt 1.4. Analyzing the Monotonicity of f(x):   For x > 0, f(x)=log_{2}x+x^{2}. Since both log_{2}x and x^{2} are monotonically increasing functions for x > 0, their sum, f(x), is also monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Given that f(x) is an even function, it is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0).5. Finding the Solution Set:   Since f(1)=1=f(-1) and f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty) and decreasing on (-infty, 0), we consider the inequality f(ln x) lt 1.      - For f(ln x) lt 1=f(1), since f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), we have 0 lt ln x lt 1. Solving this inequality gives 1 lt x lt e.      - Similarly, for f(ln x) lt 1=f(-1), since f(x) is decreasing on (-infty, 0), we have -1 lt ln x lt 0. Solving this inequality gives frac{1}{e} lt x lt 1.6.

We will color the drawn diagonals red and blue: the first diagonal will be colored blue; subsequently, if the newly drawn diagonal intersects a blue diagonal, we will color it red, otherwise, we will color it blue. Clearly, diagonals of the same color will not intersect at internal points.Suppose there are k diagonals of the same color. Since they do not have common internal points, they divide the n-gon into k+1 polygons. Each of these polygons has at least three sides, so the total number of sides S is at least 3(k+1). On the other hand, the sides of these polygons are our diagonals (each counted twice) and the sides of the original n-gon. Thus, n + 2k = S geq 3(k+1), or k leq n-3.

Also, if p, q, r are even then F(p, q, r) is odd.If p geq 4, then 1<F(p, q, r) leq F(4,6,8)=191 / 105<2, which is impossible. Hence p leq 3.Let p=2.

The perimeter conditions mean that overline{B_{2} C_{1}}, overline{C_{2} A_{1}}, and overline{A_{2} B_{1}} are tangent to the incircle of triangle A B C.Hence the result follows by Brianchon's theorem.Now suppose p neq 1.

We need to find all possible solutions.1. Case 1: (x = y)   If (x = y), substituting (y) for (x) in the first equation, we get:   [ x + x^2 = p^m ]   Substituting (y) for (x) in the second equation, we get:   [ x^2 + x = p^n ]      Since both expressions are equal to (p^m) and (p^n) respectively, we have:   [ x + x^2 = p^m = p^n ]      Since ( gcd(x, x+1) = 1 ), the only way for (x(x+1)) to be a power of a prime is if (x = 1) and (x+1 = 2). Thus, (x = 1) and (p = 2). This gives:   [ 1 + 1^2 = 2 = 2^1 ]   [ 1^2 + 1 = 2 = 2^1 ]      Therefore, the solution in this case is:   [ (x, y, p, m, n) = (1, 1, 2, 1, 1) ]2. Case 2: (x > y)   Assume (gcd(x, y) neq 1). Let (gcd(x, y) = p^k) with (k, a, b in mathbb{N}) such that (x = p^k a) and (y = p^k b). Substituting these into the equations, we get:   [ p^k a + p^{2k} b^2 = p^m ]   [ p^{2k} a^2 + p^k b = p^n ]      Since (m, n > k), we must have (p mid a) and (p mid b). This leads to a contradiction because (a) and (b) should be coprime. Therefore, (gcd(x, y) = 1).   Next, we analyze the inequalities:   [ (x + y^2) mid (x^2 + y) ]   [ x^2 + y > x + y^2 ]   [ p^n > p^m ]      Hence, (p^m mid p^n), which implies:   [ x + y^2 mid x^2 + y ]   [ x^2 + y mid y^4 + y ]   [ p^m mid (y + 1)(y^2 - y + 1) ]      Notice that (gcd(y + 1, y^2 - y + 1) = 1) or (3).

Therefore, (gcd(y + 1, y^2 - y + 1) = 3), implying (p = 3). From the equation:   [ 3^{m-2} mid left(frac{y + 1}{3}right) left(frac{y^2 - y + 1}{3}right) ]      Since (gcdleft(frac{y + 1}{3}, frac{y^2 - y + 1}{3}right) = 1), we have:   [ 3^{m-2} mid frac{y + 1}{3} ]   [ 3^{m-1} mid y + 1 ]   or   [ 3^{m-2} mid frac{y^2 - y + 1}{3} ]   [ 3^{m-1} mid y^2 - y + 1 ]      By size reasoning, (3^{m-1} mid y^2 - y + 1). Since (y^2 - y + 1) is odd and (y^2 - y + 1 < x + y^2 = 3^m), we have (y^2 - y + 1 = 3^{n-1}). This gives:   [ y^3 + 1 = 3^{n-1}(y + 1) ]      For (y leq 2), the only solution is ((x, y, p, m, n) = (5, 2, 3, 2, 3)). For (y geq 3), notice that (3 mid y + 1). By Zsigmondy's theorem, there exists a prime (p) such that (p mid y^3 + 1) and (p nmid y + 1), which implies (p mid 3^{n-1}(y + 1)). This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the only solution for this case is ((x, y, p, m, n) = (5, 2, 3, 2, 3)).Combining both cases, the only solutions are:[ (x, y, p, m, n) = (1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (5, 2, 3, 2, 3), (2, 5, 3, 3, 2) ]The final answer is ( boxed{ (x, y, p, m, n) = (1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (5, 2, 3, 2, 3), (2, 5, 3, 3, 2) } )"},{"problem":"If x^2-5x+6<0 and P=x^2+5x+6 thentextbf{(A)} P ; text{can take any real value} qquadtextbf{(B)} 20<P<30textbf{(C)} 0<P<20 qquadtextbf{(D)} P<0 qquadtextbf{(E)} P>30","solution":"1. First, we need to solve the inequality (x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0).

To find the solution to ((x - 2)(x - 3) < 0), we analyze the sign changes of the product ((x - 2)(x - 3)):   - When (x < 2), both (x - 2) and (x - 3) are negative, so their product is positive.   - When (2 < x < 3), (x - 2) is positive and (x - 3) is negative, so their product is negative.   - When (x > 3), both (x - 2) and (x - 3) are positive, so their product is positive.   Therefore, the inequality ((x - 2)(x - 3) < 0) holds for:   [   2 < x < 3   ]3. Next, we need to evaluate the expression (P = x^2 + 5x + 6) within the interval (2 < x < 3).

Since (P(x)) is a quadratic function and opens upwards (the coefficient of (x^2) is positive), the values of (P) within the interval (2 < x < 3) will lie between (P(2)) and (P(3)).

The question is the same as asking how many ways there are to write 180 as the sum of three positive integers, if the order of the numbers does not matter.If the order did matter, the number of all possibilities would be binom{179}{2}, since if we write 180 ones next to each other, we need to choose two out of the 179 spaces between the ones to divide the 180 ones into three parts.For a+b+c=180, and a, b, c are distinct positive integers, then these three numbers have 3!=6 different orders. Therefore, denoting the number of different shaped, non-equilateral triangles by x, there are 6x such triangles if the order of the angles matters. For a+a+b=180, and a, b are distinct positive integers, then these three numbers have 3 different orders. Therefore, denoting the number of isosceles but not equilateral, different shaped triangles by y, there are 3y such triangles if the order of the angles matters. There is 1 equilateral triangle.Based on these:binom{179}{2}=frac{179 cdot 178}{2}=15931=6 x+3 y+1The number of isosceles but not equilateral triangles is 88, since the size of the angles at the base can be any integer from 1 to 89 except 60. Thus, y=88. Substituting this into (1) gives 15931=6 x+3 cdot 88+1, from which x=2611.Thus, the number of different shaped triangles is: x+y+1=2611+88+1=2700.Remark.

Finally, the number of sought decompositions is:x+y+1=3 k^{2}-3 k+1+3 k-2+1=3 k^{2}II. solution. Let the angles of a triangle be generally alpha leq beta leq gamma. Count the triangles according to the size of the smallest angle, alpha. (We do not write the \\"degree\\" unit.)We know that alpha leq beta leqleft[90-frac{alpha}{2}right], because if beta were larger than this, then gamma would also be, but then the sum of the three angles would be greater than 180.Thus, for a given alpha=k, the size of beta in the triangle has left(left[90-frac{k}{2}right]-kright)+1 possibilities. Since alpha is at most 60, the total number of triangles is:begin{aligned}& sum_{alpha=1}^{60}left(left[90-frac{alpha}{2}right]-alpharight)+1=left(sum_{alpha=1}^{60}left[90-frac{alpha}{2}right]right)-sum_{alpha=1}^{60} alpha+60= = & 2 cdot(89+88+ldots+60)-(1+2+ldots+60)+60=2 cdot frac{30 cdot 149}{2}-frac{61 cdot 60}{2}+60= = & 4470-1830+60=2700 .end{aligned}III. solution. Let the angles of a triangle be generally alpha leq beta leq gamma. Count the triangles according to the size of the middle angle, beta. (We do not write the \\"degree\\" unit.)beta is at least 1 and at most left[frac{180-1}{2}right]=89.Case I: 1 leq beta leq 60, then 1 leq alpha leq beta, from which gamma is already determined. This gives for alpha, and thus for the number of trianglessum_{beta=1}^{60} beta=1+2+ldots+59+60=frac{60(60+1)}{2}=1830possibilities.Case II: 61 leq beta leq 89, then beta leq gamma leq 180-(beta+1), since alpha is at least 1. Since alpha is already determined from this, the number of gamma and thus the number of triangles isbegin{aligned}& sum_{beta=61}^{89}((180-(beta+1))-beta)+1=sum_{beta=61}^{89} 180-2 beta= = & (89-61+1) cdot 180-2 cdot frac{(89-61+1) cdot(89+61)}{2}=5220-4350=870 .end{aligned}This totals 1830+870=2700 possibilities, so there are this many triangles.Remark. The triangles can also be counted according to the largest angle, although in a slightly more complicated way.IV. solution. Let a_{i}, b_{i}, and c_{i} denote, respectively, the number of ways to break down the positive integer i into the sum of one, two, or three positive integers, where the order of the terms does not matter.Clearly, a_{i}=1 for all i.It is also true that b_{2 k}=b_{2 k+1}=k, since the smaller number is an integer between 1 and k in both cases.If a number greater than 3 is broken down into the sum of three positive integers: k=x+y+z, then k-3=(x-1)+(y-1)+(z-1), where the three terms are non-negative. Thus, we have obtained a decomposition of the number 3 less, which is either a one-term (if exactly two of x, y, and z are 1); or a two-term (if exactly one of the three numbers is 1); or a three-term (if all three numbers are greater than 1).Conversely: from a one-, two-, or three-term decomposition of the number k-3, we get a three-term decomposition of k.Based on the above, it is true that:c_{k}=a_{k-3}+b_{k-3}+c_{k-3}Let now k=6 n.

So the seating plan is possible iff the n numbers k(k - 1)/2 are incongruent mod n for k = 1, 2, ... , n. Suppose first that n = 2 m . We have h(h - 1)/2 - k(k - 1)/2 = (h - k)(h + k - 1)/2. If h and k are unequal, then h - k and (h + k - 1) are non-zero. But they have opposite parity, and both are less than 2n, so one is odd and the other is not divisible by a higher power of 2 than 2 m . Thus (h - k)(h + k - 1)/2 cannot be divisible by 2 m . So the seating plan works for n a power of 2. Conversely, suppose n = 2 m (2a + 1). If a  2 m , then take h = 2 m + a + 1, k = a - 2 m + 1. Then h - k = 2 m+1 , h + k - 1 = 2a + 1.

First, let's express (a) and (b) in terms of (x) and (y):   [   a = sqrt{1 + x^2}, quad b = sqrt{1 + y^2}   ]3. We are given (x + y = 1). Let's introduce new variables (m) and (n) such that:   [   a + x = m, quad b + y = n   ]   This implies:   [   a = m - x, quad b = n - y   ]4. Using the given (x + y = 1), we can write:   [   a - x = frac{1}{m}, quad b - y = frac{1}{n}   ]   This implies:   [   2x = m - frac{1}{m}, quad 2y = n - frac{1}{n}   ]5.

Simplifying the product:   [   a cdot b cdot c = frac{2^{3k} cdot 3^{3k-1} cdot 5^{3k}}{9} = frac{(2 cdot 3 cdot 5)^{3k}}{9 cdot 3} = frac{30^{3k}}{27}   ]5. Using the equation (30^k = a + b + c), we substitute (a + b + c) into the product:   [   (a + b + c)^3 = 30^{3k}   ]   [   (a + b + c)^3 = 27 cdot a cdot b cdot c   ]6. From the AM-GM inequality, we know:   [   frac{a + b + c}{3} geq sqrt[3]{abc}   ]   Equality holds when (a = b = c). Therefore, we set (a = b = c).7. Substituting (a = b = c) into the logarithmic equations, we get:   [   2^{3k} = 3a, quad 3^{3k} = 3b, quad 5^{3k} = 3c   ]   Since (a = b = c), we have:   [   2^{3k} = 3^{3k} = 5^{3k}   ]   This implies (k = 0).8. Substituting (k = 0) back into the equations, we get:   [   a = b = c = frac{1}{3}   ]9. Finally, we calculate (a + 3b + 9c):   [   a + 3b + 9c = frac{1}{3} + 3 left(frac{1}{3}right) + 9 left(frac{1}{3}right) = frac{1}{3} + 1 + 3 = frac{13}{3}   ]10. Since (Gamma = frac{13}{3}), and (p = 13) and (q = 3) are relatively prime, we find:   [   p + q = 13 + 3 = 16   ]The final answer is (boxed{16})."},{"problem":"Given that F is the focus of the parabola y^2 = x, and A and B are two points on the parabola such that |AF| + |BF| = 3, determine the distance from the midpoint of line segment AB to the y-axis.","solution":"This problem primarily tests the understanding of the definition of a parabola.
