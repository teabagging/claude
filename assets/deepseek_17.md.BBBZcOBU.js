Should I be worried? How can I help?","Doctor":"Dear Patient,    Thank you very much for your question. In Mitral valve regurgitation or mitral insufficiency, your mitral valve does not close tightly,therefore,it allows to flow blood backward in your heart. Upon severity of Mital valve regurgitation, patients can be no symptoms in mild cases or experience heart palpitations, shortness of breath,fatigue, swollen feet or ankles upon disease progression. Also physician can hear the presence of murmur during auscultation.          In your sister's case, since her mitral valve regurgitation is mild nothing much to worry about it.  However, I would recommend her to take an echocardiogram once every year. Maintaining a healthy blood pressure,doing regular exercises, avoiding from smoking and drinking alcohol,maintaining a normal body weight can be helpful to stop progressing this condition. Again, MVP is a very prevalent condition especially among females. Follow those recommendations and consult a cardiologist if she only develops the above mentioned symptoms. Most people have mild regurgitation throughout their entire life without any progression. Therefore, nothing to worry. If you have more questions, please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD"},{"Patient":"I checked my blood pressure today, just because, and its 140 over 99.

Hyperthyroidism.3. Anemia.4. Damage to heart tissue during heart disease.5. Smoking and Alcohol intoxication.6. Fever  etc.  Also, there are many types of tachycardia,too.  Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial flutter, Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are some of them. In order to diagnose these conditions and differentiate them taking an ECG test is mandatory. Therefore, in your case, I would recommend you to consult your family doctor and take an ECG. Also, I would recommend you to do a thyroid test because many young individuals those who have atrial fibrillation have hyperthyroidism.  Do not worry.  Therefore,see a doctor soon and check your thyroid and do an ECG. If your conditions are related to anxiety or severe stress, your doctor will direct you to a Psychiatrist.  Vagal maneuvers can slow down your heart rate.  Putting an ice pack on face , coughing are examples for Vagal maneuvers which can slow down your heart rate during palpitations. Anyway, I again do not recommend you to rely on those temporary solutions. Seeing a physician and observing his or recommendations is the best solution. I hope that I answered your question.Good Luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

Many thanks. Lewis","Doctor":"Dear Patient,   Thank you very much for your questions. There are different types of pathological heart beating conditions or arrhythmia. It is very hard for a physician without auscultation, physical examination and ECG to diagnose such  conditions. However, thanks to health care magic forum you have a golden opportunity to get an advice from a physician to direct you to a right person before worsening your symptoms. Anyway, according to your description about your condition, I feel that you have premature heart beats. Premature heat beats are subdivided into premature atrial contractions(PACs) and premature ventricular contractions(PVCs).  Also, Atrial fibrillation itself can give an irregular rhythm. Some irregular heart rhythms can be life threatening.               Therefore, my advice is consult your family physician first. Explain him all your physical complaints like skipped heart rate, racing your heart,shortness of breathing, things which can trigger these conditions for example when you are stressed, after physical activity etc. Your family doctor will take an ECG or direct you for an Holter monitor test if it is necessary. Holter monitor is a 24-hour ECG test that is more informative than standard ECG and help your physician to diagnose your condition correctly. If necessary, your doctor will direct you to a Cardiologist. As I feel, your condition is not that serious and can be solved with your family doctor. However, my advice is contact your family doctor soon and do appropriate testing immediately. If you need more help, please write me. Do not worry.Good Luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD"},{"Patient":"My heart beats randomly whenever I run a short distance or carry heavy things, but it also beats crazy when I watch a show I love or I pray out loud. I assume I get nervous or anxious, but I m not so sure because even when I m just sitting or standing it beats so fast or so slow and when it does it hurts.","Doctor":"Dear Patient,    Thank you very much for your question. Normal heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not working. However, latest research have shown that heart rate above 90 beats per minute persistently is not normal. In other words, close to the upper range of normal is not that healthy. However, we are living beings who have feelings and emotions that absolutely have an impact on your heart rate. As you described strong positive or negative emotions can raise your heart rate above normal sometimes even within a day couple of times. And it is absolutely normal.        However, reasons for persistent tachy or bradycardia (slowed heart rate) can be due to underlying heart diseases or thyroid problems. Therefore, I recommend you to see a physician and do an ECG test. Check your thyroid because nervousness and irritation with heart palpitations can be due to an overactive thyroid. Test yourself and free your mind.  Also, anxiety disorder  can cause heart palpitations. In that case, SSR inhibitors can help to ease your anxiety and normalize your heart rate.  Therefore, it is  better to consult your family physician and find out your condition for correct treatment. If you have more questions, please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

His color turned gray and his lips were purple the pain was severe. The ambulance took him to Medical College of Ohio. Keith was in a heart attack and the doctors replaced the stent that leads directly into the heart St. Vincent's put in. Saturday night while still hospitalized at MCO Keith suffered another heart attack. The doctor's tried to replace that same stent they put in because it is completely blocked.

Our family was told his heart needs to heal and he can live with that artery blocked. I know this is not true. Please confirm?

In my opinion, your symptoms could be related to a musculoskeletal pain or anxiety. The resting ECG and MRI can help exclude a serious medical disorder. I would like to review your tests reports if you can upload them for a second opinion. Another option would be to perform a cardiac exercise stress test in order to completely exclude any cardiac issues. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Coming to this point, fever could be related to recurrent infection. While the erectile dysfunction could be related to peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction, probably caused by drinking and Diabetes. For this reason, I would recommend performing further tests: - complete blood count for anemia - PCR, ESR - a chest X-ray study and pulmonary function tests (considering his shortness of breath) - vitamin B1, vitamin B12 plasma levels for possible deficiency - blood electrolytes - HbA1C for diabetes - a cardiac ultrasound and a resting ECG to examine his heart. - nerve conduction studies to examine for possible peripheral neuropathy.

My discomfort is worse in the evening, I don't go back to my  primary until 3wks. In the mean time  Im going to schedule a stress test.  I want make sure I'm on the right track","Doctor":"Hello, and welcome to HCM,It is very normal for blood pressure to fluctuate, even in a matter of minutes and stress definitely can make blood pressure go up temporarily. Blood pressure can be elevated when patients come in to see their doctor for an appointment and then decrease by the end of the visit. This is quite common. Hormones that are produced when we are stressed make the heart beat faster and the blood vessels narrow which results in higher blood pressure.But a blood pressure of more than 140/90 is  high, particularly the diastolic number (more than 90). If there is a stressor in your life that you anticipate will be ongoing, and you have tried behavioral things to bring it down such as various relaxation techniques without benefit, then it would be appropriate to start a low dose antihypertensive (blood pressure lowering) medication. Your blood pressure without stress is already on the borderline for high blood pressure. You may also want to consider a medication for managing ongoing stress such as an \\"SSRI\\". I wish you well, and hope that this information helps."},{"Patient":"Hello, I'm a male 34 years old.I have a warm sensation in the left part of my chest.I had a very bad last week full of stress & anxiety at work.I have hypertension since 13 years & I take 1 (Concor 5 Film Coated tablet) each day at morning.My blood pressure was always perfect using Concor 5 (115/75).I never had such warm feeling before except when I forget to take the Concor 5 tablet in the morning.My blood pressure was unstable allover last week & mostly was (140/89) even with Concor 5.Now the work stress is a bit relived but blood pressure is (125/75) also with Concor 5.Would you please help me with that case.

In many cases, when people are very committed to doing so, lifestyle modifications are enough to bring blood pressure down into a normal range.If you decide to go the lifestyle modification route, it would be a very good idea to get a consultation with a dietician/nutritionist. They can help you to know what food choices are best and how many calories.To start, please eliminate all added sugars such as in sodas. Also, when eating carbohydrates, choose complex carbohydrates such as from whole, minimally processed grains rather than refined white flours.aerobic exercises regularlyI hope this information helps you in your decision process.

Having said that the amount of damage that can happen in to the brain depends directly upon the time his heart was not beating. The chances that he will recover completely are rather less.

It is not absolutely mandatory to undergo angiogram to detect ischemia. There are other methods too. These include stress ECHO and Stress thalium tests (Nuclear MPI scan). If your stress tests comes out to be positive and you are really symptomatic, you need to get an angiogram done. However the angiogram should only be done if you want to get the lesions (which will be diagnosed eventually) fixed by stenting or bypass. Second important this is that patients with kidney disease have 7 to 10 times higher risk of complications during angiogram/stenting/ bypass surgery.Your Cardiologist will also consider all these things to whom you must consult.Hope this provide some insight.

Probably facing your prior medical history, the best revascularisation option to be followed would be a percutaneous coronary angioplasty with eventually stent implantation.Nevertheless, the latter discussion is almost thoroughly a technical one, and depends also by thechnical skills of the medical team, as well as by available techniques at the attending medical center.You should discuss with your attending cardiologist about the above mentioned  issues.Hope to haave been helpful to you.

If no clear evidence are found, a glucose tolerance test should be tried, too. You need to perform a glycosylated hemoglobin test (HbA1C), to make evidence of the last months glucose balance.Whichever be the reason for the actual clinical symptomatology (diabetes or glucose intolerance), your husband needs to check besides the other routine lab tests, also repeatedly blood glucose, his liver and renal function tests, microalbuminuria, as well as an ocular fundoscopy, etc.Some diet and life style modulations are necessary for a better blood glucose control, and to  treat also the other possible coronary risk factors.You need to discuss with his attending cardiologist about these issues.Hope to have been helpful to you.

I moisturise and use topical steroids with some relief any answers?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern, and would like to explain that, as it seems to be a drug related allergy, many times it is difficult to identify the offending cause for that clinical scenario. As it may be related to any of the active ingredients of those antihypertensive drugs, as well as any inactive additive ingredients of those pills. It is necessary to perform a comprehensive investigation supervised by an expert on the field (allergologist), to guide a differential diagnosis by exclusion (withdrawing drugs one by one), as well as specific allergy tests to explore all the possible compounds that could be responsible to allergy development. It is very importat to get successfully through this challenging process, as some antihypertensive drugs should be avoided, leaving the free space to other non responsible safer alternative drugs.Hope to have been helpful to you.

I have read you question completely, i understand your concern and will try to help you in best way possible.First I will explain about the report.It says that you father had heart attack which effected anterior wall of his heart.Heart has many walls and anterior wall is very important in determining the heart function.Report also says that there is left ventricular dysfunction..Left ventricle is also most important part of heart and now as it's damaged it is working at half the efficiency of a normal person.Normal ejection fraction is 60% and he is on 30 so after this heart attack his hearr us working at 50% of normal.Now how to keep him out of danger?These are simple yet important points.1) Save heart from a new attack, this will need him following the diet modifications and regularly taking meds ans doctor followup.2) Don't over load the heart :this will be done by:a) controlling salt intake.b) Taking medsc) Controlling BPd) Avoiding over exertion.3) Stay active but always remember he doesn't have to cross his allowed limits.. he is on 50% of heart activity so his physical activity should also be 50% Here your main goal is to keep it at 30% and dont ket it deteriorate..

In order to raise it as much as you can you should try the following:- stop smoking (if you smoke)- engage in a daily program of mild physical activity- avoid fatty food, saturated fat etc and prefer to use olive oil when oil is needed for cooking.- keep your body weight as close to the ideal as possibleYour low hemoglobin could be related to the gastric bypass. Cutting the stomach may impair the absorption of nutrients including iron and vitamin B12. You should check your ferritin, folic acid and B12 levels in the blood and use supplements if required.

That worked fine until a few months ago when my BP began to drop into the 90/50 range. I was advised to take my meds on an as needed basis. I can go for days with my BP fluctuating between 180/100 range then drop to the 90/ 50 range. When I experience this drop it is accompanied by dizziness and lightheaded feeling, with a noticeable pressure behind my ear drums. What can cause this erratic fluctuation? How can I be both hypertensive and Hypotensive?","Doctor":"Hi.. Welcome to HCM. I have read your question and understand your concerns. Your blood pressure medications need readjustment. Most probably longer acting drug usage will reduce the incidence of fluctuations in blood pressure. Other causes of fluctuations are diabetes related nervous dysfunction(if you have diabetes), intermittent infection or dehydration. Over dosage of blood pressure medications (short acting medicines mainly) So, my advice to you is -  you should do 24 hrs blood pressure monitoring at your home (ambulatory device is available) which will guide your doctor exactly regarding the fluctuations in blood pressure. Your doctor can readjust your blood pressure medications dosage or change the medicines also.. There is no condition like hypotension and hypotension- combined. So don't worry and go for the test I have advised. Thank you. Have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hello. I am a 50 years old woman.

I have read your question and understand your concerns. Usually blood pressure less than 90/6)mmhg is considered as significant hypotension /low blood pressure. So, yes you have problem of hypertension sometimes. So my advice to you is -  ask your doctor about 24 hrs ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. This test will measure your blood pressure automatically at home.. The results of this will guide your doctor about readjustment of your BP medication. Meanwhile if you have any further episode of low blood pressure, you can reduce the dosage to half at that point of time. So, my advice to you is go for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring recording and readjust your blood pressure medications dosage and frequency. Thank you.

Which causes breathing difficulty (due to pulmonary oedema- fluid collection in lungs) and there is impaired gas (oxygen and carbondioxide) exchange in lung and there is retention of carbondioxide in blood blood. So main treatment of in such person is 1) To prevent further decrese in heart pumping - prevent further heart attack. 2) To prevent workload on heart.  Avoid undue exertion, short term illnesses. So it is advisable 1) Restrict daily water intake to 1 liter. 2) Use of diuretics like Lasix which help in removing extra water from blood and keeps lungs free of water. 3) Continue blood thinning medicines that helps in prevention of future heart attack. 4) use of Medicine like Beta blocker, ACE inhibitors or ARBs that help in maintaining the pumping capacity of heart. 5) Regular check of blood pressure and keep it under control. 6) Regular check for lipid level and keep it under control using statins. 7) Diabetes control if present with medicines that can be used with low pumping capacity of heart, insulin is preferred. 8) Avoid smoking, alcohol. 9) Vaccination with pneumonia and flue vaccination that prevent frequent respiratory infections. 10)  Avoid undue exertion. 11) Revascularisation of heart blood vessels which are at risk (this can be known from coronary angiography report) this help in preventing heart attacks.

After heart attack damage to heart muscle is usually permanent and extend of damage depends upon duration between onset of symptoms of heart attack and the time  of revascularisation achieved either with medicine or by stenting or other method.

So it is advisable - 1) Coronary angiography and depend on it permanent revascularisation of at risk blood vessels of heart. 2) Strict compliance with medicine advised (blood thinning, cholesterol lowering, other to preserve heart function like Beta blockers, ACE inhibitor or ARBs. 3) Regular BP  check and keep it under control. 4) Diabetes control with medicine appropriate for current heart function insulin is preferred. 5) Keep cholesterol under control. 6) Regular tolerable exercise after consultation with your cardiologist.. 7)  Avoidance of smoking, alcohol.  As far as heart valves damage is concerned treatment is depends on extent of heart damage (usually leakage) and patient's symptoms, recurrent heart failure may require surgical correction  Kidney damage after heart attack is usually reversible in most of cases.

He born on 36 week having weight 1.9kg. He is doing good but his doctor recognized an extra sound in his heart on 17th May 2014. According to his suggestion, we have showed to a pediatrician who is in service a branch of Narayana Health Care yesterday. He did some scan and told the baby has a medium hole (probably ASD, not sure still from his prescription) in his heart causing the murmur. He told that, this can be closed naturally till 2 years of kids age. He asked us to visit after 2 months. And take care of baby from cold and some precautions. He has given a syrup named some furosemide(not correct) to have 1 dose twice daily. My baby s is having mother milk nicely and gaining proper wait (2.3 kgs now, 27th May). Can you please let me know the in detail about the cure for this? And if possible what is the amount for 1 dose(1ml or ?) for the syrup furosemide(not correct)? Thanks, Probir Paul","Doctor":"Hi,After going through your baby's case I want to clear certain facts about ASD (Atrial septal defect - opening in the heart wall which separate two upper chambers of heart, right and left atria).Every child is born with an opening between the upper heart chambers. It's a normal fetal opening that allows blood to flow away from the lungs before birth. After birth, the opening is no longer needed and usually closes or becomes very small within several weeks or months.Sometimes the opening is larger than normal and doesn't close after birth.Children with an ASD often have no symptoms. If the opening is small, it won't cause symptoms. If the opening is large, the only abnormal finding may be a murmur (noise heard with a stethoscope) and other abnormal heart sounds. In children with a large ASD, there is extra load on lungs and their blood vessels and right side of heart.Furosemide is a diuretic (removes water from blood through urine and reduce blood volume) help in prevention of extra load on lung and heart.It is a cheaper medicine (though I don't know the exact cost).There are chances of developing infection of heart called endocarditis in case of ASD but the chances are extremely low as compared to  other heart defects.As work load on lung is more in ASD there are chances of developing recurrent lung infection.So wait and watch and keep in mind some alarming sign and seek urgent medical attention as -1) Symptoms of lung infection - cough, cold, fever.2) Breathing difficulties.3) Poor feeding, failure to gain weight, poor activity.Keep in touch with your pediatrician."},{"Patient":"I recently had a cholesterol test and my LDL was 130.When I made the appointment they didn t tell me about not eating the night before (test was done in the a-m) 2 years ago my level was below 100.I wonder if eating dinner and breakfast affected the outcome?

Probably your husband is right. That chest fluttering, or heart quivering may be related to any kinds of supraventricular arrhythmia, like atrial flutter or PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). Atrial flutter is frequently a common transitory finding in patients experiencing atrial fibrillation. ventricular rate (measured heart rate by pulse palpation) may seem regular, even in the presence of atrial flutter (because of AV block presence).I would recommend to perform a cardiology visit and an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring to identify any possible arrhythmia passages (if the complains are frequently seen: daily).Hope to have been helpful.

They later done an ECO, Stress ECO, Brain MRI, Brain CT and they all came back clear. My cardiologist wasn t satisfied so he referred me to another Cardiologist interstate in Queensland for a Transcranial Doppler. My results where positive Grade 5 so 2 weeks later they attempted a PFO Closure which was unsuccessful, they could not locate the hole. After surgery they told me it was the first time this had happened to them and they were unsure of why they couldn t find the hole or a reason for the test to be positive at a Grade 5 level and he told me to see a ENT. The ENT i seen done a hearing test, allergy test and another test where they squirt water in your ear. All results come back normal except they discovered a dust might allergy. They later done food allergies and blood tests to check for other virus the results came back with no food allergies but a positive to Epstein Barr Virus. The ENT told me and made me believe it was a rare viral infection from the middle east that could be fixed with vitamins and B12 injections. I went home done some research and discovered over 95% of the population has it, i went and seen my GP the next day to discuss my results which she had sent to her to discover i do not have a current infection and the ENT had lied.

Thank you for asking on HCM! I understand your concern, and would like to explain that the answer to your question depends on whether your father has experienced a myocardial infarction, or an unstable angina (both are clinical presentations of a heart attack). When a myocardial infarction has happened, it is important to closely monitor the patient for possible arrhythmic event (sometimes dangerous and life-threatening), irrespective of a successful coronary revascularisation. When only unstable angina was present, then after successful revascularisation, there is no need for any special medical monitoring. You should discuss wit attending physician about the severity of his heart attack and possible clinical implications.Nevertheless, after a couple of days the risks mostly fade and nothing to worry about.

Colchicine has the potential to show dangerous side effects (hematological, digestive, etc). So I would recommend a safer option. I recommend you to talk with your doctor about that issue.

If it keeps going on these lower values, and you experience additional complains, like excessive fatigue, dizziness, etc, it is necessary to consult your doctor for a comprehensive medical check up (careful physical exam, resting ECG, and if necessary a cardiac ultrasound).  Regarding your lower back pain, easily bruising, it is important to perform a differential diagnosis. You need to consult with your doctor and possibly to perform an abdominal ultrasound; and also some blood tests, like AST, ALT, bilirubin, CPK, PCR, BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, lumbar backbone X ray study, etc.So, you don't have to worry too much, but you need to talk to your doctor immediately.Hope to have been helpful to you.

It feels like there is a hiatus - as though my heart has stopped for a moment followed by a stronger than normal beat. If I feel my pulse there is indeed a gap in the rhythm of my heart which corresponds with the feeling of the missed beat . I was told by a cardiologist about 20 years ago that I get an extra systolic beat and then a post extra systolic beat which is the one I feel. At the moment I am getting this a few times a minute. In the past it can go on like this for days or weeks. I always find it mildly disconcerting and wonder if there is a way of encouraging my heart to return to its normal rhythm. I don t get any other symptoms or pain.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding your complains, I would explain that when you have an extrasystolic beat, it is followed (after a compensatory pause) by a post-extrasystolic beat that is stronger and disturbing.For a better evaluation of those ectopic beats, I would recommend you to perform an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring, in order to investigate the nature of those extrasystoles, as well as their quantity.It is also needed to study the heart structure and function by a cardiac ultrasound, coupled with some additional lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone blood levels, chest X ray, serum electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, etc).If you have a structurally normal heart and the extrasystolic arrhythmia is not clinically important (according to Holter monitoring), probably you are not going to get prescribed drugs).

I thought it was anxiety attacks b/c of the stress of school.But it s gotten to the point that this increased hear rate is almost constant instead of intermittently throughout the day. In the last 1.5 months, I ve tried taking Xanax 0.5 mg & it seemed to help a few times but doesn t anymore. Then I was switched to Lorazepam 2.5 & it doesn t help either. I m not able to exercise right now b/c I had my rotator cuff repaired just 8 weeks ago. Could this be a more serious cond n & not just anxiety? I don t smoke. I don t drink caffeine. I m not on any decongestants. And I DO drink A LOT of water. My daily medications are Levothyroxin 0.5mg, Nexium, Effexor XR 75mg/day, Concerta 27mg bid, & now the Lorazepam. It is very difficult for me to sleep (as well as study, for that matter) when my heart rate is so high so I have one rum & Sprite before bed just to calm down & sleep. I often wake up in the middle of the night b/c my heart is suddenly racing. Here is some background information that you may/may not find helpful. when I was ~20 years old, my mom noticed that after walking up a set of stairs, or even just walking up a small hill, I would be VERY short of breath & my heart rate got up to 160 bpm at a time. This continued when I was in college & working out on a daily basis & healthy. My workout would consist of at least 30 min. on an elliptical & never had to stop b/c I was short of breath or my heart was racing. I went to a Cardiologist & he did the stress test, echocardiogram, etc. . . . He then referred me to an electrophysiologist who performed a table tilt test & throughout all this testing, I think I wore a Holter monitor at least 4 times. The Dr. said that yes, my heart rate does tend to race during very little activity but it also came down very quickly too so he wasn t worried about it. He said that if this continued on into my late 20 s, he would want to go in & burn a portion of my SA node. I wasn t too keen on that. I was put on Atenolol & it worked GREAT. The problem COMPLETELY went away. But then I had to start taking allergy injections & apparently Atenolol & allergy injections don t mix. So, now not only do I have the racing heart rate/shortness of breath problem that i ve had for ~16 years but I can also just be sitting on my couch & suddenly my heart rate is well over 100bpm. Earlier while I was studying, it got up to 128bpm. I ve been on Concerta for ~1 year now & I know one of the side effects can be an increased heart rate. I m also well aware that there is a problem w/overdiagnosis of ADHD. BUT, I m DEFINITELY NOT one of those ppl. I can t tell you how much it helps me study & it s my understanding that 54mg/day isn t a very high dose.

Can you advise me???","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM.I understand your query and concern.High blood pressure  should be treated even though its under control or else will lead to complications like Dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemia to the brain.Best treatment for elevated blood pressure is through drugs like beta blockers and Ace inhibitors.Before that adequate management and work up is needed.I advise you to have a baseline 2 dimensional echocardiography,ECG and lipid profile to assess the basic cardiac reserve of your heart.Restrict the intake of salt to less than 6g/day.Regular physical exercise in the form of brisk walk for 20 min a day for 5 days a week.Drugs like antihypertensives and antiarrhythmics will help.Reduce the intake of fatty and fried food.One pomegranate a day will help to keep your heart at good pace without clot formation. Stress management is most vital in your case.So Consult a Cardiologist for further expert management.Post your further queries if any.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing heart palpitations for almost 2 years.I have visited a heart specialist and it was recommended that I have a holter attached for 24 hrs. in order to observe the symtoms. The first time irregularities showed and it seemingly was connected to the leaking mitral valve I have , however, there appeared to be no deterioration of the valve so It was suggested that I monitor the symtoms and go back if necessary-whilst making some life style changes etc. I had to go back to have another holter attached some months later, which again showed palpitations occuring--was told not to worry and if they continued may have to go on beta blockers. The thing is, I do not experience severe symptoms during the 24hr holter phase ,however,palpitations can last for up to 8 hrs at times --leaving me totally exhausted. I was awoken last evening at midnight and experience them for the remainder of the night sleeping a little . I am going to go back to the heart specialist (very soon) but as i was doing some research I came across this site. An observation and comment would be welcome.","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCM.I understand your query and concern.Rapid heart rate and Dizzy spells can be a definite feature of heart rhythm disturbances.Irregular heartbeat is known to alter the blood supply to the brain leading to impaired function in a transient way.Few drugs like beta blockers are certainly known to reduce the heart rate and accelerate the dizzy spells.I advise you to have a complete 24 hr holter ECG which can accurately determine the cardiac conduction abnormalities.Monitor your blood pressure and heart rate.Drugs like Isoproterenol will help to increase the heart rate.Drugs like amiodarone can also help to minimise the rhythm irregularities.A 2 Dimensional echocardiography will help to assess the functional reserve of the heart ruling out organic heart lesions.Electrophysiological study and Radiofrequency ablation will also help to eliminate abnormal foci of rhythm.Consult your cardiologist for expert management."},{"Patient":"I just had something hit me, I started with my heart pounding 100 miles a minute, then my head starts pounding, I couldn t breathe, and my body was burning from the inside out.

It was determined that with me having so many CT scans for other medical conditions that they observe the ascending aorta via echocardiogram because of concern of developing radiation from recurrent CT scan. In 2013 the ascending aorta was at 4.0 according to echocardiogram done by cardio surgeon.

Regarding your concern I would explain that dealing with clogged arteries after bypass, there are 2 options; the first option, more comfortable for the patient and less risky is undergoing  PCI with stent implantation. PCI would be preferable to  surgery if it is feasible. The other option is to redo bypass. This way is more unpleasant for the patient, more traumatic and has potential risk for complications (greater than the first operation).

Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding your concerns I would recommend as follows: You should monitor frequently your BP values even for a couple of days and with your measured values to consult your doctor (GP or internist). If high BP values persist, then some secondary reasons of high BP should be sought first.Your cholesterol level is OK. You don't need any therapy for that.Alkaline phosphatase is abnormally high coupled with a high ESR. Some additional blood tests are necessary to define the cause. A possible inflammation should be excluded first.Vit D level is also abnormally low (moderate deficiency). Renal function tests, parathyroid evaluation, and electrolyte levels (including calcium) is necessary for the differential.Vit B12 deficiency is present, so a comprehensive check up should be worked out to identify the reason. Vegetarian diet, malabsorption, hyperthyroidism, megaloblastic anemia, any gastro- intestinal , abdominal or elsewhere masses should be excluded first. For all the above reasons of investigation, I would recommend: (1) First a careful medical check up by an internist (physical examination) an medical history gathering.(2) Several blood tests, like complete blood count, PCR, liver and renal function tests, Thyroid and parathyroid hormone levels, serum electrolytes, ECG, Chext X ray study, abdominal ultrasound, complete urine test, serum proteins evaluation, LDH, gama GGT, Schilling test, eventual fibrogastroscopy and other optical studies (as needed).

I understand your concern and would like to explain you that Marfan syndrome is one of the many fibrillopathies (connective tissue disorders), that affects many body organs including aortic wall structure. Aortic wall consistency may be damaged, manifested with aortic dilatation and aneurisms, sometimes leading to aortic wall dissection. Thus, it is of utmost importance to follow up aortic dimensions and structure, in order to be right in time for any needed intervention. Facing your actual aortic diameter, seems that it is around  the upper limit of normal. So, you have to be very careful with your hypertensive therapy. Beta-blockers (Atenolol) are the main stay of therapy. You have to follow your doctor advice to start  Losartan even at a higher dose, if it is judged necessary for controlling blood pressure. Yo may try other anti-hypertensive medications as well (always under medical advice and supervision). If aortic diameter increases more than 50-55 mm, despite appropriate therapy, then a strict supervision for a near and potential aortic surgery would be necessary (to avoid a fatal aortic dissection and rupture).Hope to have been helpful.Greetings!

Regarding you concern I would explain that in your situation there are some elements that may trigger those abnormal ectpic beats.(1) Thyroiditis with acute hyperthyroidism, or even susequent hypothyroidism may trigger arrhythmia, mainly supraventricular (extrasystolic arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation or flutter, etc).

The management of clinical restenosis/blockade is usually to repeat the PCI with balloon dilatation and placement of a drug-eluting stent. Once a patient has had restenosis, the risk of the second restenosis is further increased. The risk factors for restenosis are diabetes, myocardial infarction, long lesions, small diameter vessels, and suboptimal initial PCI result. Anti-platelet drugs (aspirin,clopidrogel) and statin +/- nitrates are all that are required for those patients who are unwilling for Target lesion revascularization (TLR) or target vessel revascularization (TVR).

Recently thought chest congestion was related to respiratory issue, but walk in clinic doctor referred me to a cardiologist.  What could the concern be?  I have had varicose vein surgery in the past.  Vital signs were good, respirations 22.  Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi! Chest congestion can be due to respiratory as well as cardiological causes. Respiratory causes include lung injury due to drugs, chemicals, infections etc. But cardiological causes are far more common. Basically when the left side of your heart malfunctions in some way it is unable to pump blood to your body. As a result a back pressure is created due to stasis of blood in the left side of your heart. It is finally transmitted to your lungs. The increased pressure in your lungs causes the blood vessels in your lungs to leak out fluid which results in chest congestion. Your doctor must have suspected some cause like mitral stenosis or regurgitation or coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy or some such condition. So he referred you to a cardiologist. It might not have been obvious simply from vital signs. A thorough clinical examination and investigations like electrocardiogram and echocardiogram will help detect the actual cause. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have been taking 25m maxzide for years but the last year I am experiencing a pounding heart a day later and for a few days after.

The end systolic volume is 18 mL. The ejection fraction is 82%. There is normal contractility of all segments of the left ventricle. There is decreased uptake of the myocardial tracer in the anteroapical wall seen on the rest and stress images. Conclusions: The ejection fraction is 82%. There is no wall motion abnormalities. There is a fixed anteroapical defect, likely consistent with breast attenuation. There is no reversible ischemia. What does this mean?","Doctor":"Hi, Entities like end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, ejection fraction are related to one of important chamber of heart called left ventricle. Contraction of Left ventricle pushes blood in aorta and supply blood to whole body organs. End diastolic volume means blood volume in left ventricle after its filling. End systolic volume means blood volume in left ventricle after Contraction. Ejection fraction means percentage of blood that eject from left ventricle during systole (Contraction).  Normal value 55  to 60% at rest it increases with exercise. Regional wall motion abnormalities means abnormal movement of part of Left ventricle which indicates damaged myocardium (heart muscle) of Left ventricle due to lack of blood supply (after heart attack). It's absence means no damage to myocardium. Myocardial tracer used to know viability of myocardium, decreased uptake means decreased viability. But in most cases decreased uptake is associated with regional wall motion abnormalities which indicates decreased blood supply. Decreased uptake with exercise as compared to rest is more significant. Breast attenuation means due to Breast tissue there is false appearance of decreased uptake, usually it is fixed that means constant at rest and during exercise."},{"Patient":"I had a heart transplant 9/20/2005.

In the presence of compromised heart pumping and significant aortic valve blockage heart can not generate adequate cardiac output (cardiac out put in simple term means blood volume pumped by heart in aorta per minute).In resting state cardiac output generated by such heart is sufficient to fulfill need for oxygen and blood of body.But when there is increased need for oxygen and blood supply of body, despite of extra work heart cannot generate adequate cardiac output, and there is development of heart failure (let ventricular failure) which manifest as shortening of breath, breathlessness (doe to lung conestion), there may be swelling over legs, chest pain (heart attack).Then what should you do1) continue your blood thinning medicines, antiplatelets.2) keep in control your blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol levels if any abnormality there.3) use of diuretics that help in removing extra water from body and avoid lung congestion.4) use of medications like B blockers, ACEI/ARBs that help in preserving heart function.5) there may be need for aortic valve surgery, dilatation (valvotomy) or replacement ( valvoplasty) depending on your symptomatology, pressure gradient across aortic valve, presence of concomitant aortic regurgitation.I think this information may be sufficient to solve your queries."},{"Patient":"Hi, I went to the Urgent care walk in clinic due to frequent palpatations. I have been dealing with palps for quite some time and only seem to be more noticeable after strenuous workouts. Slight chest discomfort, a little short of breath but not much. I take 25 mg atenelol, 10 mg Lisinopril for my blood pressure. As I mentioned before the last 10 days I ve had frequent palps which is unlike anything ive had before. I recently started a new job, seperated from a 7 year relationship and have been under a lot of stress. The EKG this morning read abnormal but the doctor said it was nothing to worry about.

What is the meaning for hypertension sepsis, troponin, demand ischemia due to sepsis and then leading to acute coronary artery syndrome & shock?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding your concern I would like to explain that sepsis is only one step to a broad spectrum of body distress; ranging from high-energy consuming demands to multi-organs dysfunction and failure, and to the final high-lethal state of septic shock. So at the beginning is present a hyperdynamic dynamic state; and possibly hypertension. After that, as micro-circulatory and cellular dysfunction follow (as the result of the microbiological and toxins effects), appears tissue ischemia throughout the body, comprising even myocardial ischemia (even in the presence of insignificant coronary lesions, or in their absence). This mechanism explains demand ischemia. Metabolism turns highly to an anaerobic one, and tissue injury markers appear in the blood (one of them is troponin, etc). When this vicious cycle is not interrupted during early stage, this is a lethal disorder. Frequently it is found septic shock heart pattern (with diffuse and patchy lesions in the absence of distinct coronary lesions). Hope to have answered your question. I wish a fast recovery to your husband! Greetings! Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I have been using approvel to reduce my bp since 2004 till last when my doctor prescribed me coveram since bp was a bit higher than normal, and almost a year now of been using coveram I have been having diarrhea and a peripheral neuropathy where I can t use my muscles like before what should I do?

Though there are other possible causes of decreased heart pumping like infection, high blood pressure, diabetes in these case there is possibility of improved heart pumping after tratment. As you have been told that your mother had heart attack in the past by your doctor, this consideration must be based on echocardiography report.So there is really less chance of improvement in heart pumping in your mother, but we can definitely try to maintain current heart pumping by appropriate treatment.We can do following for your mother (depending on her current infection, her physical activity and tolerance)1) To start her on blood thinning medicine (antiplatelets)2) Control her blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol if problem present.3) Coronary angiography which will tell about degree and number of blockages in different blood vessels of heart depending on which we can plan further management.4) Start her on diuretics, b blockers, ACEI/ARBs, only if tolerated in current senario."},{"Patient":"I m 58, a diabetic and on many meds.

He was told it is enterococcus faecalis.  He has had the same partner for 3 years. He is asking:  Is this transmittable through intercourse or oral sex?  What is best antibiotic for this bacteria? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, Enterococci are most commonly transmitted due to poor hygiene. Since it is naturally present in the gastrointestinal tract, E. faecalis is found in fecal matter. Improper cleaning of items containing fecal matter, or not washing hands after restroom use, can increase the risk of bacterial transmission. Everyday objects such as telephones, doorknobs, towels, and soaps can also contain E. faecalis. The bacteria can spread throughout hospitals if healthcare workers do not wash their hands between patients. If not thoroughly cleaned, catheters or dialysis ports can also transmit infection. Enterococci are eradicated with a combination of certain cell wall–active drugs (e.g., penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, piperacillin, vancomycin) plus an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin, streptomycin) is used to achieve the bactericidal activity.

Symptoms became more life altering / depilating in 2004 and have progressed until now. I was diagnosed with POTS & IST at the Mayo Clinic in July of 2010. I am in several studies at Mayo and Ciders Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. Ciders diagnosed me with Coronary slow flow and ischemia was evident in my heart during a subsequent cardiac MRI with adenosine. They unblinded a study because I lost 9% of my heart function in one month taking Ranolizine in the study they were conducting. Currently I am having many arrhythmias and becoming more compromised in my ability to work and accomplish daily life’s tasks. I have seen MANY doctors in multiple cities and until now few knew much about POTS. My question is what new information is available. I am accustom to ignoring extreme changes in BP and HR and through CATH procedures have shown no blockage so I am assuming the arrhythmias are just something I have to live with. (I have had them they are just worse.) Drugs have always made me worse. I am under the care of a local cardiologist. Have had many tests I am extremely healthy with he exception of all of this. Most published studies are older but finally there are a few newer ones. Because my heart has been beating so fast for so long I believe it is prematurely aging it thus motivating me to do what ever I can to slow that process? (My resting HR averages over 100.) Any suggestions? Any studies you recommend or new published studies? I would like to differentiate what subtype I have if that is possible.

Also this diagnosis could be coronary vasospasms which are difficult to detect, have you consulted an electrophysiologist? I have seen POTS usually as a result of another underlying disorder. You should shots triggers for these conditions such as dehydration, caffeine, alcohol, decongestants, tobacco, etc.What symptoms do you experience during these episodes? Do you get headaches or profuse sweating? This would prompt a work up for a rare condition called a pheochromocytoma. There are many possibilities but I would recommend electrophysiology and internal medicine consults.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

After being ill for about 5 months I had an anxiety attack while driving on the motorway and now the doctors always revert back to anxiety as the root to my problems.even though I was ill for 5 months prior to the anxiety attack. I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure and Im on my 4th brand of BP tablets and beta blockers. I admitted myself into A and E on numerous occasions with chest pains, light headedness and abdominal bloating and diarrhoea but after an ECG, blood pressure and blood tests they say it s probably a reaction to the BP medication. I have been on an ECG monitor for 5hrs in the hospital, had a 24hr portable ECG fitted, loads of blood tests, 24hr urine sample, cardio scan (the one with the jelly) and liver scan (because I drunk heavily for years but now have cut down dramatically). All tests have come back as OK but I m still suffering. My wife has been diagnosed with Helicobacter Pylori which, after extensive research on the internet, it s not certain whether or not it is contagious so I m being sent for a breath test on Wednesday and a 24 hr BP test on Friday. My symptoms are: Chest pain (front and back), chest tightness, palpitations (periodically), stomach pain, excessive gas (both ends), stomach swelling with an aching feeling in the stomach and sides, periods of diarrhoea (the last bout lasted 30 days), chronic fatigue, occasional blurred vision which lasts a full day, skin blotching on the arms, I can only lie on my back when sleeping…if I lie on my side I get weird sensations in my chest which makes me jump, I sometimes have trouble sleeping, movement of air from stomach to anus (rumbling), when driving I start feeling nauseous and get tight chested (it seems to be the car vibrations which causes it), I sometimes feel light headed (while sitting or laying down) and feels like Im going to faint, pressure in my temples and tingling sensations in my arms and legs. Can you please help?","Doctor":"Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome. Helicobacter pylori cannot be excluded either. For this reason, I agree with your doctor on the breath test. I would also recommend trying an antiacid and avoid spicy food.

I was prescribed seemingly strong antibiotics (looking at what other diseases it is used to treat), doxycyclin. I have learned that in some countries this is not considered an STD since it's presenton 70% of people. I also found a study online that advises against treating ureaplasma without any symptoms (because of the development of bacteria resistance), but also found articles that says that it's a very dangerous infection which can lead to infertility or joint problems. So I'm properly confused as what to do about it. Should I take the antibiotics? What about my partner? I don't want to develop antibiotics resistance either, or well I don't want the bacterias in me to do that at least. Can you please share your thoughts about this with me? Thank you, S","Doctor":"Hello, Ureaplasma urealyticum is a common bacteria that lives in the vagina. Usually, it does not cause any problems, and while it has been suspected to cause many different kinds of infection, it is hard to say whether this bacteria was responsible, or if it was due to another bacteria. While it is possible that it could cause an infection that would lead to infertility or many other problems, if you are not having any symptoms, such as vaginal discharge, fever, or pain, then it is not causing any damage, and there is no reason you need to treat it. So I would recommend not taking the antibiotics unless you have any symptoms that suggest an infection. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

She got it from her son who was diagnosed by the Dr. He had the vaccine last year. He is now 6. She said her Dr told her she can go out into the public once her fever comes down. She has been on her antibiotics one or two days. I am just concerned that she is still contagious.","Doctor":"Hello,whooping cough is very contagious and transmission may occur even three weeks after the first symptoms. The antibiotics may reduce the risk for transmission but sometimes they don't! When the temperature is normal for at least 24 hours (without paracetamol-acetaminophen-ibuprofen or other drugs that reduce the fever) then the risk for transmission should be lower but this is not 100% certain in every case. At least 5 days with an appropriate antibiotic regimen should have been completed before considering to withdraw preventive measures. Besides that a carrier state is possible as well, which means that a person may harbor the pathogen (without showing any signs of disease) and transmit it to other individuals. Having been vaccinated against Bordetella pertussis is protective but not always. A documented diagnosis of whooping cough requires caution for 3 weeks if you'd like to be sure you won't get the disease.I hope I've answered your question.

I had my piercer change out my jewelry for a hoop i had bought at a store that sells lots of body jewelry. Two days later, I have a smallish, red bump right above my piercing with tenderness around my nostril. I don t know the material of the hoop but I am not allergic to anything but mosquitos so it can t be that. I tried a hot sea salt soaks today and it reduced the redness and tenderness but now it s forming green crusties around the piercing. So here are my two questions: 1.

How long does it take for a nose piercing infection to go away with sea salt soaks?","Doctor":"Hi, No, the green discharge can imply that the infection is unfortunately worsening. There is no specific time interval that it may take for an area to heal with the soaks though it normally takes 4 to 7 days. If there is no improvement or any worsening then you may need a course of topical or oral antibiotics.

Generally, when the pain and swelling last for a longer duration, there are high chances of the wound is infected.

Contracting either a virus or a bacterium does not necessarily mean that the new host will get meningitis though. Many bacteria and viruses may cause a variety of infections. For example some viruses which usually cause gastroenteritis may also cause meningitis. Contracting such a virus from a patient with meningitis is more likely to present with gastroenteritis.In any case if you'd like to reduce the risk of transmission then you'd better avoid close contact with your mother.

I’m kind of worrying because last week Thursday I started spotting and then wed is when all that started happening so I’m hoping it is just food poisoning mild food poisoning","Doctor":"Hello, It may be due to food. You should have mentioned exactly what food you have eaten. Some sea fish contains some toxins (Ciguatera poisoning) which can cause headache. In your case, the time between eating the suspected food and appearance of symptoms is few hours, I should say that it may be bacterial cause. Although, if  time between eating the suspected food and appearance of symptoms is 12 hours or more, it may be viral cause also. But it does not seems to be a moderate food poisoning also. It may be a mild case. There is absolutely nothing to worry about. You can do a Blood Routine Test Some further prevention tips: 1. Wash your hands, utensils and food surfaces often. Wash your hands well with warm, soapy water before and after handling or preparing food. Use hot, soapy water to wash utensils, cutting boards and other surfaces you use. Keep raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods. When shopping, preparing food or storing food, keep raw meat, poultry, fish and shellfish away from other foods. This prevents cross-contamination. 2. Cook foods to a safe temperature. The best way to tell if foods are cooked to a safe temperature is to use a food thermometer. You can kill harmful organisms in most foods by cooking them to the right temperature. 3.Cook ground beef to 160 F (71.1 C); steaks, roasts and chops, such as lamb, pork and veal, to at least 145 F (62.8 C). Cook chicken and turkey to 165 F (73.9 C). Make sure fish and shellfish are cooked thoroughly. 4. Refrigerate or freeze perishable foods promptly — within two hours of purchasing or preparing them. If the room temperature is above 90 F (32.2 C), refrigerate perishable foods within one hour. Defrost food safely. Don't thaw food at room temperature. The safest way to thaw food is to defrost it in the refrigerator. If you microwave frozen food using the \\"defrost\\" or \\"50 percent power\\" setting, be sure to cook it immediately. 5. Throw it out when in doubt. If you aren't sure if a food has been prepared, served or stored safely, discard it. Food left at room temperature too long may contain bacteria or toxins that can't be destroyed by cooking. Don't taste food that you're unsure about — just throw it out. Even if it looks and smells fine, it may not be safe to eat. For now, drink plenty of water and clean foods and light diet. You can also drink some fruit juice. Antibiotic can also be taken not more than 5 days (as you have no sure shot evidence of causal organism) Next, you should do the blood routine. Hope I have answered your query.

He came home from school yesterday with these symptoms & stayed home today. He seemed to be ok earlier today & said he felt better, but now he says the headache is back & he s very fatigued. His fever is back as well. Is this the flu?","Doctor":"Hello,his symptoms sound a lot like the flu. Despite that diagnosing anything from afar is impossible and a proper - in person - medical assessment is required. Influenza usually presents with temperatures higher than 37.8 degrees of Celsius and the body aches are typically very intense. Headache and sore throat are common.

He began antibiotics tonight, so what else should I do to ensure his recovery and that I do not contract this?","Doctor":"Hello, Getting the pneumonia vaccine reduces but doesn’t eliminate, your risk of getting pneumonia. There are things you can do instead of or in addition to the pneumonia vaccine. Healthy habits, which help to keep your immune system strong, may reduce your risk of getting pneumonia. Good hygiene also may help. Things you can do include: Avoid smoking. Wash your hands often in warm, soapy water. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you can’t wash your hands.  Avoid exposure to people who are ill whenever possible. Get enough rest.  Eat a healthy diet that includes lots of fruits, vegetables, fibre, and lean protein. Keeping children and babies away from people who have colds or the flu may help reduce their risk. Also, make sure to keep little noses clean and dry, and teach your child to sneeze and cough into their elbow instead of their hand. This can help reduce the spread of germs to others.

Then, when the immune system is weakened, or for other unknown reasons, MRSA can cause skin infections like yours and your husbands, or can cause even more serious infections. So, I would advise your son not to touch your rash if possible, as I think it would increase his chances of picking it up. However, he may already be carrying it by now. Once your infections clear, you might ask your doctor about trying to clear the MRSA bacteria from all of your bodies.

Am now taking a 10 day round of both clindamycin and bactrum to treat it. Thing is, blood work I had 5 days ago when I got started taking my clindamycin and bactrum now shows that I have no signs of infection in my blood, from CBC to my C-Protein. The redness is not gone and will turn dark red before going back to a lighter shade when i move my toe around like when I am walking, but I have no other symptoms whatsoever, and I feel totally normal head to toe. I would be appreciated if a few of you could take the time to give me your medical opinion. Do I really have a bone infection?","Doctor":"Hi, I'm sorry to hear you've been diagnosed with a bone infection. I can understand your question as the treatment for a bone infection takes a long time, often for at least six weeks. If the MRI showed signs of infection and other markers like C-reactive protein were high, you could presume there was a bone infection. If they did a blood culture that grew a bacteria, or did a bone biopsy that showed infection, that would support the diagnosis, but is not absolutely necessary. Even though all your blood work looks good now, and you don't have any symptoms, I would encourage you to finish the treatment your doctor has started until complete, since it takes a long time to clear an infection in the bone, and it may seem like you're healed but if you stop antibiotics early the infection may come back.

I am light headed when I stand up and I usually need to close my eyes for a few moments before I can continue walking. Also recently I thought I had strep until I spit up two blood circles I don’t know if these two are related","Doctor":"Hello,welcome to 'Ask a Doctor' service. I've gone through your query and I can say that an infection caused by Streptococcus is not supposed to present this way. Lightheadedness when standing up from the recumbent or sitting position is usually caused either by postural hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure that normalizes very fast) or positional vertigo (which usually lasts for seconds). I can't say more about that without examining you first. Your doctor can examine you and confirm or exclude postural hypotension easily. Regarding the blood more investigation may be required. If you have rhinitis or any other disorder that explains the presence of blood then you can just 'wait and see'. Otherwise investigation would be required starting with an inspection of the upper respiratory tract (an ENT can check the most distant parts of it) in search for inflammation, tumors or other causes of bleeding. If there's no lesion in the upper respiratory tract then the lower respiratory tract will have to be assessed starting with radiological tests (chest X-ray and perhaps CT-scan).A less common cause of spitting blood is upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This disorder is not uncommon but this type of presentation is. We usually expect a patient with serious bleeding to vomit blood or to exhibit signs of serious hypotension (cold sweating, faintness, tachycardia, thirst, etc) and melena (shiny, smelly, tarry, liquid black stool).In any case don't forget to discuss these matters with your primary care physician! Distant consultation is not a substitute for a real visit to your doctor for the reasons I've implied above.I hope I've answered your query! Let me know if I can further assist you.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hi few days back dog bite happened for me same day with in 30 min had TT injection and next day evening onwards started the anti rabies vaccine course. I have taken 5 injections. Please let me know started course after 36 hours started the anti rabies course is there any effect please guide on this right now 40 days completed till now no issue. If anything further I have to follow?","Doctor":"Hello, I've gone through your query and I want to reassure you that you've done everything you could. Current guidelines suggest even less doses (4) so if you've done 5 you're done. The vaccine should be started as soon as possible but it's never too late unless symptoms have already appeared. It's good news that you haven't had any symptoms so far and you're not very likely to develop symptoms hereafter. If you do, then a doctor's assessment (in person) would be necessary. Unless you know that the dog was diseased, you shouldn't worry too much about it! Hope I have answered your query.

I do have a history of headache/migraine, but this is terrible and seems to be viral since there was fever at onset. are these symptoms of viral meningitis? no vomiting, or sleepiness - can t sleep because of the head pain. Imitrex didn t help, nor did extra strength Tylenol and sudafed, in case it s sinus trouble. any other remedies out there? sinus drainage clear - no sign of infection there","Doctor":"Hello, Viral meningitis may indeed present this way although you can never be certain about the diagnosis without a lumbar puncture. The apparent lack of fever after the first 24 hours despite the continuation of the body aches and the rest of the symptoms does not rule out meningitis because fever may be lacking altogether in up to 5% of cases and also because the painkillers may have masked the fever - you might have had fever but the painkillers eliminated it. Migraine is possible as well particularly if you have a history of migraines and you recognize the pattern of the pain. Stiff neck is not expected in migraine through but a stiff neck can only be evaluated by a doctor. So in conclusion, meningitis is possible with the symptoms you have. Therefore a visit to the ER is appropriate. Hope I have answered your query.

As of now you can take a short course of antibiotics for five days, preferably amoxicillin. You can also take acetaminophen for fever and pain.

Have any idea what might be wrong with it?","Doctor":"Hello Facial skin lesion, if this is not the wound or injury by any sharp object then it might be the insect bite.

Is it possible that i have rabies? I never see any changes on my puppy though, he's eating,  drinking water and playing like he normally does.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Rabies is not a common infection though dogs are one of the possible vectors of this infection. The most common reason for acute onset of nausea and vomiting is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Viral infections are more common than bacterial and they tend to last a few days only. Though rabies is not a common cause, you should still consider having the dog vaccinated. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have sebaceous cyst which got infected and abscess was removed with procedure and they asked me to go to surgeon for removal of cyst. after 4 weeks of abscess removal , it started draining again. do i really have to do surgery or can cyst go without surgery.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare Magic!You can treat a sebaceous cyst with the help of incision and drainage of the cyst as well as a prescription for antibiotics based on the culture of the organism that is infecting the cyst(sample should be sent).The cyst is incised and drained and followed by treatment with antibiotics when the infection subsides and pus stops forming.My recommendation would be to excise the cyst (removal of cyst) so that this problem does not repeat( chance of recurring if not excised) and this is a basic procedure which will benefit you greatly.

He did an ekg and found nothing wrong, but I didn;t think it was heart related. He said he thought the pain was due to me eating spicy food or hot sauce, because I liked it. I took his advice for a little while and stayed away from spicy food..that didn t help I eventually went back for an annual physical and at that time had issues with my grown, specifically my area of my left testicle...he had no idea what it could be as he could not find any issues, including a hernia. but sent me to a urologist. I saw 2 different ones in a years time...one had me take medication for a hydrocele he thought. Took the medication, pain subsided. the pain came back, I went back to the same urology office, but a new doctor saw me as the last one had retired. he said my file said nothing about a hydrocele, but actually said I had a hernia and recommended changes to my underwear and added support. I did that for some time and stayed away from strenuous activity. The pain never really subsided and in fact it spread to my hips and upper thighs. During this time I went back to that same uriolgoist office and saw a nurse practitioner. She found nothing of substance and sent me back to my primary, who did another exam and could find evidence of a hydricele OR hernia and recommended a CT scan of my pelvic area. I had that done about a year ago and it was inconclusive. the pain subsided in that time and so I have not gone back as I have gotten no answers really. The pain now resides in my groin/pelvis area, outside part fo the hip and now in my knees.

I was hit with a golf ball line drive in the forehead. CT scan showed sinusitis immediately after injury but no fractures. The radiologist originally thought it may be a CSF leak at first but ruled that out after a second opinion. Since then I have had chronic migraines, chronic sinus infections, in both the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, chronic pain and insomnia. in Feb I was hospitalized in ICU due to a severe sphenoid infection and cellutis. Doctor on call said he had only seen my condition twice in 32 years and I would need emergency surgery. CTscan showed severely infected sphenoid but MRI did not show the same result so they opted not to do surgery and give me multiple rounds of IV antibiotics which tamped down the infection. The infection continues to come back so I have a sphenoid sinus surgery scheduled with septoplasty as well in a couple of weeks. Is it common for TBI patients to have this extent of sinus issues?

I washed the wound after 3 hours and taken Inj: TT, Human Immunoglobulin and 5 doses of Rabies vaccine. But I am having twitching muscle around the bite area. what to do? Should I be revaccinated? And, after vaccination, can rabies develop?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If you've done 5 doses then you've done even more than the necessary doses (4 doses seem to be as effective as 5). The level of protection is probably the same. Having done the immunoglobulin too is all you could have done. Unfortunately this \\"treatment\\" is not 100% effective. There have been treatment failures in the past. Some of them have been attributed to the immune status of the involved individual (immunocompromised individuals are more likely to experience failures), other cases have not been adequately explained. If symptoms that may resemble rabies occur then measuring the antibodies against rabies may provide additional information. If you haven't developed adequate antibody titers then revaccination might be an option. Be reassured (as you can be!) that this kind of treatment is very effective. I can't say how effective as this is not easy to measure due to the nature of this disease. Hope I have answered your query.

A week later I finally began to feel better. But then a few days after feeling better,(not completely--but better)-I noticed discharge from my penis. I remember reading that is a gonorrhea symptom and immediately went to my doctor s office under an urgent care visit. They gave me 1000MG of azythithroyicin and then a shot of something taken in the muscle in the glutes. I m sure you know what it is. Within less than 2 days the discharge stopped and was dry. Gone. However- I have still had this cough lingering and terrible nasal congestion. Don t forget-this all began on Sunday July 30th. Today makes 16 days since then. Now here we are and I still have the cough lingering-although not producing anything, And some congestion nasally. But the thing is-- is that I have felt SO tired and wiped out lately. I fall asleep much earlier and it isn t just a tired before bed feeling--but a not normal feeling of major exhaustion. I do workout. A week later after this happened I worked out,(carefully going lighter) and the day I went in to the doctor s office to take the shot I worked out and felt decent. But it seems SINCE I have gotten the dose of medicine plus the actual shot------although the discharge stopped--and looked like to me the gonorrhea went away.....I still don t feel good. In other words--the cough is nearly gone, the nasal congestion and discharge is much less. There is no longer any discharge from my penis,(that stopped almost immediately after being seen at the doctor s office)--------Yet...........I just feel so tired all the time now. When I try to workout---I m not just pleasantly sore afterwards which is a good sore.....but kind of drained and wiped. Not right. But yet...I don t want to lose muscle either. What is going on? And mind you- I have never once had a fever during any of this. I am getting bloodwork done soon. I am hiv positive,(27 years and going)-and soon am going to get my labs done for viral load and T-Cells like we do every six months. So I will be seeing my physician soon.

I assume your daughter has already had blood tests to rule out anemia (CBC and ERS), thyroid problems (TSH), and basic metabolic profile (ALT, AST, creatinine and electrolytes, lipids fasting blood sugar, etc).If all these tests have been normal than chronic fatigue syndrome can be considered as the cause of the fatigue she is having. Mononucleosis is accused as a possible cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. It is not very clear why it does so but studies have shown that patients with chronic fatigue syndrome test positive for mononucleosis showing that they have had it in the past.Depression can also cause extreme fatigue so an optimal treatment of depression with tablets and phsychotherapy might be needed.Trying to have a sleep hygiene with regular times of going to bed and getting out of bed is advisable. Exposure to daylight is important to help be awake during the day and regulate the sleeping pattern.Being active as much as she can, regular exercise, at least 30 minutes brisk wall three times a day might be helpful.Eating well and regularly is important.

But recently, it has returned. I went to the ER. They did a cat scan & could not find anything wrong. My blood work & liver levels all came back fine as well. But I definitely have this dull pain on my right side. They said at the ER the CT scan showed all of my organs were fine. No blockage & no damage. But the pain has since radiated from my right side through out my entire stomach. I feel bloated & the pain is a dull ache. It also comes & goes. One minute it s hurting. For maybe 15 or 20 mins. Focusing on my right side but radiating thru my entire stomach now. Then I feel fine for an hr or so. It constantly comes & goes. It has been doing this for wks. & whatever it is. Is getting worse.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Considering the symptoms, in my opinion you have been going through a bacterial infection which started as an upper respiratory infection and progressed in acute bronchitis(probably from streptococus). This infection usually mimics a viral syndrome and it's difficult to diagnose only by the history.The rash may be related to strep infection but it also occurs in viral infections, they are both commonly followed by body rash.You can consult your doctor for a physical examination of the rash and he will probably order a rapid antigen test or a throat culture which uses a swab sample from your throat to detect potential streptococus.It's important to make the right diagnosis, because if you have strep bacteria, you need antibiotics treatment.Menawhile if you still have cough, you can use guaifenesin to thin your mucus.You can also use ibuprofen 400 mg if you have any headache.Hope I have answered your query.Let me know if I can assist you further"},{"Patient":", my son is, 1 year and 2 weeks old last month he got fever and after that cough and chest infection he was administered cefpodoxime antibiotic forseven days and he was ok after one week he got fever again and doctor advised to do blood test.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. A blue skin rash  is not characteristic for any strain of influenza.  It may be your  own  idiosyncrasy in response  to a viral infection  as people's bodies all vary but it is not something one would expect.  People can get a non-descript \\"viral  exanthem\\" (i.e. rash) from a  large number of different viruses.  One of the hallmarks of influenza is that when the symptoms  come on,  they often come on FAST.  It is not unusual for  patients to remember the exact time when it started.   While I can't say specifically without examining you,  my you may have or had  an upper respiratory or  enteric (gut) viral  infection.

You haven't specified the duration of this symptom, which is very important in order to form a proper differential diagnosis. I can make some suggestions though. First of all, sinusitis may indeed cause cough and phlegm. Sinusitis may even cause chronic cough. In most cases the diagnosis is made clinically (with medical history and clinical examination). An X-ray of the sinuses will help. \\"Full\\" sinuses do not always mean sinusitis but clear sinuses safely excludes this diagnosis. If your cough and the rest of the symptoms are recent in onset then a bronchitis is a potential diagnosis. Bronchitis cause cough with phlegm and usually lasts for 2-3 weeks (or even more). The X-rays are negative in bronchitis. If your symptoms started more than a month ago then other disorders might have to be considered. In that cases please post a new question with more information about your symptoms and what you've tried so far. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It was lanced and drained and packed with gauze by a PCP. In the past 10 years it often gets irritated and bled a bit during my two pregnancies. I had a baby 7 weeks ago via c-section. On Thursday I had my post partum exam and my husband and I were intimate that night (although not having full intercourse). Yesterday and today the area of the abscess has been quite painful and has been bleeding, although that has changed to more of a brown, gritty discharge. It also has an unpleasant odor. I can feel a little opening where the blood is coming from and it stings to the touch. Appreciate and insights as to what is going on or what I should do. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.A Bartholin’s abscess can occur when one of the Bartholin’s glands, located on either side of the vaginal opening, becomes infected. When the gland is blocked, a cyst will usually form. If the cyst becomes infected, it can lead to a Bartholin’s abscess.Bacteria, such as E. coli, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, may cause the infections that can lead to a Bartholin’s abscess. If bacteria get into the gland, swelling, infection, and an obstruction may occur.To determine if you have a Bartholin’s abscess, a physical examination is needed. It includes checking for any lumps within the vagina that could indicate an abscess. The other methods include taking a sample from the area to check for any STDs. STDs will need to be treated along with the abscess.In its early stages, a Bartholin’s abscess can sometimes be treated at home using a sitz bath. A sitz bath is a warm, shallow bath you can give yourself in your bathtub or with a sitz bath kit. Soaking may not cure the abscess, but it can help ease your pain and discomfort. It may take many days of sitz baths to treat an abscess because the opening of the Bartholin’s gland is very small, and it may close before drainage is complete.Other home treatments for cyst care may help the abscess drain and heal on its own. Using a mix of tea tree and castor oil as a topical ointment on the abscess may promote drainage. Tea tree oil is known for its antibacterial properties, which may help clear an infection. Castor oil is thought to promote blood circulation in the affected area, which can reduce inflammation. You can apply the tea tree and castor oil with a piece of gauze. Adding a hot compress on top of the gauze may make this remedy even more effective. Hope I have answered your query.

Normally, cysts are removed. This isn’t because they’re dangerous but rather for cosmetic reasons. Since most cysts aren’t harmful to your health, you can choose the treatment option that works for you.   It’s important to remember that without surgical removal, your cyst will usually come back. The best treatment is to ensure complete removal through surgery. Some people do decide against surgery, however, because it can cause scarring.   One of these methods are followed for cyst removal:1.     Conventional wide excision, which completely removes a cyst but can leave a long scar.2.     Minimal excision, which causes minimal scarring but carries a risk that the cyst will return.3.     Laser with punch biopsy excision, which uses a laser to make a small hole to drain the cyst of its contents   After your cyst is removed, you can use antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. You should use this until the healing process is complete. You can also use a scar cream to reduce the appearance of any surgical scars. Hope I have answered your query.

Last late summer I had a few episodes of what I thought was heat exhaustion and actually went to the ER once. I stayed hydrated, rested often, took frequent breaks in the shade or air conditioning, etc., but it still happened. Now that it s getting warm again (it s sometimes in the 80 s now), I m starting to have the same problem. Yesterday it began when I was working inside (the house was about 75 degrees). I am taking Vesicare, Omeprazole, and Seroquel and have Sarcoidosis (but it s in remission at present). I have made sure I take all the preventative measures when in the heat, but it seems to happen anyway. The symptoms start with head pounding, increased heart rate, weakness. Then I feel sort of dizzy and somewhat nauseated. If it continues, the head pounding increases and I then begin to feel somewhat disoriented, very tired, more dizzy, and then it will progress to fainting if left untreated. I have also had a few occasions where I get in the car with the air on, start to feel better, drive home, then when I get out of the car, it hits me again when I stand up and begin walking. After a bad episode, I will feel exhausted sometimes for hours afterwards. I did ask my Urologist about the Vesicare as a possible cause, but he said it wasn t. Any ideas why and how I can cure this problem?","Doctor":"Hello, I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to orthostatic hypotension.

He demanded us (his coworkers) not to come to work when sick with cold or flu.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Cold and flu have different periods of contagiousness and different degrees of virulence. People with influenza should not go to work because of the seriousness of this type of infection, both for themselves and others. A cold on the other hand isn't usually as virulent, and if you practice good hygiene at work such as not sneezing without covering, and if your coworker practices good prevention measures, specifically not touching his eyes or nose (unless he has just immediately before thoroughly washed or alcohol gelled his hands AND THEN TOUCHED NOTHING ELSE) then the chances of his getting the cold are markedly decreased.

Am I still contageious to them  while I did not have a lot of pox they appear scabbed over however I still have residual nerve pain.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In theory, shingles would be contagious until the vesicles are scabbed over which is the case with chicken pox. In reality, there are not reports of spread of the herpes varicella zoster virus from people who have shingles like there are when people have chicken pox, which can be spread by respiratory secretions even before erupting in pox. So it should be ok for you to be around  the baby and his pregnant mom. Residual nerve pain can unfortunately persist even after the skin is completely clear, but does not indicate contagiousness.  If you were able to get on an antiviral within 72 hrs or so of the eruptions, the chances your nerve pain will resolve without issue are very good. Hope I have answered your query.

Your wife also needs a course of antibiotic and along with it, a collagen dressing can be done that has to be changed every 5 days. It helps in healing the wounds faster. Also if sugar levels are high, then it has to be immediately controlled. You can consult a general surgeon in this regards and get her treated appropriately. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Honey Arora"},{"Patient":"Hello SIr,My brother is sufferering from Bechets Disease(diagnosed in Jan 2017) and was on steroids+Azoran tablet for sometime untill his bone marrow got suppressed as a result of Azoran drug.He had to really fight for his life for 2 months in hospital before his bone marrow got on track and blood counts went to normal.

What I would advise, I would like you must talk to a pulmonologist who would talk to you examine your and then see the X-ray. He will be in a very better position to tell you what is there.

Any antibiotic can do it. Clindamycin was the first one described, and, currently, Cephalosporins. The most common cause is profuse watery diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.Diagnosis is best made by identifying the toxin in the stool. Stool cultures take too long, and the pseudomembranes are not always seen on endoscopy. The culpable antibiotic should be discontinued, and no antidiarrheals should be used. Metronidazole is the treatment of choice (oral or IV), with vancomycin (oral) an alternative.

Ironically, the standard treatment for C. difficile is another antibiotic. These antibiotics keep C. difficile from growing, which in turn treats diarrhea and other complications.For mild to moderate infection, doctors usually prescribe metronidazole (Flagyl), taken by mouth which you were already been given. For more severe and recurrent cases, vancomycin is a preferred choice which also has already been given in your case.

You are not at risk of getting shingles from her. Shingles come from the chicken pox virus you had as a child which goes dormant in part of the nervous system called the dorsal root ganglion.Your antibodies keep it in check there. When our antibody levels specifically to them get low, or our immune system is weaker, then they can sometimes come out as shingles. Because it is a virus, it can't be killed with an antibiotic, but an antiviral, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir can lessen the symptoms and complications, particularly if it is started soon, within the first 72 hours.For prevention, there is a new shingles vaccine to help boost one's antibodies to the chickenpox/shingles virus (varicella zoster). The older vaccine was not extremely effective, and it's hoped that the newer one will do a better job, but as it is new, the data on it is mostly limited to experimental trials and early use.So in answer to your question, there is no way your friend can pass shingles on to you as you already have the virus, it is just not active.Hope I have answered your query.

Some individuals are carriers of this bacterium but have no symptoms of infection. However, these people are still infected with the bacteria can spread the infection to others.In general, the bacteria have to increase in numbers rapidly to cause disease, so the bacteria can be transferred to people, but not cause significant infection immediately.Disease occurs when conditions favor growth of these organisms such as weakened immune systems, the elderly, and especially individuals that are hospitalized, and are being treated with antibiotics that suppress the normal bowel flora.Hope I have answered your query.

He has been having severe cramps after eating for about 5 weeks and has been in and out of Childrens' Hospital during that time,  they just kept sending him home saying he was impacted.","Doctor":"Hello,My answer is as follows:Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a bacteria that colonizes human intestine. They can cause diarrhea or intestine related diseases but also urinary, pulmonary and other infections (more rarely).Among the 6 types of E.coli, one is of particular importance: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli. In children, this E. coli sub-type might produce hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (anemia, acute kidney failure, dangerous lowering of blood platelets).Hemorrhagic colitis manifests with bloody diarrhea following non-bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Signs and symptoms are dedicated to potent toxins released by this type of E.coli.In this particular disease, the use of antibiotics is contraindicated because this increases the risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is a medical emergency. The use of antibiotics has been shown to not impact the course of illness or prevent future sequelae (permanent effects of infection).Therefore, the treatment of the disease is done by offering excellent supportive care, according to signs and symptoms.This is why your doctors ask you to visit often the hospital: due to the need for careful assessment and treatment according to the state of the child.Fortunately, in most cases the infection is self-limited and will be successfully managed by the medical team.Hope I have answered your query.

If you are not allergic to Penicillin like Amoxicillin is effective in preventing infection in both the procedures.Further, Amoxicillin is a bactericidal (kills the bacteria directly and eliminate a big part of the bacteria population rapidly) whereas Doxycycline is bacteriostatic (prevents the growth of bacteria) hence Amoxicillin is preferred over Doxycycline to cover for both the surgical procedures.There is no harmful interaction between Amoxicillin and the antiarrhythmic drug Amiodarone.

Based on the history your friend seems to be suffering from hospital-acquired MRSA infection which can be life-threatening if not treated.MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a specific bacteria that is often resistant to (is not killed by) several types of antibiotic treatments which can be harder to treat or become worse if the appropriate treatment is delayed.He should be examined by a lung specialist (pulmonologist) to evaluate his condition properly. Since MRSA is resistant to many antibiotics, the treatment will depend on the culture and sensitivity of the blood/sputum. The doctor will choose antibiotics that the laboratory reports as susceptible on the resistance test they perform in each culture. The antibiotics like Vancomycin or Linezolid or fifth generation cephalosporins are found to be effective in susceptible infections.

I used the one-day Monistat treatment this afternoon and, not surprisingly, the discharge, burning and itch has increased. My concern is that I am also now experiencing mild bloody spotting. Is this also a symptom? Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello,My answer is as follows:Firstly, I am addressing the sign that is more important to me: Bloody spotting.A woman in menopause should normally not have any bleeding (also called postmenopausal bleeding - PMB). Even a small amount of bleeding, or spotting, is a reason to consult with your gynecologist.The need to see a specialist is mostly to rule out malign conditions. About 10% of women experiencing PMB are diagnosed with endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia.Of course, your mild bloody spotting could be due to yeast infection, but it is always wise to consult with your gynecologist to rule out any malign condition.Secondly, returning to your yeast infection, you could use alternatives of Monistat, such as Clotrimazole (Lotrimin), or Terconazole (Terazol), which are other anti mycotic and anti-yeast drugs.Please note that these drugs have to be used with caution because they may be toxic to kidneys and liver, and therefore you have to consult with your doctor before taking them. He/she can also indicate you the right dose and way of using them.On the other hand, vaginal yeast infections could be enhanced by your diet: consumption of too much sugars and low consumption of vegetables and fibers could cause or boost a vaginal yeast infection. Use of oral probiotics, such as yogurt, could also reduce the risk of yeast infection or fight it. Therefore, please take into account your diet too.Hope I have answered your query.

Otherwise, if HCV RNA is detected, this indicates ongoing active infection. For those requiring treatment, the goal of treatment in Hepatitis C is the so-called Sustained Virological Response (SVR), meaning non-detectable HCV RNA after treatment. Treatment of Hepatitis C has made tremendous progress lately, achieving SVR in about 99% of patients after the right treatment. Therefore, I think that your patient belongs to the group of persons being infected with Hepatitis C but the body was unable to clear the virus, she has been treated and has achieved a good SVR (as explained above). Therefore, she has not completely cleared the virus (she is a chronic carrier), with low risk of disease progression and transmitting the disease due to treatment response.Hope I have answered your query.

I am a lot better now,but I will not swim in a pool ever again,because in Florida it s always hot and humid and the water is easy pray to parasites. Thanks from Mike YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello,The symptoms of bacterial infections depend upon the mode of transmission or spread such as:1. Airborne (coughing and sneezing)2. Contact with infected people, especially through kissing and sex.3. Contact with contaminated surfaces, food, and water.4. Contact with infected creatures, including pets, livestock, and insects such as fleas and ticks.However, the most common symptoms of bacterial infection include fever, coughing, headache, inflammation, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, burning micturition, foul smell vaginal discharge, etcetera. Legionnaires' disease is caused by a bacterium known as Legionella. Its symptoms usually develop two to ten days after exposure to Legionella bacteria and include headache, muscle pain, and fever with chills.By the second or third day the signs and symptoms that may include cough which may bring up mucus and sometimes blood, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Confusion or other mental changes appear later. Although Legionnaires' disease primarily affects the lungs, it occasionally can cause infections in wounds and in other parts of the body, including the heart.

Sorry about my lungs.","Doctor":"Hello,It seems that Doxycycline is not the right treatment. Please note that antibiotics, such as Doxycycline, are not effective against viruses and viral infections. They are given in order to prevent a viral infection to be complicated by a bacterial infection and usually, such treatment is based on the judgment of your physician.Your doctor has prescribed you the right dose of Doxycycline. If your symptoms will not ease in 2-3 days, then you will need to change the antibiotic. It is possible that your disease is exacerbated by Streptococcus, a kind of bacteria that has developed high rates of resistance to Doxycycline. Therefore, your doctor might need to change the antibiotic for you, and suggest Cephalosporins for example. If the fever is high (39 Celsius degrees or higher) and cough persists or deepens, then you will have to see your doctor again. The difficulties in swallowing could be due to the involvement of tonsils. Change of antibiotic will help ease these symptoms too. Gargling with salt water several times a day could help your tonsils recover and enhance the healing process. Also, please keep hydrated by drinking water and fruit juices.

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen is effective for treating fever in patients with parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection. Fever does not always require treatment with antipyretics; however, consider antipyretics if a patient appears clinically uncomfortable.2. Resolution of infection depends on the presence of immunoglobulins against parvovirus B19. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used with good results for patients suffering pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Patients should be monitored for relapsed viremia.3. Patients in aplastic crisis require packed RBC transfusions. [9] In some studies, more than 80% of patients with sickle cell disease in transient aplastic crisis (TAC) have required transfusion.4. In patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, temporarily decreasing the dose of immunosuppressive agents usually enables the immune system to produce sufficient immunoglobulin G (IgG) to eradicate the infection and confer lifelong protection. In some individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, highly active antiretroviral therapy restores immune function, enabling resolution of chronic parvovirus B19 infection.5.

The dr says it is not caught from my partner but every time I have sex with him I am back to the Drs again complaining of the same symptoms. Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this please help me","Doctor":"Hello,Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. In diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. Due to their particular structure, Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. You have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. Post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. You again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. Apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. You should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. It is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. Lastly, Klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. But, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that Klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon).

Her Dr. said there is nothing that can be done about it. It is very bad behind both knees, red and yellow looking. It does not seem to bother her but it definitely bothers me. It is awful looking. She does have Escema and attends a daycare. What can we do???","Doctor":"Hello,The key issue here is that she receives the correct diagnosis. Generally, Molluscum contagiosum will just appear as small bumps on the skin. It should not change color from yellow to red or look awful as you describe. It sounds like she might have a different type of infection that needs treatment.However, if she does have molluscum contagiosum as your doctor says, there are no real proven treatments for it. Topical cryotherapy, imiquimod, salicylic acid, etcetera have worked for some patients. Ultimately, I do not believe she has a molluscum contagiosum infection if it appears as you describe. It sounds like she needs to see another doctor for a second opinion.Hope I have answered your query.

If you are in the United States, when we treat a patient for Chlamydia, we also treat them for Gonorrhea at the same time since when a patient has one infection they often have the other at the same time.Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is a totally separate issue that can arise if you have untreated STDs. The greatest way to avoid pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is to treat STDs like Chlamydia and Gonorrhea as soon as possible. There is no one specific test to see if you have PID. Your doctor can do a pelvic exam to see if you have pain in your internal female organs. If he determines you have PID, he can admit you to the hospital for IV antibiotics or treat you with injectable antibiotics on an outpatient basis.For the time being, you must finish your medication for your current diagnosis of Chlamydia. If you have a fever or abdominal pain go back to your doctor immediately or call 911. If you finish your treatment for Chlamydia and still have pain, also go back to your doctor. If you finish your medication and no longer have symptoms then you no longer need to go back to the doctor.Hope I have answered your query.

No red streaks, or other discoloration, no pain or swelling, but some light green discharge. After soaking in epsom salt it was soft enough to cut most of the nail away. I ve since been soaking daily with epsom salt, drying with paper towels and covering with a clean white cotton sock & usually a fabric bandaid. I was already on Amocycillin for a respiritory problem. It s been 8 days and it s very lightly still draining thin watery green puss. Is there anything else I can or should not be doing? I m worried about the new hip hardware getting contaminated. I m a 32 year hemodialysis patient, also with a 25 y/o aortic prosthesis(Saint Jude valve).","Doctor":"Hello,This type of discharge from your toenail is indicative of an infection. You are doing the correct thing in keeping the nail clean and soaking it. However, you need more serious antibiotics than Amoxicillin to treat this infection. Since you already have a prosthetic valve and are on dialysis it is much more important for you to eliminate infections than the average person. There could be a much deeper infection than you can see grossly with your own eyes. You need to have your toe evaluated by a doctor. He will most likely put you on a much stronger antibiotic than Amoxicillin to treat this infection.Hope I have answered your query.

About 3 1/2 wks ago she had a pretty intense oral surgery for removal of wisdom teeth, had to be treated for dry sockets twice. She was on several medications, including antibiotics, pain medicine and ibuprofen. During this time she started to get oral ulcers, Dentist said it was common after a oral surgery. A few days later she was having problems with urinating, dryness and itching. She had a urine sample done and had a bladder infection. Then came vaginal ulcers. Back to the doctors again and they say it may be acute reactive aphthous ulcers which is common after a surgery and long doses of medication. Now after a blood test they say it s HSV2. We are both devasted. She says she has had oral sexual recently but is still a virgin and is adement about it. Both the doctor and myself believe her. Could it be possible this test came back a false positive even with having symptoms of herpes. It s all so confusing. I don t know if this is all from her surgery or she really has HSV2. I am 100% behind my daughter, I am not mad or angry. My heart is broken for her, she thinks no one will ever want her now and that she s damaged. Please some one help me with advice","Doctor":"Hello,It is rarely possible to have HSV-2 transmitted through oral sex. Moreover, genital rubbing without actual intercourse can also result in HSV-2 transmission. She can take acyclovir to reduce the severity and duration of illness.

Was sent to cardiologist and underwent numerous tests, which were all negative. No answer. Blood tests indicated very high cortisol levels.

We kissed, rubbed penises together for no more than 20 seconds, and performed mutual oral sex only on each other. He told me his symptoms always present anally and he hasnt had an active outbreak in over a year. Unfortunately, at the time, I also had Oral Gonnorhea without knowing. I suffer from severe OCD about STDs so became compelled with the idea i had HSV2 especially given i broke out in a few spots around my lip line a week later. I had a sore throat, fever, chesty cough, congestion, aches, fatigue, headache, and even now over 3 weeks on im still not 100% back to best, still suffering from some symptoms.

However, i kissed a gentleman 48 hours ago and performed oral sex on his anus and he is now complaining of a sore throat.

Herpes viruses are the most common viruses in human populations and there is no definitive cure. HSV1 has affected more than half of global population whereas HSV2 has infected about 500 million persons worldwide.All you can do is maybe to use antiviral medicament in order to ease the symptoms associated with it.

I have shown no symptoms of any sores/blisters etc. my doctor took a swab and a blood test but I don t know my results yet. If I have no symptoms, could I still have herpes?","Doctor":"Hello,Short answer: Yes, you could have herpes.Detailed answer: If your partner has herpes then it is very probable that he has transmitted it to you. Herpes virus is very contagious and since you have had unprotected sex then it is highly likely for you to have got it as well.Transmission can occur, even the context of intact and healthy looking skin and genital mucosa, and absence of symptoms. Transmission can occur through any kind of contact with the infected person: anal, sexual, fingering, oral sex.You might be completely asymptomatic during your entire life or signs and symptoms could come and go from time to time, and this is different from one individual to another. However, please note that herpes virus is the most common virus among human populations. It has no cure, but some antivirals might help lessening symptoms.There is no universal protection from it. Even condoms protect only in about one third of cases as it depends on how it is used (if hand is contaminated then the condom cannot stop the infection).

This may be case for you since you also have a fever.The most common inner ear causes are- BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), Meniere's disease, and vestibular neuronitis. None of these are life threatening, just difficult to handle as they occur.You should consider seeing your doctor for assessment to determine the cause for you. Treatment varies.Hope I have answered your query.

Nevertheless, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests in order to investigate for other possible causes: - a resting ECG - complete blood count for anemia - blood electrolytes for possible imbalance - thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your complaints.

Six weeks ago I had pyelonephritis, kidney infection. And now at two and 1/2 weeks ago I had mrsa infection that s not completely gone. What am I supposed to do wait for the infection to come to a head again or go to the ER for testing to see if it s the same infection or a new one?","Doctor":"Hello,As per your clinical history is concerned, please follow like this:1) Do a physical examination by your family Doctor and to confirm do few investigations like [CBC with differential and culture of tissue samples or nasal secretions].2) Your Doctor will add specific antibiotic for the infection and sometimes no antibiotics are required only draining is required.Do follow lifestyle modifications like this:1) Wash your hands. Careful hand-washing remains your best defense against germs. Scrub hands briskly for at least 15 seconds, then dry them with a disposable towel and use another towel to turn off the faucet. Carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer containing at least 62 percent alcohol for times when you don't have access to soap and water.2) Keep wounds covered. Keep cuts and abrasions clean and covered with sterile, dry bandages until they heal. The pus from infected sores may contain MRSA, and keeping wounds covered will help keep the bacteria from spreading.3) Keep personal items personal. Avoid sharing personal items such as towels, sheets, razors, clothing and athletic equipment. MRSA spreads on contaminated objects as well as through direct contact.4) Shower after athletic games or practices. Shower immediately after each game or practice. Use soap and water. Don't share towels.5) Sanitize linens. If you have a cut or sore, wash towels and bed linens in a washing machine set to the hottest water setting (with added bleach, if possible) and dry them in a hot dryer. Wash gym and athletic clothes after each wearing.Hope I have answered your query.
