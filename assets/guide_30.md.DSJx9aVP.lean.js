I can understand your concern. Yes, costochondritis can recur in same patient.It is more likely too recur in patients with calcium and vitamin D3 deficiency. Usually in healthy individuals, costochondritis don't recur. But if you are having calcium and vitamin D3 deficiency then it can recur twice or thrice in a year. So in my opinion, you should first get done calcium and vitamin D3 levels and if deficiency then you will need supplements. Also follow these steps for better symptomatic relief and for prevention of recurrence. 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid movements causing pain. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Along with drugs, you should follow below mentioned lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3.

I can understand your concern. Calcification in lungs is suggestive of old, healed scarred lesions. You must be having tuberculosis in the past. And after treatment, it must be healed. Now healing in the lungs take place by either fibrosis or calcification or complete resolution (rarely). So calcification in current chest x ray is suggestive of healed lesion from previous tb infection. No need to worry for recurrence of tb and hence no anti TB treatment is required presently. In my opinion, you should get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis as a cause for your coughing because bronchitis is very common after lung infection like tuberculosis.

Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I get out of breathe easily.....I also have acid reflux and had it for a long time....I get mucous in my throat and I always feel that I need to cough it up....if I raise my voice, the mucous in my esophagus starts to build up and I then starts coughing to bring it up. Would the valve prolapse be associated with my breathing problem? Is it cause for alarm and should I go see my family doctor?","Doctor":"Hi Dear !! Thanks for your query to HCM .Read and reviewed your query and health concerns. You seems to suffer from -GERD.The rise in the voice-increases intrathorasic pressure,which causes increased acid reflux due to similar innervation as that of pharyngo-laryngeal region by Vagal nerves.This leads  to breath holding to avoid aspiration in airtrack.So breath holding is from GERD and not due to MVP in your case.Treat with-PPI -prilosec(OTC) with domeperidone and treatment of causes of GERD would resolve this difficulty in the breathing.Consult with Physician and if need be ENT surgeon to treat this laryngopharyngeal breath holding caused from GERD with which to prevent mucus  collection spillage in to air track, breath holding is reflexly done by you.Hope this would help you to plan further care of this complex illness of yours.If need be, update any health issue 24 x 7 by a direct question to ME, at following HCM link-Dear, if satisfied,Don't forget to close this query with YOUR pleasing feedback comments to rate this reply and service, to boost the morale of incoming Emergency patients like YOU, at HCM services.If you want to update more details and ask more update queries ,You are most Welcome herewith !!Good Day!!Wishing Good Healthy Life in time to come!!Dr.Savaskar M.N.Senior Surgical SpecialistM.S.Genl-CVTS"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 36 years old female, I have been suffering from diabetes since my 2nd childbirth in 2001. My diabetes management is rather bad my reading ranges more than 15 after food. I was on metformin 3 times a day 500mg, daonil 2 times a day. All these medications leads me to have cold sweat and tremors. I todl my doctor but they ask me to continue. Since I am working I actually cut down as it affects me during working hours. My father has a history of diabetes and he passed on 5 years back due to ischaemic heart disease. He was a smoker and had 3 blockages in his valves - 85, 75, 80%. He was not suitable for a bypass due to his heart functioning was below 45%. Recently a few months back I had chest pain and i went for a treadmill test the results shows ard 88% and the doc say he will not put me on medication first. I would like to do a full medical check up that has links to diabetes. What are he check ups should i go for? I intend to do it in India, so which hospital would you recommend in Chennai or Tanjore?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult Apollo hospital in Chennai for blood tests. You should go for following check ups. 1. Complete blood count 2. HbA1C (glycosylated hemoglobin) 3. Urea and creatinine 4. Urine microscopic examination for albumin in urine. 5. Ophthalmic opinion for retina 6. Dermatologist examination for lower limb foot ulcers 7. Ecg, 2d echo and stress test for heart. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Can coughing that hard be harmful?  Should he see a doctor? I had called in but was told without a cough or wheezing i was probably wasting my time and the cough wouldnjust have to run its course.  Just worried if coughing that hard can cause damage?            Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely take him to the pediatrician and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray. Cough for more than 2 weeks, chest congestion, wheezing etc are commonly seen with lung infection (pneumonia) and bronchitis. So chest x ray is needed to rule out infection. He may need higher antibiotic, inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and other supportive drugs. So don't wait at home and consult pediatrician. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My husband inhaled dry chlorine, he opened the container and the fumes hit him in the face. He insists he is fine....his eyes were red and watery but have cleared up. When he talks he sounds a little raspy, he says he doesn't have chest pains but does feel very little restriction on his breathing says he can breath. He does feel some muscus there now. What should I do? Chrissy","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. He is having inhalation of chlorine powder. This kind of exposure can cause inflammatory reaction in airways. This is known as bronchitis. Usually, this is self limiting in nature. So no need to worry for some mucus sensation in the chest. You can give him simple anti inflammatory drug for this. He will mostly recover within 2-3 days. But if he develops cough, chest pain and breathing difficulty then immediately consult doctor because he might need inhaled treatment. But at present, no treatment is required. Also tell him to drink plenty of fluids orally and keep himself hydrated. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

Yesterday(noticed by my girlfriend only) there was pulsation 2-3 inchs beneath my sternum(central but slightly to left if anything) and today I have had it much more noticably. I have been feeling a slight tremour in my whole body all day too(slight shakyness in hands). This evening the pulsation became very noticable almost like there was some sort of localised discrete cramp at that spot a few inches below my sternum. I also feel almost pulpitations in my heart too (I do have a grade 1 heart murmur). A little while ago as I was laying back pushing out my chest a little I got a strong cramping pain in the heart area that lasted a few seconds then went but have had tightness since then(it has died down a little now). I don t want to have to go in to have it seen to if not neccessary but just wondering what this could be? Note that I did very heavy weight bearing exercise today(squating etc.) and was also very cold a few days ago for a few hours(whether that makes a difference due to thickening of blood as I once saw in some program!!). Any help is much appreciated!!! Thanks, Benjamin Reynolds (Northern Ireland)","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, these symptoms are not due to thickening of blood. Since you are having heart murmur, we should definitely rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) in your case. So consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Sometimes uncontrolled stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out heart diseases like arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

You are mostly having viral bronchitis. Your sore throat and runny nose are mostly due to common cold. Most common cause for common cold is viral infection. Sometimes, similar virus can also infect airways and cause bronchitis. And this bronchitis will cause pain and Soreness in lungs. So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Do steam inhalation and warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. Take antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright within 1 week as viral infection is usually self limiting in 1 week. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. No, erythromycin will not help in chest pain. Erythromycin is an antibiotic. It is used four infection. You are having left sided chest pain with lightheadedness.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain due to improper and awkward sitting posture is more. But better to get done chest x ray to rule rule out internal lung pathology (chances are very less). If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for any major disease. Follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Sit with proper back and chest support. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid movements causing pain. 4. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 5. Along with muscle relaxant, you should also take painkiller for quicker and better improvement. 6. Apply ice packs on affected areas. 7. Wear chest belt or rib belt to prevent mobilization of painful areas. You will mostly improve with all these in 1-2 weeks. If not improving then consult orthopedic doctor and physiotherapist.

Due to weakness in the venous pull there will be venous insufficiency leading to swelling of the lower limbs. This is the commenest complain most patients face after weakness of the venous pull mechanism of the cardiac system.What I will advice is to get a thorough clinical examination and a diagnostic, post which you can undergo physical therapy under a cardio thoracic physical therapist who can help you make the functioning of the venous return better. You can discuss the same with your cardiologist. Even the American heart association and ACSM guidelines which is always under good research says that physical therapy is effective in such conditions.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"This year 30 Marcht my wife(63), heigt 1,74 meter weight 74 kilo fell backwards from a higth of  8 feet.She took an X ray. Her diagnosis was 2 broken ribs 8th rib front leftside and one rib right backside. After about 5 weeks her pain diminished to zero. Now since a week she experiences continually pain.Not especially by touch or breathing. She consulted her doctor  and took an X ray again. Diagnoses on 4 ribs left there was surprisingly so called  woven bone.  Is there an explanation?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your wife.As she is 63, and had a fall which lead to fracture of the 2 ribs at that time and now she is having woven bone on cest x-ray for 4 ribs, this makes us understand the weakness of the rib bones. As per the anatomy of the rib bone, it is a flat bone and healing for it is little slower. It is very less the ortho technology can really do as the location of the bones. What I feel is the weakness in the bones due to less of calcium has lead to this woven bony appearance in x-ray. Also, due to her age, the healing process can be delayed.What I would suggest is to check the calcium and vitamin D3 levels. Based on it there will be a supplements of calcium and also vitamin D3 injection too boost the physiological mechanism. Performing regular breathing exercises like costal will be helpful to boost the strength in the muscles and the bones.Since the rib bones are flat and cannot be made exercise by weight bearing of something there is only a simpler way to deal with it.In my clinical practice we treat such patients with woven bone with calcium supplement, vitamin D3 injection and breathing exercises. The process is slow but functions well even in ageing individual.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have an internal tickle/itch around my rib area.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, possibility of lymphnode enlargement and related swelling is more in your left collarbone. So get done ultrasound examination of neck to know confirm this. For shortness of breath and weakness, possibility of bronchitis is more. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright, consult doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Thank you!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. At the young age of 23 years, shortness of breath is mostly due to asthma or bronchitis. So better to first consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose them but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. If PFT is normal then no need to worry for lung diseases. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can also cause similar kind of breathlessness. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright.

I can understand your concern. Fluid in the lungs is known as pleural effusion. Your husband is having pleural effusion after abdominal surgery (colon resection). This can be due to either of the following causes. 1. Infective etiology 2. Fluid resorption in the pleural cavity after abdominal surgery. Tobacco confirm this, we need to examine and do certain tests of fluid. So consult pulmonologist and get pleural fluid aspiration and send sample for fluid routine and microscopic examination and culture examination. Don't worry, he will be alright.

More often than not I do not finish a meal as it is simply to difficult to get the food to move down past my chest.  I've also noticed an increase in indigestion?  Would it be stress realated?  I'm 40yr old female, 5'2\\", 180lbs.  I've not had any medical issues.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, your all these symptoms can be due to stress. Actually, in my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms indigestion, difficulty in swallowing, chest pressure, tightness, heaviness etc. Stress is the biggest risk factor for GERD. So first of all we should treat your stress. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. For GERD, take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Don't worry, you will be alright by all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Has been happening off and on for a few motnhs.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of muscular twitching is more likely in your case but better to rule out heart diseases like arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) because it is on left side of chest. So first get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Sometimes calcium and vitamin D3 deficiency can also cause similar muscular twitches. So get done calcium and vitamin D3 levels and if deficiency then you will need supplements. You can also apply warm water pad on affected areas to prevent this twitching. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. Since your blood reports and electrocardiogram are normal, no need to worry for major heart related diseases. In my opinion, your all symptoms are stress and anxiety related. But we should first rule out lung related pathology. So get done chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for lung diseases and you symptoms are due to stress and anxiety only. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have trouble clearing my lungs & seem to discharge phlem in small amounts. The phlem is kind of hard or jello in consistance. I am coughing almost all day to clear my breathing but cant succeed . I dont smoke & have'nt  had that habit , But I was exposed to alot of dust and silica particulate with little or no protection when I was young. What can I take to clear my lungs and stop having this suffocating feeling all the time ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having chronic cough with thick, difficult today expectorate phlegm with chest tightness and heaviness. You are also having exposure today sillica and dust. So we should first rule out chronic bronchitis and sillicosis in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray for the diagnosis of sillicosis. 3. PFT (pulmonary function test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids(ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). For thick secretions, mucolytic drugs like ambroxol, bromhexine, N Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) etc should be tried.

I have had this same reaction to Sweet N Low, but the sodas that I drink are not diet. I ve tried different sodas too. I have the worst reaction with Mt Dew and the least reaction to Coke. What could be causing this to occur? I m 39 years old and have drank sodas for as long as I can remember, although I admit I do drink more sodas now than ever before.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having an allergy to carbonated drinks. So whenever you are drinking these drinks, due to allergy, you start developing bronchospasm (constriction of bronchial tubes). This bronchospasm causes wheezing and coughing. So best treatment for you to avoid carbonated drinks. Incase you drink it and develop symptoms then take combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) drugs. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, Iam 28 year old, my height is 184cm.

Iam taking Happi tablet and i am getting relieved from acidity.Sometimes i get slight pain in my chest and below chest portion.I usded to smoke but i havent smoked from last 30 days. But i eat one beetle leaf with tobbacco daily before dinner. I am little worried . I just wanna know if my symptoms are related to any kind of cancer.Looking forward to hearing from you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for cancer or any major disease because you are too young for cancer. In my opinion, your symptoms are mostly due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain, hyperacidity etc. Smoking and tobacco are biggest risk factors for GERD. So first of all quit smoking and tobacco chewing. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Take antacid like pantoprazole on empty stomach. Go for walking after meals. Don't worry, you will be alright. Don't think too much about cancer. Hope I have solved your query.

Is this safe for her?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, she can fly without fear. Bronchitis is mostly caused by viral infection. And most of the viral infections are usually self limiting. So if she is improving in symptoms like less cough, less fever, less wheezing etc then she is in recovery phase of bronchitis. So she can definitely fly without fear. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have a reflex at night.

Take antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs for coughing. 2. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 3. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 4. Avoid movements causing pain. 5. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 6. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 1 week.

No, goiter cant not cause burning sensations in chest and upper back area. So no need to worry for goiter as a cause. In my opinion, your all symptoms are mostly due uncontrolled GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of burning central chest pain, back pain, belching, burping etc. Certain lifestyle modifications are needed along with drugs (pantoprazole) for control of GERD. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid junk food. 4. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. 5. Go for walking after meals. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My friend has multiple symptoms of prinzmetal s angina. His family doc told him everything was normal, yet he continues to experience symptoms. As a last resort someone gave him some nitro pills and the chest pain subsided. His doctor has him on metoprolol and we have read that drug can increase the severity and frequency of the chest pain. Tonight he has mild chest pain and a headache that he claims is nearly debilitating and coming in waves across the left side of his head. He also claims his vision in the left eye is intermittently blurred with the headache. Please advise","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, metoprolol is not causing worsening of symptoms or chest pain in printzmetal angina. In fact, metoprolol is one of the treatment option for angina. Honestly speaking, I think your friend is having uncontrolled stress and anxiety related symptoms. Since his heart work up is normal, no need to worry for angina or other heart related symptoms. In my opinion, he should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in his life and start working on it's solution. He may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, with counselling and anxiolytic drugs, he will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend.

She went to the doctor and they said it was menopause but it just cant be now a year or two later its flared up and she cant eat sleep or move without feeling pressure around that area. Her new doctor said its something to do with her small intestine so I m wondering exactly what he might be thinking it is?...","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Twinges under left rib cage can be due to heart on stomach related problems. I don't think it is intestinal problem. And post menopausal women are at increased risk for heart diseases because of low estrogen and progesterone. So better to first rule out heart diseases. So consult doctor and get done ecg and 2d. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes acute gastritis cancer also cause similar symptoms. So give her antacid like pantoprazole on empty stomach. Ask her too avoid stress and tension, hot and spicy food and junk food. Don't worry, she will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I now have several masses on my right lung and am having a VAT biopsy tomorrow.  I was told I have to be in intensive care for two days with a hospital stay of 5 - 7 days....is that normal procedure.  I'm terrified.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:VAT biopsy is the best and less invasive approach to take a biopsy of the lung masses and discover their nature. Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.At this point , after being detected the lung masses, the best approach to them is to undergo the biopsy through VAT(Video assisted thoracoscopy). The scope can be inserted into the chest through small 2-4 cm incisions made between the ribs. It allows the surgeon to view, under high magnification, the lung masses and manipulate the instruments to effectively transect and remove the tissue from the body. Compared to thoracotomy (traditional, opened procedure), VATS is minimally invasive, with less pain , smaller incision, less days of hospitalization (generally at about 3-4 days).As you suffer from atrial tachycardia and having only one kidney , asthma and COPD you need a more accurate medical care. The lung function, in your case, needs a longer time to recover comparing to a healthy lung. This means you may need a more long hospital stay, but you should understand this is the best choice in your conditions. Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

I can understand your concern. No, accident can not cause these symptoms as your all cat scan and chest x ray are normal. These symptoms are coincidentally only. These symptoms are more suggestive of bronchitis because bronchitis cancer cause shortness of breath and yellow phlegm. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol)  and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (fluticasone or budesonide). Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My daughter 28, weight 50 kilos height 1.55m has high bilirubin.  Can this be the cause of her fatigue ?

This day our era of medicine is \\"Evidence based medicine\\" there is little rolefor empirical therapy. here we try to prove what we are treating, only if every test comes out negative then we go for emperical treatment when clinical suspicion is very high. if suspicion of Tuberculosis is highsputum for AFB, Chest x ray,ESR,Mantoux test are baseline if negative but suspicion is highbronchoscopy or lymphnode biopsy if any palpable lymphnode is seen or CT chest if some doubt exists. DOTS is an effective medicine, contains combination of antibiotics against Tuberculosis bacteria.  main side effectof ATT( anti tuberculosis therapy) is hepatitis,neuropathy, nausea,vomiting  and ethambutol is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy.so if she dosent have the disease we are placing her at risk of these side effects due to these drugs.rarely ATT induced hepatitis may lead to fatal liver failure..so better to confirm the diagnosis Hope this helps.."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My wife has TB 6 yrs ago and she got treated.

So possibility of worsening of asthma due to heavy exertion is more likely cause for your wheezing. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Oral combination of antihistamine and anti allergic drug is also beneficial in your case. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Can this condition be treated completely ? I am 43 years old. Height 169 cms, weight is 52 kgs","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Pleural thickening on chest x ray is suggestive of past infection. This thickening is due to old, scarred, healed, fibrotic lesions. They are not active, infectious lesions. For medical fitness in visa purpose, we should prove that these lesions are not due active infection. For this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT scan is more superior in diagnosis of fibrotic lesions. Bronchoscopy and BAL analysis if negative rule out active infection.

Will that scar have effect on his life span? can he do exercise?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for this scar lesions in lungs. All lung infections including tuberculosis heal after treatment. They heal mostly by following three mechanism. 1. Fibrosis (most common) 2. Calcification. 3. Rarely Complete resolution. So this fibrosis look like scar lesions on chest x ray. They are inactive, noninfectious lesions. So no treatment is required for them. They will remain as it is through out the life. No need to worry as they are harmless. And these scar have no effect on his life span. Yes, he can definitely down exercise.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is auto immune disease which affects major organs of body like lungs, heart, kidneys, Brain etc. Lung involvement in RA is very common. Your pleural thickening is mostly due to RA affecting the lungs. Honestly speaking, this is not a good sign as far as prognosis is concerned. You should definitely get done CT scan of thorax to find out other lesions in lung because chest x ray is not always sufficient. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. You will mostly need periodic (six monthly) CT scans to see for any new lesion development. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Each tablet of Forecox is having combination of four drugs, Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. All these drugs are very toxic and have many side effects. All these cause gastritis, vomiting, nausea, abdominal fullness etc. Rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide also cause drug induced hepatitis (liver damage). Ethambutol causes kidney damage. So better to get done liver and kidney function tests after 15 days of treatment. In diet, avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid oily and spicy fatty food. Take plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Since you are having vomiting and nausea, better to take these drugs after breakfast. You should not also take antacid (pantoprazole) on empty stomach before breakfast to prevent vomiting and gastritis. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am 13 wks pregnant.  I have had pneumonia 2 times over the last 3 years and am familiar with the symptoms.  I currently am very week, and have a tickle in my chest that makes me want to cough once or twice a day.  When I cough hard I can taste the congestion in my chest.  This is the same taste as when I had pnemonia in the past.   I have no fever, but when I went to the clinic the doctor said my lymph nodes are swollen but my chest dosen\\"t sound congested.  I believe this is the beginning of Walking Pneumonia.  Do I have to wait until I get more sick before they will prescribe antibotics?!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are pregnant, it is advisable not to take antibiotics by your own because majority of antibiotics are contraindicated in pregnancy as they can harm your developing baby. So don't take any drug especially antibiotics without consulting doctor. In my opinion, you should consult doctor at present and ask for prescription. Tell your doctor that you are pregnant. So that he prescribe drugs including antibiotics which are safe in pregnancy. Don't worry, you will be alright. But please don't take antibiotics by your own as you are pregnant.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart related diseases because left sided chest discomfort is commonly seen with heart diseases. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can also cause similar kind of chest pressure and left sided chest pain.

I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, there is no correlation between nuvigil intake and hard to take deep breath.

So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution.

Sudden onset sharp chest pain, sweating and tingling in arms are commonly seen with heart diseases like coronary artery disease (CAD). Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg) is for arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). CAD can note be picked up by this. So despite of normal Holter report, your should definitely get done 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) and coronary angiography (if required). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of worsening of underlying pneumonia is more in your husband's case. White patch on chest x ray is suggestive of pneumonia.

I can understand your concern. No, this is not asthma. Your cough is mostly due to irritation in the lungs fromm that gutka smell.

COPD patients are used to have low oxygen saturation as compare to normal individual. This is due to their poor lung functions.Brain is having respiratory center which controls breathing.

In the process she had a heart attack. She was given a life saving drug which causes blood to be brought to major organs for life support. Extrementies do not receive the blood needed.

My heart beat seems normal, than I get this one off beat and it seems as though it's coming from the center of my chest not the left side just the center, and then I usually cough. It's not a dry cough but a mucus type cough. After the cough I feel tired and somewhat dizzy.  I have also been sneezing more than usual. Along with the sneezing there is a runny nose and the feeling that i'm not getting enough air in my lungs, I have been quite stuffy also. I am a 42 year old and female.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) because your symptoms like Fluttering feeling in central chest, missed beat, dizziness etc are common symptoms of arrhythmia. So better to consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). You may need anti arrhythmia drugs too. Your runny nose and stuffiness is mostly due to viral rhinitis. So do steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. Take antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Last night I had an odd episode and trying to figure if it warrants seeing a doctor. I am a 31 year old female about 140 pounds and had a healthy physical last year. But while swimming at my friends house late last night I encountered heavy breathing, loud ringing in my ears, loss of vision, shaking, dizziness, numbness in my hands, and almost completely passed out. My friend noticed my pale face and white lips and had me lie down. After an hour I felt good enough to drive home where I vomited the rest of the night with complete exhaustion. Today I still feel weak and moving fast still takes my vision and I did have ringing in my ears for about a minute with spots floating in vision while sitting. Can someone please give me some advice? Thanks!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Sudden onset breathlessness,dizziness, numbness, shaking, collapsing, loss of vision and ringing in ears are seen with 1. Pulmonary embolism 2. Heart diseases like heart attack 3. Epilepsy (seizures). So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination of whole body. 2. CT or MRI of brain and EEG (electro encephalogram) 3. CT pulmonary angiography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. 4. Ecg and 2d echo for heart diseases. If all these are normal then sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So consult doctor and discuss all these and first rule out major diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having costochondritis. No need to worry for major heart or lung related diseases because all your reports are normal. Costochondritis can cause recurrent chest pain on different chest areas with fever. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid movements causing pain. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 5. Take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs.

Please kindly advice me, I am fearing that, My daughter is also facing same problem with my infection (because she is suffering from cold and caugh since last 3 days and now tonight she cannot sleep & breathe naturally, some wheesing sounds)","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (pulmonary function test). You are having high eosinophil count. So possibility of allergic disease like asthma or eosinophilic pneumonia is more. Chest x ray is needed to rule out pneumonia. PFT is must for the diagnosis of asthma. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) because inhaled treatment is best for asthma. Your daughter should also be checked for asthma. Don't worry, with appropriate treatment, you both will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to both of you.

I can understand your concern. I have gone through the cholesterol and sugar reports. No need to worry for these reports as both are normal. So you are not having high cholesterol and high sugar. In my opinion, for chest pain, you should get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, simple musculoskeletal pain can be the cause. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

No need to worry for heart diseases because your angiography is normal. You are having chronic non cardiac chest pain. Most common cause for this is costochondritis. Another common cause is stress and anxiety related chest pain. So better to follow these steps for symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 2. Avoid movements causing pain. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 4. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 6.

Another answer to a similar question here just came back with another question asking whether the itch was on the heart or on the chest, and that wasn't helpful. This itch really does feel like it's internal, \\"on the heart,\\" and unreachable. Would it be related to the digestive system, like a \\"heartburn,\\" or does it suggest something else? I'm slightly concerned but also curious. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Most probably this is gastritis and reflux. Also you can get one ECG done during itching. So avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can get prescribed tab Pantoprazole.Hope I have answered your query.

I had coffee earlier and I just worked out pretty strenuously which I do 5 to 6 times for at least an hour every week.  I am in good shape and eat very healthy.  I did however have about 5-6 beers last night and smoked a cigar.  Any ideas on what it could be and suggestions for the future?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry much for your mild right upper chest pain. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain due to strenuous work out is more in your case. So avoid strenuous exercise and heavyweight lifting for 1-2 weeks. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Don't worry, you will be alright within 1 - 2 weeks. For healthy future, better to quit smoking (cigar) and Alcohol (beer) as these are not good habits. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

He says it doesn't hurt and that it feels that it takes a lil bit of your breath away like when your coming down from a roller coaster. He is diabetic but has been off metformin because his Dr. said that he was doing so well that he could get off the medication. My husband is a truck driver and doesn't sleep a whole lot maybe 5 or 6 hours. My husband is 48 maybe 170lb 5'8","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should definitely rule out heart diseases like early heart failure and coronary artery disease (CAD) in his case because both of them can cause similar kind of symptoms. And since he is diabetic, he is at risk of heart diseases. So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. Ecg 3. 2d echo 4. Stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for major heart related diseases. Since he is truck driver and not getting enough sleep, stress and anxiety are likely in his case. This stress can also cause similar symptoms. So ask him to avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Take sound sleep of 6-8 hours in night. Don't worry, he will be alright but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

Whenever eosinophilia is less in my body I do not face any problem. I got my blood test and eosinophilia was 15%. How can stop making of eosinophilia in my body? And how it can be reduced to normal level.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Eosinophils are one type of white blood cell (WBC) which denotes allergy. So high eosinophil count is almost always due to underlying allergy. So possibility of allergy related eosinophilia and breathlessness (asthma like) are high in your case. Best treatment for allergy is identification of allergen and if possible complete avoidance of it. So better to consult allergist and get done allergy testing to identify the allergen. Once you avoid it, your eosinophil count will not raise. Oral treatment with combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) is also helpful in reducing eosinophil count. Don't worry, consult allergist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have a constant pain in my chest and have been really tired for the last week or so.  I also have some much milder soreness in my back, shoulders and neck, but have attributed that to longer hours spent working at a computer recently.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your cholesterol is normal and you do regular exercise, possibility of heart related chest pain is less. But as you are past smoker, better to get done ecg to rule out cardiac chest pain. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. You are mostly having musculoskeletal pain due to prolonged sitting against computer. This can cause stiffness of back, neck and intercostal muscles. So better to avoid prolonged sitting. Sit for 1-2 hours and then stand up, move around for 5-10 minutes and then again sit. This will be very helpful in your case. Also sit with proper back support. Avoid awkward movements like bending or stretching while sitting. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I can understand your concern. He is having old age (68 years),chronic cough and hemoptysis (blood in sputum). So following are the possible causes for patch on chest x ray. 1. Pneumonia 2. Tuberculosis 3. Lung cancer. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, CT thorax and sputum examination for pneumonia and tuberculosis. Don't wait at home. First diagnose him and start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I feel like there is something blocking the food from continuing down my throat and into the stomach. The blockage area is in the center of chest sternum (sp). The past couple of days, I have had hick-ups actually leading to vomiting. Any idea what I can do or should do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of obstructive esophageal lesion and GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)  is more. This is the likely reason for your vomiting and blocking sensation while swallowing food. So better to consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) scopy for the diagnosis of this. It will diagnose obstructive lesions like mass, nodule, polyp etc if present.

X-ray report says its \\"Plerual effusion\\" and we have gone thru the test like CT scan, PET/CT scan and Bronoscopy. Everything was normal. But in the beginning ADA cells range was 196. Now it has come down to 55. May i know what can be the reason","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. There are two thin pleural layers surrounding lungs. When fluid accumulates between these layers, it is known as pleural effusion. ADA (adenosine Deaminase) is an enzyme found in lymphocytes. So ADA measurement in pleural fluid indirectly suggests lymphocytes activity in fluid. So ADA value of 196 is suggestive of lymphocyte rich pleural effusion. And most common cause for this is tuberculosis. And in TB there is recurrent pleural effusion. So better to consult TB specialist and get done pleural fluid AFB culture and sensitivity report for tuberculosis. Don't worry, he will be alright with anti TB drugs. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

I can understand your concern. Your chest pain is central in position and subside by drinking water, so possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more in your case. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of central chest pain. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

You had history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and recently had surgery. So chances of recurrence of PE are more. You are also having high blood pressure and mild heart attack previously. So coronary artery CAD at present can also cause similar symptoms. So better to consult doctor and get done blood pressure monitoring, Ecg, 2d echo, stress test and CT pulmonary angiography to rule out these possibilities. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My aunt just had a heart valve replacement and was released from the hospital about 2-3 days ago. I found out this evening that she is back in ICU. It s my understanding that her heartbeats that should be @ 100 drops to 50 and that they plan to shock her heart tomorrow! Is this normal procedure? Safe? and what does it all mean is going on? Thank you Bev I apologize, I am not financially able to pay for this service. Thanks anyway","Doctor":"Hi,According to the scenario you are telling I am expecting she has a irregular heart rate called as AF - Atrial Fibrillation which causes decreased cardiac output and is bad for patients especially those having a valve disease. If she does not have a clot in her heart and it is a new episode, we generally prefer to convert it into normal regular sinus rhythm which is done in two ways - medically or by giving a small intensity of shock. Giving shock is more effective. So I think this is what your doctors must be doing. I expect that was helpful to you and don't worry that shock is given when patient is sedated so she won't feel anything.Hope I have answered your query.

I can understand your concern. Yes, that pulmonologist is right. Old healed tb lesions will remain as it is through out the life. They are inactive fibrotic lesions. They are harmless and hence no treatment is required. As far as medic fitness is concerned, we need to prove that these patches are inactive, noninfectious. For this, you need to get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT scan is more diagnostic for healed, fibrotic lesions. If BAL is negative than you are not having tuberculosis or other active infection at present. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, I feel some tenderness over my left lower rib , there is no pain or anything and today i experienced while breathing a catch sort of feeling. i get palpitations and thats confirmed and since a year i am taking embeta xr 25mg. i dont have any shortness of breath, no tiredness ...","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. But better to first get done ecg to rule out heart diseases. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for cardiac diseases. You are also taking beta blocker. And this is mostly given to you for anxiety. But only drug is not sufficient for anxiety management. Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. Counselling plays very important part along with drug to control stress and anxiety. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query.

EFFUSION VS. ADHESION LEFT SULCUS.I would like to know what it means in laymans term thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your mother law is most having either tuberculosis or pneumonia in the past. Her current x ray is showing old, healed, fibrotic lesions due to previous lung infection. Actually, almost all lung infections (tuberculosis or pneumonia) heal after treatment with following mechanism. 1. Fibrosis (most common). 2. Calcification 3. Rarely Complete resolution. Since tb lesions are common in lung apices (upper lobes), there is fibrosis and adhesions seen in lung apices in current chest x ray. Better to get done ultrasound examination of thorax for confirmation of pleural effusion because on chest x ray fresh effusion and old healed effusion look similar. So get done ultrasound examination. Overall her chest x ray is suggestive of old, fibrotic lesions. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I have taken medicine Flolex 500 and Ciplox 500 for other infections previously . Please advice if Taxm O 200 is safe. For dry cough which antibiotic is best.Is it required?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having dry cough since 3 days only. This is most likely due to viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). And in this no antibiotics are required. Viral infection usually heal by itself in 1 week. So in my opinion, you should avoid taking excessive antibiotics because they will cause resistance and side effects. For your dry cough, do following things for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid oily and spicy food. 2. Avoid hard to chew food. 3. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. 4. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. 5. Take over the counter antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. You will mostly improve with all these in 1 week. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

NOT a heart condition. - yet the problem has not gone away - Age 49 - weight 220.  Family history has diabetes, hypertension and heart dieease.  I do not drink or smoke and I amnot taking any meds.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having post inhalation bronchitis. As you are saying that you feel chest tightness after inhaling polluted air, possibility of bronchitis is more. Polluted air when inhaled can cause irritation and inflammation in airways (bronchitis). This will cause bronchospasm and this inturn causes chest pressure and tightness. So best treatment for you is to wear face mask all the time. Inhaled bronchodilator like formoterol or salmeterol are also useful to relieve chest tightness. Don't worry, you will be alright.

If I take Zyrtec I feel a little better...could it be allergies?  or something wrong with my circulation?  Thank you for any advice you can offer...","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, this can be due to allergic disease like asthma or allergic bronchitis because you are improving with zyrtec (cetrizine). Cetrizine is antihistamine and used widely for allergy. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT is must for the diagnosis of asthma and allergic bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. Combination of anti histamine and anti allergic (montelukast) is more beneficial than antihistamine alone. Inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment fr breathlessness. Don't worry, you will be alright. No need to worry for low circulation.

EKG, blood work all checked out fine.  they wanted me to stay over night but made an appointment to go to my heart dr. One week later.  since the ER visit I have had pain in my chest, pinch and do not know why. I am thinking about returning to the ER again? What is your opinion. I also suffer from Acid reflux? Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your recurrent chest pain is mostly due acid reflux you are having. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest pain  belching, burping etc. So we need to treat your GERD first. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. 5. Go for walking after meals. 6. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I have had a chest x-ray and its come back clear, also have given a stool sample and all is well.  I just had some blood test done and its shown that the esr and crp are quite high.  What could this be?  I am female, age 29 years old.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (CAD reactive protein) are markers of inflammation. And your symptoms can be due to bronchitis (inflammation of airways). You are also having hemoptysis (blood in sputum) with normal chest x ray. This is seen with bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. Multiple matted arrhythmia with pruritus can be due to urticaria (skin allergy). And in my opinion, it is better to give combination of anti allergic (montelukast) and anti histamine (fexofenadine) instead of plain fexofenadine. You can also apply steroid cream (mometasone). In severe cases, oral steroids (prednisone) is also advisable. If he still feels itching then consult dermatologist and get done clinical examination and skin Biopsy for confirmation.

This is because medications have different onset of actions, which means that there can be a lag time before the blood pressure lowering effect takes place. Some medications also have a shorter duration of action which means that he may only have the effect for 12-18 hours, for which his blood pressure can rise again. I recommend a consult with a doctor for proper medications and dosing depending on his blood pressures. I also suggest lifestyle modification like low dietary salt intake and a regular exercise routine, which are both known to lower blood pressures together with medication intake.

Since you are active smoker, we should definitely rule out lung infection and bronchitis in your case. Cigarette smoke causes irritation and inflammation in airways. So chances of bronchitis is more. It also causes reduction in lung defence. So lung infection is also common in smokers. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2.

Antibiotic is needed for bronchitis. But it is not the mainstay of treatment for bronchitis. Best treatment for bronchitis is inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). So better to start inhaled treatment for faster recovery. With antibiotic and inhaled treatment, usually he will recover in 2 weeks.

If everything goes fine, tuberculosis patients show weight gain after 1-2 months of treatment. She has already taken 7 months of treatment and not gaining weight, actually loosing weight. So possibility of drugs not working on her is high. This is commonly seen with drug resistance tuberculosis. In this, TB bacilli are resistant to standard tb drugs.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having side effects of anti tubercular drugs. Right abdominal pain, headache, weakness is mostly due to anti tubercular drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide) induced hepatitis. High uric acid is seen as a side effect of pyrazinamide. Lower limb swelling is mostly due to hypoptoteinemia or kidney damage (ethambutol). So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Complete blood count 2. Liver function test including SGPT, Bilirubin, Protein levels etc. 3. Kidney function test. On the basis of above mentioned reports, you may need alteration in anti tubercular drugs. For high uric acid, you should take low protein diet and febuxostat. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I am fit and healthy and do vigorous excercise (running/squash), 4 times a week. Six years ago when I was at my fittest my pulse rate was in the the low thirties. I understand that top athletes have low pulse rates, but I'm not an athlete - just a reasonably fit academic. Is there anything to worry wih the low pulse rate and the low diastolic reading?","Doctor":"Hello,Blood pressure is not at all a matter of worry but pulse is definitely on lower side. You should monitor your pulse especially during rest time. It may be normal for you especially if you are not having any symptoms like dizziness or fainting, but symptoms are then you will certainly need evaluation. Also one thyroid test should be done just to rule out the other common cause of low pulse rate.Hope I have answered your query.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you are right. Your child was having low birth weight at the time of birth. These children are at increased risk of infections, particularly lung infection because of lower immunity. And this kind of risk is there until age of 5-6 years. Her current symptoms are more suggestive of lung infection. So better not to wait at home and consult pediatrician immediately. She will need chest x ray and blood reports for infection.

So I am having PSA test with tumor marker as 69.7 ng/ml and tumor gland 27 gm ( via CT scan). DO i Need to go for surgery or chemotherapy. what is the reason behind my chest pain??? Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You should go under prostate biopsy.You should be visited by a cardiologist.Detailed Answer:Dear Sir,Thank you for using HCM.Now that you have detected this problem , you need to face and follow the diagnostic and treatment steps one by one. So first of all , you have to do the prostate biopsy, which is needed to make a sure diagnosis. Depending on its response you will consult with the oncologist (if it results to be a malign tumor) or urologist (if it is a benign enlargement of prostate).Regarding your chest pain , it may be caused by low blood pressure , and reflector tachycardia (high heart rate) stimulated by such actions such as urination, defecation , the change of the position etc.Also the burn and difficulty on urination may cause tachycardia and chest pain.Nevertheless you need to see a cardiologist to exclude more serious causes.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

The doctor was convinced that there was a blockage in my heart so he did a heart catheterization, but found no blockage. He said that there was minor heart damage probably caused by stress but was treatable with medication. He decided not to give me the meds due to the fact that my heart rate was so low.

Anything thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi thanks for contacting HCM...You have not mentioned about smoking history...First we want to rule out respiratory causes like bronchitis ....chest x ray and pulmonary function test will be useful for it....If it is present antihistaminic drug and bronchodilator needed....If needed antibiotic need to be taken like levofloxacin...If no bronchitis and chest x ray with PFT if normal then pain while sneezing could be by simple musculoskeletal pain...Rest needed for it....Avoid strenous activity.....Take care.Dr.Parth"},{"Patient":"Hi I m 46 years old,58 kgs.,5ft.6 in.My chest xray in 2009 revealed apical pleural thickening.I never had any serious illness.Now i had an x ray and it showed minimal PTB,my sputum smear tested negative but still waiting for the culture.I have started treatment,will it show changes in my xray result after 3 months?","Doctor":"Hi thanks for contacting HCM...Noted you have apical pleural thickening..So this thickening could be by fibrosis ...as a result of chronic infection or inflammation...You have suspected tuberculosis....If culture report and molecular methods suggesting tuberculosis then AKT treatment given for tuberculosis.......With completion of therapy x ray will show improvement ....But fibrotic thickening can remain as fibrosis is irreversible condition...Take care.Dr.Parth"},{"Patient":"I am 63 5'7\\"and 198 pounds, and have been diagnosed with, as the nurse practitioner told me, a \\"whopping case of pneumonia.\\"  I'm on my second day taking levofloxicin and using ventolin HFA.

It will go away in about half an hour after I do t drink anymore.   It doesn't take much to set it off, just a half a glass.  I can have a beer or a glass of wine and no problems.  I am 45, 150 lbs, 5'6\\" and have never been much of a drinker.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can I can understand your concern. Since chest tightness and pain are associated with alcohol drinking, possibility of acute gastritis is more in your case. Alcohol is known to cause hypersecretion of stomach acid. And this can cause acute gastritis. This inturn cause chest tightness, pressure, nausea, burning chest pain etc. So better to quit alcohol as soon as possible.You will surely improve without any treatment if you quit alcohol. You can take antacid (pantoprazole) at present to resolve pain and tightness. But better to quit alcohol. This is must for you. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. No, sour smell all the time is not due to collapsed lung. Actually, this kind of smell problems are seen with chemotherapeutic drugs. These drugs kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. There are certain cells in the body (besides cancer cells) which are also rapidly dividing. Nasal mucosa is one of the example of such cells. So chemotherapeutic drugs will also damage nasal mucosa and so smell receptors on nasal mucosa will also damage and won't function normally. It has nothing to do with lung collapse. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I had a fundoplication and hiatus hernia op 4 months ago. I have been having a pain in the middle of my chest which gets worse if I bend down, run, walk fast or carry any shopping. It seems to be getting worse. (It feels heavy, like a weight or sometging lodged) I sweat more, and in the last 2 weeks developed a cough that I have never had before. I also have a constant ache about 3 inches (and a little to the left) below the chest pain. Could this be related to the operation and should I see my doctor?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult your doctor for all these symptoms. You are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related symptoms. Hiatus hernia is known cause for this. Surgical correction of Hiatus hernia is not always sufficient for symptomatic relief. You need to follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take combination of pantoprazole and domperidone. 5. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. 6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Since your extensive work up with x rays, CT scans and blood reports is normal, no need to worry for major heart or lung related diseases. Uncontrolled stress, anxiety and panic disorder can cause similar kind of symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. Along with anxiolytic drugs (Xanax and Celexa), counselling plays very important role in management of stress and anxiety. So don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I've had an ECG & bloodtests which showed nothing. The last 2 weeks the palpitations have become more like 'heart hiccups' but are much more frequent. In the same amount of time my abdomen has become very bloated (not hard or tight, just bigger and uncomfortable), which I initially put down to PMS, as I'm due my period, but now I seem to have a constant, mild but niggling pain in my upper left abdomen, right under my ribs. Are these symptoms related? Or if my heart has nothing to do with it, what could be causing my stomach pain? No nausea or vomiting, it's just been there for what seems like a very long time..","Doctor":"Is the pain more or increases post meals? Is your intake of citric food more? Pain in the region can be because of gastric problems.take antacids to get relief and lessen up citric foods."},{"Patient":"I feel strange, achiness in my throat (pressure) in throat and down the center chest, the pressure gets worse when I bend over, it kinda hurts when I breathe it hurts when I touch my jaw underneath on left, I also had a fall off a motorcycle and might have a broken rib on left side front and back","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain due to motorcycle accident is more. But better to rule internal lung injury because you had fall also. So get done chest x ray first. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for much. Your all symptoms are mostly due to musculoskeletal pain. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 5 - 7 days.. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I finally left and went home and lied down  because I also felt weak.  After lying down for 20 minutes or so the pain started to subside. I have been very fatigue since but I still able to do normal activities. It has been very trying at work over the past few months and I wonder if it is stress related. I don't want to bother my doctor if it is just that and since it happend last week.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more likely in your case. Your medical examination I'd normal just 1 week back.

I got the machine and used it for over a month and nothing whats ever has changed,, in fact i think im worse now! Whats my next step?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your all symptoms are suggestive of sleep apnea due to obesity. The machine you are talking about is known as CPAP machine. It is best treatment for sleep apnea. But along with CPAP, you should also focus on weight reduction. So better to consult dietician and follow strict dieting schedule. Do regular aerobic exercise like running, cycling, swimming etc. Also ask your doctor to increase pressure in machine according to your need. Once weight reduction is achieved your need for machine will also reduce. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry if your son is asymptomatic and clinically improving after treatment. Actually these current parenchymal lesions are fibrotic, scar lesions. Tuberculosis in lungs heals by any of the following mechanism. 1. Fibrosis (most common) 2. Calcification 3. Rarely Complete resolution. Since he has completed 1 year of treatment, fibrotic lesions are likely to develop as a healing process. So these parenchymal marks are nothing but healed fibrotic scars.

So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only.

Inhaled treatment is the best treatment for bronchitis. You are taking only qvar (inhaled corticosteroids). Mainstay of treatment in bronchitis is inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol).

I can understand your concern. No, I don't think it is due to reflux disease. In my opinion, you are allergic to that peppermint. Itching is Cardinal symptom of allergy.

Actually any form of smoke is injurious to the body. Smoke causes inflammation and vasculitis. This vasculitis will produce atherogenic substances.

Any ideas what could cause this?Thank you in advance!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your chest pain is subsided by pressure, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. Awkward Sitting position in flights can cause muscle spasm and throbbiing chest pain. So musculoskeletal pain is more likely. But better to rule out heart diseases first because your pain is situated on left side. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. For musculoskeletal pain, you should avoid awkward sitting postures. Sit with proper back and chest support in flight. Application of warm water pad on affected areas is also beneficial. You can take simple painkiller like ibuprofen for pain. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Has angiography been done anytime in the past? First angiography should be done if there are blockages they should be opened.

Surgery is not a big surgery and although infection risk is bit higher if sugar is well controlled and with antibiotics risk of infection is less. This will protect him from sudden cardiac death. so my advice is angiography followed by AICD. Also lifestyle modification like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly once  or twice a week. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at 30 min a day and 5 days a week.

I can understand your concern. I have gone through the echo report you have provided. This 2d echo is absolutely normal. No need to worry for any heart diseases. In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid movements causing pain. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright. And no need to worry for heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I recently have been taking the medication Imitrex first try i had nausea, second nothing, third about 20 minutes after i got short of breathe for about 20 minutes and then was relieved. I had a couple beers with dinner. Next morning about an hour after i woke i started having sharp chest pains with dizziness, short of breath, clumpsiness, trouble concintrating. I went to the er had ecg and blood work they said i was fine. next day still not relieved followed up to find I am potassium diffiecent from the ER test results I was 3.1 two months earlier it was 4.6 doc is puzzled what caused the sudden drop. Also how long until I feel normal again should I worry about my heart and the long term from this event what about my kindeys is there anything you can suggest?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for major heart or kidney disease because your ecg and blood reports are normal. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of nausea, vomiting, chest pain, tightness, pressure etc. And this GERD is mostly due to stress and anxiety. These stress and anxiety gives you shortness of breath, clumsiness, dizziness etc. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. For GERD take pantoprazole and domperidone tablet. Don't worry, with all these, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Symptoms ive had are sharp chest pain (mostly upper area and towards middle) and shortness of breath (which is relieved by burping all the time). While having these pains, i most of the time also have flatulence. These sharp pains never last long although one time i had one pain in the middle of the chest (quite sharp) for an entire night and woke up with the same pain. I dont have any other symptoms. I had an ekg done which showed sinus rhythm as well as inferior q waves. I realise that q waves represent an old heart attack, which is surprising considering ive never had a heart attack i know of. A cardiologist looked at my ecg and said they might have been wrongly interpreted, suggesting they might be r waves. can someone please put me out of misery?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are not having any heart diseases. R wave in ecg is normal. This wave is normally present in ecg. So no need to worry for heart diseases. And at your age of 20 years, heart diseases are unlikely. Your all symptoms are more suggestive of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest pain, gaseous distention, flatulence etc. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food.

Yes, you should definitely consult your doctor immediately and get done clinical examination of local part of right breast. You are having pain and bruised veins on that part of breast. These are seen in breast infection like breast abscess. During pregnancy, there is milk production in breast. Since you have not delivered, this milk will stay in the breast and make breast engorged and tender. It also causes infection and this can lead to abscess formation. So better to get done clinical examination and ultrasound examination of breast as soon as possible. You may need antibiotic, anti inflammatory and painkiller drugs. Application of warm water pad on affected areas is also beneficial. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Points in favour of this are annual occurrence during the same period, skin lesions (rashes add hives), chest congestion, cough etc. So get done detailed allergy testing. Best treatment for allergic disease is identification of causative allergen and if possible complete avoidance of it. You should also take combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast). Don't take prednisone as it is oral steroid and can harm you.

In my opinion, we should rule out worsening of atrial fibrillation (AF) and underlying heart condition for your symptoms because both of them can cause similar symptoms. So consult doctor and get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg and 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry for major heart diseases. Sometimes, stress and tension can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright, but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have have severe problems with spasticity due to a stroke. I was not a good candidate for Baclofen. My Blood pressure has been very difficult to control. After many trials of different medications, I am now on Edarbi 80 mg in the AM and Amlodipine 2.5 mg in PM and Clonodine 0.1 mg when my systolic goes over 150 and or diastolic goes over 100. The clonodine has always been successful in bringing it down. For reasons not explained to me, my doctor does not want me to take it often. Only when I can t control my pressure. The Clonidine hasn t caused me any side affects. I read that Clonidine has been used to lessen spasticity. Could I use this medication safely and ask my MD to switch me to Clonidine?","Doctor":"Hi, Although Clonidine is a medication for hypertension, which can also help in spasticity, it has several side effects which can be experienced with doses for the above purpose. First-line medications for hypertension are those that you are taking right now - Edarbi and Amlodipine, which can be titrated for more optimal blood pressure control. Taking Clonidine at higher doses can cause hypotension which is not beneficial and may be harmful as you already had a stroke before. I recommend a consult with your doctor since there are other medications that relieve spasticity aside from clonidine, which has lesser side effects. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Daryl Derick B. Dizon, General & Family Physician"},{"Patient":"my blood pressure is 135 over 107 and it was 131 over 99 two days ago..

What kind of treatments options are there?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, accessory ribs are not that common. Even if they are present, they are mostly asymptomatic and accidental finding on chest x ray. Symptomatic accessory ribs are uncommon. Surgical removal of those accessory ribs is the only treatment option. So better to consult cardiothoracic surgeon for surgery. First get done CT scan. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. Type 2 respiratory failure means hypercapnic (high carbon dioxide) respiratory failure. This means she is not exhaling carbon dioxide out of the body effectively. It is commonly seen with brain diseases and neurosurgery patients. Brain controls respiration (inspiration as well as expiration). So when diseases of brain progress, respiration is also affected, specifically expiration. Since her brain condition is irreversible and not improving, her type 2 respiratory failure will also worsen and not improve. So prognosis in her case is very poor. Hope I have solved your query.

I've been taking heartburn medicine and ibuprofen but nothing has shifted it.Katie.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart diseases because you are having chest pain with palpitations. So first get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for major heart diseases. Sometimes, uncontrolled stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. They can cause GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and this GERD is the cause for your uncontrolled heart burn. Don't take ibuprofen, this will worsen your heart burn more. Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). Arrhythmia can cause palpitations, tachycardia, pounding heart, kicking sensations etc. So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for major heart diseases like arrhythmia. Sometimes, stress and tension can also cause similar symptoms.

Your all symptoms like chest tightness, racing heart rate, swelling in legs, breathing difficulty in lying down position etc are suggestive of heart failure. You are having congenital valvular heart disease.. And this can cause congestive heart failure. So better to consult cardiologist and get done clinical examination and 2d echo.

She asked me several questions regarding the symptoms I had during the chest pain episodes. I had no issues with trying to catch my breath, I didnt have pressure pain in my chest more like an ache here and there, and I didnt have any other heart related symptoms. To ease my anxiety she did an EKG and the results were abnormal. She did not seem concerned and in fact said that she didnt really think I needed one in the first place. She said the results didnt point to anything in particular just that it was abnormal. She said my normal could be considered abnormal. I do know my heart rate increases when I inhale and decreases when I exhale and because of this it slows very quick and almost seems like I am skipping a beat but I am not. She listened to my heart as well and said it sounded find. She suggested I come in 3 weeks for a repeat EKG and she said for me not to worry because she really wasnt concerned at all. I AM WORRIED!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) in your case.

By your history and description, possibility of either bronchitis or congestive heart failure is more. Both these can cause heaviness in chest with breathing difficulty. So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Blood pressure monitoring 3. PFT (pulmonary function test) for bronchitis 4. 2d echo (for heart failure).

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out tuberculosis in your case. You are having enlarged glands in neck. This must be enlarged cervical lymphnodes. Most common site for tubercular lymphadenitis is neck. You are also having chest pain with night sweats. Both these are also seen in tuberculosis. So better to get done 1. Ultrasound examination of neck. 2. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) 3. Chest x ray 4. Complete blood count with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). If these reports are suggestive of tuberculosis then you have to take anti tubercular drugs for 6 months. Don't worry, with appropriate treatment, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your chest pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal pain due to excessive coughing. Coughing actually involves ribs, diaphragm, intercostal muscles etc. When someone is having excessive coughing, all these have to work more and so after sometime they started paining. So proper treatment of cough is must to reduce pain. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system to rule out bronchitis and lung infection. You may need inhaled treatment and higher antibiotics. Along with cough treatment, do following things for chest pain. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Is this likely caused by the surgery (both were spinal anesthesia) or possibly the motrin and oxycodone they gave me for pain?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, cesarean section can cause chest pain post operatively. It is mostly musculoskeletal in nature. During cesarean section retractors are used to get good sight of surgical (operative) field. Normal duration for cessation section and retractors placement is 1 to 1.5 hours. During this period intercostal muscles are pulled under retractors. And once effect of anesthesia is over, they start paining. So this is common after cesarean section. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drug. Don't worry, you will be alright. In some cases chest ultrasound and physiotherapy are also needed. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

He just came in gasping and couldn't talk. He was. Very pale and I got his breathing machine ready for him. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. This not breathing thing came on all of a sudden about three weeks ago and he has even said there has to be something else wrong. Help...please.","Doctor":"hithank you for providing the brief history.A thorough musculoskeletal and respiratory assessment is advised.As your husband is diagnosed with COPD, and is gasping alot , means his lungs requirements are bit and the alveoli needs some help. Only oxygen therapy is not the long term solution. let us understand little about the pathophysiology of COPDPathophysiology of COPDCOPD is a complex syndrome comprised of airway inflammation, mucociliary dysfunction and consequent airway structural changesAirway inflammationCOPD is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways, lung tissue and pulmonary blood vessels as a result of exposure to inhaled irritants such as tobacco smoke.The inhaled irritants cause inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, B cells and macrophages to accumulate. When activated, these cells initiate an inflammatory cascade that triggers the release of inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP-6, MMP-9), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) and fibrinogen. These inflammatory mediators sustain the inflammatory process and lead to tissue damage as well as a range of systemic effects. The chronic inflammation is present from the outset of the disease and leads to various structural changes in the lung which further perpetuate airflow limitation.Structural changesAirway remodeling in COPD is a direct result of the inflammatory response associated with COPD and leads to narrowing of the airways. Three main factors contribute to this: peribronchial fibrosis, build-up of scar tissue from damage to the airways and over-multiplication of the epithelial cells lining the airways.Parenchymal destruction is associated with loss of lung tissue elasticity, which occurs as a result of destruction of the structures supporting and feeding the alveoli (emphysema). This means that the small airways collapse during exhalation, impeding airflow, trapping air in the lungs and reducing lung capacityMucociliary dysfunctionSmoking and inflammation enlarge the mucous glands that line airway walls in the lungs, causing goblet cell metaplasia and leading to healthy cells being replaced by more mucus-secreting cells.Additionally, inflammation associated with COPD causes damage to the mucociliary transport system which is responsible for clearing mucus from the airways. Both these factors contribute to excess mucus in the airways which eventually accumulates, blocking them and worsening airflow.To make the rehabilitation plan better - along with oxygen therapy and medication your husband need to under go physical therapy. As the muscles of respiration are weak and are not able to support the lungs to perform normal respiration.In my clinical practice I have seen a lady aged 85, pacemaker, bypass and dyspnea. Cannot walk 10 steps either and get breathless badly. With the help of physical therapy the respiratory muscles were trained to balance the requirements of the lung tissue and the rest of the body. @ present she is much better and do not need oxygen therapy at all.Things can work better if a proper measurement is applied for rehabilitation of COPD. Medicines act only for symptomatic relief, and there is no long term relief. Making the body fit enough with exercise is the key for rehabilitation.For any further doubts/queries/suggestions you can't contact me an I will be happy to help you further.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"hi, i spontaneously quit smoking cigarettes exactly 10 days ago because of black spots in my spit. I researched about it and it has to do with my heavy marijuana smoking. I've been smoking marijuana everyday for the past year and a half, about 2 grams of weed a day pretty much. I have been smoking cigarettes for 3 years about half a pack a day (sometimes i smoked less and sometimes i smoked more than so). I do not crave any cigs at all anymore but I am freaking out thinking that there is something wrong with my respiratory system, looking out for any suspicious feels or nudges in my chest and I have felt a few that feel more superficial than lung related. I am 22 years old about 5'5\\" and 130 in weight.","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough examination of the lungs and musculoskeletal assessment is advised.Since you were smoking in the past and and heavy marijuana smoker as well, due to this, the lung tissue has become weak. Since the body was habituated for 3 years for the supply of nicotine and now sudden stopping will also give some sort of symptoms which you need not have to worry much. If possible take a CT/MRI of the lungs once to assess the lung tissues. Also a pulmonary function test is done to check the lung capacities.I will recommend you to perform regular breathing exercises and respiratory muscle Strengthening exercises which a physical therapist will help you understand and learn.Performing this after an initial Pulmonary function test and later after a month of practice redoing the Pulmonary Function test will help you understand your progress.I have clinically seen cases with such complaints and they respond well to physical therapy. A good amount of people regain their fitness of lungs back after Pulmonary rehabilitation.for any further query/doubts/suggestions you can feel free to contact me.

When stent is put in vessel there is inherent risk of blockages due to clot formation, it's attack. Stent has basically opened your blocked arteries but no one can guarantee that you will not have repeat attack. It's like repeat attack in artificial vessel. This risk is highest in initial 1 year, later decreases. However, there are medicines to prevent it, which are not always cent percent effective. You can ask your doctor for new blood thinners like tab brilinta which further reduces chances of stent blockages.Hope I have answered your query.

In my opinion, she might be having metastases in the heart muscles (myocardium). This can cause poor functioning of heart muscles and so pumping is reduced. Angiography will detect if there is blockage in coronary arteries. Since her angiography is normal, her coronary arteries are clear from blockage. So her poor heart pumping is mostly due to myocardium involvement.

I am a healthy eater, non-smoker, and I exercise regularly. I have had heart palpitations that started after taking a high dose of Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate). I noticed the palpitations and a racing heartbeat right after taking the pills. I was scared, but thought it would be fine in the morning. They never went away. That was three months ago. I can describe it as a skipped beat and then a really hard beat. Thump, thump thump....pause....THUMP. I can feel it in my neck and throat. It also disrupts my breathing rhythm. I have seen my general practitioner several times and have had an EKG and stress test. She told me I possibly have PVC s. She is convinced it is nothing to worry about, however, they are increasing in frequency (sometimes 5-6 a minute) and are very distracting (scary too). I get them randomly with an increase during exercise and the day after. My question is: Could taking this medication have permanently alter my heart function? If not, could it have made me more sensitive to my heart rhythm? I repeat, I have NEVER experienced this sensation before taking this medication. I realize heart palpitations can be benign, but why would they start after this one dose, and continue months later?

I can understand your concern. Godex is having entecavir. It is monoclonal antibody against hepatitis B virus. So you are taking correct drugs for hepatitis B. But, it won't make you non reactive after 1 month. Actually it needs prolonged treatment, at least 10-12 months for this. All these depends on your viral load. So first get done hepatitis B viral load. And monitor this every two monthly for reduction in viral load. Better to consult gastroenterologist and discuss all these.

Rifampicin and isoniazid cause drug induced hepatitis, neuropathy (due to folate and pyridoxine deficiency). 3. Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis, kidney damage etc. So better to get done ecg, liver function test and Renal function test once every two monthly. Avoid oily and spicy food.

I can understand your concern. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. But better to rule out heart diseases first because left sided piercing chest pain is common with heart diseases. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both of them are normal then no need to worry for major heart related diseases. Musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drug. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take proton pump inhibitor like pantoprazole. 5.

I am typically very healthy but over the past few weeks have felt very tired and as though my legs muscles in particular were aching all of the time. I saw my GP last week who did some tests and diagnosed me with asthma. However I did not find the 'salbutamol' pump very effective. In addition to this I often felt quite nauseous after using the inhaler so have not used it for the past two days- there has been no adverse affect to my breathing but I still generally feel unwell. Sometimes I just need to lie down as I feel so sick and exhausted- usually at night time. I had a full blood count last week and the results were all normal. I also have eczema and have had an on-going sore throat for a few months. I do not have swollen glands or a fever at all. Thanks in advance for any help!

I inhaled a lot during my effort to put it out. I had problems breathing, red eyes and then some headache and a little pain in the chest. Is there something that I should do now and probably check ?Many thanks!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Any form of smoke is irritant to the lungs and cause bronchitis (inflammation of airways). This is the cause for chest pain and breathing difficulty. Smoke will also cause irritation in eyes and cause reddening of eyes. So wash your eyes thoroughly with cold water 5-6 times a day. You will also need anti inflammatory eye drops. For breathing difficulty, better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system. You will need inhaled treatment in the form of inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

In my opinion, we should first rule out heart diseases like arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) for your symptoms. Arrhythmia like supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter etc can cause similar kind of symptoms. So consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg) You may need anti arrhythmia drug too. Don't worry, you will be alright. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment.

They want a comparison CXR but I don't have one.  Any advice? How do you differentiate the 2??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, one can not diagnose neoplasm (cancer) or adhesion only on the basis of chest x ray. Chest x ray is giving only Two dimentional (2D) picture of any lesion. It is only screening test for lung lesion. For confirmation, you need CT scan. CT will give you three dimentional (3D) picture. CT will also tell you about exact size, shape and margins of lesion, association with surrounding lung, necrotic center or not, mediastinal lymphnode enlarged or not etc. All these things are important in deferentiating between neoplasm (cancer) and adhesion (benign lesion). So better to consult pulmonologist and get done CT scan and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Bronchitis is inflammation of airways. So it causes burning chest pain and breathing difficulty. It is common in smokers. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only. You will need inhaled treatment in the form of inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide or fluticasone).

In my opinion, you should immediately consult cardiologist. T inversion on ecg is suggestive of ischemia. Your symptoms are also suggestive of ischemic heart disease. Most common cause for this is coronary artery blockage. You are having pre diabetes and strong family history of coronary artery disease. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1.

Kindly advise","Doctor":"Hello,Telminorm Am is the combination of two drugs in moderate dosage and telminorm 80 is single drug in high dose, so considering together, both are nearly same, and what will reduce the bp more depend on the patients sensitivity to individual drug.

Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of burning, nausea, chest pain, chest tightness etc. So better to follow these steps for symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and tension. 4. Take proton pump inhibitor like pantoprazole. 5. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. 6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have been having chest pain, left side.

Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 5. Take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

No need to take nitro for your chest pain because you are not having cardiac chest pain and nitroglycerin is given in cardiac chest pain only.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should get done chest x ray and PFT (pulmonary function test). Possibility of either lung infection or bronchitis is more because both these can cause cough with chest congestion. So chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. You may need antibiotic, inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on the basis of these reports. Don't worry, you will be alright. For speedy recovery, better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I feel like the lower half of my lungs do not expand much upon taking a deeper breath of air. Also, I have a twitch in my lower back/ pelvic area? area that causes my whole body to lurch.

Now, i ve developed a tightness around my abdominal area with specificly being uncomfortabele behind my lower left ribs toward the middle. My upper mid-back also feels stuck . Could this be due to the bad coughing spells? When should I see my dr? What could it possibly be?","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for choosing HCM to post your question .I read carefully your question and my opinion is as  follows:Your cough is considered subacute .The most common causes of subacute cough are: 1.Respiratory tract infection with Bordetella pertussis that is a 6 week disease divided into 3 stages,catarrhal ,paroxysmal and convalescent stage.Catarrhal stage is characterized by nasal congestion,sneezing,tearing, low grade fever.The paroxysmal phase is characterized by paroxysms of intense coughing and posttussive vomiting and turning red with coughing.Convalescent stage is characterized by chronic cough which may last for weeks.In this case antibiotics have little value.In this situation antitussives (such as codeine),bronchodilatators (such as Salbutamol inhaler)can help relieve the symptoms.2.Postnasal drip syndrome lately called Upper airway cough syndrome.It results from rhinosinusitis that can be in nature allergic,bacterial or from other causes.3.Gastroesophageal  reflux disease.From what you wrote in your question it seems to me that the last two options are less possible but i would  like to know a bit more about your medical history.Bad coughing spells can cause muscle strain mainly seen on chest muscles,abdominal muscles or muscle in back.A painkiller like ibuprofen can be taken when the pain of the pulled muscle from coughing becomes unbearable.I hope my opinion is helpful to you.Wish you good health.Kind regardsDr.Dushi"},{"Patient":"i have bronchitis and sinunitis...just got my meds yesterday. i work in a restaurant and they want me to work tonight as a waitress. my doctor said that i am contagious until about 2 to 3 days of the medication kicking in..what are the chances i can spread this to other staff and customers?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, your doctor is right. You are contagious for at least 2-3 days of starting medicines. Actually, most common cause for bronchitis and sinusitis is viral infection. And you can spread virus by droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, laughing etc. So your staff and customers will be at risk if you work with bronchitis and sinusitis.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. Your left sided chest pain is associated with activities like pull, push etc. And this is characteristic feature of musculoskeletal pain. Your right sided chest pain is associated with exhalation. This can be due to pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). So get done chest x ray to rule causes for pleurisy. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for lung disease. Musculoskeletal pain is more likely in your case. So avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take simple painkiller like ibuprofen. Don't worry, you will be alright..

I went to the cardiologist today and had both an electro cardiogram and an echo cradiogram done. I ve had a heart murmer since my birth, though I am not sure exactly what kind it is. However, I do know for a fact that it is an innocent murmur, and that I should expect to outgrow it within the next few years. I am fifteen by the way. Now, I have smoked marijuana several times. I began this year. Usually it went fine. Then when i began to do it more frequently and at higher doses, I would feel the increased heart-rate, panic, etc. I realize this is normal. But i once fainted for a few seconds as a result of standing up too quickly while high. I understand that this is brought about by a rapid decrease in blood pressure? That s only happened once though. Other side effects have been a slight cold/fuzzy feeling in the left chest at the very beginning of the buzz, which goes away shortly. My question is if I can safely use marijuana in moderation, like once a month or probably less. How does my heart murmur play into all of this? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,I suppose your echo was normal, if it was then we can consider it as innocent murmur. Marijuana will not affect this murmur, but even if you consider it using occasionally it's very difficult to craving and one usually progress to abuse. Also, addiction is associated with high risk behavior and psychological issues like impairment in school or work function, giving up of previously enjoyed social and recreational activities, and use of cannabis in potentially hazardous situations, that is, while driving, risk of anxiety, depression, panic state and schizophrenia etc. So it always better to refrain yourself from this, and you are too young.Hope I have answered your query.

Thank you,Gabriela","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, possibility of viral infection is more in their case. In general, viral infection is most common cause for bronchitis. And incidence is ever higher in children. Your both children got infection simultaneously. Viral infection is notorious to spread through aerosol route. So all these points favour viral infection more. But for 100% confirmation, you need to get done throat swab PCR for viruses. If this is positive then it is 100% viral infection. You can also get done PCT (procalcitonin). PCT is marker for bacterial infection. So if it is negative then it is not bacterial infection.

Possibility of acid reflux related chest discomfort is more. But better to first rule out heart related diseases because these can cause unpleasant sensations in chest. So get done ecg and 2d echo.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you should avoid all forms of smoking including cigarette, hukka, Marijuana etc. Also avoid second hand smoking (passive smoking). You already had pneumothorax twice, so your lungs are already weak and prone for further damage. Any form of smoke will damage your lungs further. So if you start smoking or having exposure two second hand smoke then chances of recurrence of pneumothorax, lung infection, bronchitis etc are more. So for your betterment, as a doctor, I advice you to avoid all forms of smoke. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Amphoterecin B is drug of choice for coccoidiodomycosis in lungs. But since patient is having hypersensitivity reaction to this drug, we need to replace this with colistin or itraconazole or enidulafungin. All these are second line drugs for coccoidiodomycosis. When Amphoterecin B is contraindicated, these drugs should be given. Better to consult infectious disease specialist and discuss about starting any of these drugs. I am practicing in India. Here we are using these drugs. So if you don't get them in your country you can come to India for treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I used to smoke 1 pack of cigarettes each day but for 2 months have cut down it to less than half a pack each day. This is the first time I am feeling so. Haven't had any such problem earlier. Can it be lung cancer ??? I am really tensed have taken tried antibiotics, cough syrup and nasal spray. I have been on them for 3 days. The mucus is still building up in my nose but seems to get settled in my chest as I cough real hard but very little mucus comes out.age : 21 yrs (male)Weight : 68 kghave been smoking for 4 years.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of lung cancer is very less because lung cancer is uncommon at your age of 21 years. Possibility of bronchitis is more because you are smoker. Smoke irritates airways and cause inflammatory changes (bronchitis). So better to first quit smoking. This is the most important thing in treatment. Also consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray (to rule out lung cancer) 3. PFT (pulmonary function test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis. PFT will also tell about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, with proper treatment, you will be alright. But first quit smoking.

He just told me he did  not eat today cause he was at work and did not bring anything with him - he ate cookies  - real nutricious","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since he is having blood in stool and abdominal pain, possibility of intestinal infection is more likely for his rib tenderness. So get done stool microscopic examination and colonoscopy for this. Also get done ecg to rule out heart diseases as a cause for his left sided chest pain because heart diseases can cause left sided chest pain. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Intestinal infection is more likely. So he may need antibiotic and other supportive drugs. Don't worry, he will be alright.

I can understand your concern. Yes, this is curable. Chest x ray picture is suggestive of pneumonia (lung infection). And it is mostly due to bacteria. So antibiotic drugs are needed to treat lung infection. With proper treatment, pneumonia can be treated fully without scarring of lungs. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system. You will need higher antibiotic like levofloxacin or Azithromycin or other. Along with antibiotics, other supportive drugs like mucolytic, expectorant, antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs are needed for faster recovery. Don't worry, with appropriate treatment, you will be alright. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Since she is having hypertension, we should first rule out heart diseases like arrhythmia or angina for her symptoms. Sometimes resting ecg can be normal despite of having heart diseases. So get done 1. Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg) 2. 2d echo 3. Stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar kind of chest pain and palpitations. So ask her to avoid stress and tension.

I also checked my pulse and I normally run pretty low like between 45-55, but it was 63 when I checked. Do you think maybe it's gas or something more serious?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Central chest pain more on lying down is commonly seen in GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). But better to first get done ecg to rule out heart diseases. If ecg is normal then no need to worry for serious illness. Possibility of GERD is more. GERD is due laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of central chest pain, gaseous distention etc. So take antacid tablet like pantoprazole. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid stress and tension. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

My grandma recently died of secondry breast cancer which had spread to her lungs, so i was wondering if it could be genetic. I swim 4-5 times a week competitivley for a club and my fitness is good however recently i have been feeling very short of breath. After 50m slow swims i can find myself very out of breath and wheezy even though i have not exerted hardly any effort. In addition i have found myself being incredibly out of breath when just walking up the stairs, and i have to sit down. My heart rate is usually between 56-60 and 110-120 after hard exercise but after slow 50 metres swims for about the last 2 months now my heart rate has reached 140-145. I'm really worried and wondering whether or not i should go see my doctor? I am stressed out the moment with my as levels next week but i dont think ithat would be the cause. What do you think i should do?","Doctor":"Hello,There is increased risk of breast cancer especially in first degree relatives and increased almost twofold if a woman had one affected first-degree relative.  But in you there is no increased risk of lung ca. In you, breast cancer currently is very low since you are very young and patient is not first degree relatives. Still you do self breast examination regularly and look for any hard lump. It's possible you are allergic to cold, that's why swim lead to wheezing. Also you should get your hemoglobin checked which is again common cause of shortness of breath in female. If you are still having wheezing you can get tab Montair LC at bedtime which is an anti-allergic medicine prescribed from local doctor.Hope I have answered your query.

Main treatment for asthma is inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Montek LC (montelukast and levocetrizine) is add on drug. It is not main treatment. Since you are not taking inhaled treatment, you are not improving with asthma. In my opinion, you should first get done PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will tell you about severity of the asthma and treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You will definitely improve with long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA - formoterol or salmeterol) and newer ICS (fluticasone or budesonide).

I can understand your concern. At your age of 47 years (perimenopausal), every chest pain should be evaluated for heart diseases first. Heart diseases are common in this age because of hormonal imbalance (low estrogen). So first get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can also cause similar kind of central chest pain. So take proton pump inhibitor like pantoprazole. Drink cold water and avoid hot and spicy food.

Spot or hole on chest x ray can be due to 1. Benign cyst 2. Infective cavity like tuberculosis 3. Benign nodule 4. Malignant mass Possibility of benign lesion like (cyst or nodule) is more because you are non smoker and lesion is stable over years. But better to get done CT thorax to confirm the etiology.

My cardio function is great, blood panel good, but elevated inflammation markers. Inhalers including albutoral showed no pulmonary change. Oxygen saturation typically at 97%. No one has been able to diagnose root cause of emboli. Any thoughts are appreciated! I am on xeralto and diuretics. I am hoping someone has seen these symptoms present before and knows the cause of them. No dvt","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.to come closer look to your symptoms that you have shortness of breath, fatigue, edema and weight gain.Few things to understand here - the symptoms you are facing are all interconnected. As due to the embolism you are not able to have proper utilization of the lung fields, which is needed. Due to which the oxygen is less in the body and you feel  fatigue. Also when you feel fatigue later it will restrict your cardiorespiratory endurance and lead to edema. To cut down all the bridges between the whole process, you need to focus on doing regular exercises. As once you will do your most symptoms will come down. As exercise improve the metabolism and also the oxygen in the blood it will help further to recover and provide good functional abilities.I have seen cases with such issues and 99% have recovered well. I wish the same of you. god bless youRegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"i am a male of 21 yrs fully healthy,,,since from 5months m havin shortness of breath along with burrping continously,,havin some abdomain pain,tightness of stomach n chest part,,,went 2 hospital done all test ,like ecg,cbc.liver function test,endoscopy,x -ray,,evrything is normal..but having bilirubin direct n globulin little more,,,,,,can any one help me out please","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since all your investigations are normal, no need to worry for heart diseases. Shortness of breath in young age (21 years) can be due to asthma. And for the diagnosis of asthma, you need to get done PFT (pulmonary function test). You have not done PFT yes. So in my opinion, you should first get done PFT. If PFT is normal then no need to worry for asthma. Stress and anxiety can also cause shortness of breath with burping. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, with counselling and drugs, you will be alright.

Though my symptoms were improving with antibiotic and the lung xray was improving, the doctor still recommended me to take anti TB meds. do i need to take the meds? can it be a false positive result considering my symptoms were actually improving with the antibiotic?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely take anti tubercular drugs. TB PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is highly specific. It's specificity is almost 100%. So no chance of false positive report. You might be having mixed infection (tubercular and bacterial). So with antibiotics, your bacterial part is improving and hence chest x ray is also improving. Tuberculosis is basically a chronic disease. If don't take treatment at present, it will show after 1-2 months. So even if you are improving with anti tubercular drugs, since your TB PCR is positive, you should definitely Complete the course of anti tubercular drugs. Hope I have solved your query.

It was much worse a couple days ago, but its still uncomfortable.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out recurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in your case. Your symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing etc are seen in PE. Your saturation is also low (91%). Normal saturation of oxygen should be above 95%.Decrease in saturation also seen in PE. And it is very common for PE to recur after 1 year.

Common causes for pleurisy are lung infection, bronchitis etc. So better to consult pulmonologist for her and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3.

I have asthma and had a severe lung infection.  The doctors immediately decided that it is due to the fact that we have 10 parrots, one being an umbrella cockatoo, one African grey and various others.  They want me to get rid of my birds.  I am having a great deal of difficulty facing that possibility and need more information before going that route.  I have not been home since it was thoroughly cleaned as my husband was trying to minimize the dander/dust as much as possible.  Any suggestions about getting better but keeping our parrots?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is more. And most likely cause for this is exposure to allergen. Common household allergens are dust, mites, animal dander, fur etc. Best treatment for this is avoidance of allergen. If you do this, no treatment is required. Pneumonia heals by itself once we remove the allergen. So in my opinion, you should definitely remove all the birds (suspected allergens) from you home. You will definitely improve once you remove them. You might not need medicine also. So there is no alternative to this. This is for your health.

This can be due to nodule, Mass, infiltration, consolidation, cyst, blood clots etc. So you will need CT thorax and bronchoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. And for this, you need to consult pulmonologist. Don't worry, you will be alright. Consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

It comes and goes, but everytimes it starts back, something else hurts too. Now its my chest, jaws, back, neck. I went to a cardiologist about a year ago; had a normal ultrasound. Every now and then my heart feels like it skipps a beat. No one has been able to tell me what is wrong. (This all started before I gained ~60 lbs). It is a dull, achy pain in the center, and left side of my chest. Dull pain in left shoulder blade. Tingling pain in jaws. Should I still suspect my heart? What else could it be?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be cardiac related. Anxiety or a musculo-skeletal pain could be the cause of all this clinical scenario. Gastro-esophageal reflux can not be excluded either. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing some additional tests: - a cardiac stress test for coronary artery disease- inflammation tests (PCR, ESR)- a chest X ray studyI would also recommend trying an antiacid. If this helps relieve your symptoms, it would indicate gastro-esophageal reflux as a possible cause of your troubles. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of your symptoms. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

After a week or so of them i decided to check the internet, and convinced myself i was having a heart attack and ended up in the ER. They did an EKG which came back normal. I was still getting the pains, which felt like a burning, aching, and stabbing pain in the upper left part of my chest, so i went to a NP who told me that it was probably just chest wall pain. She told me to take Naproxen for a week. It didn't really make anything better. Now the chest pain has changed, and it feels like a tightness in the middle of my chest, along with a stabbing pain under my left breast and a stabbing/aching pain under my armpits. I also feel it into my back, and its spread down my left arm, leg and my neck into my jaw. I'm also getting pretty bad headaches on my left side. My face also feels a bit numb, and the pain feels like its around my left eye. I went back to the doctor and she did a chest x-ray and blood work which was normal, and she diagnosed me with anxiety. I think that may be the case because I'm constantly worried about the pain, its made it hard to get through the day. I live in a smallish town and worry that maybe my doctor missed something.

I can understand your concern. First of all no need to worry for major heart and lung related diseases because your reports are normal and you are too young (19years).In my opinion, you are mostly having uncontrolled stress and anxiety.

Avoid movements causing pain. Take muscle relaxant tablet. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Gentle massage over involved region can also be helpful. Don't worry, you will be alright.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you can give her Azithromycin. No harm in it.. Most common cause for bronchitis is infection. Azithromycin being a broad antibiotic, helps in infection.

By your history and description, possibility of irritant cough is more. And it can be due to all the things you have mentioned like cutting and working blackberry bushes, inhaling pollens etc. These things are highly irritant in nature. When they inhaled, they cause inflammation in the trachea (center of chest-sternal area). And this gives you tingle or tickel sensations at the top of sternum. So better to avoid such things or wear face mask while doing those activities. At present take combination of antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a.

I can understand your concern. Scoliosis actually causes poor lung development in affected areas. So she might be having localised maldeveloped or collapsed lung due Scoliosis of last two ribs. And this maldeveloped, collapsed segments can cause pleuritic pain (pain on coughing, sneezing etc). So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and CT thorax (if needed)  to diagnose this problem.

No, you should not start typhoid medications.. Your symptoms are not suggestive of typhoid.. Typhoid is actually an intestinal infection which give symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting etc. Since all these symptoms are not present in your case, no need for typhoid medicines. And weak typhoid test can be false positive. It is not 100% confirmatory. So, in my opinion, you are not having typhoid.

I ve had trouble with bulimia for quite a few years and I think it may have something to do with it.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, bulimia can cause these symptoms, not directly but indirectly. Bulimia is known cause for GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). This GERD causes laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of burning, pressure and tightness in the chest. So we should first treat your bulimia. Hence consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to control your eating habits. Don't eat large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Start proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) on empty stomach for GERD. Don't worry, you will be alright.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

You are having right sided chest tightness and right shoulder pain. And this can be due to pleurisy. Common causes for pleurisy are lung infection, bronchitis, tube, pleural effusion etc. So better to first get done chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for lung diseases. Sometimes, musculoskeletal pain can be the cause. So take painkiller (ibuprofen). Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright, but first rule out pulmonary causes.

It started with long coughing fits in the day and these have reduced but have been added to by coughing fits at night which feel like they go on for ever. Also during these I cannot breathe in which initially caused me to panic but I found I could breathe in if I calmed down but this took some time. Chemist gave me a Ventolin inhaler to open airways during attack which helped a bit. Also I have an almost constant tickling sensation in the back of my throat and at night for the last week my chest has felt tight - ventolin inhaler has helped relieve this. Finally I feel like something is stuck in the right hand side of my throat but cant normally cough it up as cough is generally unproductive, except first thing in the morning when I am able to cough up some clear phlegm but also tend to vomit as well. Occasional dry mouth at night doesnt help. Really getting fed up with this now - went to doctors two weeks ago who thought I had the after effects of a viral chest infection and thought it would all clear up within a week - now two weeks on there is no sign of this. Can you advise? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for choosing H C M to post your health concern.I read carefully your question and my opinion is as follows:From what you describe it seems to me that all these paroxysms of intense coughing lasting up to several minutes, the tendency to vomit after cough(postussive vomiting) and the duration of cough(4weeks) match with the clinical presentation of pertussis infection.I dont know about your vaccination status (incomplete or absent pertussis vaccination)Pertussis is a respiratory infection that lasts about six weeks ,starting with a catarrhal phase followed by a paroxysmal phase and convalescent phase.Vaccinated adults usually develop only prolonged bronchitis.Treatment usually involves an antibiotic but it only helps if administered in the first or second week of symptoms.In your situation Ventolin inhaler that your doctor prescribed helps reducing the paroxysms and would help also if you start antitussives such as dextrometorphan,codeine.etcAnother less possibility of your health problems is even  the beginning of an asthma since very frequently it can be precipitated from a viral infection.It would help me to support this if i would have a well given medical history(allergies,familiar history of asthma)and physical examination Spirometry is useful for diagnosis and the treatment need to be guided by its value.I hope my opinion is help to you.Wish you good health.Kind regardsDr.Dushi"},{"Patient":"I am 47 yrs old, female and I've been suffering skipped heart beats for more than 10 yrs now.

I found this Web site on a search engine link after typing in the keywords, Saline IV causes stomach bloating? . My name is Nicole. I was 27 in January 2014 when I experienced very tight chest pain & the sensation of feeling like I couldn t breathe when I finished my plasma donation at a new Plasma Donor center. The last part of the donation calls for saline to run through the IV so it can calm the heart rate & sort the blood back to normal preventing clots. I alerted the employees at the facility that my chest was very tight. That employee had a nurse come in to check me. Later, paramedics made two trips to see me. I had told them to leave since I was feeling better. After several minutes of monitoring, sitting up in the waiting room eating gold fish & sipping on water, my heart rate never got below 120. When paramedics arrived the second time & placed me on the gurney, heart rate was at 150. I told one of the paramedics my heart was never this high when at rest or sitting down. After being hooked up to an IV at the ER, my heart rate never got below 99. That didn t shock me too much. I went in the plasma place feeling anxious due to the frigid temperatures outside & having a lot of anxiety-induced thoughts in my mind. However, I felt fine until the saline went thorugh my system at the end of the donation process. Keep in mind this was only my second donation. My first donation was a success with no issues a couple of weeks prior. Do you think the saline solution might have caused my chest to become tight due to bloating my stomach?","Doctor":"I dont think so. as saline only helps maintain the necessity of the body functions. you can meet a cardiologist for the same and get yourself assessed with possible advised tests. post that if the cardiologist permits for some small exercises under guided physical therapist kindly do it. it will help you retrain your cardiac system and get your heart rate fall under the normal parameters. but do meet a cardiologist before any exercise."},{"Patient":"I have surgical staples left in the chest and side from breast cancer surgery.

Yes, but if some one has bulla in lung, it has some chances that it may rupture and lead to formation of a pneumothorax. So a person who has come to know about presence of bulla in lung should also know  what are symptoms of pneumothorax, so that he can identify the situation and seek help immediately. A patient of pneumothorax report sudden onset of pain chest on the same side, and will start to have breathing difficulty. some patients may start feeling dizziness , and bluish discoloration of finger tips and tongue due to drop in BP and oxygen levels respectively.So you should be careful for these symptoms.

Although You have not mentioned details such as your age, the nature of cough, type of cough, any factors/time of day you have more cough, any other medication(for some other condition) you are taking etc.Yet few of the reasons a patient may be having long lasting cough can be Bronchial asthma- In this the patient has dry cough, usually at nights and associated with difficulty in breathing and wheeze. Chronic bronchitis can be another cause for chronic cough, although it is more common in smokers of middle age & elderly,still non smokers may also develop it due to various other risk factors.In This the cough is present for more than 2 years usually and cough is associated with sputum. Some people suffering from Gastro-esophageal reflux disease(GERD) can also have chronic cough ,but they will report symptoms associated with dyspepsia as well. Certain medicine such a Angiotensin Converting enzyme inhibitors used in patients of Hypertension may cause dry type pf chronic cough. Certain infections of lungs such as Tuberculosis can cause Cough that is associated with sputum, fever, Weight loss, decreased appetite, some times blood in sputum.

I never felt my situation hindered any sports etc but he is afraid to get into any physical sports like basketball etc for fear of injury?Is there some way of evaluating if this deformity is limiting him?","Doctor":"Thank you for your queryPectus Excavatum (sunken chest) varies in degree (mild to severe).This is a defect in the development of the anterior ribs and sternum (breastbone).The heart and lungs are adjacent structures and depending on the degree of the defect, they may or may not be significantly compromised.Reduced lung capacity, Cardiac wall and valve defects can be diagnosed by appropraite tests.Initially , the severity of the defect must be assessed. A series of tests ( ECG, CT scan of the chest , Echocardiogram will show mechanical/conductive defects of the heart; pulmonary function tests, treadmill test(stress/exercise test ) will show the functional defects of the lung/heart.)Based on these, his age and overall health, a treatment plan will be made.If it is mild and without any compromise in lung and heart function, the concern is mainly of a cosmetic one. normal physical activity can be continued. Corrective surgery is optionalIf it is causing severe retardation in his overall endurance, a corrective surgery may help.There are different types of procedures all of which are associated with certain risks. This should be discussed with his doctor before making a decision and if the benefits outweigh the risks, the surgery carried out has excellent prognosis once he is on the road to recovery.Hope this helps.

He put me on antibiotics and said to  take one pill each day for five days and I already took 4. I'm starting to notice ringing in my ears now, more like a buzzing sound. Could this be something to do with my bronchitis?","Doctor":"Thank you for your queryBronchitis is an inflammation of the small airways in your lung. This could be associated with allergies/asthma, infection of the respiratory tract.Secretions develop in response to inflammation and infection. This helps with clearing the airways . sometimes when there is too much, it enters our larger airways and requires us to cough it out.This process and an inflammation /infection in our throat could cause swelling of the throat and associated structures (ears, nose).The middle ear is connected to the throat by the eustachian tube , one on either side (This helps to regulate pressure in the ear). The nose is connected to several sinuses (air filled pockets in our face that help to regulate voice). When there is repeated or prolonged increase in pressure in these areas (blowing your nose too hard, coughing, swelling in these areas), it can affect the pressure within the ear and result in tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Ear infections or inner ear pathology may also be associated with tinnitus.Once the bronchitis and associated symptoms are better, the ringing should subside and go away.If this does not happen or if this interferes with your hearing, see an ENT (ear/nose/throat)specialist who can quickly examine you and treat any underlying causes. .hope this helps.Please get back to us if you have any questions.wish you good health"},{"Patient":"Hello.

I spent new years without drinking alcohol but i went with a friend to a tall building to watch the firework and there was a lot of smoke. can it be smoke inhalation? Greetings and a happy 2012","Doctor":"Thank you for your query.Yes it is possible.Smoke is highly irritant and toxic, especially those from fireworks.Inhaling these fumes can cause particles to deposit in your lungs and pleura (membranes that cover the lung) and a reactive inflammatory response can result in pain. Typically this gets worse when you try to take a deep breath. (pleuritis).It is important to have it checked out promptly to assess the extent of damage. in certain cases, your airways may also get inflamed and will compromise your breathing (life -threatening).Other causes include a local infection of the lung, or a muscle pull.If this continue for more than a few hours or worsens, and you experience and breathing difficulty or air hunger (you cant seem to breathe enough), dizziness, swelling of your eyes, tongue, mouth, face, visit the ER right away and do not drive.Hope this helps. please contact us if you have further questions.Wish you good health"},{"Patient":"I had arthroscopic left shoulder surgery 5 weeks ago.

I am a 40 year old male who has developed fluttering, spasms, twitching specifically in one area: the left side of the chest, right by the nipple.  I have it about 3 times a week.  It started about 6 or 7 years ago and has become progressively more intense.  I have visited doctors and have done research about it and have tried many different treatments and none so far have had any long-lasting effect. Doctors have told me that it is anxiety and that caffeine and smoking can exacerbate the symptoms but cutting down on smoking has not improved my condition and I don't consume beverages with caffeine.  I have tried magnesium which is supposed to calm the nervous system but have not noticed any difference.  The only correlation I can come up with is with sleep.  It seems that if I sleep poorly in the night, chances are the twitching will start with accompanying heaviness during the day.  The only causes I can think of at the time when it started were being very overweight and exercising constantly which led to a quick loss of 60 lbs.  I also had a tooth infection at the time which I didn't treat and subsequently became abscessed.  And lastly I had received 1 session of ECT therapy for depression about 11 years ago, after which I did feel strange numb sensations.  Any help would me much appreciated.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern.

Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic and anti depressant drugs.

In my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain, chest tightness, pressure, belching, burping etc. Along with drugs, you need to follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.4. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. 5.

Is this  something I should be overly concerned about or could it be GI related.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely concerned about this squeezing type of pain. Possibility of cardiac chest pain (angina) is more because you already had MI (myocardial ischemia). So immediately consult doctor and get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) to rule out heart diseases. If all these reports are normal then GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can be the cause. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the central squeezing type of pain. So take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Avoid hot and spicy food.

I can understand your concern. Since your Holter monitoring (48 hour continuous monitoring of ecg) is normal, no need to worry for arrhythmia or heart related diseases. Your symptoms are mostly due to uncontrolled anxiety. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution.

PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of asthma is based on severity only.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Increased heart rate can be because of a lot of reasons. It can be simple increase of heart rate because of any stressor or after exercise. If it occurs in resting state, it can be also because of abnormal conduction system of heart called as supraventricular arrhythmia. So you need certain tests to rule out same.1) ECG at the time of palpitation. If duration of palpitation is small than we put a 24 hr ECG monitoring called as holter monitoring.2) Thyroid function test3) 2D EchoAfter these test get yourself evaluated from your doctor.Regards,Dr. Sameer Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi there, I'm a 17/yr old female and yesterday I had a pretty serious choking accident.

This episode lasted about 10 minutes, I took an aspirin.  I got up after about 15 minutes, and the episode happened again.  It really scared me so I wrote down my medicine I take, and told my friend if it happened again I was calling 11.  Any suggestions as to what I was experiencing?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart diseases in your case. Heart diseases can cause tightness in chest, tachycardia (high pulse rate), recurrent episodes etc. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Your symptoms are worsening after meals. So GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can also be the cause. So take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid hot and spicy food. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry for tuberculosis. It is 100% curable disease. Tuberculosis is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is bacteria and spread through droplet infection. Droplets are produced by coughing. So you should wear mask for the first two months to prevent spread of infection. Treatment is for prolonged duration (6 months). This long treatment is needed to prevent relapse. So don't stop treatment in between, complete the full six months of treatment. AKT 4 contains rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. These drugs commonly cause gastritis and vomiting. So better to avoid hot and spicy food when you are taking AKT 4. Take antacid to prevent drug induced gastritis. Take high protein diet like pulses, vegetables and fruits. This will improve immunity and give quicker improvement. Don't worry, you will be alright.

Is this normal for Costochondritis?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. No, this is not related to costochondritis. Costochondritis can cause chest pain. It can not cause leg pain. Your daughter is mostly having sciatica (pain of sciatic nerve). Sciatic nerve is originating from lower back and runs downwards in the leg. Lower spinal compression can cause sciatica. So in your daughter's case possibility of sciatica is more because her pain is starting from back and going lower down in the leg. So better to consult orthopedic doctor and get done clinical examination, x ray of lumber spine and MRI of spine if needed. So better to first diagnose and then start appropriate treatment.

There are three grades of valve leakage  mild, moderate and severe valvular leakages. The modality of treatment depends on the grade of regurgitation,  however diagnosis of cancer has nothing to do with leakage of valves.

I can understand your concern. Possibility of pneumonia is more in your case. Normally on chest x ray, bronchi and vessels are not seen. But when bronchi are inflamed, their wall become edematous. Blood vessels supplying these inflamed bronchi carry more blood, so they are also visible on chest x ray. When both these (bronchi and blood vessels) are prominent on chest x ray, they are termed as prominent bronchovascular markings. And infection is the most likely cause for this. So you will need antibiotic, mucolytic and expectorant drugs. Get done repeat chest x ray after 7 days of treatment to see for improvement. Hope I have solved your query.

Shallow breathing, chest heaviness etc are commonly seen in allergic asthma and bronchitis.

He underwent PPD, sputum tests & xrays but all gave a negative result for TB, but positive of pneumonia. He was given higher dose of antibiotics but still the fever recurs, until his physician decided to let him undergo CT scan. It was detected that he had so many lymph nodes in his lungs & his doctor said it is indeed TB.A day after he started taking TB medication (myrinP), together with his injectabe antibiotics. And in 24 hrs, his fever gradually lowered. Im still mulling on this because i can't believe that TB is still possible even when he already had a negative result on xray, sputum & PPD tests.

I can understand your concern. Tuberculosis can affect mediastinal lymphnode. So possibility of tuberculosis is there in his case. His fever is also subsided with starting of anti tubercular drugs.
