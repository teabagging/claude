Are you symptomatic that means do you have any jaundice, itchiness over your body, increased tiredness, any blood vomiting or blood in stools, bruises over your body or dark urine? What are your main symptoms?Sometimes, bilirubin level can be slightly high due to enzyme deficiency in our body which controls our bilirubin and nothing can be done in this case. It is called Gilbert syndrome. As far as your treatment is concerned which you received from a doctor, it indicates that you received a multivitamin injection, a steroid and anti acid injection and there was no need for these things.One thing I would like to ask from you is, how is your mood? Is it high or low? Get your liver function tests done,  full liver function tests (S. Bilirubin / total and direct, SGOT / SGPT, S. AlkPo4, S.

Jaundice is usually a sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value. Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage. Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is a present surgery is typically required, otherwise, management is medical. Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping the medication that could be contributing. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I also notice bloating and extreme tightness in my legs and feet. In December 2006 I gave birth to my second child without any complications. However 2 weeks after giving birth, I began to have pain in what feels like the same area, but the difference was that the symptom along with the pain was difficulty breathing. My doctor saw me in her office and sent me to have an ultrasound. Per my doctors request, the ultrasound technician contacted my Dr. before I left and said she saw what could possibly be a blood clot. Since I had recently given birth, I was sent straight to the hospital. After numerous tests I was admitted and surgery was schedule to remove my gall bladder as they said it was diseased / dead and not functioning. Knowing my history of no longer having a gall bladder but having this constant dull and off and on heavy pain, what do you think this could be? Thank you, Michelle","Doctor":"Hi, This looks to me like so-called postcholecystectomy syndrome which has all these symptoms and this occurs in about 10 percent of patients who undergo cholecystectomy, usually can be transient, and rarely persistent or lifelong. Symptoms include systemic symptoms such as sweating and heat sense but also dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting, flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea, Persistent pain in the upper right abdomen. Some individuals may benefit from diet modification, such as a reduced-fat diet, following cholecystectomy since it may be more difficult for the digestion of fatty foods. Postcholecystectomy syndrome treatment depends on the identified violations that led to it. Typically, the patient is recommended dietary restriction table with fatty foods, enzyme preparations, antispasmodics, sometimes  oral ursodeoxycholic acid can alleviate the condition.

Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used. Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones. When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence.

Jaundice is usually a sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value. Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage. Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is a present surgery is typically required, otherwise, management is medical.

It was the most horrific sight, an hour and a half earlier he looked like my dad and after he died there was so much blood, he was so swollen and further bruised from the doctors valiant efforts to save him but is a sight I will never forget. I m writing you because I m scared about my own well being. I was anorexic/ eating disorder not specified/ anorexic with purging (self induced, lax, diuretic - all of it) for almost 20 year. The only negative physical ramification was a slightly elevated ast when on certain meds. I have stopped almost all medication and maintain a weight of 117 at 5 5 (take adderall 10 Mg 2-3x day, clonipan mg 1-2 time a day and occasionally 10 mg hydroxozine to sleep). On Jan 27 had my physical which I had put off and my ast was 225, alt 110, ferritin over 400 but everything else normal and no physical findings. I will drink a few glasses of wine a week, sometimes more sometimes less, and before those test had my period and took 4 Advil 4 times over two days. A week later (no alcohol, no otc) ast was to 70, alt 60....four weeks later my doctor retested again (I had wine during those four weeks, basically so many events for my dad s memory I wasn t paying attention to my own health) and on 2/16 ast was up to 125, alt stayed the same. Told my doctor about alcohol and cold medicine taken in the weeks leading up to the test. Neg for all hepatitis, hemochromatosis, all other blood levels still normal. She ran a ggt and it was 225! I was terrified- and I think she thinks I m lying bout alcohol intake. Nutrition hasn t been great but trying. I m getting an ultra sound Wednesday and see her again march 17 to retest all levels. Am I going to die like my dad? I m only 43. I am not an alcoholic but did enjoy wine, I am trying to eat better and drinking lots of warm water and lemon. I know you can t tell me for sure but I needed to reach out given the entire story. Many thanks","Doctor":"Hi, GTT is found in many parts of body, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, intestine, spleen, heart, brain etc. So GGT alone is nonspecific Increased GGT levels can be seen in many conditions--many liver diseases, Pancreatitis, many cancers, Alcoholism, heart diseases. GGT levels may be increased due to medications also. Smoking may also cause elevated GGT levels. so, if you have no other investigation suggestive of any diseases, no need to worry. Do not run after a single investigation which is non-specific. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr Ivan R.

In your case some may be more possible but in every case it  requires evaluation of the cause. Most common causes of such liver derangement's are Alcohol, Viral hepatitis, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, Drugs. Gamma GT is most commonly raised due to alcohol intake and in case you take alcohol, you need to keep control over it. If you don't take it, you need following tests: hepatitis virus markers, Ultrasound Abdomen and HIDA scan. A lot many times, the liver dysfunction is due to non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). So, if you have any evidence of fatty liver in Ultrasound and your other tests are negative, this rise is liver enzyme would be attributed to NAFLD.

Jaundice is usually a sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value. Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.

If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing you can do. Talk to your doctor about how to get help. If you don't stop you could get complications like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can help to avoid drinking. If you are overweight or obese, do what you can to gradually lose weight -- no more than 1 or 2 pounds a week. Eat a balanced and healthy diet and get regular exercise.

In case of serious liver disease, these values are around 1000. The reason for your results can be a fatty liver which is present for sure if you are overweight. Please note that untreated fatty liver (which is a reversible condition) can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver insufficiency. To reverse fatty liver process, you need to change your diet and lifestyle. Fatty foods, spicy foods, fired foods, painkillers should be avoided. Otherwise, this process will slow going forward.

He should do an MRI scan or liver biopsy to find what type of lesion it is.  Less common this may be malignant issues such as hepatocellular carcinoma. His abdominal pain may not be related to liver spots at all. It may always be a sign of some other issues such as IBD or gastritis.

Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used. Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones. When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence. In some cases, the stone dissolves or becomes dislodged and thereby resumes its \\"silence.\\" Because the problem may solve itself without intervention, many doctors take a wait-and-see approach following the initial episode.

If you don't stop you could get complications like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can help to avoid drinking. If you are overweight or obese, do what you can to gradually lose weight -- no more than 1 or 2 pounds a week. Eat a balanced and healthy diet and get regular exercise. Limit high-carb foods such as bread, grits, rice, potatoes, and corn. And cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice. This should lead to improvement.

Thou his sgot and gamma gt are in control is alkaline phosphate is elevated and stands at 480. Also his platelets are always low. How to cure and will his jaundice come down?","Doctor":"Hello, Cirrhosis results from damage to liver cells from toxins and inflammation. Damage and dead liver cells are replaced by fibrous tissue, which leads to fibrosis (scarring). The fibrous tissue decreased blood flow and it can back up the spleen causing it to enlarge and sequester blood cells. Most often, the platelet count falls because of splenic sequestration. ALP and Platelets test result with your husband shows that his liver is functioning not well. Cirrhosis of the liver is irreversible but the treatment of the underlying live disease may slow or stop the progression. Such treatment depends upon the underlying etiology (cause). Termination of alcohol intake will stop the progression in alcoholic cirrhosis and for this reason, it is important to make the diagnosis early in a chronic alcohol abuser. So his platelets low it may come back better if he stops drinking alcohol on time. There are many complications from live cirrhosis and it can lead to life-threatening.

I have hemochromatosis and am concerned about live damage from the statin. I have managed my hemochromatosis well for the past 5 years. Are my numbers too high to bring my cholesterol down naturally or are my risks for stroke/heart attack too high that I need a statin?","Doctor":"Hello, How old are you? What is your gender? Cholesterol levels are different by age, weight and gender. Healthy levels of cholesterol don't vary much for typical adults. Variation of recommendation levels tends to change due to other health condition and consideration. For LDL cholesterol levels should be less than 100 mg/dL, levels of 100 to 129 mg/dL is acceptable for people with no health issues but maybe more concern for those with heart disease or heart disease risk factors. Levels of 130 to 159 mg/dL is borderline high and 160 to 189 mg/dL is high. A reading of 190 mg/dL or higher is considered very high. Generally, the earlier an adult starts living a healthful lifestyle, the better for their cholesterol levels. A sudden change in lifestyle will help eventually, but the older a person is, the less impact they will see in cholesterol levels. High cholesterol at any age puts a person at risk for heart disease, heart attack and strokes. These risk only increase over time, especially for adults who are not taking action to reduce their cholesterol buildup. Your cholesterol levels high so it is an indication to give you medicine. If you try to change your lifestyle and the cholesterol levels not improve you should use medicine. Occasionally, statin use could cause an increase in the level of enzymes that signal liver inflammation. If the increase is only mild, you can continue to take the drug. Rarely, if the increase is severe, you may need to try a different statin. You should follow up with your home doctor for liver enzyme tests. Hope I have answered your query.

Diet modification are: 1. Get more vitamin D. A damaged liver allows SGPT to seep into the blood. According to a recent study, vitamin D prevents liver damage, which aids in reducing SGPT levels – those with high levels of vitamin D are less vulnerable to liver disease than those with low levels of vitamin D. 2. Eat a nutrient-rich, plant-based diet. Eating organic foods help regulate the liver, allowing it to cleanse itself of toxins and create new cells to stop the leakage of SGPT into the blood. 3. Avoid high fatty foods which may lead to accumulation in the liver leading to decreased function of it. 4. Avoid foods high in salt or sodium.Excessive amounts of salt in the body, especially in the liver, cause swelling and fluid retention. This makes it harder for the liver to filter waste. 5.

In my clinic, I suggest using Arogyavardhini tabs 2 tablets (Chewed)  along with hot water and Triphaladi Kashaya (preferably of AVS, Kottakal) three times a day before food for 15 days in patients similar to your condition. But the medicines will vary as per the conditions prevailing. Since an Ayurveda is the better option to treat conditions like you, I would suggest you meet an Ayurvedic physician in your area at the earliest for further treatment.

It showed my bilirubin was slightly elevated and a positive ANA (they mentioned a slightly high RNP or something like that). A couple of years ago, by CRP levels showed up as elevated.  What could this point to?","Doctor":"Hi, Unfortunately, the information you 've provided is not enough. A positive ANA test may mean nothing. Many autoimmune disorders - even minor or unimportant ones - may cause an elevated ana titer. Whatever is lower than 1:80 is too low. Bilirubin levels may also indicate anything between serious liver disease and the harmless Gilbert's syndrome. C-RP levels may be elevated for far too many reasons to list here but in most cases, it is caused by some sort of inflammation (infectious in origin or not). Therefore, more information is required to get a more clear picture of your current status. Clinically important information includes any symptoms you may have (in detail) and the test reports (a scanned copy).

If you do have jaundice then your urine should be discolored as well. Jaundice causes brandy-like (brownish) urine discoloration. Sometimes the stool may have a pale color resembling clay. A doctor may evaluate the clinical signs and decide whether testing is necessary. If you do get tested,  the most crucial test is serum bilirubin (direct and total). Pain in the back is too broad to draw any conclusions.

But during that monitoring had your son suffered episodes of tachycardia, if not then that monitoring will not help as in cases of arrhythmias heart activity can be absolutely normal in between the episodes of arrhythmias.Ask your doctor for 24 hour heart monitoring repeatedly till it captures episodes of tachycardia.

Internal bleeding from a pulled incion?","Doctor":"Hi, Dark urine may indicate the presence of mucus, pus, or blood. Alternatively, it can be due to sediment that forms when some of the constituents of urine, such as phosphates or urates, form tiny crystals. If you have no symptoms, then the cloudiness may be due to the presence of normal vaginal mucus. It would be a good idea to report what you’ve noticed to your GP, and to arrange for a sample to be sent to the laboratory for analysis. Any blood, pus, crystals, or infection will be reported. If you have symptoms of thrush such as itching, soreness, irritation, or a thick white discharge, then it would be wise to get treatment from your GP. If your urine test is reported as normal there is no need to worry. Drinking plenty of water will reduce your chances of having problems with urine infections or cystitis in the future.

Cyst on kidneys is also minor and insignificant. If there is pain under right rib cage then it may be gallstone issue.In most cases, treatment of gallstones is considered necessary only if you are having symptoms. Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used. Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones.When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder.Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence. In some cases, the stone dissolves or becomes dislodged and thereby resumes its \\"silence.\\" Because the problem may solve itself without intervention, many doctors take a wait-and-see approach following the initial episode.I hope I have answered you query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Stress, overexertion and going too long without eating can all bring on the symptoms of Gilbert’s syndrome. Fasting, which is when you go without food for a long period of time, may trigger the symptoms associated with Gilbert's syndrome. A healthy meal plan that includes regularly scheduled meals and snacks may help prevent the jaundice. A regular eating plan usually includes three meals plus two to three snacks daily. Eating regularly not only helps control the symptoms associated with Gilbert's syndrome but also helps keep energy levels up and aids in hunger control. Gilbert's syndrome does not lead to liver disease, but eating a healthy and balanced diet can help keep your liver healthy and prevent ill effects. A good diet for a healthy liver includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods from all the food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of protein such as poultry, seafood and tofu, low-fat dairy and healthy fats such as olive oil and avocados. Good food sources of fiber include fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans. Getting more fiber in your diet is not only good for your liver but for your heart and digestive system as well. Men need 30 to 38 grams of fiber a day and women 21 to 25 grams a day. When increasing the fiber in your diet, do so slowly to prevent gas and abdominal pain. Dehydration, which is when your body does not have enough water to carry on its normal functions, may also trigger Gilbert's syndrome. Drink plenty of liquids. Hope I have answered your query.

My stomach is real bloated and looks like I am pregnant. My dr. prescribed me lasix. Tomorrow I have to do some blood work to check my ammonia level. What would cause the ammonia? He did not explain some things that I have questions about","Doctor":"Hello,Ammonia is the end product of the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds, is neurotoxic at elevated concentrations. Normally liver clears almost all of the ammonia by converting it into glutamine and urea preventing entry into the systemic circulation. In advance liver disease or cirrhosis, the level of blood ammonia increases due to impaired liver function and shunting of blood around the liver. In addition, muscle wasting may increase ammonia level since muscle is also an important site for ammonia removal.So, when the liver is damaged, excess of ammonia can build up in the bloodstream and affect the function of the nervous system resulting in hepatic encephalopathy. So, excess of ammonia enters into systemic (blood) circulation causing The excess level of ammonia can be reduced by giving laxative (Lactulose) to prevent bacteria in the intestines from creating ammonia and by certain antibiotics such as Neomycin or Rifaximin which kill the bacteria which produce ammonia in the gut.Hope I have answered your query.

I have Narcolepsy w/ Cataplexy, so I do have to take lots of medications, therefore my Doctor has me do bloodwork every three months. But, then I started having increased pain in my abdomen, vomiting bile, upset stomach, and severe burning! After many tests - they found that I have gall bladder polyps / not stones! And my liver is swollen and is probably the reason for all the pain (right side, under my breast area, sometimes radiating to my back, under my shoulder blade.) I have been taking atenolol for years now...for mitral valve prolapse with regurg,(but I ve cut back on it this week, since I ran out...can that affect nothing significantly?) I had stopped taking Diazide for a while -- because I kept becoming too dehydrated / and passed out! But I have that under control now -- drinking tons of water! And I also take AdderAl for Narcolepsy. I take Synthroid for hypothyroidism. I recently started taking proton is for the stomach pain and acid, as well as Carafate for the burning (just took my last one)! I had an upper gi -- they found H-Pylori, I took all the strong medications to treat it & completed the course! I it helped for about 2-3 days, and as soon as I had something acidic to drink, the pin started all over again! I also have ulcers, which have been bleeding from time to time (throwing up blood & in bowel movements). My urine and bowel movements are very yellow...I guess from all the bike! For about three months I was throwing up bile every day...and about 2-3 weeks of non stop vomiting...no matter what I ate or drank!

Her INR score was at 1.2 up to 1.5 and now 1.4. Her Creatinine is at .53, BUN 19.

Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia does not require medication, however, you mentioned that you have foot pain; if you have swollen painful red joints then it is most likely gout.On the other hand, if it is diffuse nonspecific foot pain, it is not due to gout.If there is a painful red swollen joint, joint fluid aspiration and examination must be done to identify th cause.If you do have gout, then you need to be treated with prescription drugs like Allopurinol or Febuxostat.You may also take Ibuprofen orally along with an antiulcerant like omeprazole.However, you need to talk to your healthcare providers for a prescription.In addition to all that, you need to lose weight.Reduction in weight in an obese individual can significantly reduce blood uric acid levels.It also increases insulin sentivity hence that will help with your family history of diabetes mellitus.I hope this helps.Thank you for visiting healthcare magic."},{"Patient":"I had my gall bladder removed 12 days ago.

I understand your concern.Liver enzymes may be  raised because of various causes. In your case some may be more possible but in every case it  requires evaluation of the cause. Most common causes of such liver derangement's are Alcohol, Viral hepatitis, Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, Drugs.Gamma GT is most commonly raised due to alcohol intake and in case you take alcohol, you need to keep a control over it.If you don't take it, you need following tests: hepatitis virus markers, Ultrasound Abdomen and HIDA scan. A lot many times, the liver dysfunction is due to Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). So, if you have any evidence of fatty liver in Ultrasound and your other tests are negative, this rise is liver enzyme would be attributed to NAFLD.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I canWell, jaundice is just a sign and not diseases, and treatment depends on exact cause.Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I canWell, jaundice is just a sign and not diseases, and treatment depends on exact cause.Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause.

I am a 44 year old woman and take statins for cholesterol (purely preventative measure). My father (who was a GP) died at 61 years old with a sudden stroke and my GP said my cholesterol was at the high side of normal and that statins would be a good measure. I do not have blood pressure. Is this crease a definite indicator of heart disease? Many thanks. RJ","Doctor":"Hello, I would explain that there are many studies which indicate that ear crease is an independent cardio-vascular risk factor. Anyway, dyslipidemia, family history are other independent risk factors. For this reason, I would agree with your doctor on the description of statins for dyslipidemia. It is also recommendable to closely monitor your blood pressure values and follow a healthy lifestyle (regular physical activity, avoid smoking and alcohol and follow the Mediterranean diet).

First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure.Then ,Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that dose not help, medications are a must .That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities .Some drugs that are perfect for patients are not necessary good for others.Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started.I suggest my patients the following : take lisinopril once in the moring , add another drug at night according to their age gender and risk factorsThe information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other comorbidities like diabetes, hyperlipidemia etc.*Conclusion: I suggest you stick to a low salt diet and consult  your physician about your grandma's  medication.   If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used. Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones.When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder.Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence. In some cases, the stone dissolves or becomes dislodged and thereby resumes its \\"silence.\\" Because the problem may solve itself without intervention, many doctors take a wait-and-see approach following the initial episode.I hope I have answered you query.

Also, I don t think he can see anything with the scope that the MRCP didn t see. Are there any other foods I can eat to lower the levels further while I wait to see the specialist? I can t exercise as I have too little energy. I have constant nausea and itching and am tired all day.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.It seems like you have fatty liver and there are two main types of fatty liver disease so treatment depends on this: Alcoholic liver disease and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. You can get alcoholic liver disease from drinking lots of alcohol. It can even show up after a short period of heavy drinking, other causes are obesity and hepatitis B and C.If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing you can do. Talk to your doctor about how to get help. If you don't stop you could get complications like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can help to avoid drinking. If you are overweight or obese, do what you can to gradually lose weight -- no more than 1 or 2 pounds a week.Eat a balanced and healthy diet and get regular exercise. Limit high-carb foods such as bread, grits, rice, potatoes, and corn. And cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice. This should lead to improvement. You should repeat your liver markers in 3-4 weeks.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time."},{"Patient":"Its been about two months since I have had this symptom.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.It looks like gallbladder issue.In most cases, treatment of gallstones is considered necessary only if you are having symptoms. Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used. Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones.When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder.Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence. In some cases, the stone dissolves or becomes dislodged and thereby resumes its \\"silence.\\" Because the problem may solve itself without intervention, many doctors take a wait-and-see approach following the initial episode.I hope I have answered you query.

When can it be eliminated or Is there any chance of converting this Acute HVB to Chronic HVB. My age is 32 years","Doctor":"hi I read your question thoroughly. HBV infection has many outcomes: In majority of patients(approximately 80 to 90 %) human immunity will eradicate the infection. In which case serology tests will only show Anti-HbsAg and Anti HbeAg(IgG). Normaly it takes 5 to 6 month for the immunity of human body to eradicate HbsAg from the blood. so in your case you still need to wait 2 to 3 months to see if your infection gets completely eradicated or not. So, regular follow up with serology tests for HbsAg and Anti-HbeAg is strongly advised. In a minority of patients( approximately 5 to 10 %) it may get converted into chronic infection. In which case there are two possibilities: 1) The infection might develop into a chronic carrier transmissible disease( Anti HbeAg-IgM and HbsAg +ve in blood) in which case there is high replication of virus and it causes damage to the liver, therefore, it has to be considered for further evaluation that is repeating the tests such as Alt( SGPT ) levels and a PCR for HBV DNA and a liver biopsy(in selective cases). Depending on the outcomes of the mentioned tests, treatment can be considered for a duration of 1-year.2) The infection might develop into a chronic carrier non transmissible disease(Anti HbeAg-IgG and HbsAg +ve in blood) in which case there is low replication of virus and it causes minimal or no damage to the liver, however, it should also be followed with regular tests such as ALT(SGPT) levels and viral load(PCR) for HBV DNA.

Later years, when more effective malaria drugs came, I no longer use chloroquine.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I canWell, jaundice is just a sign and not diseases, and treatment depends on exact cause.Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

At the other hand D Dimer test eventhough sensitive, is not a specific test expecially when the level is slightly elevated.It may be rised in other conditions such as recent surgeries, trauma, infection, heart attack, liver diseases or rheumatoid arthritis.So you need to rule out any other of the above mentioned conditions as the cause of high levels of D Dimer.The liver disease may increase the D Dimer level, but ussually in advanced stage. So I don' t think Hepatitis B may be the cause. So I would suggest you the same as your doctor: just to repeat the exam once more, and if it persists in high levels than you should decide for further diagnostic steps with your treating doctor.Hope this may help you. If there is something else you need to know, please feel free to ask.Thank you, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"sir,i am 32,and suffering from heptitis-b (detect on 12/12/2009) and after treatment get negative on april-2010. in hb dna test.with doctor advise i am taking medicine (sebvio-600)since 12/12/2009 till today and doctor advise me that you should stop the medicine after  six month of get negative of HEP-B. pls advise ME WHAT SHOULD I DO.","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for using HCM.The apropriate time of cessation of hepatitis B treatment with nucleos ( t) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( Sebvio - Telbivudine), depend on which type of Hepatitis B are you affected.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Usually liver enlargement may indicate some types of hepatitis or fatty liver diseases and in most cases it doesnt require any specific treatment.  If this is caused by diet, obesity and diabetes then dietary and lifestyle changes will be beneficial in every case. Alcohol and viral hepatitis are most common causes and in this case medical evaluation is required. Also if there is infectious disease or biliary duct disorders then you need to do some tests to rule out more serious issues which require specific medical treatment. You need to check your viral markers and do liver biopsy if necessary.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards.

Second most common causes include autoimmune diseases such as hrombocytopenia. If this is ruled out by specific tests then some other causes may be considered and some are more or less serious such as Leukemia Lymphoma, or someInflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

I went in to see my PCP a couple of days ago because I have been having pain on my lower right side (ovary area), She sent me for a CT Scan of my apendix and ovaries and turns out that I have an Ovarian cyst on my right ovary (I do get these sometimes, right before starting my menstration). While looking at that region, it was discovered on the CT that the liver is enlarged and is heterogeneous in appearance.

Ovarian cysts are common and may be single, multiple or may occur as a part of polycystic ovarian syndrome.At this point there is no need to be worried but further steps are required to ruled out malignancy completely. It means that CT scan or diagnostic laparoscopy should be done to evaluate it more accurately.Generally, cysts should be managed surgically i cysts are larger than 5cm, bleeding cysts, torsioned or ruptured and it means that cysts became complicated and may cause specific pain.Also, if there is polycystic syndrome as underlying cause then hormonal therapy is indicated. Pain is usually placed deep in pelvis on affected side and may be associated with nausea and fever.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I canWell, jaundice is just a sign and not diseases, and treatment depends on exact cause.Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

I got severely nauseous and had pain in my upper right side. The tech told me I was very white. She got me a cool wash cloth and a vomit bucket. Are these the usually reactions to a hida scan?

I have also had a biliary stent put in a few years ago that was supposed to stay in for a few months but came out in a day...In your opinion( I know you dont have all the facts) does this sound like a bad gallbladder?","Doctor":"Hi there,It sounds like your symptoms are definitely related to your gallbladder, given that the HIDA scan recreated your symptoms - which sounds like pain and nausea with gallbladder contraction. Basically, what the HIDA scan does is measure how well your gallbladder empties - although you may not have had stones, it sounds like your gallbladder just doesn't empty well.  I'd find a general surgeon who is willing to take out your gallbladder, and I'd also talk to him about doing an intraoperative cholangiogram, which is a special X-ray that he can do at the time of gallbladder removal which will help evaluate your common bile duct and see why it is dilated.  Sometimes intraoperative cholangiogram can pick up things that other studies don't see. Another study to consider is a special MRI or an MRCP that may be able to help figure out why your common bile duct is dilated.Overall, it sounds like given the symptoms you have had during the HIDA you're warranted for a gallbladder removal.

If those haven't shown any significant problems, then I'd say you likely have irritable bowel syndrome.  The ER is probably one of the worst places you can go, as they aren't going to do much but treat your nausea at the time. The ER doctors are trained to stabilize patients, not to figure out rare disease or make difficult diagnosis.  I'd really recommend you find a gastroenterologist who specializes in irritable bowel syndrome (which is different than irritable bowel disease).

With long term anemia , crohns and the medications I have to take, it has given me abnormal blood levels when they take cbc and various blood tests. For this reason they are going to monitor the spleen and the levels before deciding if they need to remove it, if it may be cancerous, or fairly harmless. All the tests on my liver were good and they have ruled out my liver causing my spleen to enlarge. I have heard removal of the spleen leads to a higher chance of infection and a tougher time to fight bacteria, infection etc. What type of medications are used for people who have their spleen removed and will removing my spleen, put my body in a very compromising position since Im taking medications like Humira, Immuran, predisone and my immune system is pretty much shut off? I know I dont need to worry about the worse case scenario yet, Im just concerned if they remove my spleen I will either spend a lot more time in and out of the hospital or I will have to isolate myself even more due to increase risk of infection . Im curious about the quality of life a person with severe crohns disease taking immune lowering medications and has their spleen removed?","Doctor":"Hi there,First of all, let me assure you that many patients have their spleen removed, even in the setting of being immunocompromised and don't offer any ill effects. You are correct in that you have a greater risk of post splenectomy sepsis, but typically in elective splenectomy (planned removal of the spleen) we give 3 vaccines that offset this risk - Hemophaulis influenza, Streptoccoccus pneumonia, and Neisseria.  I believe that you have to have these vaccines repeated every 5 years, and that should cover you for the organisms that could cause infection without a spleen.  You shouldn't have to isolate yourself or take any special precautions after your spleen is removed, as long as you keep up with your vaccines.  Your quality of life should be unchanged, and most surgeons in the US will do these procedure laparoscopically, meaning it should be done with small incisions.I hope I have answered your questions.

About how much time does she have.","Doctor":"Hi there,This is difficult to say and impossible to predict without further information.  A tool that is used to predict mortality is called the MELD score, and you can easily google this.  It's not a perfect tool, but will give you some idea of what her mortality risk is over the next 90 days. The higher the number, the worse her prognosis is.  The numbers you will need is some laboratory values such as creatnine, her albumin, her bilirubin levels, as well as the presence of ascites (fluid in her belly) and encphalaopathy (mental status changes). Some newer calculations that are more accurate include her sodium levels.  Again, I'd really recommend you search for the MELD calculator online, and use the lab values you have from her last set of blood tests, and this will give you an idea of what her life expectancy is.

The extra hepatic common duct measures 3 mm in diameter (prior was 5 mm). The right kidney measures 10.1 cm (prior: 10.1 cm). Impression was hepatic steatosis.","Doctor":"Hi there,I often get referrals for ultrasound findings seen in relation to liver and gallbladder issues.  The diffuse increase in echo texture means that you have a bit of a fatty liver, which in itself can be normal due to aging. This can lead to NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatoses), which is a fancy way of saying you have fat that is damaging your liver.  This isn't necessarily reversible, but you can limit the amount of damage that is done to your liver by limiting your alcohol intake, and staying away from fatty foods.  Your hepatic ducts are within normal size, and the range can be anywhere from 2mm to 7mm, depending on your age and liver function. I wouldn't worry about this.  Your right kidney seems fine and again, no cause for concern.  Overall, you have hepatic steatosis which means fatty liver. Stay away from fatty foods, alcohol, and limit your tylenol intake to no more than 2 grams per day (and only if you absolutely need it).   I'd also recommend you get a repeat liver ultrasound in 6 months to a year, as well as have your liver enzymes checked. I hope I have answered your questions.

That's great news.  Your weight gain is probably something you did not want, so the best thing here is to evaluate your eating habits and adjust your diet.  It is safe for you to take phentermine, however, I'm not a big fan of using phentermine for weight loss.  I don't mean to preach to you, but the effects of phentermine may help you to lose a few pounds, but adjusting your lifestyle and eating habits will have positive effects on your health that will last a lifetime.  I'd recommend at least 30 minutes of exercise each day if you can, as opposed to taking phentermine.But to answer your question, yes it's safe to resume all of your home medications at this point as related to your gallbladder surgery.

I was very ill when I was diagnosed so I m wondering if the multiple infections I had at the time caused a false positive or if daily use of cannabis (mostly in food) has cured me.","Doctor":"Hi there,There are a lot of things that can cause your liver enzymes to elevated. As a general surgeon, I often see patients with elevated liver enzymes, and am asked to evaluate them.  NASH is a chronic process, and usually your liver enzymes won't be elevated until there is a significant amount of damage done.  This means that just because your liver enzymes are normal doesn't mean NASH has resolved. What NASH basically means is that you have a fatty liver, and the fat can damage the liver over time.  In terms of your liver enzymes being elevated, you are correct in saying that it was likely due to your illness.  Any illness can cause your liver enzymes to be elevated, and this will usually resolve over time. Drugs like acetominophen (tylenol) and alcohol can cause your liver enzymes to be acutely elevated.  I think the marijauna, while a better pain reliever than prescription pain meds, didn't cure your liver.  Time and stopping the pain meds helped your liver enzymes go back to normal.With patients who have NASH, I recommend a low fat diet, minimal alcohol use (really try to limit it to 2 drinks a week, and cut it out totally if you can), and avoid tylenol use (try to limit to 2grams per day, and only if you absolutely need it). Marijuana won't harm your liver acutely, but we still don't know the long term effects of marijuana on the liver, lungs, and the brain.  I hope this answers your question.

I have taken the treatment of ayurvedic medicines in year 2002. But at that time i came to know that these ayurvedic medicines can easily be available at some ayurvedic stores so i take them from the stores and continue to take them for upto year 2004. During that period i did'nt feel anything wrong. But in year 2005 i have suffered from jaundice. After recovering from the jaundice in year 2006 i go to a ayurvedic doctor for the treatment of premature ejaculation. At that time he gave me some ayurvedic medicines but on taking those medicines i suffered from the excessively lack of memory and brain fog. I told these symptoms to the doctor but he surpisingly said it rare how it happens in my case as those medicines does'nt have any side effects. So i decided to go to seek another better doctor. the problem persists again with that doctor too. At that moment of time i can't understand why this happen to me. I can't understand. After some time in the june 2007 i suffered from very bad health condition. Doctors does'nt know the exact problem. I suffered from excessive body heat causing me insomnia, lack of concentration and memory, headaches like burst out the veins of brain with jaundice like symptoms. I got inflammation in liver area too. I that time some local doctor said that i suffered from khushki like symptoms. He treated me with DNS and give some sleeping pills. After that my conditions remains like that upto now it passed 4 years but my condition still remains same. I feel extremely tired, lack of energy, lack of concentration and memory with a little jaundice like symptoms. My LFT reports said the same. bilrubin 1.4, Sgot - 58, sgpt - 69. The liver area under right ribcage have bulging which seems like liver inflames due to excessive heat caused by taking those ayurvedic medicines. I consulted lots of doctors, took lots of medicines for last 4 years but all in vain. After 4 years when i searched a lot on internet about my health i came to know that the ayurvedic medicines i take in past are stimulating herbs and that causes all these problems. Is there any treatment for this. Can i become healthly again. help me i am in deep trouble.  My life become living hell. Some times even i think for suicide. what can i do please help","Doctor":"Hi there,First of all, I'd like to reassure you that your liver enzymes are only slightly elevated, and this doesn't mean that you have liver failure or your liver is in any immediately danger. I think some of the medications you've taken in the past are probably contributing to your elevated liver numbers, but I think they can go back to normal with the proper care.  The first thing I would do is stop all your ayurvedic medications, which I think you have done.  Time is the treatment here, and your liver will heal itself with time. I also would stay away from alcohol, fatty foods, and stay well hydrated with plenty of fruits and vegetables. I'd also limit red meat if possible.  I wouldn't lose hope here. I see plenty of people with liver problems, and many times the liver can heal itself by clean living.  I don't think you're in any big trouble here. I'd just stay away from the medications, eat and live clean, and take care of yourself with diet and exercise. I really do think you'll get better with this advice. I hope this answers your questions.

I will say that your heart rate is too high, and you should likely be put on a beta blocker, especially if you have a history of high blood pressure and any history or risk factors for coronary artery disease. Gallbladder polyps are recommended to be removed at 6mm or more, and yours is 5.5mm, so I'd recommend seeing a general surgeon for removal of the gallbladder polyp in order to remove the gallbladder (this is the only treatment for polyps in the gallbladder).

When everything starting going downhill a few weeks back I took 6 Extra Strength Tylenol PM and drank an entire bottle of Champagne (it was all that was in the house) 4 or 5 days later I did the same thing but took closer to 10 Extra Strength Tylenol PM. I was in so much pain I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up. Anyways, I'm an extremely healthy individual. I am 5ft 7in and 135lbs. I had some blood work done before all this happened and my liver was extremely healthy. I only drink socially (3 beers max) 2 or 3 times a month. Both times I took the pills and champagne I experienced extreme fatigue, difficulty talking and standing up. The fatigue and slurred speech lasted into the next day; I only had difficulty standing the night I took the pills. Aside from having slightly more sensitivity to cold, I'm currently feeling strong, I run frequently, eat a normal diet; I'm more or less feeling myself again. I'm wondering if I should get some more lab work done to see if I've seriously harmed my liver. What would you say is the likelihood that I damaged my liver, and do you think it will recover from this? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi there,There is a chance you've damaged your liver, but seeing that you're feeling better, it's unlikely that you've caused any acute liver failure, in which case you'd still be feeling sick and not feeling better. Long term damage is called cirrhosis, and you may have caused some cirrhotic changes to your liver.  You could have put yourself into acute liver failure - which could have cost you your life. It seems like this did not happen, and you're fortunate.  I'd have your liver enzymes checked, and get a liver ultrasound to see how health your liver is.  I think overall, you'll likely be ok, but you can get a baseline to see how healthy (or unhealthy) your liver is.   I hope this answers your questions.

The surgeon has prescribed Nimusulide,Oflaxcin and Rantidine after surgery for 4 days. Presently she in not taking any medicines.Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi there,There are two reasons for itching after surgery. The most common reason is a reaction to the pain medications, as opioid based pain medications such as norco, vicodin and percocet can cause itching.  I would recommend, if she's not having pain issues, for her to stop pain medications. The second thing that can cause itching after gallbladder surgery is an injury to the common bile duct, which causes an increase in bilirubin leading to jaundice and can lead to itching. If she cuts the pain medication and is still having pain issues and itching, she should undergo an ultrasound to evaluate her common bile duct.I hope this answers your questions.

I wouldn't be overly worried. I'd make sure you have your liver enzymes checked regularly (every 6 months).

I'd recommend increasing your caloric intake. You probably need to consume at least 2500 calories per day, and this will help you gain weight.

I would first make sure your bladder infection is adequately treated with at least 3 days of oral antibiotics.  In terms of the pain in your legs, there are many different causes.If you don't have any history of ulcers or kidney problems, I'd recommend taking ibuprofen for your leg pain, which will also help with inflammation in your bladder as well.

The easiest way to diagnose this is to get a right upper quadrant ultrasound to look for stones in your gallbladder.

When the liver starts to detoriate, it has difficulty breaking down certain substances and you can get these spider veins and angiomas.  If you're a heavy drinker, you are very much at risk for cirrhosis.  I'd recommend seeking treatment to stop drinking, as stopping cold turkey will be dangerous.

The American College of Surgeons and standard of care in the United States is to remove any gallbladder that has a polyp that is more than 1 cm.  If hers is 2 cm, then she should definitely have her gallbladder removed, as it is possible that this could be cancer.No one can tell what it is until her gallbladder is removed and the pathologist examines it under a microscope.  Usually, once the gallbladder is removed, the pathologist will look at the polyp and the gallbladder under a microscope. It usually takes about 3-5 days to get the results from the pathologist.

I would also recommend incorporating a low sodium diet. The other options for treatment are repeated paracentesis - removal of the fluid with a needle, however this is temporary and will likely be need to be repeated as the fluid tends to build up.Another option to decrease the amount of fluid in your abdomen is a TIPS procedure - a trans jugular intrahepatic portal shunt - where a shunt (connection) is made between the portal vein and the hepatic veins. This decompresses the portal system and ultimately causes less buildup of fluid in your liver, but a lot of your blood bypasses your liver and this can cause worsening mental status due to worsening encephalopathy.

Most of my physicians do not seem to pay too much attention and a couple say that my other numbers are fine.

I discovered my high range in 2000, when I had a complete physical, blood work, etc. I am a healthy, a bit overweight (56 year old, 195 lbs @ 5' 8\\" Native American male). I do not drink alcohol, no hepatitis, no gallstones (but haven't been checked and they run in my family, although there have been times I have gotten very sick, nauseated, and vomited after a fatty meal, like greasy steak, (which means I don't do this often) and could not eat for a couple of days.

If your bilirubin continued to go up significantly, from 2 to 4 to 7, then I'd be very worried you'd have some problem with your liver, gallbladder, or pancreas, but with the numbers you are giving her, I wouldn't be worried about that at all. 1.6 is not a significant elevation of bilirubin.

The dr's are not sure what it is. I am concerned and don't know how to direct her from long distance.","Doctor":"Hi there,Unfortunately the most common cause of fluid buildup in the abdomen after liver surgery is ascites, which is fluid in the abdomen that occurs when the liver isn't working very well.  It may be that the liver she has left isn't enough to work well enough to keep that fluid out of her abdomen.  The first thing that the doctors should do is make sure she is on a water pill like furesomide (lasix) and spironolactone (aldactone). These two pills help to make sure that extra water is removed from the body and may help the fluid that is building up in her abdomen. A low salt diet will also help her.She may need continuing paracentesis (removal of the liver from the abdomen).  A procedure called a TIPS procedure (trans jugular intrahepatic portal shunt), where a shunt from the portal vein to the inferior vena cava may help to reduce the amount of ascites your mother has, but there is a  work of causing or worsening encephalopathy.  It sounds like your mother needs to see doctors who have a bit more experience treating liver failure.  I'm a bit surprised if they really don't know what is causing the fluid, as (ascites) fluid in the belly after liver surgery is almost always due to the liver not working very well. I'd recommend making sure she goes to a university hospital that has experience with this.  I hope this answers your question.

Please type your query here...My friend (male 70) has gall bladder cancer and had chemo. The cancer has shrunk but he know has spots on liver and hasn't passed fluid for three days. What could have caused the retention. Thanks for assistance. Alexandra","Doctor":"Hi there,If you mean what causes him not being able to urinate, then this could be due to him being unable to urinate from a few common reasons.  The first is due to dehydration, which can be seen in patients undergoing chemo as they may be nauseated and not stay well hydrated. The second reason may be damage to his kidneys from the chemotherapy, which causes them not to work very well. This is more difficult to say without knowing the exact type of chemo, but gemcitabine is commonly use for gallbladder cancer and can cause nephrotoxicity (damage to the kidneys).The third reason could simply be to something obstructing (blocking) the urethra such as the prostate, which is very common in older men. If he hasn't urinated in three days, he likely needs hydration and a catheter inserted to monitor his urine output. I'd encourage your friend to return to his doctor or the emergency room immediately.I hope this answers your question.

I wouldn't worry too much about a slight increase of liver enzymes. If they are continuing to rise, then that could be more worrisome, but a slight elevation shouldn't cause any reason to panic. I usually start to get more worried when AST/ALT are over 200 and continuing to go up.  I'd have her cut back or take a break from the tylenol for a bit, and see if that helps.I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...Hi...I have a friend who had her gall bladder removed yesterday and she also had atleast 50 gall stones removed.  She said she had white bile in her body and today she has developed little red spots all over her face.  Is this normal or should there be a concern?","Doctor":"Hi there,Sounds like she had a lot of gallstones.  As a general surgeon, I take out hundreds of gallbladders per year, and white bile simply means that the cystic duct (the connection between the gallbladder and the main bile duct) was completely obstructed by the stones.  The medical term is known as a hydrobic gallbladder, and it's not usually significant for anything else than that the gallbladder was completely obstructed.  The number of stones usually doesn't mean much. Some people have a couple of stones, and some people have a lot. With a lot of stones, it simply means she was likely having a lot of pain and it was good that her gallbladder removed.Finally the red spots on her face may be due to an allergic reaction to something - usually either antibiotics (sometimes people have penicillin allergies) or to the pain medications. Again, I wouldn't worry too much about this. She should try some benadryl which she can get over the counter and see if this helps.  I'd recommend she walk as much as she can after surgery, and she should make sure to follow up with the surgeon who took out her gallbladder to make sure that the pathology wasn't anything else to worry about. I think your friend will feel a lot better after she recovers now that her gallbladder that was chock full of stones has been removed.I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"MY AUNT HAS HAD HER CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY FROM HER FROM CPS BECAUSE THEY SAID SHE FAILED A URINE TEST AND COME OUT POSITIVE WITH OPIATES AND ANPHETAMINES. She has the prescriptions and discharge summary with her, but that still did not help. They have continued to give her ua drug tests and most of them have came out negative but there are a couple a test that came out insufficiant for invalid, but not positive. My aunt has just found out that she has hepatitis c, cirrhosis of the liver and constant urinary track infection. I currently have her children and need to know if this can cause her urine to be insufficiant or invalid. Her creatine level was .8  I have gone with her to get her ua's. She is not allowed to take anything with her in there is no sink and the toilet water is blue. Can having these diagnosis or her liver enzymes cause this her urine to be insufficant or invalid? Please help her children want to be home with her so badly especially since their father has past way from stomach cancer 1 month ago.","Doctor":"Hi there,I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like a difficult situation. Let me try to answer your questions one at a time.  First of all, if the urine test was done while she was in the hospital, pain medications such as norco, vicodin, percocet, oxycodone, morphine, dilaudid, fentanyl or other opiate based pain medication will cause her to be positive for opioids.  In terms of the amphetamines, adderall is a common medication that can cause her to be positive. My recommendation would be to get a list of every medication she was given at the hospital and the emergency room - the discharge summary simply lists the medications that she's supposed to take at home and doesn't mention what medications she was given in the hospital.A creatinine level of 0.8 is normal, and her UA won't really make a difference in terms of false positives.  The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis won't make her urine results invalid, especially with a normal creatnine.  Your best bet here is to get a list of every medication she was given during the hospital and have that reviewed by CPS. Remember, the discharge summary doesn't tell what medications were given in the hospital.  I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"I am having liver problem for last one and half month.I had a LFT test it shows SGPT 184 And ALT and SGOT also high. doctor prscribe me mtadoxine 500 mgr. and EVION vitamin capsules.before blood culture I had loose motion amd taken eight nos of ayurvedic pills for stopping the loose motion.can it be reson of SGPT high?","Doctor":"Hi,The combination of loose bowel movements and elevated liver enzymes is usually due to the obstruction of the bile duct.  In this case, bile and pancreatic enzymes which help breakdown food and help fats to digest normally are blocked from being released, which is likely causing your symptoms.  There are some medications such as pancrealipase that may help (Creon), but I'd be more concerned about why this is happening. Gallstones, pancreatitis, or malignancies can cause these symptoms. I'd recommend seeing your doctor and having an ultrasound of your abdomen, which is a good place to start.  I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"I recently had a liver transplant (7 weeks ago); my blood work looks good and I am now somewhat active.  A month ago I developed tingling'pins and needles' in the top of my feet and ankles.  Soon after I developed what looks like freckles on the same areas.  Today they have spread up my legs and onto my chest.  They are very small but many.  I am also developing larger, darker ones, scattered about.  The tingling in the feet and ankles remain but not as painful.  What is going on? Are these indeed freckles or are they something else ie a rash, broken vessels...?","Doctor":"Hi there,The most common cause of the feeling of pins and needles after liver transplant is neuropathy, which can be secondary to your transplant medications. I'm not sure what is causing your freckles. Usually, immunosuppressive medications for your transplant can cause you to be more at risk for skin cancers, but 7 weeks out is a little soon. This sounds more like a rash, and I'd try some benadryl and see if this helps.  I'd make sure that you follow up with your transplant surgeon as soon as you can, and let him know about this.  In general, transplant patients should also see a dermatologist regularly, as they are at very high risk for skin cancers, and should have all their regular cancer screening when scheduled. Your transplant surgeon should be very invested in your success here, so I'm sure he or she will be happy to help you.I hope this answers your question.

The most common cause of fluid buildup in the abdomen in a cirrhotic is ascites, which has several ways of being treated. First of all, I'd recommend a low sodium diet, and this patient should started on some diuretics (water pills) such as lasix (furesomide) and spironolactone (aldactone).  Second, if the abdomen is very tight, and this patient can't eat, they likely need a paracentesis, which is removal of fluid from the abdomen with a needle.  Some cirrhotics will respond to medical management with the medications and diet I mentioned above, but some others need regular paracentesis. It really depends on the degree of cirrhosis, which is difficult to determine with the limited information here.I would really recommend this patient see a hematologist (a liver specialist) as this a is a difficult condition to treat and requires a doctor with experience with it.  I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"My husband recently died from what the doctors are saying is a heart attack.

Could the two incidents be related or one causing the other?","Doctor":"Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I have gone through you question carefully. Any form of stress (physical oremotional) can precipitate heart attacks. They may be related incidents.

Therefore, I am mailing/ attaching  his medical reports, from SGPIMS, Lucknow, India,  for your kind observation & comments. Only after your observations, I will be able to decide the path ahead and further communication with you. Kindly mail me your observations at  YYYY@YYYY . Also pl tell me the tentative cost for treatment in your hospital","Doctor":"Hi there,I'm sorry but this is a very non-specific question. It certainly depends on what the liver disease is.  If the liver disease is hepatitis A, this is self limiting and will resolve on their own. Antiviral medications can be used to treat hepatitis B and C, and newer agents for hepatitis C have proven to have great success.  If the patient has cirrhosis or liver cancer and this is advanced, then the only cure is a liver transplant.  In cases of liver cancer, sometimes the cancer can be removed safely, but this requires someone with expertise in the area.I don't know of any experts in your area, but I'd recommend seeking care a university hospital or one of the affiliates associated with them, as they likely have specialists experienced in these sort of cases.I hope this answers your question.

Sometimes patients will still need antibiotics, and I'd recommend they have continued follow up with an ultrasound of the liver in 2 weeks to see if this has resolved or improved. If she has continued fevers and chills, or unable to tolerate a diet, then I'd be concerned that the abscess hasn't been adequately drained.  An ultrasound of the bile ducts is also helpful, as this may show some kind of problem that caused her to form this abscess. I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"I had a Gamma GT reading of 85 and have slight fatty tissue on my liver (identified in an ultrasound scan). My doctor has told me that if I refrain from alcohol for 6 months I would then be able to drink within my female weekly limit. Is this correct?","Doctor":"Hi there,I'd agree with your doctor. A GGT reading of 85 isn't particularly high and a slightly fatty liver is common, especially if you have a typical western diet.  Having a couple drinks a week probably won't hurt you, but the more important thing is to adjust your diet. I'd really try to limit foods high in cholesterol and salt, and try to incorporate more fruits and vegetables in your diet.  Limiting the amount of red meat will help you as well. I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"My father in law has been in and out of the hospital for the past 6 weeks.  He has CHF; 3 detected heart attacks; diabetes; has had renal failure three times, but the kidneys made a comeback; a diabetic sore on his foot (amputation delayed until stable); and now an infected gall bladder that they just drained.  Is there any hope of recovery?  If not, what is his life expectancy?  He had previous renal failure and heart attack 5 years ago.","Doctor":"Hi there,There's always hope for a recovery. I will say that the fact that he recovered from his renal failure gives him a better chance.  A diabetic sore should be dealt with, but if it's not infected, then I'd agree it should wait until he's stable. As long as the infected gallbladder has been drained, then your father in law should be better.  It sounds like he may be able to recover if all his infectious sources are dealt with. I wouldn't give up hope.  I hope this answers your question.

TIPS for ascites has an excellent success rate, with 90% of patients having a good response and decreasing the amount of paracentesis they have.  The most significant risk is worsening of encephalopathy (altered mental status). This can vary, but usually can occur in up to 20% of patients with cirrhosis. Again, this depends on how advanced her disease is. Another complication is that the stent can become thrombosed (clotted) which would require another procedure. Finally, there are risks such as bleeding and infection, but significant bleeding and infection risks are low, likely under 5%."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with autoimmunate antibody negative cholangiopathy which I understand is a rare disease.  I cannot find out much information. I think it is a problem affecting the bile ducts.  I have been prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid.  Is this similar to primary biliary sclerosis?","Doctor":"Hi there,This is a diagnosis that is a combination of primary biliary sclerosis and autoimmune hepatitis.  The treatment is exactly what you are taking, and if it becomes worse, steroids can be used.  You're right, there isn't a lot of data on this disease, and it's variable as to how many patients end up ultimately need liver transplant. I'd recommend you try to avoid alcohol and fatty foods, and exercise as much as possible, and continue to follow up with the specialist who prescribed you ursodeoxcycholic acid. I hope I have answered your questions. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter who is 9 (Type 1 Diabetic) was recently admitted/discharged diagnosed with a kidney infection.  While ruling out appendicitius, they found evidence of an old legion (maybe from an enjury ? ) on her liver. Her liver emzymes were abnormal.  Yesterday me SIL went to the hospital and got results from a ultrasound.  They found that her spleen was enlarged, she has gallstones, some mention of sphreositosis (SP?) and her uterus is small. Diagnosis consistent with sicle cell anemia.  We do not know if her doctor is even aware of these reports yet.Could you please explain the meaning of the report?","Doctor":"Hi there,I'm sorry your granddaughter is having some health issues. Let me explain each item in the report with the information you've provided me.   Spherocytosis are abnormal types of blood cells that are round instead of the usual disc shape. This can be quite common in patients with sickle cell anemia, as the body pushes out immature red blood cells due to the shortage of normal functioning blood cells. The spleen digests red blood cells that are normal, and in cases of sickle cell or other hematologic disease, can become enlarged due to the fact that it is working harder.  If your granddaughter is very anemic or having low platelets, sometimes a splenectomy (removal of the spleen is warranted). If she's not having any difficulty with anemia or bleeding, then leaving the spleen in is an option. When red blood cells get broken down at an increased rate, this can cause gallstones to form in the gallbladder, which can also cause liver enzymes to be elevated. I don't believe that her kidney infection or type 1 diabetes are related to her sickle cell anemia, but if she's having recurrent abdominal pain (sickle cell crisis) and gallstones, it may not be a bad idea to consider having her gallbladder and spleen removed at the same time.Finally, a small uterus is nothing to be concerned about in a 9 year old. This sounds like an incidental finding.  I hope I have answered your questions. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend began having stomach problems in 2007.  The first time I took him to the emergency room they said it was a virus little did we know that 3 years later and countless visits to the ER would we still be getting the same diagnosis.  He has had an endoscopy, XRays, CAT scans, blood tests all showing nothing yet every few weeks he gets sick to the point that he has to go to the ER for IV and whatever prescriptions they give.  He is now on a diet of pretty much clear liquid stuff because he is afraid of his stomach acting up again, but that doesn't help anyway he will still get sick.  What else could this be?  I've told him to have them look at his gall bladder, but no one (ER nor his PCM) does anything","Doctor":"Hi there,It's possible his symptoms could be due to his gallbladder, especially if he has pain after eating.  Sometimes CT scan doesn't pick up on stones in the gallbladder. I'd recommend he have an ultrasound to look at his gallbladder, which is a quick and non-invasive test.  Other rare causes of abdominal pain and how to diagnose them - median arcuate ligament syndrome - this is when the median arcuate ligament (one of the ligaments that holds the diaphragm in place) compresses the celiac artery and this causes pain after eating due to the lack of blood flow from compression. MRI is the most accurate way to diagnose this.Hiatal hernia is usually seen on endoscopy, but not always. This is when the  lower esophageal sphincter is in the wrong position, and causes food to reflux from the stomach to the esophagus. Usually people will complain of heartburn, but this sometimes can cause pain as well. I'd recommend he start taking an acid reducing medication like prilosec (can be bought over the counter) and see if this helps. A good test to start looking for this is called an upper GI, which is a test where the patient drinks some contrast and a series of X-rays are taken.I would recommend he stop going to the ER and save it for a true emergency. ER doctors are good at dealing with real emergencies, but not very good at dealing with specific problems such as these.  Tt sounds like he's been having these problems for a very long time, and I'd recommend he start by seeing an experience gastroenterologist.I hope I have answered your questions.

Apart from this I have been very ill since the end of September with digestive problems, weight loss, headaches, etc. Should I be worried about cancer?","Doctor":"Hi there,A cavernous hemangioma is not associated with cancer.  The risk is that they can rupture and bleed, but usually that risk isn't elevated unless they are over 5 cm.  A fatty liver infiltration just means you have a small spot on your liver that has some fat.  High bilirubin in itself can mean a number of things, and without the specific numbers, it's difficult to say, but most common cause is gallbladder problems.

Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that dose not help, medications are a must .That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities .Some drugs that are perfect for patients are not necessary good for others.Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started.I suggest my patients the following : low salt in diet and exercise .The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about *Conclusion: I suggest you avoid high heels and check out salt content of every item you eat or drink.

I see a lot of patients with abnormal HIDA scans, and the only ones that are worrisome and would cause problems are the ones with low ejection fraction.  A high ejection fraction means that your gallbladder is working very well, and isn't cause for any concern.  Gallbladder problems are unrelated to breast pain.

I'd recommend you google normal liver ultrasound, or look at videos on you tube, and this can give you a better idea of what a a normal liver ultrasound looks like. If you'd like to send the pictures here, I'm happy to take a look and give my opinion (however this is limited as I won't be able to see the whole ultrasound exam).I hope I have answered your questions.

Sometimes, it takes many weeks or even months to get over a major surgery, but he should start to improve and not decline.  Blood cultures would be the first place to start, as if he has blood cultures that show infection, I'd be very worried that his arterial grafts were infected. If he has negative blood cultures, that is more reassuring.  If his incision is getting better, that's certainly a good sign. I would have a straight forward conversation with the surgeon who did the surgery and ask him why your husband hadn't fully recovered, and what his expectation for his recovery should be.  If he's not eating well and having pain, then there are certain things that can be due such as a nasogastric feeding tube, or perhaps even IV nutrition.  If he's having pain issues, then he should refer him to a chronic pain doctor.  And finally, if he's having fevers, I'd ask the surgeon if he has an infection of the grafts, and if he says no, I'd ask him where he thought the fevers were coming from this far out of surgery.In this case, it sounds like you really have to push your surgeon for answers.  No one will know the answers to these questions unless it's the surgeon who did the operation, who should be following him closely.I hope this is helpful.

I have been asked to go back to the doctors tomorrow to be examined as I have a suspected swollen liver. Pain in upper right abdommen and fullness on right side / shoulder/ Could this have happened from the accident and what will the teamment be?","Doctor":"Hi there,Usually after rib fractures and an accident, the liver can be damaged and bleeding - this is known as a liver laceration. Depending on the trauma, this can range from mild to severe. In severe cases, the bleeding areas need to be(embolized) or removed via surgery. However, the fact that you're at home and going to the doctor means that your case likely isn't severe. If you were bleeding enough to require surgery, you'd likely be so sick that you'd be passed out before you could write this question. You could have a mild liver laceration, in which the treatment is just waiting as the body will heal this on its own.  The treatment for you will likely be avoiding contact sports or collisions, and just waiting. Also avoiding any medications that can make you more likely to bleed such as ibuprofen will also be recommended to you. I hope this is helpful.

This means there isn't evidence of hepatitis B in your blood.HEP B IMMUNE STATUS 1000.00.

Can a nissen fundoplication from four years ago, similar to a gastric by-pass, interfere and increase these levels?  I was recently stopped and tested over 1.0 BAC and had three beers over two hours and am dumbfounded as to how this was so high.  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi - Gilberts syndrome is a laboratory finding and causes absolutely no symptoms at all. A nissan fundoplication is a wrap of the stomach that basically is the surgical treatment for acid reflux.  Sorry, but none of these operations or conditions interfere with metabolism. The more likely reason is that his testing device is off. I'd ask to see the officer's calibration records.  Its likely that his device was not calibrated correctly.  An alcohol level over 1.0 BAC would be one of the highest blood alcohol concentrations ever recorded.  A 0.08 is over the legal limit, and a 0.50 is often fatal in most people.  Are you sure your level wasn't 0.10? That would make more sense and that would correlate with about 3 beers. I hope this is helpful. Feel free to contact me with any further questions."},{"Patient":"I am a 48 year old Male 2 years removed from an open appendectomy and subsequent pyogenic liver abscess. My surgical incision for the appendectomy healed by second intent and my issues with the Liver abscess were resolved through drainage and long term administration of antibiotics.  My only other surgery was a vasectomy approximately 10 years ago in which my only subsequent complication was a sperm granuloma that developed and resolved over a few weeks.  Now to the present.  Since my abdominal surgery I have developed numbness in my outer left thigh which occassionally cause a tingling / prickling sensation.  I have also developed some sexual issues including difficulty getting and maintaining an erection a reduction in the volume and intensity of ejaculation, and many times, I will have a pain in my lower abdomen at the moment of ejaculation.  I have noticed a decrease in sensation in my penis such that I have difficulty obtaining an erection even through masturbation.  I have explored these issues with my family physician, but it is difficult to know where to head with it based upon whether I am dealing with separate issues and causes or maybe just one cause.  For example, I thought that maybe the issue was nuerologic due to a compressed nerve, but an MRI failed to reveal any such problem.  I thought my problem may be related to trauma to one of my abdominal nerves during surgery, but my physician seemed to think this was unlikely.  I had tests done for my testosterone levels and prostate and all revealed that I was well within normal limits.  I even treated on antibiotics to see if the condition might be prostatitis but it really had no impact.  I am really not looking to circumvent my own doctor, but rather searching for ideas on what the best course of action, process of elimination or method of obtaining a differential diagnosis might be.  Can you help?","Doctor":"Hi,I'd agree with your surgeon. It's unlikely your pelvic nerves were affected during the surgery or the liver infection, as the nerves in this area don't travel to the penis.Are you diabetic? This can sometimes have an effect on nerve function, and diabetics can have neuropathy, which causes nerve dysfunction.Another possible cause is this could be a delayed complication of the vasectomy.  If an MRI showed no issues, than it could simply be due to primary erectile dysfunction.Another possibility is Leriche syndrome -in which patients get leg pain, buttock pain, and impotence. This is due blockages in the internal iliac arteries, which give blood supply to the pelvis.  A CT Angiogram would help diagnose this. (MRI would not show any potential blood supply symptoms). This would particularly be a problem if you have a history of high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or any smoking. I hope these other ideas are helpful.

First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure.Then ,Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that dose not help, medications are a must .That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities .Some drugs that are perfect for patients are not necessary good for others.Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started.I suggest my patients the following low salt n diet and avoid excessive salty food or caffeinated drinks.The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about  other blood pressure readings and personal data like height and weight and other comorbidities.*Conclusion: I suggest your friend to moderate his diet to a more healthy less salty.   If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones.When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder.Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence.

I also have scoliosis. My spine does curve to the right. Today I have noticed the pain does seem to come around the ribs to the front a little. I can change position and feel some relief at times. Others times no. It is worse when I move alot. My ribs are uneven from the scoliosis. I am concerned it is liver related. Or something else.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I canWell, jaundice is just a sign and not diseases, and treatment depends on exact cause.Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

You can get alcoholic liver disease from drinking lots of alcohol. It can even show up after a short period of heavy drinking, other causes are obesity and hepatitis B and C.If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing you can do. Talk to your doctor about how to get help. If you don't stop you could get complications like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can help to avoid drinking. If you are overweight or obese, do what you can to gradually lose weight -- no more than 1 or 2 pounds a week.Eat a balanced and healthy diet and get regular exercise. Limit high-carb foods such as bread, grits, rice, potatoes, and corn. And cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice. This should lead to improvement.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Well, alcohol is main cause of fatty liver disease, so it should be avoided definitely.There are two main types of fatty liver disease so treatment depends on this: Alcoholic liver disease and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. You can get alcoholic liver disease from drinking lots of alcohol. It can even show up after a short period of heavy drinking, other causes are obesity and hepatitis B and C.If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing you can do. Talk to your doctor about how to get help. If you don't stop you could get complications like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can help to avoid drinking. If you are overweight or obese, do what you can to gradually lose weight -- no more than 1 or 2 pounds a week.Eat a balanced and healthy diet and get regular exercise. Limit high-carb foods such as bread, grits, rice, potatoes, and corn. And cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice. This should lead to improvement. You should repeat your liver markers in 3-4 weeks.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards.

If this is caused by diet, obesity and diabetes then dietary and lifestyle changes will be beneficial in every case. Alcohol and viral hepatitis are most common causes and in this case medical evaluation is required. Also if there is infectious disease or biliary duct disorders then you need to do some tests to rule out more serious issues which require specific medical treatment. You need to check your viral markers and do liver biopsy if necessary.I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards.

Sorry bothering you, but I am concerned about the condition of my partner. He is having a constant headache the last 2 weeks. We went to doctor, who measured his blood pressure along with other checks. My friend's blood pressure stayed constantly around 165/115. He was sent to do Chest X-Ray, blood test, urine test, ECG. Unfortunately it will take 2-3 weeks to get the results. Meanwhile he was prescribed to take Ramipril once a day. There are 5 days passed, and his headache is not disappearing. We are going later to the doctor to check the blood pressure again. I am so concerned that I don't know how long it will take my friend to get rid of this terrible headache.

Some individuals may benefit from diet modification, such as a reduced fat diet, following cholecystectomy since it may be more difficult for digestion of fatty foods.

First, be sure that high blood pressure is not secondary to any other diseases as Cushing or renal failure.Then ,Diet with low salt and less fat content is crucial. Exercise and other healthy activities are also a mean to control blood pressure. If all that dose not help, medications are a must .That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities .Some drugs that are perfect for patients are not necessary good for others.Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started.I suggest my patients the following :regular follow up of blood pressure.The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about exact family history of heart disease and if any hyperlipidemia presents.*Conclusion: I suggest you follow up with a dietitian to help you with weight loss   If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

It is very important to know your antecedent that you have ulcerative colitis because for that reason the cause of your cirrhosis can be a Primary sclerosing cholangitis that is related in approximately 5-10% of the patients with colitis, whose main importance of the early diagnosis of the Hepatic disease is the risk of developing a cholangiocarcinoma.In your case, if you already have irreversible liver damage, it is very important to determine the etiology, and if it is the case of Sclerosing cholangitis as pharmacological measures should be considered the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid. In addition, it is necessary to perform an ERCP in view of the possibility of finding stenosis in the biliary tract and to perform a paliacion of the biliary tract to improve obstructive symptoms.This besides the basic management of your ulcerative colitis and the measures for the attention of your cirrhosis, an adequate nutritional management, diuretic treatment with its renal and electrolytic follow up as well as surveillance endoscopies, so I suggest you go with your Gastroenterologist or hepatologist and you can continue your integral management."},{"Patient":"My mother-in-law who 69 yrs old has cirrhosis of the liver.

So the next step is to look for certain liver damage and most common cause is fatty liver disease. It should be confirmed by ultrasound. Other causes are viral hepatitis,cirrhosis, medications, alcohol intake or autoimmune diseases. To verify exact cause, US, bilirubin levels and tumor markers should be additionaly done.In every case, till you do these tests you should follow next:1. Avoid alcohol, smoking and hepatotoxic medications2. Avoid fatty, fried and high sugar diet3. Regulate your body mass4. Take Silimarin suppplementThese measures should protect your liver from further damage.If reversible cause if found then liver condition may be healed completely.Other causes should be treated regarding the exact pathology.Hope this answers your question.

The main abnormalities that are to be found are alterations in hepatic chemistry, weakness, fatigue, diabetes mellitus, cutaneous hyperpigmentation, arthralgia, impotence, cardiac abnormalities.

ALso, it will show if liver and pancreas function are fine which are also possible causes of deranged SGOT levels.

Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal.  High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, o rblockage of the bile duct. In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing, but Augmentin os not hepatotoxic drug so it should not be the cause.YOu need to do ERCP and CT scan as soon as possible since prolonged jaundice may cause some serious consequances.I hope I have answered you query.

He has been seeing a Cardiologist ever since and a pacemaker/difibrilator was placed to reduce his risk of sudden death. In March his legs started swelling and he was very short of breath and was taken to the ER where he was diagnosed with CHF. He was hospitalized for one day while the fluid was removed and was sent home with strict diet instructions. He s on several medicines to which they ve now added a low dose diuretic. He s done very well sticking with the low sodium diet, exercising, and following all of the lifestyle chances. He has maintained his weight and feels better than he has in a year or more. I m very confused as to his prognosis. When I asked his cardiologist about a prognosis I was told that he has the good kind of heart failure and that the main issue to worry about is sudden death which is why the device was implanted, but when I talk to our family doctor he doesn t seem to think he ll live very long. The ER cardiologist mentioned that he didn t think the HCM was being managed well enough and changed several dosages of his medicines. He also mentioned that there are two surgeries that are options if his condition worsens. One is an alcohol ablation and the other is septal myectomy. My question is two-fold: Realistically does he fall into the dreaded 50% chance of dying in 5 years, or since the heart failure seems to be caused by the HCM can either of these two surgeries turn the heart failure around? What is the good kind of heart failure? I ve never heard of such a thing. I m younger than he is and we have a young child together the stress of constantly worrying about his life expectancy is overwhelming.","Doctor":"Hi, Let's start from the surgery. Your doctor may have explained to you that in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle gets very thickened. Such thickened muscle may produce life threatening arrhythmias, that's why defibrillator was implanted, which is the most efficient way to prolong the life of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Also, in some cases, the thickened muscle obstructs a part of the heart from where blood flows from the heart to the aorta. Two types of surgeries, who mentioned are done in this case. They are meant to reduce the thickness of the muscle in the heart septum, thus, give a chance to blood flow to the aorta. Heart failure in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have two causes 1. the obstruction I have mentioned above 2. when heart thickened heart muscle starts work weak, and heart can't pump enough blood to the body.You can talk to your doctor to find out which one is the case of your husband.In the first case, the surgery may help. In the second case, only medications are indicated.The life expectancy of heart failure patients depends on many factors, one of them is how weak is heart muscle.But usually if you can achieve good results with medications, his 5 year life expectancy may be quite high, especially if he have a defibrillator.

If all that dose not help, medications are a must .That is usually decided by your doctor according to your condition and comorbidities .Some drugs that are perfect for patients are not necessary good for others.Regular blood pressure monitoring is as important as starting treatment so that we could assess efficacy of the medication we started.I suggest my patients the following :avoid excess caffeinated drinks intake, complete other investigations as electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about age and other risk factors, also laboratory results if any done. *Conclusion: I suggest you adhere to a healthy diet and consult your physician if you need to start antihypertensive medication.   If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

Liver surgery is my field of interest and this looks to me like benign cystic disorder of liver with possible effect on pancreas. But additional tests are require in first case to rule out malignancy and biliary stones in common bile duct or in pancreatic duct. If there are no such pathologies then you may considerd laparoscopic management of liver cysts if these are proved to be cause of your symptoms. Usually cysts that are larger than 10cm may require surgical treatment. Your fatigue and stool colour may be related to liver but also may indicate certain colon issues so colonoscopy may be considered.Hope this answers your question.

I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.Yes, this may be gallbladder issue but if only ALP is elevated then I dont think that urgent measures are required. If other liver markers are fine than it may be just small gallbladder stone that passed so only lab follow up in few weeks is required. You can do ultrasound to see if stones are present, but CT scan is not necessary. You need to change your dietary habits first.  Need to avoid fried food, carbonated drinks, coffee, alcohol and spicy food. You should eat more milk products, vegetables and boiled food.

Hamzah Nassir.","Doctor":"Hi i hope you are very well The alteration that you present in your liver chemistry according to ALT levels is a moderate elevation, with a hepatocellular pattern. Your diagnosis may actually be a fatty liver, however, this is a very broad spectrum that includes hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis.You have metabolic risk factors for fatty liver such as your overweight / obesity and dyslipidemia. You should have a checkup for suspected diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension.There are several non-invasive studies to evaluate the degree of fibrosis or even cirrhosis, the one with the highest diagnostic yield is the transient elastography (Fibrotest), however, to differentiate between steatosis and steatosis hepatic biopsy should be performed. The importance of detecting a steatohepatitis is for prognostic purposes, since the progression to cirrhosis is greater.The treatment indicated in these cases is mainly non-pharmacological, the loss of weight is fundamental as well as a modification in the lifestyle, a balanced diet, increase in the physical activity. An approximate loss of 5-10% of weight is suggested in a period of 6 to 12 months, this is associated with an analytical and histological improvement.There are very few drugs that can be useful. One of them is Vitamin E in doses of 400,000 to 800,000 U / day especially in people who do not have diabetes mellitus. Other medications currently being used are statins like simvastatin that you consume, as it has antifibrotic properties."},{"Patient":"I am 37 yrs old, never ever had any health issues at all in my life past the occasional headaches etc. I recently had felt bad for about a week and wen to doctor because my eyes wer turning yellowish color as was my skin . later to find out that it was jaundice due to my alt/glucose to high that cause a high bilirubin in my body as well.

The study of alterations in hepatic chemistry consists of:1. Know the type of enzyme and pattern of elevation, you comment that you only present an increase in ALT levels so we can infer that it is a hepatocellular pattern.2. Assess the severity of elevation of enzymes; In your case it is of a slight level.An image study as an abdominal ultrasound is elementary when it comes to an obstructive process because it speaks of cholestasis; you mention that you have presented isolated episodes of jaundice, however in your image study you did not present any obstructive alteration or biliary tract, considering the high diagnostic yield of abdominal ultrasound in these diagnoses.You should be given laboratory tests such as:1. Viral panel in search of HAV, HBV and HCV infection.2. Search for autoimmune pathologies such as autoimmune hepatitis.3. Inherited or genetic causes where an iron panel is important in the presence of suspected hemochromatosis or ceruloplasmin in case of Wilson's disease.Laboratory studies should be repeated, with special attention to the levels of TGP, TGO, albumin, proteins, globulins, alkaline phosphatase. If a suspected diagnosis is presented, it should be studied in a targeted manner. If it is not enough, a liver biopsy should be performed, which may be useful both to find the etiological diagnosis and to evaluate the degree of liver damage."},{"Patient":"i have had pain under my right rib cage area since January...have had u/sound and as well as xray and MRI.A liver cyst 9mm was found but i was told that this is unlikely to be causing my pain.Also some crystals were found in my g/bladder.Could there some some bone damage in that area or maybe some inflammation.Would the liver and spleen MRI or the MRCP MRI i had have shown this?","Doctor":"Hello, I hope you´re well. According to the symptoms and the findings in the image study that you present may be related to gallbladder lithiasis. The presence of gallstones is common. Incidental gallstones are gallstones that are diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient based on an imaging study that was obtained for an unrelated reason. There are several types of gallstones; they are composed of a mixture of cholesterol, calcium bilirubinate, proteins, and mucin. The most frequent are those of cholesterol in up to 75%, and the diagnostic study of choice is through an abdominal ultrasound.The majority of patients found to have incidental gallstones will remain asymptomatic. Patients who develop symptoms typically report biliary colic. It is rare for a previously asymptomatic patient to present with complications of gallstone disease without first having had episodes of biliary colic. The recommend following for most patients with incidental gallstones expectantly rather than performing prophylactic cholecystectomy. Waiting until a patient becomes symptomatic before performing cholecystectomy prevents unnecessary surgery since the majority of patients with incidental gallstones will never develop biliary colic. However, prophylactic cholecystectomy is indicated for patients who are at increased risk for gallbladder cancer and are good surgical candidates.You should know that the symptomatic gallstones are uncommonly treated with medical therapy alone. The main form of medical therapy is the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid, which may enhance gallstone dissolution and perhaps reduce symptoms in patients with mild symptoms or those who are not candidates for laparoscopic surgery. The dissolution therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid is indicated in patients with mild symptoms who have poorly calcified small stone(s) and are not candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time.I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion.

Treatment is advised if AST and ALT are > ULN and HBV DNA count on PCR is very high. Liver enzymes and HBsAg status and HBV DNA PCR maybe done regularly every 6 to 12 months,As per your current presentation, treatment maybe initiated. Consult hepatologist or gastroenterologist.even if HBV DNA count in PCR are not high, Liver enzymes should be monitored regularly while HepB markers maybe checked every 6 to 12 months.hope to answer your concern.wish you good n sound health.regardsDr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"hi.        what is HCV borderline result of anti HCV test?and how can it be cured. i recently tested for anti HVC test and the result came \\"Border line\\" what is this?and is it cureable?some other information about test is this.. cutoff value 1.00 patient value 2.28 CUTOFF VALUES: non reactive 5.0 PLZ TELL ME WHAT IS THIS AND HOW CAN I BE CURED","Doctor":"hi.thanks for posting query at HCM.the values of both tests suggest that you need further tests to confirm if you have HepC or not.

I thank you for posting your query here and I'm definitely going to help you out.. I being a surgeon, we encounter so many such cases day in and day out.. I read your question completely and have understood it well enough. I will analyze all your points and provide necessary explanation.. 1. You say your report came back negative for stones! Meaning, you had stones?? As far as my experience of 12 years goes, gall bladder stones once they come, they stay.Unlike Renal stones, they do not pass down the tract. So, either.. A. The 1st report is wrong B. You need re scan.. All this is in case you have had earlier scan which said gall bladder stones. 2. Gall bladder shrunken has no clinical significance.. Some Radiologists report this. But as a surgeon, there's nothing to worry for this finding. As long as gall bladder functions, we don't have an issue out of this.. So chill, do not worry.. 3. Polyps of 6 and 5 mm should not bother you again. Generally, in size more than 1 cm or some say 2 cm and associated problems like A. Diabetes, Uncontrolled B. Along with stones which is symptomatic like pain C. Episodes of infection like cholecystitis These need surgery.. If you are fine without fever episodes, jaundice and pain then do not worry.. We can follow up with regular scans, may be once or twice a year.. Hope this helps you, in case you need any further assistance, please let me know.. Take care and God bless."},{"Patient":"Hi. My friend's daughter was just released from ICU. My friend said that the doctor said her liver function was @ 30% only.

Around that time I started take the anti depressants, Lexapro, Trazodone, and Wellbutrin starting three months ago. I've also been taking Aderall since last may. Now I have an abnormal liver. Could any of these medications be the cause of my liver problem? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.Yes, Welbutrin and Trazodone are known to have some minor effect on liver enzymes so this could be cause of elevated liver markers such as SGOT and SGPT. If this is just slight elevation then medications should not be changed but if there is significant values then you should consider switching it to another antidepressants. Also, you should avoid alcohol, and fatty food till liver findings stabilize. All medications changes should be discussed with your doctor. If liver abnormality persist no matter of medication stop then you should look for some other causes such as fatty liver or viral hepatitis. In this cases ultrasound should be done and viral markers as well.Hope this answers your question.

I feel as though my chest hurts and feels very heavy, I sometimes wake up only 1 or 2hrs after i have gone to sleep and then cannot sleep afterwards and find it very hard to sleep afterwards. thanks","Doctor":"There are two problems. there is the sensation of abnormal rhythm and the fact that it disturbs sleep.To catch a rhythm that is not daily, I usually recommend a long term monitor to try and catch the abnormal rhythm and tie it to the symptoms that you feel. For you, this may not be needed.Abnormal sleep and abnormal rhythm often go together. If you are very tired in the morning, sleep easily during the day and snore loudly, you may have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common cause of abnormal heart rhythm requiring treatment. A sleep study or the simple recording of your heart rate and oxygen saturation over night may answer both questions.Discuss both options with your doctor to see which route will be most efficient."},{"Patient":"my father aged 69 years and 6 months underwent lapcholecystectomy, cbd exploration and stent is placed in may 2009. he was reluctant and delayed ERCP. ten days ago he had vomitings and elevated bilirubin levels and he is admitted in the hosp.

Thank you for your query. Jaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to more complciated- High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, o rblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. In childern, common causes are Gilberts disease or hepatitic viral. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting certain liver issues.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.[Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

The other issue may be sign of postcholecystectomy syndrome syndrome which has all these symptoms and this occurs in about 5 to 40 percent of patients who undergo cholecystectomy, usually can be transient, and rarely persistent or lifelong. Symptoms include Dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting, Flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea, Persistent pain in the upper right abdomen. Some individuals may benefit from diet modification, such as a reduced fat diet, following cholecystectomy since it may be more difficult for digestion of fatty foods.

This risk may be bit higher in case of cholecystitis or cholangitis, but still this is pretty rare. Causes may be related to surgery or may be related to heart and lung function, Some surgical complications such as bleeding may lead to hemorhagic shock and death in early postoeprative period. Other such as infection would lead to longer period between surgery and death. Heart related complications include myocardial infarct which may happen as in any person.

Hepatomegaly is a liver enlargement and there are many causes of liver enlargement and treatment depends on exact cause. Galbladder stone as you say, may be cause of it but rarely.

This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Biliary colic -\\"The pain without cholecystitis- gallbladder infection/inflammation\\" - usually subsides within few hours to a day. Acute cholecystitis secondary to gallstones may be continuous and accompanied with fever.2. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.3. Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time.I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion. You maybe asked to cut fat completely from your diet ( or keep to minimum) after gall bladder surgery.hope to answer your concern.wish you good and sound health.regardsDr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"I am having high SGPT level 109 ? how to lower it?

THC is still controversial as a treatment method for many disorders and there are supporters of this medications but also, many doctors refuse THC as an unefficient and harmful. For this type of disease, autoimmune hepatitis, there is no clinical or scientific evidence that it may be beneficial and cure the disease or act as antiinflammatory substance It may only reduce pain and make you feel more relaxed.

This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Biliary colic -\\"The pain without cholecystitis- gallbladder infection/inflammation\\" - usually subsides within few hours to a day. Acute cholecystitis secondary to gallstones may be continuous and accompanied with fever.2. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying.

Since cutting out dairy and yeast I am alot better but still have flare ups for no apparent reason.  My lower right stomach below tummy button is quite tender and my stools are always a mustard colour and very loose.

If its not that than he says it must be caused by hyperalgesia, but I have not been escalating my dose or having alot of breakthrough chronic pain. I feel like he is not listening to me and that I will lose my pain management. what can I do or say to help my situation? thank you for your time! Jeff","Doctor":"hi.thank you for posting query at HCM.i thoroughly read your query and understood your concerns.Though you did not mention for the removal of gall ladder in your family but most commonly its due to gall stones.Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder.Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is usually experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Biliary colic -\\"The pain without cholecystitis- gallbladder infection/inflammation\\" - usually subsides within few hours to a day. Acute cholecystitis secondary to gallstones may be continuous and accompanied with fever.2. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.3. Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time.I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion. You maybe asked to cut fat completely from your diet ( or keep to minimum) after gall bladder surgery.hope to answer your concern.wish you good and sound health.regardsDr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"Hi I am Jyothi Female 30 Years old From Hyderabad recently undergone gallbladdery surgery i.e on sep 24th 2010.Recently i am facing back ache, pain under the ribs.can u please suggest me what to do?is it major or minor problem.I am worried about my future.","Doctor":"thank you for posting query.post cholecystectomy pain maybe due to stones in common bile duct OR increased fat intake OR functional pain.need further evaluation.advice:- get an ultrasound (abdomen) to rule out any stone remnants in common bile duct- also get a complete blood cell count(CBC) test- avoid OILY food altogether- you may need to take nexium/pantocid 40mg once daily before breakfast  few weeks- avoid eating stomach full and mouth full- avoid spicy food wish you good health.further queries are welcomed.wish you good health.regards,Dr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.[Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

It doesn't increase your overall risk of stroke, though some individual papers in scientific community has mentioned  the same, so you will read it somewhere online, however the authenticity of such publication is questionable. Rather the most large trials including thousands of patients across the globe haven't found so, in contract diction it has recommended reduction in blood pressure less than 120 / 80 to reduce risk of stroke. Lastly as a Cardiologist I would like to say, every human has a different physiology, don't try to fight it out. The blood pressure mentioned is perfectly withen normal limits and gives you best protection against heart issues and even stroke. Keep good hydration.

I understand your concerns..The most common cause of fatty liver is alcoholism and heavy drinking. In many cases, doctors don’t know what causes fatty liver in people who are not alcoholics.Fatty liver develops when the body creates too much fat or cannot metabolize fat fast enough. The excess fat is stored in liver cells where it accumulates to form fatty liver disease. Eating a high-fat diet may not directly result in fatty liver.Besides alcoholism, other common causes of fatty liver include:obesityhyperlipidemia, or high levels of fats in the blooddiabetesgenetic inheritancerapid weight lossYOu need to remove these risk factors and then repeat tests to see if there is improvement.I hope I have answered you queryKindly regards.

I understand your concerns.It depends on the exact cause of liver failure and generally 25% is something man can live with for more years, but if there is cirrhosis or tumor present then the prognosis is very poor and may take from few weeks till few months. Jaundice and ascites are generally bad prognostic factors and I am afraid that you should not be very optimistic but it is har t predict sch things and in everx case you should be with him and give him all necessary support.I hope I have answered you queryKindly regards.

By the way on my own I lost 190 lbs. so I have a lot of extra skin for 58 year old.","Doctor":"hi.thanks for posting queryincomplete informationwhy do you need your gall bladder to be removed alongwith uterus?gall stones are common cause for gall bladder surgeryGallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder.Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is usually experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Biliary colic -\\"The pain without cholecystitis- gallbladder infection/inflammation\\" - usually subsides within few hours to a day. Acute cholecystitis secondary to gallstones may be continuous and accompanied with fever.2. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.3. Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time.I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion. You maybe asked to cut fat completely from your diet ( or keep to minimum) after gall bladder surgery.hope to answer your concern.wish you good and sound health.regardsDr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"hi this is ashwani kumar, yesterday my medical test taken by doc.

This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.2. Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time.I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion. You maybe asked to cut fat completely from your diet ( or keep to minimum) after gall bladder surgery.hope to answer your concern.wish you good and sound health.regardsDr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been exercising for 40 days now, and I drink 1 scoop of WHEY protein shake after my 2 hours training 3 times per week.I did a blood test and I realized that my SGOT went from 18 (previous test a year old) to 102. could it be a lab mistake or you have a logical explanation for this.Thank you.NAB","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.It may be both but also it may be sign of fatty liver or acute liver damage sue to viral hepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis.

Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.[Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.

It  also includes the development of symptoms caused by removal of the gallbladder (eg, gastritis and diarrhea).In general, PCS is a preliminary diagnosis and should be renamed with respect to the disease identified by an adequate workup. It arises from alterations in bile flow due to loss of the reservoir function of the gallbladder. Two types of problems may arise. The first is continuously increased bile flow into the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which may contribute to esophagitis and gastritis. The second is related to the lower GI tract, where diarrhea and colicky lower abdominal pain may resultTreatment should be governed by the specific diagnosis made and may include pharmacologic or surgical approaches.

Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I canJaundice is usually sign of certain liver disease and high bilirubin value.  Causes of jaundice vary from non-serious to potentially fatal. Levels of bilirubin in blood are normally below 1.0 mg/dL (17 µmol/L) and levels over 2-3 mg/dL (34-51 µmol/L) typically results in jaundice High bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, orblockage of the bile duct In the developed world the cause is more often blockage of the bile duct or medications. Blockage of the bile duct may occur due to gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Medical imaging such as ultrasound is useful for detecting bile duct blockage.Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present surgery is typically required, otherwise management is medical.[Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing.
