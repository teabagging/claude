On top of these symptoms every time I get a stuffy nose, I get lightheadedness, dizziness, stomach upset, diarrhea, and headache. I also noticed that when this happens, if I move just my eyes to the left or right, I get this literal pulse of dizziness and I can also feel a buzz in my ears and they feel full. These symptoms come all at the same time and are non-stop for about two to three days and it is during all seasons. A stuffy nose is always an indicator that I am going to get all of the other symptoms. Right now, I am on my second day of this type of episode. I have been to numerous doctors and other specialists, and I have had MRI, CT scans and x-rays, but no one has ever been able to give me a diagnosis or treatment that works. I have tried dozens of medications that either do not work at all or only work for about a month. I am desperate for help at this point. I just cannot take this anymore. It makes it impossible for me to do anything, work, school, travel, and I am even starting to lose weight. Do you have any idea what could be going on and how I can fix it? I am currently on Venlafaxine, Simvastatin, Vyfemla, Flonase Propionate Nasal Spray, and Afrin.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Your nasal symptoms are more suggestive of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The dizzy feeling and associated changes are more suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). There is no direct relation between both symptoms, but an allergic exacerbation may aggravate BPPV. For allergy, the treatment of choice is skin prick test and immunotherapy. Please contact an allergy specialist. That is the only way to cure an allergy, with everything else symptoms may exacerbate on and off. BPPV is a condition that may not show any findings on MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography). Treatment of choice is vestibular rehabilitation exercise and maneuvers like Dix-hall pike and Epley,s. Antivertigo medicines are mainly supportive only. In your case, you have to get both the conditions treated simultaneously. I hope this helps. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, BPPV.

This is a common concern that every mother has. Kids are fussy eaters and we should inculcate good food habits in them. Try giving different food items to him on different days, keep changing, and experimenting with food - this might help him eat something. Never try feeding the same item to your child. Kids are bound to get infections - at least one in a month. It can be from other kids in playschool or park.

He is a healthy 75 years old, eats healthy, drinks at least two liters water a day. He has since five years atrial fibrillation and gets for that Xarelto 15 mg and Amlodipine accord 5 mg, takes them in the morning and that was always good. Unfortunately, he had a brain stroke on the left part. He walked to the ambulance. On the next day, he had lesser movement on the left side (mouth, arm, leg, and difficulties with swallowing). Yesterday, it was worse and the doctors say he has a stuttering stroke because the situation is going worse. Because of a little fever and the cholesterol too high he gets something for cholesterol and an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone. The doctors think the worse is now over but still little risk next 48 hours. My question is that we see on the monitor every day fewer peaks in his heartbeat. Please see the pictures, the doctors say that is an extra heartbeat and does not matter, his regular heartbeat is around sixty, and now it is around 80. Could it be his heart is weakening?","Doctor":"Hello. In atrial fibrillation, the heart beats can vary in frequency and height (amplitude). What is more important in these patients is that the rate needs to be controlled and not above 100 beats per minute. Also, one must make sure that no clot forms in the heart due to the abnormal heartbeats. I have seen the monitor pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they do not look concerning.  One must make sure that there is no clot forming in the heart which can give rise to the stuttering nature of the stroke as in his case. I would recommend a transesophageal echocardiogram to detect the presence of thrombus in the left atrium. If the thrombus is present, he requires anticoagulation with heparin. If the thrombus is absent, oral anticoagulants are enough. For more information consult a neuro surgeon online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 79 years old male and in good health.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The treatment is control of diabetes. Follow the adage do no harm. Potent topical steroid like Tenovate cream at night for 15 days can be tried (under occlusion).

I am a quiet person and did not ask many questions during my consultation. I cannot breathe very easily through my nose because I have some sort of sinus issues and it is worse when I am laying down flat on my back. I wrote down that I had sinus issues on the papers I filled out but half the time they do not look at them. I know i should have brought it up at the consultation but I was shy and nervous about the whole thing. They said they cannot even do the surgery if I have a cold. Can they do anesthesia if I have sinus issues? I would prefer to be knocked out when they take my teeth out but I am even more worried about not being able to breathe through my nose. As of right now, I am scheduled to have my wisdom teeth taken out at a hospital with many assistants who will monitor everything while the surgeon works. They also said they would be putting a tube down my throat in case I need help breathing. That makes me even more worried because I will not be able to breathe through my nose and my throat unless the people monitoring me are breathing for me the entire time during the operation. That worries me. My question is: Should I be taking anesthesia to go to sleep if I have difficulty breathing through my nose? I am not worried about the surgery itself but being given anesthesia and not being able to breathe once they give it to me freaks me out because of my sinus issues. If I did not have sinus issues I would not be worried so much.","Doctor":"Hello. You do not have to worry at all. There will be people concerned by you. Having a sinus issue is not a contraindication for anesthesia. You can have sedation supplemented with local anesthetics. In case you need endotracheal intubation, that will be safer for you because your nasal passage will be bypassed and you can be totally knocked off which is called general anesthesia. This will be done by a trained anesthesiologist. So, do not worry at all and leave your worries on your anesthesiologist. You will do absolutely fine. Wish you all the luck.

I am currently being treated for TB. I need expert advise. I have some test results with me.","Doctor":"Hello. As your gene Xpert report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows you have been tested positive for MTB which is sensitive to Rifampicin.

I would like to know your HBV DNA levels and HBeAg status as it will help in determining whether you need treatment for hepB also. As far as ANA positivity is concerned, it can be associated with hepB also in about 1 to 2 percent population it can be a normal phenomenon.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

MRI scans show nothing and she is taking a maximum dosage of Endone. She now has vascular issues with bilateral inflammation and swelling in lower legs. She has been to a pain specialist and neurologist who have no answers. She is losing hope and trying to care for four children. Can you please offer us some answers?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that her symptoms (especially the grip loss in her arms and blurring vision) are not related to a lumbar spine disorder. A brain disorder (intracranial hypotension) or a cervical myelopathy could explain some of her symptoms. Intracranial hypotension could be a complication of local anesthesia, but you should know that it usually leads to a headache and blurring vision or nausea when standing up or sitting and the symptoms usually improve with lying down. So, it seems that her symptoms are not typical of this disorder too. Coming to this point, it is necessary to perform a brain MRI study and a cervical spine MRI study. The bilateral inflammation and swelling in her legs do not seem to be related to any neurological disorder. For this reason, it is important to perform inflammation tests (complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate) and a Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels to investigate for chronic venous insufficiency. A cardiac ultrasound is necessary to exclude possible heart failure as a possible cause of increased fluid retention. Hope you will find this answer helpful.

I think he is having severe acid reflux as he is gassy and fussy almost all the time. He spits up and swallows it too. In the night, his nose gets congested. While feeding him he gags and chokes too. Whenever he does not fart he arches his body and cries a lot. His hiccups are lengthy too. He does not sleep in a deep sleep. Currently, I am giving him Colicaid (SOS) and Yamoo but it does not seem to work. I am burping him after each feed too. Kindly help me. Can I give him Bonnisan?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. I think, you just have to make sure proper time duration and frequency of feeding. Make sure, the baby is breastfed on one breast completely and then attached to another breast (frequently changing one breast to another breast or inadequate feeding to one breast can lead to loose motion as well as gas). Keep a gap of two to three hours in between the feed (frequent feeding can lead to indigestion, overfeeding as well as a lot of gas). Increase burping duration to 10 to 15 minutes or more. A decrease in burping duration can lead to nose block, which can lead to breathing difficulty as well as noisy breathing. For nose block, you can put Nasoclear drops in each nostril, one to two drops. Whenever nose block is there, especially in the night. Never breastfeed or feed in sleep or lying down position. If the baby cries excessively in the night, (evening colic) you can give Colicaid drop 0.5 ml one or two times, especially in the night. Make sure, the feeding position is proper, so that baby should not take in a lot of air during breastfeeding. Take help of online video resources on breastfeeding position. If you follow above-mentioned options, I am sure baby will be alright. No, Bonnisan is not advisable. Yamoo is given for lactose intolerance. If it is not helping stop it. Review after two days.

Ever since, I have been trying to treat the gums and also noticed an odor, greying area toward the root, and it has become difficult to manage the irritation. It also looks like a cavity may be present. I have attached a picture.","Doctor":"Hello. Discontinue the use of peroxide type mouthwash, use a gum paint which could strengthen your gums. Gums may move a little downward after cleaning as the inflamed gums come back to normal size after cleaning and is normal. However, in the photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it looks like you still have inflamed gums and a consultation with a periodontist is recommended at this time. The probable causes of inflammation may be an injury during the procedure or incomplete removal of deposits or the use of peroxide-based mouthwash. Your gum specialist may do a thorough checkup and will be able to tell you if you require another round of cleaning.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He is saying he does not feel like having sex with me. He says he is not getting erections. I asked him to take a semen test as well. The sperm count is 18 million and actively motile 5 % and asthenospermia. Could you please suggest whether he is marriage material or not. My in-laws blame me for not conceiving.","Doctor":"Hello. Your husband is suffering from some psychiatric illness most probably an affective disorder. Semen analysis report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is suggestive of asthenospermia, that is, low sperm motility. But all these problems including erectile dysfunction if present can be treated and several treatment options are available. First of all make sure he is taking treatment from a psychiatrist and not from a non-specialist, that is, a general practitioner. Support him and say you are with him and motivate him to share his problems with you. Open communication is the key for a healthy relationship. Not having a baby is not necessarily your fault, asthenospermia is one reason, and also to have a baby proper sexual relationship should be there.

Assuming that your baby has no other symptoms such as fever or runny nose accompanying the cough, my understanding is that this is a very simple issue of post nasal drip aggravating the gag reflex. This means that nasal secretions flow back into the throat causing a continuous cough like response.

Try the behavior method first, and understand that these methods take time to show the effect, same with drugs, they take around two to four weeks to exert their effects.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have rounded shoulders with slight thoracic kyphosis and sit at the desk often but do shoulder, neck, back stretching exercises regularly to combat this. I think that the main problem is coming from weakness in my thoracic spine, causing me to use arms to support myself on the desk. I think the weakness may be coming from my T11/T12 area as it shows up as having a fairly damaged disc compared to others (see attached MRI).Although the whole T3-T10 area seems to have dessicated discs that I have had since my 20s. I have had fairly tight hamstrings all my life and I have tried to stretch them intensely with a number of standard stretches, which works for a short while but they quickly become tight again. I have noticed just recently that using the leg press machine at the gym (see photo attached) is helping a lot to stretch my hamstrings.What I am confused about however is that when I keep the legs loaded, I eventually feel a great stretch and workout on my lower back and then in the T11/T12 area I mentioned, directly around the joint. This seems to be the only way I seem to get to feel a release in the thoracic joints and what feels like strengthening, but it has never been recommended to me. I have done thoracic spine strengthening in isolation (using floor back extensions, as well as tennis balls etc) and as I said hamstring stretching in isolation, but they have limited effect.I am hoping this exercise will do the trick in terms of restoring some flexibility and strength to my thoracic area and take some load off my upper spine and neck from the poor desk posture. I would appreciate any thoughts that you have.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. In my opinion, your posture is the main culprit more than strength and weakness of your thoracic musculature. I wanted to know about your low back posture and pelvic tilt. With your narration, I presume you have weakness in the gluteus muscles which is not supporting your low back thereby causing stiffness in the hamstring and in your thoracic spine. The relief what you get while stretching in leg press machine is not from the mere stretch but your gluteus muscles get activated and started to fire to support your lower body reducing the load placed over the hamstrings. I feel you would have a mild stiffness in your low back while getting up early in the morning. I am not saying pain but kind of stiffness which settles within few minutes once you stretch or start to walk. In my opinion, I suggest you the following: Glute recruitment exercises like bridging, clamshell (10 s hold six each side), side lying and lifting leg up, lying on your stomach and lifting the leg backward, step ups, Swiss ball supported squats and isometric bridge hold (30 s hold). While doing all these exercises, I suggest you exert pressure over the heel. Do not take weight over your toes. These exercises are to be done for 15 reps of three sets twice daily. Stretch your abdomen muscles. Do retraction work if upper back and stretch frequently your pecs. Both pec minor and major lats. Scapular pushups, shoulder retraction help you regain your posture. Support your low back while sitting by keeping a pillow in the low back. Hope this is helpful for you. Kindly revert back in case you need any further clarification in this regard.

IVSD 13.8 mm   IVIDD is 50.8   PWD 12.3 mm   IVSS 16.3   lVIDD 34.6   EDV 130 9ml   ESV 41 5 mL   SV 89.4ml   EF at 68.32%   FS 35.82%   IV mass 337.3 g   IV Mass - c 270.4g   LAD 34.6 mm   RVD 34.6 mm  Both diastolic and systolic functions are normal. The wall motion of left ventricle and contractibility are normal. Aorta valve is normal. Mitral valve is normal. The pulmonary valve is normal. IVC is normal. Pericardial space is normal. Tricuspid is normal. The cardiologist did not tell me the kind of hypertrophy I have and I want to know it, please. Am I likely to drop dead? I am on aggressive blood pressure control taking Losartan 50 mg and Carvedilol 6.25. Blood pressure is always under 120/80. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and also have 30 minutes of walk four times a week. Please, will LVH recess over time and can I live for another 40 years?","Doctor":"Hello. You are not likely to drop dead. You are hypertensive for a long time and that is why you are having left ventricular hypertrophy due to left ventricular remodeling. If you control your hypertension there can be reverse remodeling of your heart and your LV (left ventricle) will normalize in time. I suggest you take medications as prescribed consisting of ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) and beta blocker that will make your heart normal again in time.

Prior to this, from past 10 days, he was suffering from a low blood pressure and our family doctor asked him to stop the BP tablet for a few days. At morning 5 AM, he got high acidity and chest pain, but we thought it was acidity and gave him Rantac and other home remedies. But, he started sweating and got severe pain in the chest. We took him to a nearby hospital and the doctor immediately did the angiography and found the main coronary artery was 100 % blocked which had to be stented immediately. But, he said it is very risky as you have reached late. The damage has already happened. He processed with the angioplasty. There were a total of three blockages on the left side. Two were done via balloon and the 100 % blockage one was stented. Post the surgery, on the next day, my dad started feeling high acidity, big burps, and heaviness in the chest and his heart rate was very high. From then, we were in the hospital for ten days until his heart rate and BP and other things got normal. He had little breathlessness also. Post returning home, he felt very weak and again a week later, he got readmitted for low blood pressure as my dad fainted at home and we checked the BP was very low and hence we got him to the hospital. The doctors admitted him to the ICCU and started giving fluids to bring up his BP. The doctors said low BP was due to dehydration as my father had gone for motions thrice that particular morning and since the intake of fluids is restricted to 1.5 liters max. Previous medication when we got discharged: Cardivas, Ivabrad, Ecosprin, Brilinta, Restyl for sleep and now since my dad complained of breathlessness, they have changed the medication and now they have discontinued Cardivas completely and increased the dose of Ivabrad and asked to stop Brilinta and take Prax 10 mg. My query is should one discontinue Cardivas abruptly in between? Also, his heart rate is very fluctuating and at times his respiratory rate also reaches 25 to 30 at times. And his LVEF on the day of discharge was 30 to 35 % but on the day when he got readmitted his LVEF was 25 to 30 %. Is the heart muscle becoming too weak? What could be the reason for the same? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Your father presented to the hospital late after the episode of acute MI (myocardial infarction) with a total occlusion of LAD. So, before intervention itself, a major part of his anterior heart muscle was damaged. Even after angioplasty, his LVEF deteriorated and your father is now suffering from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Ideally, according to the recent ESC guidelines, the medicines should be: And fluid intake 1.5L/ day. So beta blocker must be continued at a reduced dose and to be adjusted with Ivabradine. Send a recent ECG of your father to evaluate whether he is a candidate for CRT or ICD implantation.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This never disturbed my lifestyle though. At present, I have frequent bouts of whole body itching (at different places in the body and not always in the same body part) in the past one month. It started suddenly one month back and persisted for 3 days. And then it was very less frequent. Now the itching has again started in the last 3 days. Meanwhile, there are no lesions or any other skin changes in the body. Only itching is present. Is it anything serious? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from either scabies or urticaria. Since no other skin lesion is present this is going more in favour of scabies. Take the following medications for 15 days and review your condition after that. 1) Calosoft lotion - to be applied on the body twice daily. 2) Tablet Teczine 5mg - to be taken twice daily. 3) HH Mite soap - for bathing. 4) Pernil 5% lotion - apply the full bottle (50mL) once the whole body after scrubbing, in the evening, just like you do an oil massage.

It all started late last year when I first experienced frequent chest pain, followed by an episode of sinus tachycardia. My 2D echo, stress test, troponin-I (1.5 ng/L) and CP-MB (14) levels were normal at the time. The doctor put me on Nebicard SM 2.5 mg just to keep my palpitations under control. This year mid, I was diagnosed with GERD with ulcers in the esophagus and a small sliding hiatus hernia. I followed a strict diet which reduced the acid reflux substantially. But, last month, I was diagnosed with mild appendicitis. The doctor put me on antibiotics and probiotics when they found out giardiasis in blood tests. The appendicitis seems to have improved as I do not have any symptoms now. But during investigations, my ECG showed ST-T changes. The doctor said these are nonspecific changes and the ECG is normal. I still went ahead and asked a cardiologist. He asked me to do troponin-I and CP-MB. The results were again normal [Troponin-I 1.5ng/L and CP-MB 5]. My concern is, despite all the tests showing normal outcomes, I do not feel healthy. I feel fatigued most of the times. My brain becomes foggy. I have become a lot more forgetful. I have lost five kg in the last three to four months. The chest pain still exists. I go through a lot of mood swings. I cannot concentrate well. There is regular muscle pain in my neck, shoulders, upper/middle back, breast bones, etc. I need to know why such drastic change in health has occurred.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns. I have checked all the reports you attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and all are within the normal range except a hiatus hernia and GERD II, but you should not worry, as you can improve with the medications. From what you mentioned, I suggest that you need psychiatric evaluation as you may have generalized anxiety disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, mid-life crisis or atypical depression. Moreover, we have to exclude hyperactive thyroid by testing for TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), free T3, T4 (cause palpitations). All these conditions may cause fatigue, muscle pains and/ or weight loss. You have to answer these questions in order to reach an appropriate diagnosis: I suggest the following: Revert with more information to an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question. Well, I had an STD. It was chlamydia, but it was cured. It was months ago. I recently had sexual relationships like two months ago, after that, I started getting a yellow discharge and I went to the doctor. They told me I had UTI. They gave me pills that I am taking and my period did not come for like one month and my period usually is not regular. And now that I am taking the pills, my period has not stopped bleeding for 13 days now, and usually, it lasts a week. But, I am worried because I do not know if it is the pills or not because it does not stop coming.","Doctor":"Hello. The pill is not the cause of bleeding. You said your cycles are not regular. So, what happens is because the cycle duration is long, there are chances of heavy bleeding. Unless you have confirmed that pregnancy was not there (abortion can cause too much bleeding), do a urine pregnancy test just to rule out it is not an abortion. If it is just heavy bleeding due to hormonal imbalance then take tablet Pause 500 mg three times a day for five days.

The doctors were saying that my prolactin and growth hormone level is quite high. They suggested me for surgery. I was afraid for surgery. Then they said to take medicine Cabergolin 0.5 mg two tablets twice a week for three months. But I continued this medicine till now (eight months). I want to take a doctor's advice. I tested prolactin and IGF-1 recently.Prolactin 725 ng/ml (ref. for Female 1.9 to 25.0) and IGF-1 was 702 ng/ml (ref. range 87 to 238), HGH was 5.90 ng/ml (ref. range up to 5.0). Again, I checked recently prolactin 6.01 ng/ml, IGF-1 was 343 ng/ml, and HGH 1.44 ng/ml (ref. range 0 to 18.0). I have attached the medical reports. Please suggest me. Should I continue the same medicine? If yes, then please specify dose and time limit. If you have other suggestions, then please recommend me. Thanks for giving your valuable time.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your detailed query and gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have hyperprolactinemia and raised IGF -1 which are being treated with Cabergoline. I would advise you to continue your Cabergoline treatment till your IGF-1 levels also normalize. Pituitary macroadenoma can be treated with either Cabergoline or surgery. Repeat your tests again every four weeks only Prolactin and IGF-1. Hope you find my advice beneficial. Good luck.

WBC count 14.5 *10^9/L, neutrophil count 8*10^9 and lymphocytes count 5.3*10^9/L (lab normal for lymphocyte between 1-4.8). Other parameters are mostly normal. Main symptoms are currently upper abdominal pain with frequent indigestion when fatty, oily, or fried food is consumed. Particularly, issues with nuts and dairy products. I previously had IBS like symptoms and was also diagnosed with H. Pylori and stones in the gallbladder a couple of years back, although it was told that the stones were small in size. Please check the attached image for detailed symptoms by period and results of blood tests. I have also been requested for an ultrasound of the abdomen. What bothers me is the referral to a hematologist. Can you please suggest?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Probable cause is cholecystitis. After reviewing your records, it is noticeable that there is persistent leukocytosis with prevailing neutrophilia and a slight microcytosis that is low MCV (mean corpuscular volume) and hypochromia that is low MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) of RBC (red blood cells). Since your ferritin level is normal and no abnormal hemoglobin was detected, it is safe to rule out the presence of both iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia which makes the aforementioned constellation indicative probably of a chronic infection which may cause an impaired iron turnover as evident from the persistently low MCV and MCH. Now, your primary complaint is abdominal pain, which obviously is a chronic one since it spans around two years. Yet, you do not state whether it is in the left or right abdominal half. The presence of gallbladder stones can cause chronic inflammation of the gallbladder and that condition can cause all related lab abnormalities. You have elevated cholesterol levels and TGL (triglycerides) as well as a BMI (body mass index) which is considered obese. It is highly probable that the reason for these gallstones is the increased concentration of cholesterol in bile. It is advisable to repeat the USG (ultrasound) of gallstones that might have increased. You should be offered a treatment regimen to \\"dissolve\\" the gallstones starting with the diet such as low fat/cholesterol food, intake of more vegetables and vegetable oil, also increased physical activity; secondarily, if necessary drug treatment or surgery. USG will also yield information regarding your liver and spleen, which is important if one is to suspect a hematologic disorder. In my opinion, there is less reason to suspect a hematological disorder in your case. If such is to be considered, then given the protracted course of two years, this should be either chronic myeloproliferative disorder (such as chronic myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis) of lymphoproliferative disorder (such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Both are diseases of the elderly, then splenomegaly should usually be present. And you should have other symptoms such as nights sweats, weight loss more than 10% for less than six months, malaise, fever.  A simple differential blood count could reveal whether that neutrophilia is due to the presence of segmented cells only, meaning - infection or due to the presence of expanded WBC formula that could prompt further testing. As for the lymphocytes, yes, they are elevated, but their number is fluctuating paralleling and inflammatory state. In case there is spleen enlargement on USG and you have enlarged lymph nodes, then further testing may be necessary to rule out chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is okay to be seen by a hematologist, who can review the differential manually and examine for the presence of enlarged spleen or liver and then consider whether further and more sophisticated testing is warranted. But most probably your complaints are due to the presence of chronic gallbladder inflammation. As for the H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori), a more informative test is the stool antigen test. Serology for H. Pylori is often falsely positive, but the antigen test before and after the double antibiotic course is much more informative. I would advise you to go through with a gastroenterologist once again and in alkaline phosphatase is present to monitor the WBC parameters with its resolution upon appropriate treatment. Investigations to be done include abdominal ultrasound, GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase).

It is darker now as compared to earlier. I want to know the reason behind this and the solution of this problem too.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern very well, but let me make it very clear to you that working out in the gym will not have any sort of effect on skin color. Going to the gym is a step closer to a healthy life. Skin color is determined by melanin, a color pigment which is synthesized within melanocytes. Melanocytes are color-producing cells. They are very sensitive to sunlight. Recent color change can be due to many reasons like It is very difficult to prescribe medications without seeing your clinical picture. However, I would like to mention a few general skin care tips here: For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Good day to you. I was having post nasal drip all last week. Yesterday, it was going away, but today I woke up and my voice is almost gone. I can barely speak. My throat does not hurt. It just feels a little scratchy, constant clearing of throat too and I have developed a cough now with a dark brown mucus (sometimes clear). Nose gets stuffy with dry bloody mucus, never gets clogged or runny. No fever, no body aches yet. Is there anything I could do to help my voice come back? I have a bottle of Amoxicillin, but not sure if it is viral or bacterial that is causing my hoarse voice. Please let me know any remedy I could use in my throat? I have attached a picture of my throat. My tonsils were surgically removed 10 years ago.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to have a typical case of laryngitis associated with viral infection. You should rest the voice, that is, speak less until you feel like the symptoms are resolving. Avoid throat clearing as it irritates the throat further and hinders healing. Steam inhalation three times a day will help with both nasal/ sinus congestion and post nasal drip. You can add small amounts of menthol crystal to the steam which works better than steam alone, but do not add too many. You can use intranasal steroid spray called Budesonide one puff in each nostril once daily for two weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Since you already have dry nasal mucosa, do not take antihistamines. The cough is brownish because it may be mixed with little blood which may have come from irritated throat lining. Too much throat clearing or coughing can lead to minor tears in the throat which heal rapidly, so do not worry. However, if there is fresh blood, you must see your ER doctor. Acute laryngitis, which is very likely what you are suffering from, resolves on its own in a week. If symptoms worsen or do not improve in a week, or if you come down with fever, you may require oral antibiotics. Hope this helps.

I have had IUI back to back for two consecutive days. But my major concern is I have a unicornate uterus with a left rudimentary horn. I recently had lap because I had a cyst on my right ovary. The doctor says I have been ovulating perfectly every time. I am depressed abt the fact that left tube is absent but four follicles ruptured on the same side. Please give me some hope of getting pregnant. The endometrium lining is 9 mm which the doctor said is very good. And, this is my first IUI after lap.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? I do not see any reason for you to worry. The movement of egg into the fallopian tube is chemically controlled or attracted. So, no matter which tube is open or blocked, the egg falls into the peritoneal cavity or the space around the uterus. Then, it will be obviously sucked into the open tube. So, you have definitely a chance of pregnancy. Your doctor will have more job to do only after you get pregnant, with lots of close monitoring and medications. Your chances of getting pregnant are on par with any other lady. So, just hope for the best and pray well. All the best.

There is so effective a treatment available for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) that it is no longer a dreadful disease. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) needs to be taken regularly with 100 % adherence. With regular ART, HIV will be completely suppressed and this not only improves the quality of life but also prevents the risk of other infections and reduces the transmission.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She does not have any other symptoms. Her balance is perfect. She has a migraine for the last 10 years. My query is should we start her on Vertin or Zevert again? For how long? And should we go for any other investigation? Can it be something serious?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your question and would explain that your mother symptoms seem to be related to an inner ear disorder. There is nothing to worry about, as her situation improved with Zevert and Vertin once. For this reason, I would recommend starting again Zevert (Betahistine) for a month, with the same dose. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.  If her complaints persist, I recommend consulting with an ENT specialist and performing labyrinthine tests.  A Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries would help exclude possible vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  Hope you will find this answer helpful.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Morning: Modapex 50 one pill, Depakene, Lamotrigine 25 mg one pill. Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill. I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight. Nothing works. I go to the gym every day, I workout but still I eat way too much because of the drugs and I cannot control it. My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly. But here is the problem. Clozapex 25 and Mirtimash make me sleep and without them, I cannot sleep. No kidding, I have not slept in the past three weeks more than a maximum of 70 hours. Even those 70 hours, they are full of nightmares and I usually wake up after two hours with my mind confused and afraid and I cannot sleep back. I want to sleep. My eyes grew tired because I have been opening them for way too long. I do not want to give in and get back to the drugs because I am sick of them and I have had enough. I am not going back but I also want to sleep. Just a single continuous eight hours of sleep without any nightmares. I usually get nightmares that are very weird. I do not even know how to describe them. Mathematical problems and complicated solutions that are presented to me (in my sleep) and I keep thinking about them until my head hurts and I wake up freaked out. Please tell me what to do. I thought that after three weeks it would get easier but it is not getting easier. I have no side effects at all from any of the drugs only the disturbance of sleep. Some of them were written on them that if you would stop them suddenly you would risk getting seizures but nothing happened thankfully. I am not even depressed or sad I am just irritated and sad about the sleeping problem.","Doctor":"Hello. Because of stopping the medication you have a problem with sleep. You should try some sleep medication for a short time and then taper it. I suggest tablet Diazepam 5 mg before sleep. It is Benzodiazepine group drug and long duration, but it is addictive. So, you must taper it within four to six weeks. Or you can try tablet Zolpidem 5 mg before sleep. It is a good medication but it is not so effective like Benzodiazepine. Zolpidem does not get you addicted. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Or you can try tablet Melatonin which is a normal nonprescription medication. You can get it online or over the counter. The non-pharmacological ways to sleep better are: Hope this will help you.

From your history and video (attachment removed to protect patient identity), my diagnosis would be post nasal drip with chronic pharyngitis. The visualization of the mucus discharge in the throat with congestion in the pharynx points to this diagnosis. The usual causes of this condition are chronic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, post viral flu, tumors in the nose and nasopharynx. The initial treatment involves warm salt water gargles, decongestant nasal drops (Xylometazoline) three drops three times a day only for seven days, antibiotic (capsule Amoxycillin 500, if not allergic) twice a day (morning and evening).

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder about a year ago.","Doctor":"Hello. From your symptoms, it seems like you suffer from post nasal drip frequently. It is commonly associated with sore throat and sinus congestion. When it occurs along with the symptoms you mentioned, it frequently points to allergies. For instance, recurrent exposure to dust mites. Attacks of allergic rhinosinusitis may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms even body aches. And, they frequently clear up in a day or two. Your case seems quite likely to be chronic rhinosinusitis due to allergies or frequent cold. Steam inhalation with menthol can help with the post nasal drip if you take it regularly. Also, antihistamines or intranasal Budesonide spray may be helpful. However, you may need a doctor's prescription for that.

The only curative treatment for this tumor is surgery (removal of affected kidney along with the whole tumor). It is difficult to save the kidney because of the large tumor size, but the surgeon will review the CT scan films with the radiologist to decide finally regarding any chance of saving the kidney. After surgery (removal of the tumor), the pathological report will be available which will show the type of tumor and pathological stage. That will guide us whether further treatment is needed or not. You have not attached kidney RFT/LFT, serum chemistry, LDH, alkaline phosphate blood test reports. So that I can tell you whether further tests are needed or not like isotope bone scan, etc. After surgery usually prognosis is good depending on the pathological report.

The episodes have been happening on and off for the last year in which I have had three MRIs, a full cognitive function test, full set of blood tests, count, liver, kidney, cardiac panel, arthritis, and sleep apnea test. I have also had a cardiac stress test, 24-hour Holter monitor, 5-day event monitor, echocardiogram and these were all negative (no abnormalities were picked up). Of late, I have found that these episodes have been getting more frequent. Could you advise if this could be intracranial pressure, a tumor, seizures, epilepsy or some sort of neurodegenerative disease?","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to intracranial hypertension or any of the other disorders. An inner ear disorder, vertigo, or epilepsy may lead to such clinical situation. For this reason, I recommend consulting with an ENT specialist and performing labyrinthine tests to exclude an inner ear disorder. If these tests result normal, I would recommend performing an EEG. It is necessary to check also thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction. Hope you will find this answer helpful.

So, I was very worried. I tested for HIV CMIA combo after 55 days. The result was 'non reactive' and again HIV test ECLIA combi Ag/Ab after 95 days. The result was 'non reactive'. My question is, I have been eating Azadirachta Indica leaves continuously for two years on waking up every morning. Does eating Azadirachta indica leaves affect HIV window period?","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. There is no risk of HIV due to a cut from a used blade even if it was earlier used on an HIV positive person and had his infected blood on it. This is because the HIV virus is very fragile and cannot survive outside the body for more than a few seconds. It dies quickly on drying. Moreover, your screening test for HIV CMIA combo result at 55 days is conclusive. This test has a short window period of two to three weeks and it is considered conclusive at six weeks (45 days) as recommended by CDC. Consuming neem leaves does not interfere with the test result.

My eyes are always dry and I suffer from allergies. Is this of any concern or is it associated with dry eyes/allergies?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The clear bubble is kind of retention cyst which is completely harmless. Only trouble if it causes red eye or heaviness while eye movements. Which you are not having.Secondly, I have seen your spot at the nasal angle but do not worry. It can happen sometimes due to allergic reaction or dry eyes. Red spot does not seem to be connected to a cyst. So, they are not related to each other.

The cause of the seizure was not known, that is, idiopathic. She is now taking Valparin 500 Chrono and Levipil 750 both two times daily. Last seizure occurred four years ago. Developments are slow although attained puberty last year at the age of 11 years. Academic achievements are fairly poor seemed to be dysgraphic. Can I expect any improvement in the future?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that as your daughter has been suffering from seizures since birth, it is very likely that her brain has been damaged during birth (from hypoxia) or she has any specific genetic syndrome, associated to seizures. Both these conditions, indicate that her brain is not like other girls of her age. On the other hand repeated seizures, lead to important neuronal (brain cell) damage to her brain. For this reason, we cannot expect her to have the same development as others. But, as she is still young, there is still hope for improvement in the future. You should just try to be more patient. The most important thing is that her seizures seem to be under control with her current therapy. Regarding her current therapy, you should know that Valparin can lead to ovarian cysts and menstrual cycle irregularities. For this reason, I would recommend performing periodically an abdominal ultrasound to check her ovaries. Hope you will find this answer helpful.

BUN levels represent the balance between urea production (liver), urea breakdown, and urea elimination (kidneys). Therefore, BUN is an indicator of kidney health and/or liver health. A high hematocrit could be due to many reasons and is not an indication of iron overload. Your hematocrit is not that high.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It was about 30 seconds long before I ended it. We did also deep kiss for several minutes. I came down with a fever about two weeks later. The fever lasted almost a week. Since then, I have had muscle aches, light headaches, and unexplained fatigue. This too went on for another two or three weeks. I have not felt 100 % since and have a general sense of malaise. I also currently have a dry cough, and it has been about six weeks since the event. Finally, I am noticing red veins in the corners of my eyes, my eyes are also watery and have discharge and crusting. I do not know what her oral hygiene or health was. I cannot say that I do not believe I had any open wounds on my penis, and I did not notice any blood on in her mouth.

Does this include HIV? What are the chances of catching the HIV virus from insertive fellatio? Do I have symptoms of HIV ARS, or symptoms from something else? Maybe this is all just from stress.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. Unprotected receptive sex from an HIV positive female (insertive fellatio) carries a very low risk of passing the virus and perhaps it is impossible to get HIV that way unless of course, she had oral sores or bleeding gums. The symptoms that you have are non-specific and may be experienced by someone with the seasonal flu. Since it has already been six weeks since the event, you may get screened by a 4th generation HIV (antigen/antibody) screening test which would be conclusive. Other STDs that you may have been exposed during fellatio are herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and gonorrhea. Regards.

I understand your concern. A child with a history of fever and cough-cold for five days definitely needs further investigation. Do blood test (CBC) to rule out bacterial infection. If he is having difficulty in breathing you must do X-ray as well. Do warm saline gargles three or four times a day so that throat inflammation can be controlled as it can also give fever and cough symptoms.

The act involved a handjob and blowjob with condom. No penetrative sex involved. I am now having sore throat and cold after four days. Should I be worried about HIV or STD?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your problem and understand your concern. As you had blowjob with condom, so the chances of HIV or STD are rare but can occur. A sore throat and cold after four days of the exposure can be due to STD or in general common cold which is likely a strong possibility. So, I recommend that you should be investigated for the possible STI/ HIV also as soon as possible, as a baseline and these can be repeated after three and six months. It also decreases your apprehension, as you investigated for HIV and found negative. Similarly a timely action can be taken for any STI/ HIV if found positive. At this point of time, it is unlikely that you have HIV infection as you had protection, but testing is recommended. Thanks and regards.

A menstrual cycle is calculated from the first day of your period to the first day of the next period (1). Safe period is from day-1 to 7 and day-21 to the rest of the cycle when you can have sex without worrying about getting pregnant. This period will not be the same for all women as it depends on the length of the menstrual cycle. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days or a little less, but if your cycle is longer than 28 days, the safe period is not reliable. It does not depend on the duration of intercourse, whether ejaculation was done at the time of the act or not.There is less chance of being pregnant but confirm that you have a regular 28-day menstruation.

I am still getting acne and blemishes. I have one large blemish that is getting small in some days. I find it getting bigger once I wake up in the morning. I always tell my doctor about this blemish. She is saying it is going to take time to clear. Now she wants to stop the course for two months and start again later as all my blood tests results are good. What do you suggest? What is the solution? I have attached photographs.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw your clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is looking like acne cyst for me. The probable diagnosis is acne grade 4 with scars Is the blemish raised and painful? Can you feel that with your finger or is it just flat red blemish? If it is raised, as I am seeing in that picture, then you will need an intralesional injection of Triamcinolone into to affected area. This will help to clear it faster compared to Roaccutane (Isotretinoin). If it is flat red and blemishes then I would suggest you use Brimonidine gel to the affected area twice a day for one week and massage a little. This clears up the redness. I feel seven months of Isotretinoin is quite long treatment duration, but the treatment regimen varies from country to country. I usually see good results with three months of Roaccutane (Isotretinoin) 20 mg. It also depends on skin type and body response. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. I suggest you also take an intralesional injection of triamcinolone. I am sorry I really cannot comment on Isotretinoin therapy from your dermatologist. But you can discuss with your dermatologist regarding the intralesional injection of triamcinolone. Please attach the clinical picture with good visibility of skin lesion. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 5 years and 2 months old. He has got continuous stomach pain, especially at night time. During the day he is fine. Can I give him Albendazole?","Doctor":"Hello. You can give a dose but that is not the main cause of his stomach pain. Most of the kids have stomach pain due to constipation. They say they pass stool regularly, but stool keeps getting accumulated. To confirm, you can just take an X-ray of the erect abdomen. We can see the fecal loading of the colon. I suggest giving syrup Looz 10 ml (Lactulose) twice daily till the stools become soft. Hope this will definitely help you.

Since you have not mentioned the condition you are receiving the drug for, I am assuming that it is for hairy cell leukemia. The main adverse effects of Cladribine are hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, and neurotoxicity. If you have any symptoms of decreased urine output, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, tingling of hands and feet, loss of sensation, etc., please visit the emergency room immediately.

Blood culture came back negative but she tested positive for RSV and also had bronchiolitis. She was discharged on the 15th and readmitted the next day 16th. The primary physician did not like the way she was breathing. My daughter was pinched several times in the ER for a blood culture which the next day came back positive. The doctor performed additional culture as he believes the positive results were due to a contaminate. Blood culture came back negative. The 42-hour culture that tested positive is appearing to be staph aureus. One doctor is suggesting getting a central line and treating her for 10 days. I am just looking for a second opinion as I do not see the logic in treating something they do not officially know she has. She has had no fevers.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Culture positive for Staph Aureus infection needs treatment. A central line is advised and when it is difficult to get, a peripheral line or prolonged course of treatment is needed. Even if the baby is not having a fever (which is a good sign), the antibiotic course needs to be completed, as half a course of antibiotics leads to more complications like drug resistance or partially treated meningitis. If resources are limited in the setting, we also consider clinical findings like if the baby is tolerating feed well, weight gain present, no fever, looking well, and hemodynamically stable. If all are there then usually we consider them. It is possible that not always you get the cause, but when the child is having symptoms, we have to treat it, initially with empiric medication and simultaneously look for the cause.

I cannot user tampons because the pressure from clots pushes them out. I am in pain. I have been taking Tylenol two or three about every hour or two. I cannot stand up because clots come out uncontrollably. I am feeling weak.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns. Fibroids may cause excessive bleeding. So, a strict management is required. If fertility is not required, hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is an option. If fertility is required, myomectomy (removal of fibroids) is a good option. Before surgery, a medication is given for three months in order to decrease the size of the fibroids. The other treatment is Mirena which is an intrauterine device with drug release. It decreases bleeding greatly. I suggest: For more information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 10 month old daughter has been sick for five days.

Kindly tell me what should I do? I have given her Paracetamol 5 ml also. It works for the hour. After that, the fever comes again. Kindly advice me as there is no good doctor here. Please help me. What to do? Is that normal or not?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. I suggest you give her Crocin (Paracetamol) 5 ml every four to six hours (Paracetamol 5 ml equals 125 mg). If fever is persistently more than 100 F, give her syrup Meftal P 2.5 ml (Mefenamic acid 5 ml equals 100 mg) every six hourly. In between fever, do tepid sponging of the whole body. The whole purpose is to bring down the temperature so that she should not throw febrile convulsion. Which is very common in very young children with high-grade fever. Usually, fevers are viral fever and do not require antibiotics. Why was Ciprofloxacin given? Just check with the doctor, usually, in children, it is least advisable. Give her warm saline gargles, throat infection is common in children, which can lead to high-grade fever. Review after two days. Happy to serve you.

The doctors are saying that general anaesthesia will be needed for RCT. Is it safe?","Doctor":"Hello. If he is not cooperating then root canal treatment is very difficult for him and he would need to be sedated. You can delay the treatment by taking antibiotics and paracetamol for a week. This will give relief for some months. Also, use a good toothpaste to prevent further cavities. In small children, proper root canal treatment need not be done but a procedure called pulpectomy can be done to give relief for a few years.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Lambert-Eaton syndrome could mimic this clinical situation too. I would recommend also checking any malignancies.

From your description, I feel you are going through traction alopecia. Yet, I would be more comfortable making a precise diagnosis if I had seen your clinical picture. Tractional alopecia is common when you tie a tight high pony every day. I would suggest you stop wearing a high tight pony, stop using hair bands, start using loose clips or leave your hair free.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have not had any issues until recently. It has been around four years since I had the root canal done but never went back to get the crown. I have not gone because of dental anxiety. I have not had great experiences at the dentist in my life. The pain and sounds of the tools make me weary. I take pain relievers (one a day usually, maybe two). The toothaches are not so bad, but they are bothersome, to say the least. I take primarily Acetaminophen capsules 500 mg. Toothache details:It is weird. Let me explain. I have recurring moderate toothaches (three to five a day) for a few days in a row, then I have a minor one maybe once a day for a few days then the cycle repeats. It is like a pattern. No toothache has been that serious but I do recall having a couple of low-end severe toothaches that did bother my sleep. Those, however are rare. These toothaches have been going on since two months. They are again, not constant. I do have times when I do not really have much or any pain, the most active toothache time is evening.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have not put a crown until now on the root canal treated tooth, then yes it can get infected and cause pain. The pain will only increase. So, it is better to go back to your dentist, get an X-ray done and get an opinion. If the root apex is again infected, you may need retreatment or you may lose that tooth.

I was relieved with biopsy, but urologist wants to do a follow-up MRI to rule out any hidden cancers. Why did not he do this before biopsy? Is this insurance related? By the way, my prostate measured 60 grams. I am an active healthy guy. I take Simvastatin for cholesterol and Losartan 100 mg for blood pressure. I just want your advice on why MRI is indicated.","Doctor":"Hello. If no foci then you do not require anything at present just follow up with PSA (prostate-specific antigen). If there are other foci which are malignant then you may require surgery depending on the stage of disease and hence MRI. MRI can be done pre or post biopsy. If your biopsy had shown aggressive tumor then MRI could have been avoided and you would have required surgery directly. So, he did not do an MRI before.

One, in the morning before the breakfast and the second one is in the evening. If, I exercise in the evening then again two options, one after dinner or before. Please let me know which option to choose. Currently, I am taking diabetes medications.","Doctor":"Hello. Your body’s core temperature is an important factor in determining the quality of exercise. A cold body causes muscles stiff, inefficient, and susceptible to sprains whereas higher body temperatures leave muscles more flexible, more adjustable for workouts. Body temperature typically increases throughout the day. Typically, more body temperature in the late afternoon. Some hormones have effects on workout which usually secretes more during the day. So will be more by late afternoon. A regular workout will be helpful if u do it during late afternoon or before dinner. It better to have workout to be done on empty stomach.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have gone through the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity) Your MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) report suggests disc changes at L5-S1 and hemangioma of L3 body. You should understand that MRI is a very sensitive investigation and picks up many features whether they are the cause of a problem or not. Hemangioma is picked up very commonly during the MRI of the spine or abdomen. These are benign lesions from birth and are not operated unless they are the cause of symptoms, which is in very few number of cases. Disc changes too can be seen in a number of individuals as it is a sign of aging. Only those disc lesions which cause a backache or neurological symptoms need to be addressed. In your case, you only have hip pain with no backache or neurological symptoms so you don't need to be concerned of any of the findings reported on the MRI. Only when you have neurological symptoms of tingling, numbness, muscle weakness, backache radiating to then legs then repeat clinical examination and MRI might be required.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The report is showing transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder (cancer of urinary bladder). In biopsy report, there is no comment on muscle involvement. That means we need to know whether the tumor is superficial or deep (involving muscle) also.

Because treatment and diagnostic workup is different for superficial and deep (muscle invasive tumor). If superficial only, then simple surgery through cystoscopy to remove superficial tumors called TURBT surgery. After that, they may give weekly intrabladder BCG or chemo to prevent recurrence. Superficial urinary bladder tumor (TCC) is highly curable.

I have a history of a previous mid-trimester miscarriage which was believed to be due to an incompetent cervix, and so have been on vaginal progesterone pessaries since I tested positive this time around. Last month, I had some PV bleeding. Scans at that time did not show an SCH. A week after the onset of the bleed, progesterone levels were found to be 6 and so I was started on tablet Duphaston 10 mg twice a day and a shot of Inj Proluton Depot 250 mg was given. Sadly, I developed light bleeding again last night and USG showed a small 1.1 cm collection suggestive of an SCH. I was given a shot of Inj. Proluton Depot 250 mg before being discharged from the ER. I am doubtful as to whether I should continue taking the Inj Innohep while I have the bleed or if I should stop. My rheumatologist thinks I should continue on with the LMWH in spite of the bleeding in view of positive immunological markers. However, My RE thinks otherwise. He says the previous miscarriage was not due to APS (the baby was fine when I went into labor) and so he did not feel there to be an absolute indication for Heparin for this pregnancy. But what about the positive ANA? Or the Lupus anticoagulant? Pre-pregnancy tests were as follows  ANA: Positive -Homogeneous >1:1280 Lupus anticoagulant: Negative  The rheumatologist wanted a repeat panel done and so the tests were done while I was pregnant.  ANA: Positive - Homogeneous >1:2560 ( Increased ) Lupus anticoagulant - Positive  In view of these test, Should I be continuing on with the LMWH? Should LMWH be continued even with the presence of an SCH or vaginal bleeding? Does the increase in ANA indicate a definitive immune response from my body to the pregnancy? Can Lupus become positive just weeks / few months after it was found to be negative?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? I know it is a tough situation for you to decide. Do not panic. Relax, you are doing fine. Let me answer you one by one. 40 mg dose of LMW Heparin once a day is a prophylactic dose. Twice a day is a therapeutic dose. So just by getting once a day dosage, will not affect the hemorrhage. Just have a follow-up scan after a week to compare the size. If you have any severe abdominal pain or active fresh red bleed. Then stop the injection. If you are also on tablet Ecospirin, better stop it, as it causes more bleed. About the antibody levels. This is a reason why blood is tested for the antibodies before.

When 15, I was sexually assaulted and resulted in pregnancy and a late-term abortion. At 17, I fell pregnant with my son. I had an easy pregnancy with no complications. Last year, at 28 weeks, I went into early labor which they stopped until 29 weeks and his heart rate started dropping and not picking back up and I started bleeding. They delivered him at 29 weeks via emergency C-section. During the healing process, I had a hematoma and a large infection right on top of each other and after two weeks of not being able to walk only being in a wheelchair, my healed scar ripped open and blood and pus was leaking for days. I have since last year not used protection with my partner and since the end of the year, I have been tracking my cycle and making sure we were having sex days before during and after my ovulation. I guess I want to know when I should go to the doctors, how secondary infertility is diagnosed and what you think about my situation?

Before his birth, my periods were very light, lasted three days and had no pain or clots.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? That was quite a history. I hope you and your son are doing fine. Well to start with, you will need to rule out any pelvic infections. Examination by your doctor as pain as early as 28 weeks of pregnancy, with a history of sexual assault at a young age, pus from CS scar with wound gaping, all can be due to infection. This can also increase your period's blood being thicker, darker with vaginal discharge, with itching with fleshy masses. You and your partner will be needing a course of antibiotics. Rule out any bleeding disorder. Anyway, when you had the purulent discharge, there is a risk of infection entering the abdomen. This could affect the tubes. So, better have the tubes tested by HSG (hysterosalpingogram) or laparoscopy. You have had a pregnancy, So will definitely have a pregnancy again.If your attempts to get pregnant have crossed six to eight months, then better to meet your doctor.

I have been fine but tonight noticed what looks like a flat white cluster that are tiny inside my urethra (penis). I do not have a burning sensation when I pee or ejaculate, nor do I have any symptoms of traditional STDs. I will be getting tested this week, however, I wanted to know if this is in any way normal or in your experience points to an STD or other conditions?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query and the photo you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I am unable to get a clear picture from the photo sent by you. From what I can see, it appears to be a normal urethral opening. However, it is unlikely that you have any usual bacterial STD's as they are generally symptomatic within two to three weeks. I would suggest you schedule a visit with a urologist or dermatologist who will give you a confirmation. I would urge you to get tested for viral STD's now and again after three months to confirm.

After that, I had sex on the 31st. As I was in my fertile window, I took an I-pill within five hours. I started bleeding on the 6th and it continued to 11th. Bleeding was light but included blood and clots. From 7th, I stared taking Novelon birth control pills to be on safe side always. But now I could see very very light red color while wiping. Not sure why it is there as I am already on Novelon. Is there any possibility that I could be pregnant because of the sex we had on 13th and 31st?","Doctor":"Hello. It is unlikely for you to be pregnant. First, you had I-pill which is highly effective and very less failure rate. Secondly, you had bleeding after sex. So, further reducing the chances of pregnancy. The spotting is likely a breakthrough bleeding due to prolongation of the recent period as it could not be completed fully because you consumed Novelon which prevented emptying of entire content during the recent period. So, I think there is no need to worry about it. All the best.

It is still bent a bit at the head and the shaft. During sex, I feel something is wrong. I also feel that my penis has become more flaccid and swollen. It feels a little bit larger and very soft. All these problems started right after my penis got bent. Before this, everything was fine. Currently, I have sex ones in 5 to 6 days. I have a little pain when I enter my wife's vagina, which is not very intense. And I have a burning sensation after ejaculation. When my penis got bent, I did not hear any popping sound nor felt any intense pain. I get a normal erection even now, but it does not last. I last longer when there is a long gap between two sexual intercourse. Sometimes, I feel burning sensation after I urinate. I got my penis examined by a sexologist, who said it to be a disorder of the nerves. He denied it to be Peyronie's disease after checking my penis and pressing here and there in and around the penis and asking me if I feel pain. I was having normal pain. He did not advise any test, and he just said that it would be cured in a month. He prescribed me really expensive medicines to take. What should I do? I am very scared for my sex life.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

You can feed the baby with a bottle or with a sipper to monitor how much feeds the child is taking and this will also regulate the flow of milk. However, use a sterilizer to clean these so that there is no chance of infection.

I already carry HSV1, but I have never had a cold sore. Did I put myself at risk?","Doctor":"Hello. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) if once acquired stays lifelong. When it is dormant it does not produce cold sores. When there are risk factors like stress in any form, physical stress, mental/emotional stress, recent illness, surgeries, prolonged sun exposure can trigger cold sores. When there are active sores with blisters and fluid in it, the person who does not have HSV can contract the virus and produce cold sores. Since you already carry HSV, you can have a cold sore with above-mentioned risk factors and it may not increase the chance of getting a cold sore as there were no blisters at the time of contact (kiss).

Nuts have unsaturated essential fats which the body cannot make on its own. Hence consumption of all types of nuts in moderation provides healthy fats like omega-3 and fat-soluble vitamin E (which works as an antioxidant). Nuts do not cause weight gain.

A headache is quite common and it will need a long time to recover (weeks). Painkillers and Mannitol perfusions will help against the pain.

I had a clean EMG three months ago but I have started twitching more and have more weakness/soreness.

Could this be ALS?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns. ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is familial in only 10 % of the cases. The diagnosis is mainly clinical (with characteristic symptoms). EMG AND NCS (nerve conduction studies) may help in the diagnosis, symptoms include: 1. fasciculations (muscle twitches) in the arm, leg, shoulder, or tongue. 2. muscle cramps. 3. tight and stiff muscles (spasticity). 4. muscle weakness affecting an arm, a leg, neck or diaphragm. 5. slurred and nasal speech. 6. difficulty chewing or swallowing.

If I just look at your lips, it looks like severe cheilitis. Considering the history, I would like to rule out oral lichen planus. Amalgam is known to cause lichen planus. Check in your mouth for a whitish lacy pattern. I suggest you meet your dermatologist for detailed oral examination. Warm compresses will be helpful till you meet your doctor. Avoid licking your lips, saliva further aggravates the condition. Use Bioline jelly, apply to lips four times a day. These are all symptomatic treatment, not specific. If the diagnosis of lichen planus is confirmed after detailed examination from your doctor, then you will be prescribed topical Tacrolimus, topical Corticosteroids and oral Corticosteroids if needed.

The sensation you are feeling could be due to a number of reasons like less space for the tooth to be in position (crowding), excessive force from the opposing teeth (trauma from occlusion) which leads to swelling of the structures supporting the tooth, an infection to the minute fibers which holds the tooth in position or certain habits (grinding).

I took him to his pediatrician the following day and was prescribed Clindamycin 150 mg three times a day for 10 days. His doctor made a big mistake by not doing any throat culture for a definite diagnosis of what she suspects as a strep/staph bacteria on his lymph node. I did not doubt the doctor then and gave him the antibiotics as prescribed. I took him back to the office on Tuesday to be seen by another doctor in the facility to do a rapid test for strep which of course came out negative since he was already taking the antibiotics. He was not getting better but worse the following days with fever not reducing, worse pain inside his mouth, not eating, skin over the lymph node turning red, and also generally feeling ill. I thought the antibiotics were not working after three days of taking Clindamycin. So, took him to the ER. ER doctor gave him one dose of Clindamycin through the IV and although his fever was still present, the redness on his lymph node diminished a bit. He had an ultrasound and they said it was not an abscess. They drew some blood to also check for mono which we do not have the result in yet. They sent us back home and told us to continue with the antibiotics until the mono test comes out positive. He is acting a bit better today (six days after onset). However, still running a fever at night 101.7 and his swollen lymph node slightly came down in size but not completely. The inside of his mouth is still painful. He does not eat much or drink much. He has been complaining of his belly feeling weird and slept a lot yesterday. We went back to our pediatrician for a followup today and our doctor suspects that he has mono due to his higher liver level but of course, we would need to confirm that for the real result. We are still told to take the Clindamycin until we hear back about the result. I am just really concerned with his past infectious disease history. He was hospitalized with Kawasaki six years ago. And with his natural immunity so low I am concerned if the Clindamycin is doing more harm than helping him at this point. If I can turn back time, I should have asked the doctor to swab his throat before prescribing him the antibiotics but it is too late now. I cannot make him stop taking his antibiotics just in case he does havea bacterial infection. Is it possible to find out after taking his antibiotics halfway, to find out if he has the bacterial infection for sure? And what should I do if the mono comes out positive? I am afraid to stop the medication in case he both had a bacterial and viral infection and make things worse by stopping the medication without any medical proofs that he should. But I am also afraid to continue the medication in case he only has mono and the medication is making things worse on him. Would it? If he only takes the Clindamycin until Monday, which would be full seven days, is that sufficient treatment time for strep in case he had it too? I want to get your opinion on this. Please answer ASAP.","Doctor":"Hello. Here are the points I would like to bring across: The lymph node is quite inflamed as per the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) that you sent. It may be inflamed in the event of any infection be it viral or bacterial. Your reports are showing a high WBC count with high neutrophils and also a high CRP which is more suggestive of bacterial than viral infection. Hence the doctor was right in prescribing Clindamycin. However, since the infection load is very high maybe an additional drug may be required or we may need to change the drug based on the response. Another last resort, if all fails, is to do a biopsy and find out what the lymph node actually contains. However, this is an extreme and painful step and should be reserved for the last. As per what you are describing it may also be mono but even if it is mono you do not need to worry, it is self-limiting. Continue the medications as advised.

Should he wear eyeglasses?","Doctor":"Hello. I do not know whether you have got his cycloplegic refraction or not. Is this just auto refractometer finding or final refractive power? Anyways, I will suggest you get a repeat cycloplegic refraction done at a good center by an optometrist who is experienced. Secondly, this refractive power is significant enough to cause symptoms. Your son may be able to correct it because of high accommodation at this age but this is not good. He may develop squint or many more other problems if not treated. So get his refraction done as soon as possible and use appropriate glasses.

Is not it important to know what your blood pressure is when you are walking around and going about your day especially if that is what makes blood pressure rise? I never understood and I am really curious.","Doctor":"Hello. This is because it is a normal response to the blood pressure rise with exercise and such increments are not harmful to the body. Exercise-related blood pressure will vary with the level of exercise so we will not be able to standardize it. On the contrary, baseline blood pressure at rest predicts the future outcome and all studies are done on this basis only.

After five days, I had a pregnancy test and it was negative. But, now I am having frequent urination with burns and sometimes a single clot in urine. Am I pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I read an article about people who badly want to grab attention. I hated to be like them. So, I started to closely watch my acts so that I do not grab attention. With the passage of time, I found out that I like to grab attention and cannot help stop myself from doing or saying things to grab attention. I do not understand my thinking since I know this is a bad habit and at the same time, I like to do it. I know it is a contradiction and I am trying hard to get rid of this habit. My question, from a psychology point of view, is, is there such an illness that the thing you hate so much, becomes your habit and you start liking it? Or it is a desire deep inside me which was sleeping and suddenly woke up? I appreciate your effort and help. Thanks a lot.","Doctor":"Hello. Do not force yourself to hate anything. Allow yourself to express yourself. There is person's nature, under which they do attention seeking behavior. If you force yourself to hate something, it means you are constantly thinking about that particular thing. Do not think about it even to avoid anything. Even 'thinking to avoid' is also 'thinking'. So, just be yourself. Do what you want to do. There is nothing wrong unless your behavior affects or hurts someone's feelings or life. You will be the person what you are thinking. The mind does not know that you are 'thinking' to avoid. It just means you are 'thinking'. Try to find a book or videos by the name of 'The secret'. They have explained the psychology of our thinking. So, accept yourself and stop over thinking. Enjoy life. People with cluster-B personality are attention seekers. You may be cluster-C personality.

Now, it is in normal range with Synthroid. My blood pressure is also normal. I feel great, but I am now down to 125 lbs. I do not exercise with a fear of losing more weight.

I am done with the tests. Reports are normal and thyroid is under control. So, what can be the other reason for my extreme hair fall? I really cannot understand. Please help. I am very tensed.","Doctor":"Hello. For hair fall, you need to use Iodium 1M one dose and Acid Fluor 6C daily 10 pills in the morning. And you have to take nitrous food. Do not use chemical shampoos and hair oils for your hair. Use Arnica hair oil and Arnica shampoo (SBL company) regularly.

He is on Thyronorm 500 mcg one tablet per day in the morning. Off late, he is having mood swings. Sometimes he seems to be active and sometimes too tired. He sleeps a lot maybe about nine hours in the night. In holidays, he tries to sleep in the afternoon also. He is about 5 feet 10 inches and weight 90 kgs. His age is 29. I checked his nails and bottom of the feet and they seem to be fine. There are no cracks, etc. He has no numbness in the feet or in the body. For the past few days, he is having a dry cough for which he is taking a cough syrup.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query about your son and it appears that your son has hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. The combination of hypothyroidism and severe vitamin D deficiency can give rise to the symptoms that you have mentioned. I suggest that you give him tablet Vitamin D 50000 IU once weekly after lunchtime for three months. Give him tablet Calcium 500 mg once daily after lunch as well. Continue Thyronorm at the same dose.

He had an MRI done recently and it showed that the tumor has grown. He is supposed to undergo radiation therapy soon. Do you know what would cause the tumor to grow? What is the prognosis? Is radiation therapy safe and effective in stopping the tumor from growing? What is the percentage? Would he need a certain type of radiation (like proton therapy) so that it would not affect the surrounding brain tissues and cells?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that we cannot determine what made the tumor grow, but you should know that the growth speed depends on the tumor type. There are different types of benign meningioma, which grow at different speeds. A biopsy would help determine the type of meningioma and the better treatment options. Regarding radiation therapy, I would like to know if he is going to do gamma knife or just fractional radiotherapy. Gamma knife is radiation, similar to surgery. While fractional radiotherapy is usually used after surgery and helps treat tumor residual or recurrence. Open surgery may be at a higher risk compared to gamma knife, considering your father's age. Hope to have clarified some of your uncertainties.

If my TTG IgA is high then I must be having celiac disease because this level only goes high with celiac disease, am I right? Then why do I need to go for biopsy as it is a painful procedure?","Doctor":"Hello. It is useful for comparison of severity of bowel involvement in raised antibody status. Raised IgA TTG level grade according to Marsh classification if your antibody level less on Marsh stage you may need a biopsy. If the patient is suffering from hypoglobulinemia present with less IgA level may present even though positive results but severity of bowel involvement is high. So, in that case, we need confirmation. I think I answered your question. If you have more questions feel free to ask.

I was just wondering if it was still alright for me to play hockey.","Doctor":"Hello. Factor 7 deficiency, also known as Alexander's disease, is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The levels of the clotting factor in the blood do not correspond to the symptoms exhibited by the individual. The severity of symptoms also vary greatly from individual to individual. Generally, it is advisable to avoid contact sports due to the risk of bleeding, either external or internal which can be fatal in some cases. I think that it would be better for you to avoid any contact sports. However, I do not know what symptoms led to your diagnosis. You said that you have a minor factor 7 deficiency, which I think should not cause much of a problem with bleeding. You can get a second opinion from your hematologist who is treating you regarding restrictions on your physical activity if any. Formation of clots is another risk factor for this condition, so that needs to be kept in mind as well. For more information consult a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a yellowish tint to my skin and yellow patches in the outer corner of both eyes.","Doctor":"Hello. Yellowish skin and mucous membrane indicate conditions with raised bilirubin levels in the blood. You need to get liver function tests done like serum bilirubin and liver enzymes ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT. If you do not have any other symptoms like nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain or fever and if this has always been the case with you, it is probably nothing serious. However, you do need to see your healthcare provider for clinical examination if other symptoms develop. And please get those tests done. Hopefully, this helps.

But from yesterday my breast has shrunk and my nipples too. There are a few lumps on my nipple as well. Even though I apply cream it is not getting relieved. It is getting worse day by day.","Doctor":"Hello. I do not think it is related to anything serious issue. During breastfeeding, it is common to have nipple infection which causes cracks, pain, dryness, etc. So, it is better to avoid feeding the baby from the affected breast for three or four days and keep it clean all the time.

At the age 55 years, if persistent lymphocytosis is seen, then CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) should be ruled out.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Personally, I am not in favor of hormonal contraception especially for long-term use as they harm the liver and suppress ovulation and decidualize endometrium.

I woke up with complete numbness on the right side, unable to make a fist, weakness when trying to stand, dizziness and confusion around dates (I did not know what month it was), issues with spatial awareness and remembering. I felt like I had the worst hangover of my life. After 10 hours with no feeling, I went to A and E. The junior doctor said she would expect to see paralysis and not just numbness. I had CT which I was told was \\"clear\\" and sent home. I was told I was too young and not fat so not at risk of a stroke. After one week, movement improved in the right arm, after four weeks symptoms were 90 % better. I still have some confusion with dates/times/numbers/spatial awareness and some new dyslexia. I have developed a deep pain in the right arm. It started with one point in my elbow and one point in my shoulder, now I have a heavy and deep consistent pain. I have been choking on my food a lot and I have had chest pain. I also was experiencing pain in both my calves. Around six months ago, I had temporary episode of visual disturbances and I was unable to tell if the soup was hot or cold and I burnt my mouth. I needed to lie down. Symptoms only lasted an hour or two but I had problems with depth perception after. I was advised it was a migraine. A few months later, I felt sick but could not vomit. Extreme dizziness. Lay down and body became rigid then relax, rigid then relax, then came the headache. It was like someone clashing two symbols at the side of my head. It came in a few seconds bursts, relief for 20 minutes and returned. The headache lasted several hours. I had an MRI and was told the lesions were \\"non-specific\\" and that the diagnosis was \\"functional\\". I am 100 % sure that these events were not functional. I also had blood taken and my homocysteine was 25. I had another MRI after the wake-up stroke symptoms. I was told there are new lesions but because of my age (33), they are choosing to ignore it.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to migraine or a possible seizure. A stroke cannot be excluded, but it is really less likely with a normal MRI. I would like to directly review your MRI reports and give a more professional opinion on the new lesions. Can you please upload both your MRI reports? I would also recommend performing an EEG to investigate for seizures. Thyroid hormone levels should be done too. Hope you will find this answer helpful. Kind regards.

It will cause some symptoms like tremors, anxiety, lack of sleep tonight, but serious side effects will probably not occur especially if the dose is taken in the late afternoon or evening. Usually, symptoms onset occurs after 24 hours of stopping the drug and I guess you will be able to get another dose within that time period. You can have some antihistaminics like Cetrizine or Levocetirizine 10 mg tonight if available and help in tackling the symptoms to some extent. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. If you noticed excessive symptoms then you should call the ambulance and keep someone informed about your Lorazepam status or keep a chit in your wallet.

The type of sedation your dentist has recommended for you is \\"conscious sedation\\" in which you will be at minimal consciousness and not completely asleep. You could respond to verbal and physical stimuli. This type of sedation helps you reduce the discomfort, pain, and anxiety during and after the procedure. Unlike general anesthesia in which you will be completely unconscious, this type of sedation is pretty safe and does not cause any side effects as such. Conscious sedation uses the same drugs used for general anesthesia but at lower doses. For minor procedures like extraction of wisdom teeth, general anesthesia is not recommended.

Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Yes, there is a risk of the baby being born with Down's syndrome. To confirm it, there is a test called chorionic villus sampling where the sample of the placenta is taken and chromosomal analysis is done to rule out trisomy 21, 18, and 13, that is abnormal chromosome. But there is another blood test which is done at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy plus level 2 ultrasound scan to rule out any stigma of trisomy 13, 18, and 21.  To confirm at this stage of pregnancy, amniocentesis is done for chromosomal analysis. If AA tests are suggesting trisomy then I suggest you go for termination of pregnancy.

Yes, I can understand that weight gain can be difficult for some people - but surely it is possible. Your wife needs to add at least 6 to 7 kg weight. You need to eat the food that you like as this will help you eat more than usual. So, you need to take the kind of food that you like for example spicy food, veg or non-veg diet, etc. The calorie intake has to be higher than what you regularly take - this also means that you need to take greater quantity of food. You need to make a list of foodstuffs that you like and stick it on your refrigerator. For example, bananas, apples, peanuts, milk, chocolates, chips, french fries, ice-cream, almonds. Also, make a list of items for lunch and dinner that you like and cook them frequently. Exercising: If you are doing any high-calorie burning exercises then you need to switch to other exercises for muscle training and less cardio workouts. Dietician: constant follow-ups with your dietician will help you with progress of weight gain - always keep a dietician in the loop. Add-on meal: start intake of one small extra meal other than your regular meals and do this consistently, over two months you will see the difference. Protein supplements: powder protein supplements available in the market needs to be taken twice daily with milk. Do this consistently to see a change. Consistency: is the key to success, so do these things regularly and only then you will see the results.

I have now been told that my right eye has a full blown macular hole but surgery may not help. Why not?","Doctor":"Hello. There are two surgical outcomes of a macular hole surgery. Anatomical correction, that is, whether the gap (hole) that has formed will be filled again or not. Usually, it has 90 percent chances in a macular hole surgery. Functional correction, that is, how many functional retinal cells remain there or who again take part in bridging that hole. This functional correction depends on the timing of the surgery, that is, how old is the hole. Older the hole, poor is recovery. Also, it depends on the grade of the hole. More the grade, poorer the recovery. Your hole is old and as you said full-blown (which I am assuming grade 4), and also there is a concomitant Best disease which primarily affects retina and macula. So, combining all these factors makes surgery a less likely intervention.

I am suffering with severe anxiety. I want to know that in what way can I handle my bad anxiety. I have tried many methods to deal with my anxiety, but nothing much is changing. I recently started to wonder if it is something more than just anxiety since my problems and suffering seems a bit too much. I am curious to know any possible idea I can try to do about it soon? Thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand that you are suffering with severe anxiety and panic attacks. Our brain is designed in such a way that we react to external signals and stimuli. Our reaction depends on the stimuli. If the stimuli are less, then we react less and if the stimuli are more, then we react more. Anxiety is a stage where we react more for less stimuli or sometimes no stimuli at all. This may be due to two reasons, temporary stress and biochemical abnormalities in the brain. If it is the former reason, then it will go away after a few days. If it is the latter reason, then you may need to take proper tablets. As per your narration, since you are having this for a long time, it is probably due to some biochemical abnormality in your brain. But, please do not worry. This can be treated quite easily with tablets. Just like diabetes (increased blood sugar) and hypertension (increased blood pressure), which are basically biochemical abnormalities, anxiety can also be treated with tablets.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have been having nasal problems since I used cocaine two weeks ago. I am not a regular user of any drug but have used cocaine three times in the past year, about 1 g per time. I have been concerned about a perforated septum. My GP has had a look and has said there is no evidence of such but there was soreness/ inflammation. I have also checked and cannot see a hole but I am not sure what I am looking for. I have booked in to see an ENT specialist but there is a two-week waiting list and I am growing increasingly concerned. My symptoms are/were:Blood in mucus when blowing my nose. This reduced across a 10-day period and has now stopped (I was prescribed an anti-inflammatory cream and I have also been using saline spray).Stuffy and dry nose which is still present.Slight nasal pain across the bridge of the nose.Bit of an odd one but if I massage where my sinus is my nose clicks/pops as if there is a cartilage damage.I get occasional whistling noise when congested and breathing in.My questions are:If my doctor sees no evidence of perforation and I abstain from any further usage, will this mean perforation will not occur.Does the initial vasoconstriction caused by cocaine cease after use or does it continue?Will any damaged mucosa/tissue repair itself over time?What could the weird popping be?In your experience would minor usage (as described above) lead to irreparable damage?Would the whistling I am experiencing be more constant if there was a hole in the septum?Is there anything I should ask/state at my ENT appointment?I will not be using again but would really appreciate your guidance. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, if you stop using cocaine, perforation will not occur if your nose is healthy. It stops gradually. But you may need a course of steroid and nasal wash. It will repair but it depends on the severity of damage. Popping in the nose can be due to infection or drying. I can confirm after examining. No. A small hole will heal but larger one needs to be repaired by surgery. In your case examination is most important.

The only concern is the baby is having an echogenic intracardiac focus in left ventricle which was found in anomaly scan following which my doctor prescribed a quad screen test and I did that as well. My doctor is very supportive and understanding, but with both my double marker and quad marker test my chances for Down's syndrome was 1:1071 and 1:1384 respectively, and she keeps saying, she would have been happy if it was 1:10000 and with finding of echogenic intracardiac focus, I am a bit anxious and worried about how to actually take it. I am looking for a strong opinion on your experience. Also, please note, there were two complications I faced. During my eighth week, I had a minor brownish spotting, which was subsided by extra dose of Progesterone and Duphaston and following which I had major itching issues, which when examined found out to be increase in AST and ALT level. All possible tests for hepatitis and ultrasound for liver were clear, and with Udiliv 300 it came back to normal. But my AST and ALT levels were high since the 11th week of pregnancy which according to any doctor is not heard of but it is in control with Udiliv. Other than that, I feel absolutely no physical discomfort or complications. Please tell me if there seems anything alarming.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? Let me assure you that you and your baby are absolutely normal and will have no problems. Let me explain one by one. A single soft tissue marker like the echogenic cardiac focus is not at all to be worried about. We do not need to do any marker or even a fetal echocardiography. Forget the risk ratio. Even if noted anything above 1 in 250 is not to be worried about at all. Even echocardiography will be normal and post-delivery follow up will be normal. Brownish discharge in first three months of pregnancy is normal. When the embryo implants, the minimal blood which comes due to the burrowing embryo will clot and come out within first three months of pregnancy. Even without the progesterone, the clot will resolve. So do not consider it as a problem. Pregnancy is a cholestatic state and liver enzymes will raise. But that is quite early as you mentioned. Just have symptomatic management. In short, I feel both you and your baby are absolutely fine. Nothing needs to be done. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries.

I saw the clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like twenty nail dystrophy. This is a clinical diagnosis. Some cases are genetic and some are acquired. The cause for the nail dystrophy is not very well known. Some of the systemic diseases like anemia, IgA deficiency, primary biliary cirrhosis are the mentioned causes. Some of the skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, vitiligo, eczema are also known to cause this type of nail changes. This is not a fungal infection. Because all the finger and toenails are involved equally. Usually, fungal nail infection starts in one fingernail then spreads to few other nails, but never all nails. This is a difficult condition to treat, there are case reports saying spontaneous correction of nails with age.Other treatment modalities include: A protein-rich diet consisting of eggs, chicken, milk, dal, and curd would help because nail is made up of protein.

It happened one week ago. I knew her from the last three months and had very good communication with her. She said to be working in a good company. We went out one day and had sex. I used a condom while doing it. But during that time I had a cut in my hand and I had once put my finger in her vagina and also the used condom. I also happened to put my tongue in her vagina. The girl is in good health and I even asked her twice if she is HIV positive but she told she is not. I had this anxiety in my mind. I searched the online sites for the early signs and found that I a had little back pain and numbness and throat is feeling little strange. I have little dizziness sometimes. When I am trying to sleep I am shaking from the inside and not able to sleep. It is just seven days since I had sex. I am too scared and not sure what to do. Yesterday, I was feeling a little bad today it is little better for me, but my hands shake a little. Do you think it is possible that I have any symptoms of HIV? Should I look for a common symptom? As I said before the girl is just fine, no noticeable health issues. Do you still think it is possible for me to get HIV from her? What step should I take now?","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. I would say that you have a very low risk of HIV due to unprotected oral sex. Unprotected oral sex is still less of a risk as compared to unprotected vaginal or anal sex but the risk is not zero with oral sex. Protected vaginal sex is safe and a skin cut on the finger that is not freshly bleeding is not a risk. A cut that is a few hours old is self-sealing. As far as your symptoms are concerned they are non-specific and partly due to anxiety. Anyways you should take an antigen/antibody HIV screening test (P24Ag and anti-HIV antibody test) at four weeks and at six weeks for a conclusive result. Regards.

I was put on PEP immediately within 11 hours post exposure and the first dose of PEP was the tablet TLE (Tenofovir/Lamuvidine/Efavirenz), given to me on the morning of 10th. I was asked to follow up the next day with an HIV specialist and she changed my PEP regime to a combination of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine and Dolutegravir as they are more effective. As I was worried and had fever for two days, I did an HIV PCR RNA test qualitative exactly after 10 days from exposure. The results came back 'not detected'.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. Perhaps your question was not completely typed. Anyways, your PEP regime of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine and Dolutegravir is recommended one. Continue with it for 28 days.  As far as the HIV PCR RNA test is concerned it is not a reliable test while on PEP. You need to wait for your PEP to be over before testing. Regards.

What is the root cause of hypercoagulation and can it be treated so the condition goes away? My fibrinogen, antithrombin III, and D Dimer are elevated and my TEG platelet mapping shows hypercoagulation. I am taking Coumadin 5 mg per day. I did some research and learned that elevated fibrinogen could be the result of chronic inflammation from atherosclerosis, which I have. Other causes might be cancer or arthritis, which I do not have. Can you think of anything else that might be causing it and have you any ideas on how to reverse it permanently? I do not want to take Coumadin for the rest of my life if I can help it.Background: I have a history of a dozen lacunar strokes in different parts of my brain (sometimes in several places at once) and many TIAs over the past three years, for which I have received tPA, and after which the stroke symptoms resolved with minimal lasting deficits (left hip is still weak).Recently, I went to a hematologist to see if I could find the cause of the strokes and TIAs. He did an extensive workup and told me my blood protein is all screwed up. I assumed he meant fibrinogen. He diagnosed me with hypercoagulation and put me on Lovenox shots for two weeks, then transitioned me to Coumadin six weeks ago. Since then, the strokes and TIAs have stopped.My normal blood tests: Protein S, Protein C, Factor V Leiden, IGG/IGA/IGM, Anticardiolipin Antibody, Thrombin Time, Lupus Anticoagulant, DRVVT, Heparin Level, APPT, Protime-INR, PFA, Homocysteine, Cortisol, C Reactive Protein, Troponin I, Prothrombin DNA, PT, PTT.My atherosclerosis: CTA and MRA show there are no problems in the vessels of my heart or neck, but mild to severe stenosis in various vessels of my brain, notably the basilar artery (balloon angioplasty reduced it from 90 % to 50 %) and the right anterior cerebral artery (is 90 % but they cannot do angioplasty because they say it is too difficult). I have small vessel disease in my white matter.","Doctor":"Hello. Your elevated antithrombin 3 and D-dimer levels are a direct consequence of the stroke you suffered and the many TIAs. High fibrinogen levels are associated with an increased incidence of blood clots. The treatment that you are receiving currently is to prevent the formation of blood clots. Unfortunately, the only way you can reverse it completely is to reverse your hypertension and atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis in older individuals and those with a prolonged duration of the disease is usually irreversible. You need to keep taking the medication since it prevents the development of clots and will help prevent them in the blood vessels in the brain. If they are allowed to develop, they can be fatal.

I suffered from OCD psychiatric disorder from five years. The doctor told me that I am passing more urine due to anxiety. My urea creatinine and blood sugar are in the normal range. I want to know why my kidneys are hyperactive. Have I any risk of developing CKD in the future?","Doctor":"Hello. No, not at all. If your urea and creatinine are good, there are no chances that you will develop any renal failure or CKD just because you pass excessive urine. To alleviate your anxiety, get your urine osmolality test done and if that is normal, the urine you are passing is normal. I hope it helps you.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My sister gave me the car seat and it was used by her 6 year old daughter when she was a baby. When I went to buy a car seat recently, I realized that the newer models of the car seat I had used were much softer and more padded than the one I had used which was a bit worn from use and quite hard. I am worried that the hard car seat could have caused harm to my baby either now or in the future. Could it have harmed her cells? Is this medically possible? I have postnatal anxiety and my main worry is the hard car seat and regret that I did not buy a new one.","Doctor":"Hello. In my opinion, it may not have caused any harm, as far as your daughter is walking well, no gait issue, and no complains of pain over hip joints. Kids cells have higher regeneration power compared to adults. Theoretically, one can take a biopsy of a particular site and see under the microscope for any change, but in my opinion, it will be useless, and practically does not add value to the outcome. I will suggest, focus on involving her in a safe sports activity where hip mobility can be ensured. Do not blame yourself. You and your sister did it in good faith. The baby will be alright.

I have reviewed your query and can understand how worried you are about your health. I want to add that it seems to be due to hormonal imbalance caused by the contraceptive pill. Emotional distress also adds up to the situation. As of this time, it seems nothing wrong. You just keep up with daily routine and do not bother much about this issue. When we take pills that contain hormones, it interferes with the natural body hormones. This may sometimes cause breakthrough bleeding too. Hope it helps.

Also, you should start dietary restrictions on sugars, fatty, and oily food. Deranged lipid profile. Your triglycerides and cholesterol, both are elevated. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, and high-calorie diet. Get your BP checked once. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity for at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week.

I have a neck swelling (lump in my neck) in the posterior triangle area for a few weeks. X-ray chest and USG whole abdomen are clear. I went to the doctor and done FNAC which showed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and started Augmentin antibiotic and later Ceftum antibiotic but no resolution. Finally, excision biopsy was suggested and done. The report showed tubercular lymphadenitis and started the treatment and currently on Akurit four tablets for three days. Now, my question is, I had neck swelling in two areas of my neck as shown in the picture sent to you pointing out with my fingers. The upper one was large hard and lower one was small movable. ENT oncosurgeon said he will bring out lymph nodes from upper area and not from the lower side as it belongs to the same area. Accordingly, excision was done and four lymph nodes from the upper area were sent to histopathology. In the meantime, while waiting for results my lower node grew in size a bit and also I felt lump just below my incision site. I mean lump type. And two days later, the report came and it was TB. Now, my question is: Is the doctor correct in bringing out upper lymph nodes and not the lower area node? Could it be like lymph node swelling in the upper area was due to TB and lower area swelling for some other reason? Like lymphoma, etc.? What do you think? Your expert suggestion is needed. Does lymph TB involve single node or can be multiple in different adjacent areas?","Doctor":"Hello. Tuberculosis can present with single or multiple enlarged neck nodes. It is unlikely that one lymph node will be due to lymphoma and another due to tuberculosis. Your doctor did the right thing by taking a biopsy from one area of lymph node only. No need to take from all neck nodes. Your X-ray chest and ultrasound are normal. While in lymphoma, there may be associated abdominal, axillary, and mediastinal lymph nodes (central chest nodes) plus sometimes enlarged spleen and high LDH blood test, your ultrasound, and X-ray chest are normal. In TB, usually ESR (blood test) is raised and skin test (Mantoux test) may be positive. Your neck lymph node FNAC/biopsy is clearly showing tubercular lymphadenitis. Nothing to worry about and continue anti TB treatment and take balanced diet. All your lymph nodes will start disappearing in two to three months. Follow up regularly with your primary physician.

Yes, your scan indeed tells that you are having a low lying placenta. In such cases, chances of painless bleeding may be there. It would be better to avoid intercourse and heavy activities and to have a review of placental location in the anomaly scan at 19+ weeks. Almost 75 to 80 % of the times, the low lying placenta usually migrates to the upper uterine segment. So, the chances of bleeding come down by the term. So it is not something major to be worried about but yes the precautions are needed to be taken. Take care.

I have a desk job where I need to be sitting for eight hours continuously at the computer. I am suffering from these problems since 27 years. When I was 19, I did heavy exercises once and suddenly the heartbeat increased to approximately 180 times per minute. It came back to the normal rate in a minute. But, from that day I have been having heart palpitations. I stopped all the exercises. I tested ECG and 2D. Both the tests were normal. The doctor said my heart is 'almost' normal. But another doctor said that it may be a valve problem. He said this just without testings. But my experiences are 'heart palpitations' and I feel some 'weight' in the heart continuously for four to five months. Then I felt normal and tried doing the exercise again. I feel the same experience. So, again I stopped exercising. So many times these repeated. Three months back, I experienced the symptoms. I felt giddy too. So, I feel very afraid. I immediately consulted the cardiologist. But ECG, 2D, and treadmill (this is first time tested) came normal. I did not test the angiogram. Now I have breathing difficulty, dizziness, and uneven heartbeats when I lie on my side. I quit exercises completely. I am only walking. I do not understand what is going on. Am I straining myself during exercise? Or is it a serious problem? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. You have done some tests already related to the heart and found it to be normal. I suggest you do free T4, T3, TSH, Holter monitoring, and Hb %. Based on the reports, the next course of action could be taken. I think you need not worry. Try to control your stress.

She is a lactating mother of a 12 month old baby girl. She is also believed to get pregnant this week.

As for the body ache and fever, I suggest tablet Crocin 500 mg (Paracetamol) one tablet when fever present. After feeding the baby, medicine is to be taken. Syrup Honitus (ayurvedic cough syrup) two teaspoons thrice a day for five days. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

Since he was not in his senses for quite some time, a neurologist diagnosed him as a probable case of extrapontine demyelination. Although after some time, he showed better signs of consciousness and within next 15 days he was back home and went from being bedridden to doing everything by himself after some help from physiotherapy. Although after he realized he spent almost three months in hospital, he started getting depressed. Nowadays, he stays in a kind of crying mode (no tears), does not talk properly (talks in a weepy tone), has no confidence in himself and says he cannot even move by himself (although he can). He even does not want to go out anywhere. At times he blabbers weird things. Also, at times he does not realize about the nature calls and poops in his pants. I am not really sure whether to take him to a psychiatrist or a neurologist. Who should I consult and what should be my next step? How do we take care of him now?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The skin texture has also changed and itches a lot. When I scratch in the dry condition, flake-like particles come out of it. I am not sure whether it is a fungal infection or something else. It irritates a lot. Please suggest a remedy.","Doctor":"Hello. Thigh folds and armpits are usually little dark compared to normal skin tone. This is because of constant friction, sweating, and hormonal influence. If you are really worried about skin tone in that area there are few medications which can help like Kojic acid cream, but the effect will be very minimal, cannot expect to get fairer. Regarding fungal infection in the groin, there is one more condition called inverse psoriasis which affects groin area with white flaky skin. Hence I would suggest you attach your clinical picture along with your query so that it is convenient for me to comment on your condition and suggest you proper treatment. However, I would like to mention few skin care tips that are crucial to follow during tinea infections along with medications. Tinea fungal infections - crucial do’s: 1. Wear dry loose cotton clothes. Try to find inner garments which are 100 % pure cotton. Make use of fans or air conditioners at night to keep the affected part well ventilated. 2. Take bath twice a day. Always use lukewarm water. Avoid using very hot water. Hot water favors fungal growth on the body. Wash the affected parts with cold water once you are done taking bath. Always use a fresh dry towel to wipe off water from the body. Make sure skin folds are totally dry before wearing clothes. 3. Use antifungal dusting powders for your skin folds such as underarms, thigh folds, below breasts, and between the toes. 4. Wash your clothes, towel, and bedspread in hot water and dry them in good sunlight. 5. Eat healthy food, keep your body weight ideal for your height because being overweight or undernourished leads to reduced immunity which increases the chances of acquiring a fungal infection. 6. If you are diabetic, check your blood sugar level frequently and make sure your blood sugars are within the normal range because uncontrolled blood sugar is a risk factor for fungal infection. 7. Ask if any of your family members have a similar fungal infection. If so, encourage them to take treatment. 8. Check your pet animals for rashes. If there are any, take them to a veterinary doctor for treatment. Dogs and cats are also the sources of infection. 9. Always complete the full course of medications prescribed by your dermatologist. Incomplete treatment results in recurrence of fungal infection which is more resistant to treatment. Tinea (ringworm): crucial don’ts 1. Do not scratch. Scratching makes the rash worse. Ask your dermatologist to prescribe anti-itching medicine. 2. Do not wear synthetic clothes, tight-fitting jeans which do not allow air to flow through them and do not wear wet inner clothes. Do not wear inners while at home, just allow air to flow freely through the affected part. 3. Do not share your personal items such as clothes, towel, soap, or comb with your family members or friends. 4. Do not use over-the-counter (OTC) medications for ringworm. Most of these OTC creams contain steroid in them, which gives faster relief from itching but they make the ringworm spread to a larger area and also make the routine treatment insufficient. 5. Do not use home remedies such as garlic paste to get rid of ringworm. This could burn your skin and leave a permanent scar. Hope this little piece of information is helpful for you. I wish you a speedy recovery. Take care. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I spoke to a dermatologist on here.

You can re-try the vomiting medicine of the same brand or other like Ondem /Enset (Ondansetron) 5 ml two times a day 30 minutes before meal. If no fever, do not worry, give vomiting medicine, maintain adequate hydration by giving liquids.

I am attaching the prescription/ medicines which she is taking as well as the latest blood report.","Doctor":"Hello. It is not a viral infection but a bacterial infection as her TLC has increased. Also, diabetic patients are prone to such infection. Treatment is antibiotics, which she has been started by her physician. In most patients, this resolves with a week. Continue other medicines as prescribed. We should see a response in 24 to 48 hours. If there is no improvement in fever, cough, or increase in her symptoms like increased shortness of breath, visit a hospital as her antibiotics will need to be escalated and she may need higher IV antibiotics. If you have electronic BP apparatus, then monitor BP twice a day. Excessive fall in BP or decreased frequency of urination are some of the warning signs. Repeat TLC, urea and creatinine test to see antibiotics response. So overall, a majority of the patients recover well but some amount of risk is always there in such infections.

I have a diagnosis of arachnoiditis, arthritis and low lying conus with fattening of filum terminale. Due to increasing pain and neuropsychologist recommendation, I was sent to do a new Brain and L spine MRI and I would like to hear your opinion on it.","Doctor":"Hello. I observed your scan (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I agree that the conus is low lying at L2-L3 level (normally it should end at L1 level). Facetal joint arthropathy is seen at multiple levels in the lumbar spine. Post-contrast images show abnormal enhancement of the anterior subarachnoid space consistent with arachnoiditis. However, the cause of your left side radiating pain is due to left para-central disc bulge at L5-S1 level narrowing the neural foramina and compressing the L5 left exiting nerve roots. These changes are probably due to adjacent segment degeneration. In my opinion, the MRI scan needs to be repeated post-therapy to see interval resolution of arachnoiditis.

I have previously been diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis but a new physician recently did the genetic test and indicated that I only had one of the genes present and thus was a carrier and not a patient.The blood test showed:  Iron, Serum 286 ug/dl range 35-169 (ALERT LEVEL) TIBC 435 ug/dl range 250-450 UIBC 149 ug/dl range 111-343 Iron Saturation at 66%   On the Transferrin Saturation   Iron 298 ug/dl range 61-157 Transferrin Saturation 56% range 15-55 Transferrin 377 mg/dl range 200-370 Ferritin, Serum 36 ng/ml  I had given blood about 10 days prior to the test being taken. I am looking for some guidance on whether these results should be of concern or not.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your blood test results (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your blood picture shows that the iron which is absorbed is not being utilized properly. Your transferrin saturation levels 56 % is high but not more than 62 %, which is indicative of homozygosity for the HFE gene. Moreover, genetic testing is confirmatory. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45 % for males or 35 % in premenopausal women (i.e. 300 ng/L in males and 200 ng/L in females) are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of hemochromatosis. You have already been diagnosed as heterozygous for hereditary hemochromatosis, and these values are to be expected. Since your serum ferritin levels are towards the lower end of the normal range, you do not need to undergo phlebotomy. Serum ferritin in excess of 1000 nanograms per milliliter of blood is almost always attributable to hemochromatosis. The increase in RBC count and hemoglobin is a direct result of the testosterone therapy you are receiving. I would say that currently you need not worry but you need to keep monitoring your serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation in order to prevent the development of complications and receive adequate treatment when your iron stores reach levels that can cause them.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I visit my doctor every year for a gynecological physical and regular physical. My regular physical last year was great and my gynecological physicals have always been good as well except for uterine fibroids. My last GYN visit was four months ago and everything was fine. I have never had an abnormal pap smear. I have had the fibroids for almost 20 years. During my last GYN visit, all my tests were normal and my doctor said my fibroids were shrinking. A week ago today I saw what I thought was a very small amount of blood on my poise pad. It has not happened since. This has never happened in the last three years since my last normal period. I also suffer from OCD and anxiety and I am always to myself. I am not even sure it was blood to be honest and of course, I will call my doctor and make an appointment for next week. It was not brown spotting and it was not bright red either. I do not have a UTI or pain in my abdomen or anything. Again, it was very, very small and light. I am thinking perhaps I had something on my hand and it touched my pad and I did not notice it. A little insight would be helpful. I am currently on Valsartan and Prozac.","Doctor":"Hello. It is blood spotting and it may be due to the presence of fibroids in the uterus or due to non-infective endometritis or due to some hormonal change. All these may occur after a gap of few years post-menopause, rarely Prozac may also cause bleeding. It may not occur again, anyways you have to see the gynecologist.

Recently, I have been diagnosed with tubercular lymphadenitis and started the treatment three days back for TB. My USG whole abdomen reveals hemangioma of the liver. I have pain in left side below ribs which radiates to back and a couple of months back on CT scan done for other reasons showed stomach rugae thickening. Now my question is what is causing the pain? Can stomach rugae thickening cause pain in that area? What is the treatment of stomach rugae thickening? Please suggest medicine for it. One of my brothers who is a pharmacist suggested Pantoprazole and Acogut 100 mg tablets. Is it worth taking the medicine for stomach rugae thickening? I need your suggestion. Can bacterial infection like tubercular lymphadenitis cause mild splenomegaly?","Doctor":"Hello. Rugae thickening by itself is not going to cause you stomach pain. Such thickening is usually normal or a result of hyperacidity, or rarely Menetrier disease. Now, first of all, you need an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as well as a biopsy to rule our H.pylori infection and other causes. Tuberculosis can also cause such thickening. It is unlikely that tuberculosis would cause mild splenomegaly. However, it is important to see if tuberculosis has involved spleen also. You can take the medicines suggested by your pharmacist but cross check with your doctor in case they have given the same with your tuberculosis medications. I hope it helps you.

I bumped my knee on the table not even hard enough to bruise then the seizure happened. This has never happened before. Also for a month or so I am hearing some wheezing sound in my head. I feel tired and stressed lately. Whilst in front of a computer I feel tics in my right eye frequently. My GP told me to ignore the seizure. He prescribed me Vastarel 35 mg for a month. Recent blood tests show everything fine which includes FBC, iron, ferritin and glucose. He advised me to have a brain examination only if I have another seizure. Is he right? Or do I need further checkups? Also, what could be the cause for this seizure? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me share some facts of seizure. A seizure is due to abnormal or synchronous activity in the brain and presents as a mild tremor to violent shaking or change in the behavior. Epilepsy is due to recurring epileptic seizures as a result of malformed or brain malfunction usually associated with abnormal EEG (electroencephalogram) and scans. Thus, seizure is not synonymous to epilepsy. The most challenging fact is to define the actual episode and confirm it to be a true seizure. If yes to above, then just stay away from those provoking factors and everything going to be alright. Unlike that if it is unprovoked requires work up like EEG, video EEG and later MRI brain to confirm epilepsy.

They are round patches along with a lesion similar to canker sores. Normally, I get canker sores but this time this lesion seems to be little more enlarged. Is this a precancerous condition or if not then what meds should I take?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Do not worry. It is not any type of precancerous lesion. Such patches usually come when you are not taking good balanced diet and take lots of snack items. So reduce snacks and very hot and spicy food.

This can be a viral infection and that spreads from person to person very easily. The area that is hurting maybe your lymph nodes under the ear and chin. They are swollen and very painful when there is an infection of the area of their drainage. You need to consult a physician right away so that he may have a look at your upper respiratory system.

It is usually about 130 over 85. I am having another echocardiogram next month.","Doctor":"Hello. So, currently, you do not have any serious heart issues. The impaired relaxation and diastolic dysfunction occur due to chronically elevated BP leading to hypertrophy. It is not serious heart problem and needs no specific treatment. It is similar to the bodybuilding of athletes secondary to increased workload. Now, regarding Dextroamphetamine, the contraindication is not related to your heart but related to high BP. It is contraindicated in moderate to severe uncontrolled hypertension. So considering you are having the lowest possible dose and your observation that it is not affecting BP readings, Dextroamphetamine can be continued. However, keep watch on blood pressure. Now, mentioned BP reading is fine and you should continue the same antihypertensive. If needed, we can increase Amlodipine to 10 mg. Regarding cholesterol, LDL is significantly higher. You should do vigorous lifestyle modifications and if you are already doing then it is better to initiate medicines like tablet Rosuvastatin at bedtime. Otherwise, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, and high-calorie diet. Also, have a low salt diet. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Try to lose some weight and bring BMI down. Recheck cholesterol after two to three months, if there is response it is fine, otherwise, you will need medicines.

Darolac (Lactobacillus) is a good treatment which helps replace disturbed gut flora.It is safe OTC medication, with a maintenance dose of one capsule per day. You can increase it to two times per day if there are symptoms. IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) is not curable but controllable. There are some precautions if you take antibiotics along with Darolac, separate the two medications by at least two hours. There are many medications that can be taken for IBS, including Loperamide if there is diarrhea, Senna tablets if there is constipation, Librax (Chlordiazepoxide and Clidinium) if your symptoms are related to anxiety.

I am giving him normal saline. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Since your child is having an asthmatic cough, I suggest you give Asthalin (Salbutamol/Albuterol) nebulization and Budecort (Budesonide) nebulization along with an oral cough syrup with Salbutamol or Levosalbutamol. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Just giving normal saline will not help. If the wheezing is heavy consult your pediatrician.

Sometimes, I also experience that there is something crawling in my chest. I recently have my ECG done and results are within normal limits including X-ray.","Doctor":"Hello. According to the details provided by you, I do not think there is something to worry about. The only thing you can do is change your breathing pattern to 5-4-7, that is, inhale while counting up to five then wait till you count four and then exhale until you finish counting up to seven. It would be of help if I can view your ECG and then the answer will accordingly change if you have other problems like feeling fatigue or dizziness or getting breathless on walking a short distance or climbing an uphill. Hope this helps you out. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 23 year old. I have got a lot many allergies. Actually allergy from almost everything. 15 to 16 to be precise and reports of my prick test are attached. I get stomach problems, hyperacidity, indigestion, hives (urticaria), sinus, breathing problems and my eyelids and a part below that stays swollen almost all round the year. My weight fluctuates a lot. There is a difference of 1 to 2 kg somedays in the morning and evening measurements. The things stay under control when I pop in about two antihistamines a day and 2500+ mg Vitamin C and occasionally vitamin D. But management is difficult. I have tried diet changes and everything. Bromelain helps too. I also have anxiety issues for which having 25 ml rum every night helps me and stops me from getting so frustrated that I stop everything.I am allergic to ghee, neem, wheat, dust, paper dust, cats, mouse, fish, chicken, milk and milk products, and few more insignificant things that I cannot recall at the moment. Immunotherapy will not work that is what my last doctor said and well, to be honest, it was so expensive Icould not have gone for it anyway. Please give me something so I can reduce the amount of medicines I take. I was actually looking for a mast cell stabilizer that brought me here.","Doctor":"Hello. Cromolyn (Cromoglicic acid) is a mast cell stabilizer. Sodium cromoglycate is the chemical name for it. You must try allergen avoidance. That seems to be the only way. Allergy to so many substances will make immunotherapy very difficult. The success of avoidance depends on how strictly you follow it. It will be very cumbersome initially but over time you will learn to avoid the offending stuff. Although regarded less predictive than skin prick test, blood allergy testing may be useful in you in reducing the positive allergen detection. If we are able to pinpoint to fewer allergens then avoidance becomes easy. Blood allergy testing or specific IgE testing is called immunoCAP.

I was cleaning my wood pellet stove, running up and down the stairs to get tools from my workshop and during the process, I noticed I was sweating and my heart was racing. I sat down in front of my clock and checked my heart rate, it was 162 BPM. I had a doctor's appointment that day anyway, so I took a shower and got dressed to go to my orthopedic. I felt a little off while I was in the office and spent like I ran a marathon. When the nurse put the finger heart rate monitor on I noticed my heart was still running between 115 and 120. My BP was 140/110 also high. I think something I put into my body yesterday interacted with my prescription meds.I said something to the nurse when I saw my heart rate, she said to speak to the doctor about it. I started using Minoxidil 5 % a week ago to help thicken one side of my beard and assumed that maybe it was interacting with my meds because it was only my second day taking it. I checked for drug interactions and did not see any between it and my meds when I started using it. The doctor told me that Minoxidil should not cause this condition. The Minoxidil box says Minoxidil can cause your heart to race. I checked Minoxidil interactions and found several people who claim they had interactions immediately after using it. I went home, alerted my psychiatric nurse and then took to the internet to try to find some answers.My heart rate and BP came back down last evening. I found several things that could have caused a problem and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on the issue. I take three prescription drugs daily:  10 mg Ritalin three times daily for ADHD (just started taking eight months ago). 100 mg Zoloft once daily for PTSD. 100 mg Seroquel once daily for insomnia.  I went untreated for years and began to suffer extreme anxiety and depression. So, I saw a doctor over a year ago. Ultimately, I was diagnosed as ADHD and PTSD. I have had sleeping problems since I hit puberty, it is genetic on my mother's side of the family so I addressed that too.I also have SIBO, small intestine bacteria over-production. I am on a low FODMAP diet, and mostly use aloe vera gel and occasionally use calcium pills to control heartburn. When I started taking these meds I was 20 pounds lighter. My resting blood pressure was 107/70 and my resting heart rate was about 55 to 60.I started smoking again last year, then I injured my right forearm so I stopped working out on top of it all. My blood pressure has steadily climbed. At my last visit to my psychiatric nurse this week my BP was 128/80 and my heart rate was 60 BPM. I asked my nurse if she thought the Ritalin was causing my BP to rise, she said it is the smoking and lack of exercise. I quit smoking tobacco a month ago, and switched to an e-cig, I am down to 3 mg of nicotine, next step is 0. So I am dealing with that. As soon as my arm is 100 %, I will return to the gym too. For the holidays, my wife made a beautiful spread of food I should not have eaten, but I did anyway. On top of that, I did some drinking, vodka, club soda and OJ over the weekend and my heartburn was out of control. It is just starting to subside right now so I have been taking more calcium pills to help control the heartburn. I found an article that said Calcium pills can raise the pH level in your stomach which can cause Ritalin to absorb more into your bloodstream. I found another article that said Minoxidil can cause a racing heart rate because of a sudden decrease in blood pressure. The article said that your heart will race to bring your blood pressure back up, but no data to confirm that hypothesis.I have also got a cold, I have been taking a generic Sudafed 12 hour for a week or so too. I found that the Sudafed I was taking can interact with Ritalin, but again no data to confirm. By the way, it is real Sudafed, not the PE. And for the record, I took some Sudafed this spring and did not notice any problems, but I was 20 lbs lighter and in better shape. There is also a laundry list of problems and drug interactions associated with Seroquel. Did I mix a dangerous concoction of Ritalin, Sudafed, and Calcium pills? I did not take Ritalin, Minoxidil or Sudafed today. I am gonna just deal with the cold and would love someone to weigh in on what could have caused this issue.That is all I have got. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the detailed history. Your three prescription drugs Ritalin, Zoloft, and Seroquel would not have caused the tachycardia and high blood pressure.  There can be two causes of the increased heart rate.  One could be due to Minoxidil as you said but there is very less chance that it will cause such serious side effect. The most likely cause can be severe gastritis that could have happened because of faulty eating and alcohol aggravated it. Severe gastritis causes distress in the body which can cause a rise in blood pressure and tachycardia.  I hope that answers your questions.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Its just because of sex or some hereditary issue","Doctor":"Hi, Hope you & your dear ones are doing fine. I would like to put forth few features / symptoms to differentiate normal from pathological labial hypertrophy/ vaginal wall enlargement. 1. If wall prolapse is painful/ tender, associated with excessive vaginal discharge, especially yellow or greenish color, foul smelling & with itching. If swelling increases after sexual exposure . Around the time of periods discharge increases with all above features. Associated mild feverish feeling around periods, cramps in lower abdomen before periods. All these suggest that it could be infection in vagina , following sexual exposure. You need to meet your gynecologist & use medications for yourself & for your partner. 2. If the lips of vagina are not not tender & free of the above mentioned symptoms, then this could be just hereditary as you mentioned. Then it needs no treatment. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries & for your feedback All the best"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My face has tiny pimples. I could not understand the reason. My skin is oily in nature but seems to be dry in winters sometimes. I can send pictures of my face.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw your clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have Grade-1 acne. Acne is a disorder of pilosebaceous unit - pilo meaning hair, and sebaceous glands meaning oil producing glands. The oil produced from these sebaceous glands is expelled out from the duct out onto the skin. If there is a blockage in the duct, oil accumulates and starts irritating surrounding skin causing comedones (black and whiteheads). For your acne grade, I would suggest you use: Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start using the medicines with their consent. I wish you get rid of this condition soon. Take care. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I am taking SNRI/ SSRI for around 20 years. Five years ago, my general anxiety got worse. So, my doctor switched from Citalopram 10 mg to Escitalopram 10 mg (one per day). Citalopram was taken five years to 10 years ago, before that Zoloft 20 mg per day. Now my GAD is getting worse. A friend of mine had a good experience with Buspirone. Could you explain me the general difference between Escitalopram and Buspirone?","Doctor":"Hello. Buspirone is a different drug than Escitalopram. Escitalopram is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and helps improve serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain. The drug should be taken regularly in order to improve anxiety and depression. Buspirone is also a drug that improves serotonergic neurotransmission but the drug usually helps control anxiety symptoms. The drug should be taken on SOS basis while in some conditions this should be taken regularly. If we consider potency then Escitalopram is more potent than Buspirone. Thanks and take care.

This HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) screening test involves antibody and antigens accurately and detects the majority of those infected at four weeks whereas its sensitivity increases between 99 and 99.9% at six weeks. So most HIV specialists consider the results of this test conclusive at six weeks.

I take no medications except Ativan. I take vitamins. I am a non-smoker, worked in the auto body shop for two years painting cars, quit grain farming at the age of 44, minimal exposure to asbestos. I have been suffering from panic disorder for 56 years. Last winter I got a whiff of hot coals while cleaning my fireplace. Radiation exposure includes two thallium test, two barium enemas, one angiogram. Normal chest X-rays until last spring. Last spring X-ray showed scattered fibrosis. Normal pulmonary function test - FVC liters - Ref 4.11, Pre meas 4.18, Pre % Ref 102 ; FEV1 liters- Ref 2.70 , Pre meas 3.10, Pre % Ref 115; FEV1/FVC % Ref 68, Pre meas 74; FEF 25-75% L/sec Ref 2.40, Pre meas 2.35 , Pre % Ref 98 ; FEV3 Liters Pre meas 3.67; PEF L/sec Ref 7.87, Pre meas 10.63, Pre % Ref 135 . What could be causing the fibrosis?","Doctor":"Hello. Single chest X-ray cannot diagnose lung fibrosis and further tests are required to rule out other causes. As you said, the chest X-ray was normal before a few months and now showing scattered fibrosis. It is advised to repeat the X-ray after few days. Once the X-ray is reported as fibrosis, there is suspicion of a chronic irreversible disease known as IPF that is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. After this, I would like to clarify that having no significant past medical history of any risk factors, it is advisable to rule out common reversible infective causes like TB (tuberculosis) or pneumonia. Radiation exposure, you listed above, is not significant to cause fibrosis of lungs. But it can be a contributing factor. Chest X-ray is not much sensitive to rule out lung fibrosis and the next important investigation advised is HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) scan to rule out IPF or other ILD (immature lung disease). In your case, the advancing age of the patient is the most important risk factor to be the cause of scattered lung fibrosis. Looking at the spirometry, it is absolutely normal which cannot rule out IPF and further tests like DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) with body plethysmography are advised. So in summary, as I said, single chest X-ray cannot diagnose lung fibrosis. Further investigations like HRCT scan, DLCO with body plethysmography and in some cases lung biopsy are must find out the exact cause of lung fibrosis.

My FSH level is low at 0.74 µIU/mL but my LH level is normal at 4.96 µIU/mL. Please help. I have attached photos for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It appears that although your FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) is slightly low your testosterone and other gonadotrophic hormones are normal so it does not make a difference. Usually, the FSH varies depending on the time it is tested. If it bothers you then retest after one to two months. Your gynecomastia could resolve in a year or two naturally as some males do tend to have gynaecomastia in their late teens which normally resolve on its own by 21 to 23 years. Your facial hair shall come gradually as you are a late bloomer that is still having the effects of puberty. Take it easy and let your body take its normal course.

Do rinse her mouth regularly with water after she has taken candies or any food, rinsing mouth thoroughly is a good habit, make her develop this habit. 3.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

Yes, you can take bath with lukewarm water, avoid hot water. Do not use harsh soap or scrub. You can use dove soap. Since it is winter, normal soap will make your skin drier and will irritate the chickenpox blisters. But the best thing will be to have luke warm sponge bath, take clean cotton cloth, dip in luke warm water, use that cloth to wipe your skin gently. This will be helpful during initial days of chicken pox rash, once there is scab formation, you can resume your normal bathing. I am sorry I am not able to view the picture you have attached along with your query. I cannot comment on crowed blisters near your genitals which you have mentioned above as I am not able to see the picture. I would suggest you apply Dermadew caloe lotion.

I had undescended testes from childhood which went untreated (hence I had always been and am on single testis only). The undescended testis still lies in the groin. I used to feel fatigued most of the times over the years, due to which I had difficulty in concentrating, focussing and managing day-to-day tasks. About a year ago, I started on TRT (testosterone replacement therapy). I used injectables (Nebido) for seven months. TRT worked very well for six months and I experienced positive results in various aspects (better focus, better memory, energetic, improved libido, was able to manage my tasks very well). After six months my hemoglobin increased from 16.6 to 18.5 and hematocrit went up from 46 to 54, and my doctor advised to donate blood. At this point, I started feeling fatigued and headache (typical high hemoglobin symptoms). I donated blood for the first time three months ago. However, after donation, I felt less energy and benefits of TRT also started fading away. Within a month, hemoglobin again went up from 16 to 17.6 and hematocrit was at 51. I went through venesection two months ago to bring it down. From then onwards, on the advice of my doctor, I switched from injectables to gel (Testogel). Hemoglobin and hematocrit again went up and I had to undergo another venesection last month. I was also low on Iron (ferritin - 46). So, I started taking a lot of oral iron supplements (ferrous sulfate - 65 mg elemental iron). I took up to eight tablets per day for three to four days. Iron levels improved (ferritin 118 ng/ml), but hemoglobin also shot up to 17.5 (as per recent report).Questions:  What do you think could be the possible reasons for fatigue that I have been facing since last few months? When I started TRT it took six to seven months for hemoglobin to rise from 16.6 to 18.5 while after I gave blood in the first blood donation, hemoglobin rises by similar points in 30 to 45 days only. MCV results confirm that the size of RBC’s is increasing since I am on TRT, it means that the new RBC’s have more iron. However, I have been continuously feeling fatigued before first blood donation till now. My iron stores (ferritin) is still towards low (74) as per latest blood test and I am currently taking iron oral supplements. Do you think that the fatigue symptoms will improve once ferritin comes in the midrange (150 ish)?","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to know as to why you are receiving testosterone replacement therapy. I know that you have mentioned that you have one undescended testis. But many men do not have any problem even when they have a single functional testis. Testosterone replacement therapy is given only when there are both low levels of testosterone in the blood (less than 300 ng/dl) as well as symptoms of low testosterone. Your elevated hemoglobin is a direct result of the increased red cell count due to the effect of testosterone. Testosterone replacement therapy is contraindicated in people with a hematocrit of more than 50. I would suggest that you speak to your doctor and discontinue the testosterone replacement therapy for a few months and increase your ferritin levels to 100. If your symptoms improve, you need to get your treatment plan reviewed. Thank you.

I am currently using Ketoconazole 2 % shampoo.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw your clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, it is looking like tinea but not tinea capitis. It is tinea corporis (corporis - body parts) spreading on to your scalp. There is a round rash with active edges and clear center on your back of neck extending on to your scalp. I mentioned it is \\"looking like\\" because even seborrheic dermatitis also looks similar. Usually, seborrheic dermatitis is seen behind the ear, eyebrows, scalp, and neck sometimes. Scraping from the rash and KOH mount under the microscope is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Seborrheic dermatitis and tinea both are fungal infections but caused by different fungus. Seborrheic dermatitis is severe dandruff involving facial skin and neck in simple words. I would suggest you continue using Ketoconazole shampoo, every day to wash your scalp. Use Miconazole gel, apply over the affected area, over the neck, and behind the ears twice a day for three weeks. This helps for both the fungus.

But as I stopped taking the above medications for four to five days, my mood swings are terrible. My anger is out on everything. I start having doubts about everyone. My psychological problems are improved if I take antidepressants daily without fail. I wonder if I am addicted to the drugs? Or do I have to take other proper drugs to improve my condition? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello If your symptoms are coming back on stopping the medication, it is an indication that you need to continue the treatment. It means you are not fully recovered from your illness. My advice is that you continue the medication as prescribed. This recurrence of symptoms means that you should not stop your medication, it does not mean that you are addicted. Once you have complete relief from your symptoms, your doctor will gradually reduce the doses of medication under supervision. In the meanwhile do not experiment by stopping medication or changing the doses. Relapses are more difficult to treat, and there is always a chance your symptoms will worsen. Take your medication as advised and go for regular follow up. Talk to your treating psychiatrist about any problems you are facing.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The doctor has told him that he has an ulcer and also his hemoglobin is low. He has undergone a capsule video endoscopy and a bone marrow test and all these tests have been normal. He also has reflux of food when he is sleeping. If he walks more, he gets a breathing problem. He is having high BP for which he is using Ramcor-H 2.5 and Stamlo-2.5 tablets. For iron deficiency anemia, the following tests have been performed: Endoscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal CT scan, capsule video endoscopy, and bone marrow. I have attached the reports for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your father's test reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and he has microcytic hypochromic anemia. The most common cause of which is iron deficiency. This could be due to bleeding from duodenal ulcers over a long period of time. I would advise that he take iron and folic acid tablets after food twice daily in addition to existing medications. As for reflux, ask him not to lie down within two hours of eating. When he lies down, he should sleep on his side, preferably the left side and avoid lying down on his back. He should continue his medications as advised. Shortness of breath is experienced by many causes involving the lungs and heart, but in your father's case, it is due to his heart since he has a history of hypertension (high blood pressure). It could also be exaggerated by his iron deficiency anemia. He should incorporate daily walking into his lifestyle to improve this.

Bottom left eyelid and top right eyebrow twitch whenever I blink. It is worrisome. I drink caffeine but I am well rested. I had a negative brain CT scan done last month. I have never had both sides twitch. I have a reasonable amount of anxiety and stress lately. Have had a concussion history but nothing in over a year and have been cleared by many doctors and have had a negative CT scan.","Doctor":"Hello. Even though the eyelid twitches are very commonly associated with stress and they usually go away on their own without any treatment, the involvement of both eyelids could also be an early sign of blepharospasm which requires treatment. If symptoms are getting worse or twitches turn to spasm you must see an ophthalmologist who will evaluate the condition. If treatment is needed, a botox injection does the trick hence do not stress. It is not complicated. For more information consult a general practitioner online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I cannot memorize anything despite learning many times or reciting speech. I find it very difficult to study. I become desperate when I cannot memorize anything. Thi has been present for the last five years. Please help.

Recollection is easy if your retention is proper and flawless. Retention is possible when you are able understand what you read or learn. To understand, you should have concentration. Concentration comes from effective learning techniques based on creative and active learning. Physical exercise, outdoor games, entertainment, socializing coupled with systematic learning improves your memory and mind power. Vegetables, fruits and nuts are perfect for memory. Brain games like Sudoku and jigsaw puzzles help too. Avocados, beetroots, blueberries, broccoli, celery, coconut oil, dark chocolate etc. are good for improving concentration and memory.

At that time I was tensed and also had difficulty while penetrating her vagina. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. It appears you are having a condition called cryptorchidism in which one of the testes is not present in the scrotum. There could be one of the two possibilities, either your testis has not developed at all or it has developed normally but has failed to move into the scrotum. At your age, if your sexual desire is normal and your secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair, pubic hair growth is normal then your testosterone production is normal. Your reproductive ability will depend on the number of sperms produced by your normal testis. I would suggest you visit your local urologist for a complete evaluation and identify the type of cryptorchidism you have.

The replanted finger usually cannot be commented upon until 48 to 72 hours of the procedure. The finger may seem to be normal until then. The common cause of failure includes venous congestion where the finger turns bluish and edematous. As you have mentioned, the finger is having wrinkles and in the photo you sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the color also looks good, so more likely it will survive.

I want to know the reasons, please.","Doctor":"Hello. Usually, girls start menstruating by the age of 15. If there are still no signs of menstruation then it is possible that she might be suffering from congenital gynecological malformation. There could be many reasons for that. It could be due to a thick membrane covering the vagina preventing blood to come out. It could be any other malformation in the outflow tract of the female organs. It could be due to faulty hormones or decreased hormone production or genetic issues. I suggest you visit a gynecologistfor an examination and detailed evaluation to look for the cause.

He is totally refusing to have a sibling. He makes statements like \\"I do not want a brother or a sister. We are a good family like this.\\" He says it is not a good idea to have a baby. He does not want his mother to be fat and have a big tummy. We did not tell him yet that my wife is pregnant. How can we deal with this and would this affect him psychologically?","Doctor":"Hello. What you are describing your child is normal insecurity of the first born child. Whenever there is a second baby expected due to the constant attention which the coming baby gets, the first child gets insecure and feels unsafe as young children have a different mindset. They feel that their parents will be snatched away from him. Also when the second child is born, the elder one craves for more attention from the parents. This is also called as sibling rivalry. You need to ensure your elder child that he will be loved and taken care of as earlier. You need to explain him about his responsibilities about the second child that he is also responsible to take care of the younger child. When you make your child responsible with affection, this fear will slowly go away.

Well, for your knowledge color blindness and color deficiency are two different things. You gain color vision due to cone cells in your retina. True color blinds see only black and white. They have no cones or have only blue cones. This is rare and they do not have 20/20 vision they nearly have 20/200. Most others are color deficient people; however, it is erroneously used as a color blind. They have either two types of cones including the blue and all three types of cones. They see the world colored but they have issues with color discrimination. They can have 20/20 vision.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am a virgin, not on any medications and I started my period about two years back. My period has been coming nearly exactly every two weeks without fail since about a year ago. At the beginning, it was all over the place (which is to be expected), but it started evening out after a few months. It very occasionally comes slightly later. I also experience quite bad cramps (but nothing that a 15 ml dose of Nurofen cannot alleviate) along with my heavy flow. Could there be an underlying condition? Endometriosis or similar? Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? Let me start by saying that you are absolutely fine. It is a human tendency to expect a big condition when it is actually a simple one. We should always think of the common conditions first. You are having immature hormone cycles and spasmodic dysmenorrhea. Let me explain. You have started periods at the right time. But, even though you have periods, the hormonal balance between brain, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland - ovaries are fully matured by 19 to 21 years only. Once this axis is fully mature, the hypothalamus produces hormones at the right time, makes pituitary to produce hormones in the right amount and which in turn gets the right level of hormones from ovaries and ovulation occurs on the right time. Now in few cycles, you do not ovulate. That is when you miss periods or you only have a discharge pink or red color. Or else you have no proper periods and the thickness inside the uterus, the endometrium keeps increasing and finally when it tries to come out of the narrow cervical canal, you get severe lower abdominal cramps. You will have the pain only till that clump of blood falls out.  The normal frequency of periods will be 28 days plus or minus seven days, bleeding for approximately five to seven days. Ovulation will be around 13th to 15th day. Do not worry. At this young age, you cannot expect big conditions. I cannot say you will not have endometriosis, but chances are very very remote. If you are fine with the medications for pain, you can go ahead with that. Over time, everything will be fine. I am sure. Hope I have cleared your query. All the best.

These changes are usually seen in people with underlying diabetes and hypertension and represent longstanding nature of two conditions.

At that time, my vision in the right eye was hand movements only and I was diagnosed with a macular injury. Three months later, my vision slowly improved to 6/36. However, my right eye started to deviate (exotropia) and I started experiencing diplopia. My main problem is diplopia. I have used prisms, but of no use. When I try to focus on an image, I have severe diplopia. The diplopia disappears when I try to correct the squint. At present, I am doing higher studies and the diplopia is really bothering me. Will doing a squint surgery be of any use? Is there anything that I can try?","Doctor":"Hello. Diplopia is occurring definitely due to squinting because, in this, the image which is formed will be defocussed. It has occurred secondary to the trauma. The only remedy is to correct it by surgery. If it would have been due to other causes which were intrinsic to the eye then the chances would have been to correct by glasses. But still, I would suggest you get to check whether the diplopia is due to the squint only and even after surgery your vision will not recover however the diplopia can be relieved.

The test to be done is the high vaginal swab culture test (HVS) which can help isolate the causative organism and then the treatment should be directed towards the cause.

The time that this lasted for, I would say was anywhere from three to three and a half hours. This is far longer than I have ever masturbated before by a substantial amount, and when I finally allowed myself to climax I noticed that I had some pain in my penis and it was still kind of swollen. Initially, this did not disturb me, but then the swollenness did not go down immediately and only after about an hour or so did it finally subside. I had taken some Ibuprofen immediately when I noticed it may have had inflammation. And I just figured that it would go away overnight, but it did not. I have now had pain in my penis on and off for the past two weeks since the incident and it is really starting to concern me. I know there are certain things that can happen. And Peyronie's came to my mind. As of now, if and when I get an erection, it seems like my penis is bent to the side slightly. I guess my biggest concern is if it was the beginning of Peyronie's, would it develop slowly as the scar tissue developed, or would the bend be more abrupt? I currently do not have health insurance as I have not needed to go to a doctor for years, and I do not know what to do at this point. I have pictures showing the bend and also what seems to be some sort of bump or vein on my shaft that was not there before.","Doctor":"Hello. Had you taken any erection enhancing drug so that your erection lasted long? It should not be left erect for hours, like four hours and more. The image shared (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is an acceptable shape of the penis. I do not think you should be concerned about Peyronie's disease. Veins or slight swelling seen are also normal. For more information consult a urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am in my periods, but this is the first time I am facing this problem. It is my third and fourth day. I am not bleeding much, just a little. Is it a matter of concern?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? From you short history, the only significant finding is your weight. A minimum of 14 kg/m2 of BMI is needed to have periods. The normal fat in the body is gradually converted to hormones and further support the growth of the follicles, the uterus and the inner lining of the uterus which later bleeds. But when this hormonal support is low, the periods may come, but the inner lining may not develop as required and the bleeding noted is very scanty or may not come at all. To substantiate my theory, the hormone I am mentioning is the estrogen (female hormone). It is needed for the female body shape, breast, waist size, and contour. With such a low BMI and hormones, these areas will be poorly developed. This is not a thing to worry about. Do get your thyroid profile and serum prolactin done any of these days on an empty stomach at 6 to 9 AM. If abnormal, get it corrected. Do not start eating too much to put on weight. Just have lots of nutritious, protein-rich, fruits and vegetables, and avoid fatty food. Hope I have clarified your query.

Pain while putting finger can be due to mild edema of the external ear canal due to injury. Since you do not have any symptoms suggestive of middle ear involvement, I do not think you will have any problem in the future. But to be on the safer side you please take anti-inflammatory enzymes like Trypsin and Chymotrypsin for three days which will reduce any inflammation present. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines.

As, the reason for poor erection is psychological, the best way to cope with this is to take rest for a few days and spend a lot of time in foreplay. More and more foreplay would make hard erection and you will be able to penetrate. You will not lose the potency in the future and so no need to worry. With time, the symptoms would improve. For building up the confidence again and for hard erection, I suggest tablet Tadalafil or Sildenafil as and when required about half to one hour before intercourse. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. This will make strong erection and will increase your confidence. You can reduce the drug once your erection becomes better. Herbal medicines like Tentex Forte or Confido can help to increase the power if used on a regular basis for about 8 to 12 weeks. Take two tablets each twice a day. For further information consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 2-year-old son has hard motions. He has just had his circumcision surgery. My friends advised me to apply Lignocaine Hydrochloride gel between his buttocks. By mistake, I applied more. I am very much worried. I hope it is not harmful. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Lignocaine (Lidocaine Topical) gel is a local anesthetic so even if you have applied more there is nothing to worry. If he is having constipation, I suggest you give him syrup Looz (Lactulose) 10 mL twice daily. This is a stool softener and you can give him until his stools become soft. You can stop it after four to five days. For more information consult a paediatrician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My brother is a myasthenia gravis patient. He had undergone thymectomy four years back. Since then he is continuously taking Azoran 50, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Surgeons are not able to suggest him for reducing the amount of drugs. Available neurologists also do not have any experience with this rare disease. Please, suggest whether he can stop taking these medicines for rest of his life. If not, can it be reduced to one or two a day? Currently, he is taking three tablets a day. Occasionally, he reduced drugs because of some reason, and did not feel any physiological changes in his body. If he takes this drug for his whole life then will it cause any side effect? Moreover, any suggestion related to lifestyle or food is welcome. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. We are here to help you.

I got married in before 10 years and it is a love cum arranged marriage. My wife is also working with me. When I was in grade 3, I got introduced to sex by a male teacher. I used to go for tuition and he used me for homosexual. Almost for a year, I was abused by him. From that time I got interest towards sex, especially oral sex. Then, that teacher got transferred to a different school. I could not control the sexual urges, so I use to masturbate from those days when I am alone. But it never stopped me from concentrating on studies. Again, I got a homosexual relation with one of my male friends in grade 8. That relation went on for around six months. Later on during my UG, I got another male friend and had a homosexual relationship for around two years. It will not be very frequent. But, like monthly once or twice. I got the habit of smoking and drinking in my PG days. When I am alone and feel the urge, I used to masturbate. I got a job and I got a chance to stay alone. I used to visit sex workers, but not frequently. I never liked to be in relation with different people. Instead, I like to stick with one girl who understand my feelings and co-operate. I got such a girl, she also a sex worker but she was not like money minded. She got some feeling towards me and gave me good moments in my life. This relation was there for around two years. At the same time, I worked hard and I got many promotions and salary increments.I met a girl in my office, who was brought up by her widow mom. She is not aware of many things, which the same age girls would know. I did not have any wrong intention towards her initially. One thing I like to mention here is that I never showed the other side of me to anyone. People still believe me, I am very good and loyal person. I got attracted towards the girl and we both started loving each other. Love was gentle and tender. She never used to come out with me. She is very scared to roam outside with a male. We got married. But, from the day one, she never used to show interest towards sex. She says sex is not the thing to enjoy and it is a sin. She also will not show any response towards sex. It is making me go crazy at times and I shouted at her. She will only cry and never change her attitude. As these continued, to control my urges I started again with masturbation, watching porn, etc., when I am alone. This was fine for these many days. Nowadays, masturbation is not giving the satisfaction to me. I am in a position like, I need a sex partner, who enjoys sex with me. I am not interested to have sex with multiple people. But, with a single person, who also enjoys sex like me. Another thing I like to mention was, we do not have a child yet. My wife got TB before marriage and her fallopian tubes were blocked. We went for years of treatment and no success. My wife did not show interest towards treatment much and we stopped it after two years. As she cannot bear a child for me and cannot sexually satisfy me, she is asking me to marry another girl. My situation is like I cannot cope up with her and proceed further in life due to unfulfilled urges and at the same time I cannot able to accept her offer and divorce her. If I leave her she will be left alone in her life. She is a good girl otherwise like she takes care of me when I fall ill, she prepares good food and when my parents use to visit us she will take care of them well. Now, every night is hell for me. It started taking me to the path of depression. I tried meditation, yoga, studying self-help books, etc. All worked for a short time only. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Although there are many things to intervene one thing requires immediate attention, which is mismatched sexual interest. There are prevalent myths about sex and sexuality that make it difficult for them to engage in healthy sexual relationship. I think your wife can be helped with proper sex education and counseling and further she can be encouraged to initiate a relationship with you. I understand her point to encourage you with a second marriage, but rather than opting for it you can see a marriage counselor. In my opinion, much can be helped with proper counseling in regard to regular sex and bearing children. Regarding your problem, I do not think it is abnormal. As a young person your desires should be respected and fulfilled in a judicial manner. Personally, I feel that yoga, meditation and other measures are good for you. But, it is not going to help the other person. In addition, no treatment can change the normal process of anybody and do not think you should suppress the normal desires and urges.

Now, that has gone down but there seems to be a bump inside my lower cheek where the gums meet the cheek. It seems thick or hard, not really moveable and more on the inside of the cheek rather than gum. I cannot see it but I can feel it with my tongue. I drink on the weekends and have used tobacco pounds for the past four years or so on average twice a day. The lump is tender, not really painful and not visible.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms that you have described are most common to an infection-related swelling associated with a cavitated tooth. This can be easily diagnosed by a clinical examination (you can check by yourself or send a picture) followed by an X-ray (IOPA). If however, there is no evident cause related to the tooth, it could also have originated in the gums (could be due to food lodgement or an acute manifestation of chronic periodontitis). In that case, you must get an OPG (orthopantomogram) X-ray done. For more information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 29-year-old male, working in IT firm. From my childhood, I am very soft and gentle. When I was 12, I fell in love with a girl. But, she changed schools. So, when I was 15, I started having sex with boys. After she left, I felt love towards boys and was sexually attracted to boys. I do not feel anything even if I see a girl in nude. I used to masturbate twice a week, by thinking about males. If I see a girl's nude picture I am not feeling anything. I am not a smoker or drinker. So, I think I am gay, but I do not want to be a gay. I want a straight man's life. I wanna be a manly man. I should feel sexually attracted to girls. Help me take a good path in life.","Doctor":"Hello. I completely understand that you feel concerned about your altered sexual preferences. It is generally due to past negative experiences in life as you mentioned about the early sexual interactions with the same gender partners. Since your first early interactions were with the same gender, it usually becomes a habit or the sexual preference/ orientation. Are you currently engaged in homosexual activities? It becomes difficult to alter your sexual preference if you are engaged in sexual activities with the same sex. Since you are highly motivated to make changes in your sexual preferences, it is the first step towards betterment. Intentionally involve yourself in activities which would help you find interest in opposite gender. For example, Intentionally avoid sexual interaction with the same gender so that your sexual needs find satisfaction with the opposite gender. You may feel disturbed as you do it. Learn to deal with your emotions and state of mind. Suggest positive affirmations for you at the time of disturbance such as I am doing it because I want a straight man's life, I choose to be sexually attracted towards girls, and I like to be a heterosexual (opposite sex) partner. These are instances from what you have already mentioned. Find more positive affirmations for you which will help you become what you want. Make these affirmations a routine in your self-talk. Practicing it daily will gradually make it automatic in your mind, and your brain will start working on the way you want it to be. I hope this is helpful for you. Best Regards.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The probable diagnosis is pericoronitis. As per your symptoms, the sore bump behind the last molar tooth can be either due to an abscess formation that can be due to an injury or it can be due to an erupting wisdom tooth that might be putting pressure over the gums. Another cause can be inflammation of the gum flap in that area caused due to food accumulation between the gum flap and the wisdom tooth. For confirmation, a clinical examination and an X-ray is needed. I suggest antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate) and anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen can help. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Application of numbing gel containing Lignocaine (Lidocaine Topical) over the bump will also help. Warm saline gargle and an antiseptic mouthwash gargle can also be used. You need to avoid hard foods to prevent irritation of the area, keep the area clean, and maintain meticulous oral hygiene.

I am really scared. Please help. She is not a virgin. But she has not had sex before me in a year or so.","Doctor":"Hello. She is fine. Implanon is a very effective method and the failure rate is almost zero. Also, you have used condoms too, so why worry? Usually, the hormone levels of Implanon create thick brownish or maroon secretions from the cervical canal and some do come out of the uterine cavity. Both of these are normal. They cannot be stopped or treated. If the bleeding was because of the direct injury to the vagina as you felt, the blood would have been bright red blood.

I would suggest you to repeat urine culture and drug sensitivity to determine the bacteria causing infection and the antibiotic to which it is sensitive. Few bacteria which cause urinary infection in women develop resistance very easily and become difficult to treat.

How do you recommend I get rid of them? Should I consult my dentist? Should I continue using my whitening pen? Of note, I am currently on Guanfacine.","Doctor":"Hello. As per your symptoms, the white spots on the teeth are due to hypocalcified areas that are areas of poor mineralization. Bleaching makes them more pronounced and they can further stand out on the teeth. It is not an allergic reaction but this has happened due to a more clear appearance of hypocalcified areas.

It is always a good idea to be sure. Paxil (Paroxetine) is a respected and very effective SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and commonly used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, etc. Unlike Ativan (Lorazepam), it is not habit forming (addictive) and does not typically lose effectiveness over time due to the body 'getting used' to the substance. It does take four to eight weeks to start working and may feel like it is worsening your symptoms (anxiety) initially, but that will go away and most patients derive a lot of benefit from it.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Every individual has a unique ABO and Rh blood group. It remains same throughout the life.

He was taken to a hospital and after tests and preliminary medications, he has been advised to do PTCA to RCA. His age is 51 years old. He has a diabetic history. The reports have been enclosed. Kindly suggest whether he requires angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). He had heart attack. There are significant blockages. The medicine he is receiving is fine and should be continued until bypass surgery. Regarding, bypass or angioplasty. Immediately after the attack, say within 24 hours, if you do angioplasty, then it is beneficial for the patient as it can be done on an urgent basis, and shorter the time interval between attack and either procedure, more is the benefit. This benefit is for 24 to 48 hours. But at this stage, since this crucial time period has already passed, there is no urgency. He should undergo bypass surgery as he is having too many blockages and stenting will not be possible at all these places. So, discuss with the cardiac surgeon regarding bypass. It should be done as early as possible for best results. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

I need to know some more information regarding the symptom like: has it followed some kind of stress, dehydration, prolonged standing especially in hot weather, panic, fear or pain? Because it is common for fainting to follow all these events, and it is called as vasovagal syncope or fainting. However, if not, then we need to rule out cardiac cause like arrhythmias, as it may cause these episodes due to decreased blood supply to the brain, mostly due to abnormalities in the heart rate. Did you have any palpitations, just prior to episodes? You should get one ECG (electrocardiography) done and if not informative then, you will need Holter monitoring done. If possible, try to get an ECG done or at least measure your pulse rate during the episode. Also, get your blood pressure checked once. In treatment, it is important you protect yourself during the episodes. You should quickly get to a safe place and lie down or sit for a few minutes. Have some fluids after that. Increase your fluid intake in general, avoid dehydration, prolonged fasting, and smoking, alcohol or drugs, if any. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

I was diagnosed 15 years ago with fibro/CFIDS, and very low thyroid, which they cannot get regulated for some reason. The fatigue and brain fog have been unbearable. Then came the IBS, severe pain and diarrhea after every meal, low magnesium, and vitamin D levels. Then, five months ago, I developed a severe pain in my wrist, throbbing, piercing pain that never leaves and I cannot use my arm at all. I had an MRI of my wrist and it showed 'severe edema and erosion of the bones, most likely due to an autoimmune disease as RA.' On some days I cannot get out of bed and those days that I do, I am not able to do anything productive. My orthopedic specialist referred me to a rheumatologist but they cannot see me for six months.

I would like to describe the series of events to you and need your advice as I have been most disturbed post this event in my life. It has been eight months since my first ever sexual encounter, but I am still tensed and lost. I am too scared to get a blood test done for hepatitis B as I fear the worst. It was a protected sex with a CSW for a less than half a minute. Four months later, I had a heavy meal at a local restaurant. I also had a strong beer. Later, I felt heavy, bloated and fullness in the stomach. Note: I have always had this gastric problem coming and going as my lifestyle is that of a software engineer with no physical activity. I had mucus in my stools, and it increased slightly in the next few days. There was no loose motion. But, I use to pass gas and stools both at a time, and I saw the stool very closely. It had a little pink spot. I think it was blood and panicked. I also started to have pains and cramps in both sides of the stomach, in the hip region and sometimes in the center of the stomach. Then again, a few days later I had stomach bloating because I had skipped meals as I was not hungry. This worsened the trouble, but I had more beer and smoked a lot and had vomiting sensation. The stools were loose, and I saw a light red tinge in it. I was sure it was blood. Again, I had a pain in the side of the stomach and at the center and below the right rib. I had a burning sensation in the anus. I then consulted my general physician and told him all these. He told me that I had IBS and gave me Pre Pro IBS for six days and then I was taking it, and mucus stopped, and stools also were hard. Four days later, I had the same symptoms, and he advised me to take Taxim OZ twice a day for five days with Pre Pro IBS tablets as I had some infection. He also advised me to take liver function test and abdominal scan. Two weeks after that, I took the liver function tests, and I have attached the reports of the same. Last week, I took the abdomen scan, and it was normal with just fatty liver observation. From the past few months, the pain and cramps have reduced. Some days back, I again started to feel pains below my ribs on the right side now and then. Also two weeks back, I was around 79.3 kg, but now when I checked, I was only 78. Is it because of hepatitis B as I have read online that it causes weight loss. Even my stool color keeps changing from yellow to pale, and also the texture keeps varying. I keep reading and always check hepatitis B symptoms on the internet, and I am very disturbed and unable to focus on my work. I am losing my mind. Please help me relax and alleviate my anxiety. As it has been eight months after the exposure, should I stop worrying? When do people get symptoms for hepatitis B infection?","Doctor":"Hello.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The only difference is not many people talk about vaginismus. Not able to have sex can be emotionally exhausting and mentally disturbing but the good thing is that it is a completely curable condition. Treatment involves a combination of couple counseling, and pelvic floor physiotherapy which consists of a thorough pelvic floor examination along with complete objective history by certified pelvic floor physiotherapist following with some relaxation exercises (also called myofascial release) either with direct interaction or using vaginal dilators. Physiotherapy increases the chances of success up to 98%. Patients mostly do not even need medication to treat this condition. Anxiety-relieving medicine may be prescribed for some, but only if required. The primary treatment methods involve understanding the vagina and exploring it and slowly desensitizing it using vaginal dilators under the guidance of pelvic PT. For partners of vaginismus patients, wise advice would be to be more supportive, communicative, and sensitive. One’s rock-solid support to their partner is crucial for the chance of a complete cure. Intimacy is important but there are many ways to express your love. Pleasure is not the result of just one move, take out the time to research, and learn about each other’s bodies.

I think the bruise you mentioned could be because of any bony injury or just soft tissue injury. But it would be worth to get an x-ray of the hand to rule out a fracture. The mechanism of injury you mentioned might cause something called boxers fracture (fifth metacarpal fracture). If x-ray comes out clear then you would just need to ice your hand and keep it elevated when you go to sleep by using a pillow. Also, use regular pain killers. If it is broken then it needs to be looked at by a hand surgeon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Always need to be confirmed whether we are treating the cause as there are many ailments that need to be ruled out for an unintentional weight loss. Treatment includes a single dose of tablet Albendazole 400 mg to be taken by all the family members once irrespective of symptoms at once. If she has severe itching apply lotion Caladryl in and around itchy areas. Now the most important aspect, prevention: 1.

First, you have to know whether there is any organic abnormality like parietal lobe lesions in your brain affecting the visual pathway. I think you should undergo full visual assessments including visual acuity, visual field, color vision and also neuroimaging to look at the brain and visual pathway. Do you have other abnormal sensations like hearing voices and abnormal smell sensations? If there is no organic abnormality, some people have synesthesia where they can hear sounds and smells due to various functional brain abnormalities and you need functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).

I have gone through your query and attachment. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I can understand your concern. This bump on the inner side of your lips is called aphthous ulcers (simple mouth ulcers). So many factors can cause ulcers in the mouth. It could be because of vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes, psychological stress, allergies, accidental injury during brushing, by food poking or bacterial infection. This may take a week to resolve. This is absolutely normal. 1. Avoid hot and spicy foods until the ulcer heals. 2. Do warm saline mouth rinses thrice daily. 3. Rinse mouth after every meal. 4. If required, if it hurts, a topical anesthetic like Dologel or Hexigel can be applied over the ulcer with a clean finger. Maintaining good oral hygiene and following the above said instructions will prevent further infection of the ulcer and promotes faster healing. Chapped lips occur when 1. Our body becomes highly dehydrated. 2. We are exposed to long term cold weather or air-conditioned environment and direct sun. 3. Constant lip licking/wetting habit (which makes our lips even drier). 4. Mouth breathing habit. (if constant nose blocks occur). This can be taken care of by following simple tips at home. 1. Drink lots of water and keep yourself hydrated at all times. 2. Use honey or sugar to exfoliate the dried skin over the lips. Applying lip protection creams over dried and flaky skin will have no effect. So rub those over the lips to remove dried flakes of skin and then apply lip protection creams for best results. 3. You can apply coconut oil over the lips for faster healing. 4. If present, it is best to break the lip licking and mouth breathing habit.

When I was 18 I went to the doctor and they said I was leaking high amounts of protein. Also, I had some bacteria showing up in my urine so she gave me medicine for that which I had to stop taking before the dosage was out because I reacted badly to it. Then she sent me to a kidney doctor who ran a bunch of tests and found nothing wrong. He said I might have autoimmune deficiency and they might have to do a biopsy it scared me and I never went back. Six years later and I feel perfectly fine no frequent urinating or none of the symptoms I looked up. I was always been in shape even though I do not eat healthily. I was wondering after all these years should I be concerned about my kidneys? I do not want to have kidney failure also my mom has the condition sarcoidosis which I know causes protein and a bunch of other stuff to happen.","Doctor":"Hello. Going by the history given by you, it seems that you had proteinuria (that is protein leaking in the urine due to some defect in kidneys). There are multiple conditions which can lead to proteinuria. The treatment varies depending upon the cause which can be established by kidney biopsy. There are a few causes which can resolve spontaneously which most probably happened in your case. Still, I would advise doing a kidney function test (urea, creatinine), urine routine, urine protein creatinine ratio (spot). If these investigations show any abnormality we should proceed with a kidney biopsy to guide further management. Also, please check your blood pressure as well."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This rise in creatinine levels is usually related to a kidney dysfunction. For this reason, I suggest performing further tests to investigate your kidney function like creatinine clearance, a urine analysis, urine microalbuminuria and consult with a nephrologist. It is also necessary performing a urinary tract ultrasound. Chronic hyperuricemia can lead to chronic damage to the kidneys.

Try to train your bladder to pass urine on regular time meaning you can void bladder after two hours and try to control the urge of urine till the time you can hold. Do not take too many liquids after 6 p.m. Avoid alcoholic beverages and caffeinated drinks. Intake of sesame seeds with jaggery thrice a day controls frequent urination.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity). Resting ECG and echo showed no abnormalities, and stress test does not show any abnormalities, although could not be completed. So, we cannot be certain that this is not cardiac pain, but appears to be less likely. So you should undergo further testing with either pharmacological stress test or CT (computed tomography) coronary angiography. Now normal BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) level is against cardiac cause for shortness of breath. Your thyroid shows significant abnormalities, you need to be on thyroid supplements like Eltroxin and should begin as soon as possible. Now do you get this chest heaviness at rest or on exertion? If this heaviness occurs at rest only then possibility of other causes like acid reflux should also be considered especially if you have other symptoms. You should try antacid then. If heaviness classically occurs on exertion and relieves with rest then strongly suggest cardiac cause only and then should undergo further cardiac resting. So possibility of non-cardiac cause should also be suspected, however, should undergo further cardiac evaluation.

My work is staying open during the COVID-19 pandemic and are wanting to know what employees will work. I feel like if I say I don’t want to work they may hold it against me in the future. It is Family Video so people are constantly coming in and out and touching things. My county just had their second confirmed case and the patient was around many people during the time before she was diagnosed, therefore going to spread quickly. Does having a pulmonary stenosis put me at a greater risk or is it safe for me to wait out the situation and work in the meantime? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the Icliniq Following is my opinion for your asked question Pulmonary stenosis puts you at higher risk for complicated Covid infection. So if you get covid infection than course might be aggressive in you. Your country as mentioned not reach at stage where complete lockdown needed. However it's good if you can avoid contact with other individual and if you can stay at home with your family. Surface contact, hand shaking, kissing all can also favour spread of covid. So avoid close contact and use frequent hand sanitizer. Hope I have answered your question Let me know if I can assist you further Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Meniere disease which is associated with increased pressure inside the ear. So if you have any hearing loss or tunning sound in the ears, kindly let me know.

The doctor has advised taking Menactra vaccine (Sanofi). Though this vaccine is not listed in IAP compulsory immunization schudule, is it necessary to take this? What are its side effects?","Doctor":"Hello. Menactra Vaccine (Meningococcal Vaccine (Group A, C, Y, and W-135)) is given to prevent meningococcal disease. It is not mentioned in IAP (Indian Academy of Pediatrics) compulsory immunization schedule. But in some places where meningococcus is prevalent, this vaccine is generally advised to be administered. This vaccine has some side effects like low fever, redness or pain at the site of vaccine injection and irritability. But these are very mild in nature and can occur with other vaccines also. In my opinion, it would be better if you give the vaccine to the child because meningococcal is a fatal disease and management is very difficult if the disease occurs in a child.

It all started after I lifted a stone at a cricket ground. A little amount of physiotherapy helped after the doctor's advice. I have consulted three doctors in two years and a doctor advised MRI this week. My doctor is out until next week and I am very anxious to understand the MRI report. Kindly help me understand the report.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is showing herniation of an intervertebral disc that is displaced from its position and impinging in the nerve.  However, this is only an MRI impression. MRI is a sensitive investigation that picks up clinically insignificant findings so it is important to get clinically examined and see if these findings reported by MRI are actually the reason for pain or not. Secondly, whether the condition requires surgical management or will it be treated by conservative treatment alone.

It feels like a tight constricting pain. I took Asprin three hours ago. The pain comes and goes occasionally and it goes to the left shoulder. It feels very localised. So, I am putting pressure on the spot where pain the is. It feels like it is between the ribs. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Does this increase in deep breathing? How long does it persist? Is it for a few seconds or minutes? Sharp pain and short-lived pain is less likely to be a cardiac pain. Cardiac pain is usually retrosternal, persistent, increases on exertion and relieves with rest, associated sweating, and uneasiness. Are there any risk factors for cardiac diseases like hypertension, family history or smoking? I think the possibilities in you are reflux disease, musculoskeletal pain, pleuritic chest pain which is the pain from linings of the lungs. Musculoskeletal pain increases if you press hard at the site of pain, while pleuritic pain increases on deep breathing or coughing.

Now that I went to my doctor she told me not to get pregnant since my rubella IgG tests came out to be reactive. In the first TORCH test, my rubella IgG value was 65.1. In the second TORCH test, my rubella IgG value was 277. I did the second TORCH test after 16 months. My doctor said that getting pregnant would be risky. Also, there is a higher chance of miscarriage. Can you please give me your suggestion? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Do not worry. With recurrent miscarriage, you do not require to go for TORCH test as it is responsible for sporadic losses and not a recurrent one. Have you been immunized against rubella in childhood by receiving MMR at 16 to 18 months? The levels of 277 suggest that you are immune and to know whether you had a recent infection or not then avidity testing is done for that. Please state at what period of pregnancy you had an abortion and what test and medication have been given so far. Few important tests should be done to know the cause of recurrent miscarriage. Is there any family or past history of thrombosis in the family? We need to rule out congenital or acquired thrombophilias.

I used condoms and after sex, I washed my penis with plain water and not with soap. I rinsed my mouth with plain water, I did not brush. After four hours, I washed my penis with Dettol hand wash. After that, I took a bath tonight. I am worried now. Will this cause me any harm? Should I undergo any test? Kindly let me know.","Doctor":"Hello. I do not see anything to be worried here unless there are some symptoms you or your partner are experiencing. It is too early to have symptoms. I am not sure if you are worried about sexually transmitted infections. If so, you have used a condom while having intercourse, hence less likely to acquire infections. Do not use Dettol hand wash for cleaning your genitals. Never ever. It might cause irritant dermatitis. If you know your partner very well, if she is free of sexually transmitted infections, then there is nothing to worry. Ask her if she has any concerns regarding this. The great thing is that you used a condom. So, there is nothing to worry, provided there was no condom break during the act of intercourse. Any infection would take at least five days to manifest symptoms, which I really hope you have not got. In case of any ulcer, pain, pus from urethra, you can get back to icliniq or consult your nearby dermatologist. Wish you a healthy skin and healthy life.

For cholestasis of pregnancy, the serum bile acid test and LFT (liver function test) are to be done once weekly or fortnightly depending on the severity. You should consult a liver specialist or gastroenterologist. This condition might affect the growth and liquor (water level) around the baby.

If the scratch did not break the skin, if there was no bleeding and if the attack was provoked, a single TT shot would suffice. Although do keep the area in check for any bacterial infection that might follow. However, if the animal in question was acting strangely or if the attack was unprovoked or if the scratches are on the face or hand and caused bleeding, you may need to get a course of rabies vaccine, to be on the safe side. Since it is a pet, it may have been vaccinated against rabies, in which case there is nothing to worry. Please check with the owner about the immunization status of the pet and its health condition and act accordingly.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Just wondering what your thoughts on multigrain Cheerios are and if they are truly a healthier option.","Doctor":"Hello. When it comes to the content of sugar or high fructose corn syrup or chemicals, multigrain cheerios has it in the same amount as the normal one. Another good habit to follow is to eat one grain in a meal. For example, You should not be eating rice and wheat together in one meal. So multigrain is never the best option.

Your tests are conclusive. Most of the HIV infected will have a positive test by three to four weeks. Since you have negative tests even after eight weeks, therefore it is reliable.

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have used a smokeless tobacco called Swedish Snus for going on four years now, always in the same spot. My gums have severely receded in this area. I am otherwise healthy. I recently made an appointment with a periodontist but I am terrified I may have gum cancer. I noticed about a week after I quit putting smokeless tobacco in this area the gums became extremely sore, and are still sore two weeks later. I do not see any lesions in this area of my mouth, but the gums look 'pickled' is the best way I can put it. I do not know if the soreness I am feeling is from the gum tissue or exposed roots in that area of my mouth.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the images posted (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have to change your brushing technique as soon as possible. Brush in an up and down motion without putting too much pressure on the teeth and gums. The recession is definitely not any type of cancer. It seems to be a side effect of intense to and fro brushing. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush. You can consult a periodontist to find out ways to regenerate or surgically stitch back the gums to its old position.

Now my left ear feels blocked or something. It is the same feeling as having water inside. It was painful at first (especially when I burp) but got better after a day. The pain is almost gone now but the blocked/ fullness feeling is still there. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Avoid water entering the said ear while bathing or swimming. We need to make sure there is no perforation of the drum. For the same, you must visit an ENT surgeon who can look into the ear through an otoscope. You can take an antihistaminic tablet to reduce fullness. It will help if the fullness is due to eustachian tube dysfunction caused due to pressure changes by suctioning.

Your father seems to be on the right kind of medication. His blood sugar levels are not controlled, so he definitely requires a revision of prescription. Since he is having other coexisting medical conditions, it would not be a good idea to take an online prescription.

Will fertilization of this type of sperm result in a child with de novo single gene disorder with the sole reason being lesser oxygen, nutrients, and hormones being supplied to the testes?","Doctor":"Hello. What you have mentioned is correct. However, since the paternal DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is normal, the mutation will be affecting a single sperm or those derived from a single germ cell in the case of single gene mutations.

My previous psychiatric nurse practitioner tried me on many antidepressants that did not work. Lexapro helps some but not much at all. I have very bad anxiety and low mood with irritability. Is there another antidepressant I can take with Adderall (as it interacts with so many). Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. It looks like you have been tried on several different types of antidepressants already but did not help. Since you are on Adderall for treating narcolepsy, taking antidepressants will potentially lead to an increase in side effects. This applies to all SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) type of antidepressants. So you will need regular follow up by your prescribing doctor to monitor your response to the medication combination. Since you are saying Lexapro (Escitalopram) helps to an extent, it will be worth trying to continue it and have additional psychological therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) to manage anxiety and depression. If Lexapro is not effective at all, there are other options like Sertraline and Fluoxetine but they belong to the same class of medicines (SSRIs). Risk of potential interaction applies to these medications as well. Also, ensure that narcolepsy is optimally controlled. It will help to improve your mood and help you to function better. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

Tinea cruris is commonly caused by a type of fungus called dermatophytes. It causes mostly circular growth on the skin and often looks like rings. It is also referred as ringworms. Generally, it grows in unhygienic and wet areas.  Antifungal management is the line of treatment. I suggest you apply Onabet cream (Sertaconazole Topical) externally twice a day after cleaning and drying the affected area. Along with these medications, you can also use an ayurvedic ointment like Cutis cream, Six C Ointment externally. I suggest you can take Khadirarishta 15 mL twice a day with equal amounts of water after meals and Gandhaka Rasayana Vati two tablets twice a day after meals.

You can apply any one of the antibiotic creams. Also, start Opexa Gel (Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Topical and Dimethicone Topical) from the third day. Apply it to the affected areas and leave it overnight to prevent scarring. He may require oral antibiotics. It is better to consult a dermatologist.

Now, I am worried and regretting my decision of not taking the pill as my period has not started and I am scared to be pregnant. I am not getting any specific symptom related to my periods. I am just feeling a bit dizzy. I have done a beta hCG test today. Please check the report. Please tell me what to do next?","Doctor":"Hello. I do not see any reason for you to worry. Usually, the ovulation occurs between the 13th and 16th day of periods. Life of the egg is 24 hours and that of the sperm is 72 hours. So there is no chance of the egg being available for three days and sperm will not survive until next ovulation. Your beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels show that there is no pregnancy. This test detects the smallest of pregnancy anywhere in the body. Pregnancy is not the only reason for missing your periods. There may be other reasons: Whatever be the reason to have periods, I suggest you have tablet Novelon (Ethinyl Estradiol and Desogestrel) or Ovral-G (Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol) or Dear 21 (Ethinyl Estradiol and Levonorgestrel) or Duoluton L (Ethinyl Estradiol and Levonorgestrel) or Intimacy plus 3 (Desogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol) one tablet twice a day for 10 days.

But now all of a sudden the density of my hair has reduced drastically. I cannot touch my hair anymore because if I do, they will start falling out. I did have a severe cold fever one or two months back. It was a different kind of illness with severe head pain and food tasting bitter for at least 10 days. Also, I have not properly washed my hair in the past four months. During that time, I could feel many scabs on my scalp. I think this may have been related to that. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Kindly attach an image to know the severity of your problem. It is usually normal to lose 80 to 100 hairs per day. But yes, if you never had a hair fall and are suddenly witnessing it, it might be due to some underlying etiology. As you mentioned about your recent illness, it might be pertaining to it. Kindly attach an image to start the treatment accordingly because these days it is also common to see \\"androgenetic alopecia.\\" But it occurs over a period of time.

I am currently taking Vyvanse, Strattera, and Spironolactone. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, deranged in medical terms means abnormal and likely in your case there must be elevated liver enzymes like SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase). Likely, the cause is alcohol only. It directly affects one's liver. In short term, such damage recovers within a week period but the chronic high consumption may lead to permanent damage.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It was a normal cold, but as it was almost gone (no more congestion, did not feel sick anymore), I lost the sense of taste and smell overnight. I have not had a sense of taste or smell for 11 days now. I do have a history of losing my sense of taste and smell for a few days during cold with congestion and for four weeks when I had mono. I did speak with a general doctor and he seems to think my loss of taste and smell is cold or allergy-related so he does not think I have Coronavirus. However, this loss of sense of smell is different than all the rest. I have never been without smell for this long after a normal cold and I have had a fairly clear nose for the entire duration of it so it cannot be due to congestion. I just wanted to get a second opinion on if you think it could be Coronavirus as news has just come out that this is a possible symptom of asymptomatic Coronavirus carriers. I am currently on Amoxicillin for sinus infection.","Doctor":"Hello. I appreciate your timely picking up of the signs and reaching out to us. We have two scenarios. First, is that you have Coronavirus infection and the cold, allergy, and loss of smell are due to it unless you develop more severe symptoms like fever, temperature, breathing difficulty, respiratory distress, you do not go anywhere out of home. You are gonna remain quarantined till 15 days from now. Take plenty of fluids and water. Eat good and normal diet. Exercise indoors if you can. Second, it is allergy-related. In this case, it should subside in some time. You can try some nasal steroids and other measures told above. In the first scenario also nasal steroids can be tried. You can revert back to us if you need any further support."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 20 year old girl and it has been almost four years that I have been suffering from epilepsy.

I had numbing and tingling in my left arm and my hand would go numb while sleeping. However, over the next couple weeks the numbing, tingling, moved to my right arm then my legs and feet to include muscle twitching/ spasms. Now, these symptoms have mostly left my arms other than occasional slight sensation in my fingers. However, my legs and left foot continue to have this sensation. I do not have any pain other than the sensation and can move normally. However, exerting myself seems to elevate the sensation. I visited my doctor and they ran a complete set of lab work and everything was normal other than slightly low vitamin D. Also scheduled to MRI on the spine to rule out MS. After doing some reading, I think I developed a case of peripheral neuropathy. My question is could this be something else? Is it possible that with rest it will go away? Are there any supplements I could take to help? Any other thoughts or suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your question carefully and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of a peripheral neuropathy. They could be related to a bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column. That is why it is necessary to perform a cervical spine MRI study. MS (multiple sclerosis) would be an exceptional diagnosis at your age. Vitamin D deficiency may lead to muscle twitching and also joint pain, associated with chronic fatigue. As it resulted low, it is necessary to take vitamin D supplements. I would also like to know if you checked vitamin B12 levels and thyroid hormone levels. Vitamin B12 deficiency can mimic this clinical situation. Regarding peripheral neuropathy, I would recommend performing a nerve conduction study (electroneurography) to exclude this possibility, although it is really less likely that you suffer from this disorder.

It did feel weird as I swallowed it, which has been happening a lot recently as I have had these anxiety issues with eating. I also have acid reflux if this contributes, as my chest is also hurting. But, I am assuming that is hopefully from the acid reflux.","Doctor":"Hello. Have you choked any time? What is the result of your reports? You may be suffering from anxiety neurosis/ phobia while eating. If you are feeling dysphagia, that may be due to acid reflex but it will not cause aspiration in the daytime. During night time acids regurgitate back may cause choking. Eat a small bite every time and chew properly. You may need cognitive behavioral therapy to improve your problem. You need to consult a psychiatrist. You will need an endoscopy to rule out a hiatus hernia or ulcers, etc. Use tablet Alprazolam 0.25 at night, head end elevation while sleeping.

It is most likely psoriasis which is an autoimmune condition which affects the skin causing white silver scales. This could be drug-induced, genetic, or an idiopathic infection.

I appreciate the efforts you put in to upload the case completely along with EKG reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is only a slight variation in the normal sinus rhythm and so do not worry about it. Your BP (blood pressure) is high and needs treatment. For that you said you are on Betaloc-50 (Metoprolol). When did you start taking this medicine? I will suggest you to keep taking the medicine for BP and hope that will control your blood pressure. Keep a record of your blood pressure and after sometime make a follow-up to see how things are working. If needed we may add some medicine for blood pressure.  Diabetes and high blood pressure are two important risk factors for heart diseases, coronary artery diseases and heart attacks. You also need to go for some blood work important to see how is your blood sugar level, cholesterol, kidneys and liver working. I am advising you some tests for that. It is necessary to see if diabetes and high blood pressure has affected your body organs. Go to lab with overnight fasting and have the following tests:- 1. Serum proteins. 2. Serum electrolytes. 3. Liver function tests. 4. Kidney function tests. 5. Fasting blood sugar. 6. HbA1c. 7. Fasting lipid profile. 8. Thyroid Profile. 1. Continue the medicine and consult a psychiatrist for anxiety. 2.

During that time we did not take her out and applied neem leave paste. It got cured in 15 days. Now, this year also, again she got chickenpox. Now, she is 4 years old. What to do now? Why has it come again?  She ate chicken and mango the same day. Is it because of that she got chickenpox? When I was a kid, I got chickenpox three times. All the time we have applied neem leave paste only. Two years ago, I got again, and that time I ate more mangos and chicken. Is body heat causing chickenpox again and again?","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, I would want to know if the diagnosis of chickenpox is made by you or a doctor. It is highly unlikely for anybody to get chickenpox twice and even if the person gets chickenpox twice least likely it would be once every year. Her weight 11 kg is very less for a 4 year old, which suggests she must either be frequently ill or malnourished. The fact that you also had the same issue in your childhood points to a genetic cause of some form of immune deficiency. If such is the case, then eventually the child will outgrow this problem as the age progresses just like you. Chickenpox is caused by Varicella zoster virus and not due to heat or due to eating some food item. Also, I would like to know if this child has been vaccinated to date and if not then please get her vaccinated. It is important to get the child evaluated with blood reports, and a physical workup with a pediatrician is necessary for diagnosing chickenpox. Please give proper nutrition to the child and avoid outside food as the weight of the child is very less for a 4 year old.

Currently, I am using a corticosteroid Foster inhaler two times a day with two inhalations each time. After the inhalations, I clear my throat with throat cleaning solution and also I use a sprayer with propolis and ethanol several times per day and yet despite that I got the oral thrush with white dots all over my throat. I thought that maybe it is just temporary and will disappear after a while but three weeks passed and it still stays the same. Do I need to buy some medication or do I need to just wait for it to disappear while still using the sprayer? Also, can this be related with my higher temperature which is varying in the interval 37.1 - 37.4?","Doctor":"Hi. Oral thrush that is oral candidiasis is a kind of yeast infection that in your case can be attributed to long term steroid use. This is a kind of untoward effect due to inhaled steroids. You need to clearly examine the entire oral mucosa with regard to the extent the creamy layer has spread. Coming to the treatment aspect, you need to apply Nystatin suspension on the affected area four times daily, which means the sequence should be food, gargle, apply medicine. Nystatin should be applied to the white areas inside of each cheek and/or on the tongue. Apply gently with your finger. Continue for 48 hours, after all of the white spots have disappeared. Also, get FBS (fasting blood sugar) done to screen for diabetes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Start with anytime in a day foe 15-20mins, also start with simple walk. Please remember intensity and duration also keep us motivated. Once you establish a routine than you can keep it moving.

What is its cause and treatment, please?","Doctor":"Hello. A first-degree heart block means there is a slight delay in conduction of heart impulse from one chamber to another, that is from atria to ventricles.This is not a serious issue. There are many causes for it, few are, congenital defects in the heart, old age, taking some drugs which affect the heart, etc. If you are having any symptoms then only you should investigate it further, otherwise, do not worry about it. This will decide your treatment. If you are not having any symptoms then do not worry. For further queries consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 29 year old female. I have a diagnosis of autism. I have mood swings, feeling low/ depressed, which I do not know if it is related to my periods. People tend to notice more just before and during my periods (but also I do not know if it is partly frustration due to my living circumstances. I am currently living with my mum and her husband, while I wait to move into supported living, but I do not have a date. I am sad and depressed about my weight, but do not have the motivation to get out and do things. If I am exercising, I am constantly thinking it is for weight loss and so not enjoying it, because my head wants instant results.

Also, I suffer from stress and urge incontinence and need advice on how to manage it when flying as it makes me anxious. And, I am getting hot flushes.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understood your concern. Early on you got diagnosed with autism. It is caused by different combinations of genetic and environmental influences. Then thinking about that does not make any sense. If it is because of environmental conditions that makes you disinterested about yourself, then it better to work up regarding change of environment that you grew up. It is better to start initially with mediation and yoga which makes you feel fresh and making up some things new every day or try to learn something every day makes you interested in yourself. My advice was initially to rule out any organic diseases like thyroid disorder which even present with similar symptoms and few other common diseases that patient have but being neglected or get unnoticed will lead to health issues. So, get a blood investigation and thyroid profile. Later on, we will proceed accordingly. Kindly attach your reports so that I can help you better.

I had a bypass surgery seven years ago. I used to walk 45 minutes daily. I feel completely fit and fine. A week ago, I felt that my heart rhythm was irregular. After going through a Holter test, I found that my heart rate increases and slows down with a pause of 1.8 seconds. My minimal heart rate is 50 and the maximum is 144 BPM. My average heart rate is 89. Is there anything serious? More details about the presenting complaint include I rarely get a headache with no other symptoms.

Now, I am two days late and I have a brownish discharge since yesterday. I thought it was my period. But it clearly is not. What is it? Could there be a chance that I could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. The days you mentioned are nearing the ovulation period. In a patient who has normal regular cycles of 28 to 30 days, ovulation occurs on the 14th or the 15th day when chances of pregnancy are high if you have sex on those days. You have said that there was no ejaculation inside the vagina and you have already taken an I-pill (emergency contraceptive pill) within two hours. So, there are very rare chances of pregnancy. Your current period is late for only two days and you have a brownish discharge. Sometimes due to stress, periods get delayed. You need to wait for four to five days more and I think you will start proper period. But if you do not start your period within a week then you need to do urine pregnancy test. I am sure you will start your periods. Stress is a big factor for delayed periods.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As all the test for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) are negative at the initial level and after 90 days, it means you are not infected with this virus. So do not panic. Pain at multiple sites can be due to other medical conditions that are psychological in origin because of excessive worry and anxiety. For white spots on the upper lips, get a consultation with a dermatologist to find the cause of it. Probably you are having too much anxiety as to suffering from a serious infection.

Elevated troponin may occur due to the involvement of heart, lungs, and kidneys. They occur in blood as a response to trauma to the heart muscles.

Although I should mention I do have a bad tooth (back tooth) which was causing me quite a lot of pain three months ago. But, the pain was inside my mouth (a toothache). I do not have this pain now.

A lump behind the ear could be a swollen lymph node if the toothache was also on the same side.  If it recently appeared, not hard or fixed, if it is more or less tender to the touch or is not growing bigger, it easily could be due to an infection from a tooth, inside your ear, or a scalp infection.

Meaning, she ovulates on the 16th day of her cycle. Another example is that if a lady has a regular cycle of 28 days then her ovulation will occur 14 days prior to her last day. Meaning, she will ovulate on the 14th day of her cycle. It is so because the menses start exactly after 14 days of ovulation.

The hospital is telling us to follow up with an orthopedic. My question is what can this mean now and in the future?","Doctor":"Hello. The cleft can be just superficial or deep going up to the spinal cord. If it is superficial then it will not be of a major concern. If its deep then there can be tethering of the spinal cord or bifid cord which can lead to neurological disorders of the lower limbs as the child grows. This can be seen very well on ultrasonography done by an experienced sonologist which will give more information when compared to an X-ray. So the sonography needs to be done which is a safe and easy procedure. Sonography of the entire spine is the next step. This is only a second opinion platform. This professional advice provided by me stands subject to the actual examination of report or image and is based entirely on inputs provided to me. It should be correlated with clinical findings.

Sometimes he becomes violent also. Currently, he is on Clonazepam 5 mg. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your father is having features of psychosis. I would suggest starting him on Quetiapine 25 mg twice daily and increase after one week to 50 mg daily.

I saw your clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is called pearly penile papules. It is not a disease. It is a physiological variant. There is nothing to worry. You can ignore it, it is not going to cause any harm. If you are concerned cosmetically, it can be removed using cryotherapy. No cream or ointment is necessary. Any cream or ointment would cause more harm than help. Kindly do not try any home remedies. You will end up having skin damage.

I feel like one-sided nerve pain and for the first two months felt weakness and now the fifth year is going on. I tested four times for HIV and it is negative. I have also been checked for also herpes 1, 2 and syphilis, VRDL tests and all are negative. What tests should I do for my one-sided nerve pain which is there from head to toe? Kindly help me. Of note, my eosinophils are quite low.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your fear. If you have used a condom while having intercourse then it is less likely to acquire a sexually transmitted infection. You can either have an ulcer over your genitals or pus from your urethra in case of sexually transmitted infections. Since it has been five years now, the chances of you having any infection with no symptoms are very remote. Moreover, you have tested yourself for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), syphilis, and herpes. All are negative. The only thing which can remain silent and lead to a problem is syphilis. It is called neurosyphilis. Again it should have been picked up in VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory) test. With your history, I do not see any reason to worry about sexually transmitted infection or HIV. But thorough physical examination is necessary to declare you are infection free. I would suggest you visit a venereologist for a physical examination. Regarding your nerve pain, if it is pain restricted to one half of your body, you need to see a neurologist.

Ten years ago, I had the same issue and got treated. It is a kind of acne that is what the doctor had diagnosed at that time. At present, I do not take any medications for the same.These are the same kind of boils that I have been getting on my shoulders too and they are brown in color and not skin color. In the past, I used to apply Clear Gel, Sofradex and Cetaphil face wash and had been prescribed two other medicines. I have attached pictures for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw your clinical pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) You have lots of closed comedones on your forehead. Yes, it is acne. There are two types of comedones. They are closed comedones nothing but whiteheads and the other are open comedones which are the blackheads. Closed comedones should be removed, we call it comedone extraction. For this procedure, you need to meet your dermatologist. The one near your right lower eyelid in the picture looks like milia. The picture is not very much clear, hence I have mentioned it \\"looks like.\\".  A milium is a cyst, forms around eyes because of friction and rubbing. It appears whitish in color. It can be removed the same way as closed comedones or it can be closed comedones with enhancement of light on picture making it look like milia. Comedone extraction is the best treatment until you visit your dermatologist for this procedure. I suggest you start using Deriva-Cms (Adapalene Topical, Clindamycin Topical) MS gel for these comedones in the evening You should apply a very little quantity like the size of a pinhead. You should apply only on the top of each comedone at 7 p.m. Make sure it does not touch the skin. Wash your face at 10 p.m. before sleeping. Acne can be seen on shoulders, chest, arms as well. You have acne on your shoulders, which is leaving pigmentation. Use Deriva-Cms gel on shoulders also. Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser face wash, wash your face four times a day. I would like to suggest a few skin care tips here too.  Do not touch your comedone. It will leave pigmentation and scar. Use good sunscreen on the face for 30 minutes before going out in sun. Do not use oil for scalp before taking bath, you can use oil after bath.

There was a non-mass lesion seen on the left breast which the radiologist said was stable for three years. On the right breast, there were three foci seen, two measuring 5 mm and one 3 mm. The 5 mm foci have been stable in size for one year. But, the 3 mm one is new. The doctor did not recommend a biopsy because of the small size and after mammogram and ultrasound were performed, he gave it BI-RADS III and told me to go back in six months for another MRI and a mammogram. Should I be concerned about these and ask for a biopsy?","Doctor":"Hello. A BI-RADS III (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) means the lesion has a high probability of being benign and something which is not of a serious concern. The MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a detailed test and has good accuracy. However, a suspected BI-RADS III lesion needs to be followed up on the MRI and mammogram as recommended by your doctors. In reply to your questions, you surely need a follow-up testing after six months. A biopsy for the 3 mm lesion which is showing benign features on MRI is not usually recommended and there is no serious concern right now. You can possibly get an ultrasound mammogram after three months if waiting six months for the next MRI is causing anxiety.

When I am in a wrong position, there will be tension in my shoulders and arms, and in my face muscles, but also I cannot think clearly anymore. It is like a blackout. When I bend my head forward for a few seconds, my body reacts with sweating, rapid breathing. My chiropractor thinks it has to do with the absence of lordosis in my neck. When I bend my neck forward, there will be pressure on the brainstem. The result is a fight/flight reaction. My symptoms are a headache between my ears and above in my neck and earache after an hour of thinking. So I am not able to do my job anymore for nearly two years. I have trouble with clear thinking. The biggest problem is that sometimes I feel muscle tension in my shoulders, arms, and hands, and in my face. In that case, my consciousness is impaired. I visited a neurologist, but she could not explain it. Can you help me? Of note, when I was 12, I broke my nose. My current medications are Paroxetine 10 mg twice a week and Ibuprofen and Paracetamol. Some weeks ago, I had an MRI of the cervical spine and it showed spondylosis at C4-C5. Uncovertebral osteoarthritis. No significant neural foraminal bony stenosis was seen. Degenerative changes in the atlantoaxial joint.I also had an MRI of the cerebrum that showed no relevant MRI for comparison. Current research concerns an MRI of cerebrum according to standard protocol. The results were as follows: There were some punctiform supratentorial white matter abnormalities, a specific but most likely on the basis of microangiopathy. These are not striking for the age. Normal aspect of the basal nuclei, brainstem and the cerebellum. Normal grey/white matter differentiation and gyri/sulci patron. Slim/slender ventricular system and peripheral liquor areas. Results of the MRI of the cervical spine were: Modic-2 endplate changes around the anterior intervertebral spaces C4-C5. Degenerative changes of the atlantoaxial joint, with known osteophytes, in accordance with the CT CWK from 2007.  C2-C3: Free from significance.   C3-C4: Uncovertebral disc disease and osteoarthritis. Combined bony/discogenic narrowing of C3-C4 neuroforamen left, possibly with the involvement of root C4 left. No significant spinal canal stenosis.   C4-C5: Disc disease with posterior bulging. Uncovertebral osteoarthritis. Combined bony/discogenic neuroforamen C4-C5 on each side, possibly with the involvement of root C5 on each side. Mild to moderate spinal canal stenosis with reduced liquor signal around the myelum, but with no obvious compression.   C5-C6: Disc disease with posterior bulging. Uncovertebral osteoarthritis. Combined bony/discogenic narrowing of C5-C6 neuroforamen on each side, possibly with the involvement of root C6 on each side.   C6-C7: Disc disease with posterior bulging. Uncovertebral osteoarthritis. Combined bony/discogenic neuroforamen C6-C7 on each side, possibly with the involvement of root C7 on each side.   C7-T1: No abnormalities of any significance.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If vocal nodules are confirmed by a doctor then there are a few things which you should know. Vocal nodules are small thickenings in both vocal cords which usually occur secondary to excessive voice use and very common in singers, teachers, and any professional voice user. More than 99 percent of vocal nodules resolve with simple measures such as voice rest, steam inhalation, drinking warm water frequently to avoid throat dryness and sometimes voice therapy may be required. Only one percent of vocal nodules need surgery especially in people who do not follow the above measures. So you need to continue voice rest, steam inhalation, drink warm water, have two teaspoons of honey three times daily (it prevents excessive dryness)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing erectile dysfunction. Are there any over-the-counter medications for a quick solution? I am on a tour with my wife and I am not accessible to any specialist. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello.

Sildenafil is to be used daily while Tadalafil can be used in an interval of three days as it stays in the body for a long time. These drugs need to be taken one hour prior to sexual activity.

I have tried Viagra and ayurvedic medicines to increase sexual drive but no results. My parents had compelled me into this marriage.

I tried sex several times. Erection is maintained for a few minutes that also after thinking about some other girl but ejaculation never happens. Now for the last five months, even erection is not happening. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last year but that is under control now. I was also diagnosed with increased prolactin levels recently and I am currently taking medicines for that. I think the problem is more psychological. Please advise me what to do. I am currently on Thyronorm 100 mg per day and Cabgolin 0.25 mg per week. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Hypothyroidism and high prolactin explain a few symptoms that you are suffering from. So before jumping to conclusion that it is psychological, I would suggest you that further investigation is required such as serum testosterone, serum LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). You may also need sonography of testes and visualization of the duct to see if they are blocked or not and also prostate if it is enlarged or not. Most often psychological anejaculation is situational and not permanent or complete, while you mentioned that you never had it. So I recommend that you consult a urologist for your symptoms and get investigated properly to find the cause of your problem. It is a treatable condition and can be treated accordingly. If the investigation comes normal then you can think that this is due to psychological in origin. Then counseling and sex therapy will be helpful.

They used to be around 24 days in length and my current cycle is now 36 days. My basal body temperature indicated that I may have ovulated on day 10. But I have not menstruated at all this cycle - not even spotting. Late last week, I had slight cramps and pains in the regions near my ovaries, which made me think that perhaps my body was trying to ovulate again. I have taken a pregnancy test, which was negative. I do not believe I am pregnant; rather, I think I may be entering into perimenopause. I have been trained for a marathon last year and during training, I ran up to 50 km or more per week. I had a cycle of 36 days. However, since that time, my cycles have been as short as 14 days but no longer than 31 days. My partner and I use condoms and I track my cycle so that we do not need to use these on infertile days. However, given the length of this cycle, I am unsure whether condoms are necessary until after I have menstruated next. My question relates to fertility in this perimenopausal stage. As I believe I ovulated on day 10, does this mean I remain infertile until I get my next period? Or is my body going to ovulate again, meaning that I will again be fertile?","Doctor":"Hello. No, you have not ovulated on day 10 because if it would have been so you would have had your period by now. Menstruation usually occurs 14 days after ovulation and the duration between ovulation and menstruation is always fixed. Ovulation occurs only once in one cycle. I suggest you repeat the pregnancy test after one week. Since your cycles are irregular now, you cannot rely on fertile period method. Take proper contraception during an entire cycle. If you do not get your period even after a week and pregnancy test comes out to be negative again then you should undergo some investigations to find out the cause. I suggest you get a thyroid profile, prolactin levels, serum LH (luteinizing hormone) and serum FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) checked.

Two months ago, I was exposed to HSV-1 and then seven days later, I was tested positive for HSV-1 oral with IgG of 1.51 and IgM confirming a recent infection. The same day I started taking Acyclovir for three weeks and then one month later, I was switched to Valtrex (Valaciclovir) at 1 g twice daily. I started having HSV-1 facial symptoms, but never any outbreak. It started with tingling lips and then nerve pain running all over my face, cheeks then under my eyes. The last two weeks, the nerve pain has gradually increased from my eyes to my head, mainly at my trigeminal ganglion. The pain is 5/10 and is now on my forehead and the top of my head.

In the past, I have been on Gabapentin.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are compatible with trigeminal neuralgia. I agree with your doctor's decision to avoid performing brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or any medication within the first trimester. Regarding encephalitis, you should know that it is a very serious condition, characterized by acute confusion and persistent seizures, associated with fever. So, you can understand that it is not your case. You should also know that pregnancy makes you more vulnerable to trigeminal neuralgia. I suggest you taking just Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) or Ibuprofen for the pain. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicine. In the second trimester of your pregnancy, I would recommend performing a brain MRI and checking again IgM (immunoglobulin M) levels. For the moment a neurological consult would help exclude any other physical signs of neurological disease.

My cholesterol level is 225 and triglyceride is 200 for the last 12 years. I used to do frequent masturbation in early age. I do have erection during morning hours many times, particularly after sound sleep or if I had long walk previous day. I am having Sildenafil 25 mg or 5 mg Cialis, which is effective enough.

The condom burst inside me and cum went inside. So after five to six hours I took unwanted 72. Then from 17th to 22nd there was bleeding and cramps. But now it is about one month and I did not get my periods. Is there any chance I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, there is some chance. Do urine pregnancy tests. If the test comes positive then there is pregnancy. And if the test comes negative then it is disturbed menses due to emergency pills. Here are some detailed explanations: Unwanted 72 is an emergency contraceptive pill and it can disturb your menses. It can disturb the cycle for two to three cycles. You may have irregular periods or delayed periods also. At the same time, it is not 10% effective to prevent pregnancy. There is some chance of failure even if taken within the time period. You have periods on Jan 31st and have intercourse on 13 Feb which is almost near ovulation period. After taking Unwanted 72 there is withdrawal bleeding mostly within seven days. that does not mean period. After that, it is almost a month. So do a urine pregnancy test for confirmation. If it is negative, then you can take tablet Primoult N daily for five days and then wait for periods. It should come in 10 days after the last tablet. In case if the test comes positive then you are pregnant and you can continue or terminate pregnancy. Do drink more water. Can do one ultrasound sonography for other reasons for delaying menses like an ovarian cyst."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Because, smoking habit is more about self-control and determination than anything else. Also, medical council does not recommend any one particular brand or medicine. It recognizes that Nicotex (chewing gum with Nicotine) is legal and in my personal opinion, it is a very helpful substitute for quitting smoking. There are no side effects after quitting smoking. Once you quit smoking, you will only have an urge to pick up the cigarette again, but this you should be able to fight using Nicotex. Also, this is not going to be an easy path. So, I recommend you to have a social support from your group of friends and family. Also, give a strong reason to yourself while fighting the urge to smoke. It is an excellent step towards a better way of life. Also, you must drink a lot of water, more than usual to detoxify your body from all the toxins that the smoking has produced inside and this will also help you to avoid smoking in the future.

When we went to the doctor he said that due to some reason, some blood came behind his eye. That is why he is not able to see from that eye. Now, one and a half years have passed, and we continue using the eye drops. But, no improvement is seen. I am enclosing the reports of tests.

His condition is described as old CRVO (central retinal vein occlusion). There is bleeding inside the retina which has almost resolved. He has also recovered around 30 to 40 % of his vision. Unfortunately, this condition is very difficult to treat. There are options like injections of Avastin (Bevacizumab), Lucentis (Ranibizumab), Ozurdex (Dexamethasone). These work only in fresh cases and results are not consistent in every case. For now, I request you to continue the same drops for few months and get a regular follow-up from a retina specialist.

Earlier, I had a pretty healthy and regular sex life. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Poor erection in most individuals occurs due to psychological reasons.

There is a continuous release of gas from my stomach. The stomach sort of puffs up all the time, gas production is in every 10 to 15 minutes and it goes out through the anus or mouth. After 10 to 15 minutes again I have the same symptoms. I have visited many doctors but they are unable to cure completely. Recently I visited a doctor and he prescribed me to take some capsules like Panlipase 25000, Velgut, and Medigas and after taking these capsules, I feel better. He advised to continue the medicines and now I am in the third month. But still, the problem persists. What is the reason behind the release of gases and how can it be cured completely?","Doctor":"Hello. Gas formation is not always abnormal and need not always be treated. You can take precautions like avoiding foodstuffs which can increase gas production. Other measures are to regularise bowel habits, avoid constipation and have an adequate intake of water daily up to two to three liters. Tablets like Velgut (Probiotic) help temporarily.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am not sure how am I getting PPD with all my current medications.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for taking help from a psychiatrist. It will be better to stop all the above medications except Zoloft (Sertraline) and Lamictal (Lamotrigine). Zoloft and Lamictal cause very rare and mild side effects. Pregnancy may cause depression.

She locally met a doctor who gave her a cream called Sunban after applying which the brown patches turned reddish. Someone told her to apply camphor and coconut oil after which the situation deteriorated and patches became more prominent. Now she has stopped applying anything on her skin. Please help her to overcome this skin disorder. I have attached photos for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, I would like to appreciate your image quality and way of taking photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Everything is nicely visible. The basic problem here is melasma. She has brownish pigmented patches that are usually developing on her face. They occur because of female sex hormone called estrogen or ultraviolet rays exposure or cosmetic overuse or nutritional deficiency like iron etc. Camphor many times irritates skin. But before that, I would like to know did she apply anything else with Sunban (Octyl methoxycinnamate, Titanium dioxide, and Oxybenzone) like some skin lightening cream? As with sunscreen alone, it is less likely to become red. Anyways, now she has developed irritant contact dermatitis. At present, she needs a good moisturizer and one low potent anti-allergic cream. I suggest you use Evion (Aloe Vera and Vitamin E) cream locally twice a day. You can also use Desowen (Desonide Topical) gel twice a day for five days and then once a day for five days. If the irritation still persists, you can use it alternate days I suggest you also take Levocetirizine one tablet as required. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicine. In the meanwhile as a precaution avoid excess sun exposure.

I cannot have access to an eye specialist since it is a weekend in my country. I want to know how dangerous can this be. What caused the eye to bleed? What else can I do until Monday when I take her to an eye specialist?","Doctor":"Hello. Kindly tell me is the blood coming out of her eye or is it collected in the white part of her eye known as a subconjunctival hemorrhage. A picture of her eye would have been very helpful. If blood is oozing out of her eye, which is very less likely, kindly immediately rush her to an ophthalmologist or an emergency room. In the second situation, which is most likely the case, as long as her vision is not affected you do not have to worry from her eyes point of view. But, the main concern should be the head injury. If the injury was so severe to cause a subconjunctival hemorrhage, it means the force was large. So, kindly consult a neurosurgeon and rule out a head injury cause it might appear late and we should not take any chances.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How accurate in your opinion is the Lelli ACL (Lever test)? I am almost three months post-op of having my ACL reconstructed along with a few lesions addressed during the surgery. I am concerned I have ruptured my ACL again after feeling a short sharp pain when turning in the sand on vacation. It has been three days since the incident and the knee now feels a lot looser and I have some pain in different areas. I have tried the Lachman test with no noticeable shifting, and the Lelli test was positive with good leverage hopefully assisted by my intact ACL. I will have to see my surgeon and physio soon but I am just wondering how accurate the Lelli test is. There seems to be no difference when comparing the test in both knees.","Doctor":"Hello. I read through the concern. The Lelli test is accurate in diagnosing acute on chronic ACL tears, more sensitive than many other traditional tests performed in an acute condition, especially partial and acute tears. Do not be afraid. Keep calm. Take precautions not to strain and exert your knee. Keep it supported with an ACL brace until you get properly diagnosed by a good orthopedic or physio. Do not jump to a conclusion and keep worrying as you might not be accurate enough to say the reason for translation as there could be many factors like muscle inhibitions and imbalances that exist post surgery which may all confuse you leading to false positive tests. Hope this is helpful. Kindly revert back in case you need any further help in this regard.

In addition to this, I am stressed, tired and not looking or feeling well as I have a very engaging and stressful job. During the days of high blood pressure, I went to see a doctor, and she sent me for thyroid check for which I needed to wait a month. My blood pressure went to complete normal from then, but I still went for a thyroid check. I had blood test and ultrasound. The doctor found a 9 mm nodule and send me to gamma screening. After that, my results came and I was prescribed 50 mg of Thyronajod (Levothyroxine and Potassium Iodine) and I needed to take it daily.

When I was consuming this, I got heavy pain in my body and after some days I found that fat under my thighs, palms, hands, legs, chest, feet and soles has been lost (it is still continuing). A swollen lymph node in neck appeared and my left parotid gland became swollen. I consulted an ENT. He prescribed Moxclav 625. The swelling in the parotid gland subsided and again after some days there was swelling and the doctor gave me Piroxicam. Again it subsided and then after some days again the same problem raised and the doctor gave me Claribid 500 for five days and it subsided. A scan was done on my neck and the result showed: Enlarged left parotid gland with diffuse decrease in echogenicity possibly parotitis. Cervical lymphadenitis: Enlarged lymph nodes noted in the left posterior cervical, submandibular and upper jugular group. They show maintained fatty hilum and ovoid shape. Maximum short axis diameter is 5 mm.Still, I am losing fat from thighs, glute, legs, hands, chest, palms, and soles of the feet, etc. I have a burning and tingling sensation all over the body and in the night inside of both palms become red and veins become enlarged. The following tests I did for HIV and other STDs after the above-mentioned exposure:  P24 antigen - 28th day. ELISA - 42nd day. CMIA DUO test - 75th day. ELISA - 92nd day. Hep B, HCV, and VDRL - 99th day.  All the above tests were negative. And doctors said that HIV test after 90th day is conclusive that I do not have HIV. Then please analysis my case and give me your valuable suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello. I need to know some more information such as how much weight have you lost in the last four to six months, the presence of any other symptoms like fever, diarrhea, joints pain, recurrent oral or genital ulcer. Was there any ulcer over the scrotum during the swelling? The symptoms which you have are very non-specific and can be associated with any chronic illness. So further tests will be guided by your symptoms. Are you in touch with the lady, if yes does she have any particular illness? Firstly, there is very less likelihood of HIV, almost nil. At this stage, the possibilities I would keep are of syphilis. However, your VDRL is negative. Orit may just be a psychological issue due to overthinking about that exposure. Anyway, you will need some more investigations like complete hemogram with ESR and CRP, liver and renal function test, ANA antibody test, chest X-ray. For syphilis, you will need other tests like FTA-ABS or TPPA or MHA TP. If none of the above are informative, we may need a CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen.

Since two years, I am getting tiny white balls coming out from my head in comb with dandruff flakes and a lot of hair fall. I took homeopathy medicine and after some time, it came again.","Doctor":"Hello. I am not very sure what you are referring to by saying white balls. It can be a small piece of dandruff scale forming a ball. To be more precise, I would like to see the picture. For any query, please make it a point to add the clinical picture, which would make diagnosis and treatment easier in the field of dermatology. However, for dandruff, I would suggest you use Salisia KT shampoo. It has Ketoconazole Topical and Salicylic Acid. It is very much effective in controlling dandruff. Use it alternate days to wash your scalp. Talking about your hair fall, losing up to 100 hairs per day is absolutely normal. Hair is the fastest growing structure in the body next to mucosa. Hence it is normal to expect hair loss every day. If you are losing more than 100 hairs per day then it is problematic which needs attention. Again I would like to see the density of hair. You should also do a pull test to determine the cause of hair fall. Most common reason for hair fall in girls of your age is stress like exams. We call it telogen effluvium. Here you will lose hair for three months, later it will settle down on its own. There are other reasons for hair loss, like thyroid hormonal imbalance which require further evaluation. I am just listing out possible conditions because I cannot make a precise diagnosis without seeing you in person. I would suggest you consult a dermatologist if you are losing more than 100 hairs per day.Below mentioned are a few hair care tips: For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have an abscessed Bartholin's gland cyst.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

After 15 days of surgery, she started feeling lower backache with very local pain in bending, sneezing and coughing. Initially, we thought it is a post-cesarean effect. As she was breastfeeding the baby, she took homeopathic medicines. Afterwards, we consulted an orthopedic as there was no relief of pain. Three months later, we consulted Neuromedicine. With certain blood investigations and an MRI report, they diagnosed it as a Pott’s spine in the L4-L5 region. The MRI report said there was an altered T2WI hyperintense and T1WI hypointense signal intensities noted involving the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies with the paradiscal destruction of the L4 vertebral body. A post-contrast study reveals heterogeneous involvement. An irregular peripheral enhancing T2WI hyperintense and T1WI hypointense collection is noted in intraosseous space, prevertebral and paravertebral space extending behind L4 and L5 vertebral level. Small similar collections were noted in the adjacent psoas muscles. Anterior epidural space collection was noted behind L4-L5 level causing spinal canal stenosis. Rest of the vertebrae were normal. Of late, she has started feeling severe pain in her back as well in the right leg. Right now she is feeling difficulty in moving and walking. Can you please prescribe her what to do next? They have started the treatment course and suggested to wear an LS belt.

However currently, I take 50 mg of Lamictal and 75 mg Venlafaxine. This treatment kind fits me because I have lessened anxiety levels for sure. It is my first week on Venlafaxine XR. And the second week on Lamictal. In a few days we will increase Lamictal to 100 mg and after two weeks to 200 mg. I also take Tranxene 10 mg if needed, as well as Olanzapine 10 mg. How come I responded to Venlafaxine XR so fast, when I did not respond to SSRI? I lack energy and motivation, should I increase Venlafaxine XR to 150? If so, will it have more effects on my anxiety and depressive episode?","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to know that you are responding to your current medication. Venlafaxine XR is an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) which can be helpful when SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have not been effective. I note that you have been tried on different SSRIs and mood stabilizers before with no success. It is positive that you have found Venlafaxine XR 75 mg to lessen your anxiety. I will advise to continue with the titration regimen suggested by your prescribing doctor. Do not rush to increase the dose to 150 mg as titration needs to be carefully considered after weighing up your response and any side effects. As you are also on increasing dose of Lamictal it makes sense to do the titration gradually.

I have been on beta blockers for about 15 years, first on 50 mg Atenolol and then on 10 mg Bisoprolol. They lowered my pulse rate to about 60 but then about three years ago I started to get AFib. The episodes of AFib became more frequent and painful so that I needed to use a GTN spray to reduce the pain. It got so that I could not lie down and had to sleep propped up against pillows. The painful episodes would last about three hours and they occurred every couple of days.I gradually reduced the Bisoprolol and stopped them completely after a few weeks. I am currently on Aspirin too. Now my pulse is erratic but I can sleep lying down fine and I am not experiencing the painful bouts of AFib anymore. Should I be looking at taking some other medication or am I just experiencing withdrawal symptoms which will eventually pass? Please provide your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. Atrial fibrillation (also called AFib or AF) is a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. Normally, your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat. In atrial fibrillation, the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) beat irregularly (quiver) instead of beating effectively to move blood into the ventricles.  If a clot breaks off, enters the bloodstream and lodges in an artery leading to the brain, a stroke result. About 15–20 percent of people who have strokes have this heart arrhythmia. This clot risk is why patients with this condition are put on blood thinners. The cornerstones of atrial fibrillation management are rate control and anticoagulation and rhythm control for those symptomatically limited by AF. The clinical decision to use a rhythm-control or rate-control strategy requires an integrated consideration of several factors including a degree of symptoms, likelihood of successful cardioversion, the presence of comorbidities, and candidacy for AF ablation. Ideally, to treat atrial fibrillation, the heart rate and rhythm are reset to normal. Cardioversion can be conducted in two ways: Electrical cardioversion: In this brief procedure, an electrical shock is delivered to your heart through paddles or patches placed on your chest. The shock stops your heart's electrical activity momentarily. When your heart begins again, the hope is that it resumes its normal rhythm. The procedure is performed during sedation, so you should not feel the electric shock. Cardioversion with drugs: This form of cardioversion uses medications called antiarrhythmics to help restore normal sinus rhythm. Depending on your heart condition, your doctor may recommend trying intravenous or oral medications to return your heart to normal rhythm. This is often done in the hospital with continuous monitoring of your heart rate. If your heart rhythm returns to normal, your doctor often will prescribe the same anti-arrhythmic medication or a similar one to try to prevent more spells of atrial fibrillation. After electrical cardioversion, your doctor may prescribe anti-arrhythmic medications to help prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Medications may include Dofetilide, Flecainide, Propafenone, Amiodarone, and Sotalol. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Consult your cardiologist, get a 2D (two-dimensional) echocardiogram, a 24-hour Holter done and follow the following medicines and procedures. They are not withdrawal symptoms. A full evaluation is required. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is one month old. Her birth weight was 3.6 kg.

With regards the family history, my wife's 75-year-old grandmother is now under treatment for a neurological disorder or madness for four years. Sometimes, she has to be admitted to the mental hospital. My 62-year-old mother is suffering from a hearing problem since three years. So, keeping in mind the above things and the data available from the internet about the MMR vaccine, I want to know the chances of being affected adversely by MMR vaccines like autism and hearing problem?","Doctor":"Hello. As per current recommendations, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and Varicella vaccines can be given to your child at 15 months of age at different sites. There is no association of MMR vaccine with autism. The benefits far outweigh any risks.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

In the scanning, it showed that his prostate was minimally enlarged. After antibiotic treatment and based on the ultrasound report, the doctor prescribed Urimax 0.4 mg once per day.

Why is he passing urine a little early even before reaching the toilet?","Doctor":"Hello. This urgency and leak of urine are age-related.

I have Rh negative blood group. I was not given an anti-D injection the first time but I was given the second time. The doctor suggested an ICT test and it came positive which means there are antibodies in my body. Could you please tell me how could this impact on my future pregnancy? I am very worried.","Doctor":"Hello. Rh-negative pregnancy occurs when there is negative blood group in the mother and positive in the unborn child. The attacking agents called antibodies are produced by the mother which crosses the placenta and attacks the child. Usually, the first pregnancy is spared and from the second it becomes active. Anti-D injections prevent this and should be given after every childbirth or abortion. Once you are pregnant, from 16 weeks onwards start checking the ICT (indirect Coombs test) levels every month. When this crosses >1 in four titers you must get an ultrasound of the blood flow to the child's brain. If this condition gets severe, there is a provision for transfusion of the blood inside the womb in big centers. So, do not worry. With good advancements in technology, the prognosis is good.

I have seen the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) An ectopic pregnancy happens when the fetus starts developing at a location other than the uterus. In your case, the pregnancy is developing at the end of the left tube which is called the fimbria. You can see in the pictures that the uterus is empty and a sac-like structure is visualized in the location which is probably the end of the left tube.

What are these lumps? I have attached few pictures for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As your child is 10 months old, the upper teeth should have been erupted by this time. But three to six months delay is normal and it looks like your child is putting teether in his mouth and bitting it hard which is normal during teething. If the lower teeth are there, they also exert pressure if the child bites strongly on upper gums which also leads to this condition. Just check if there are no other lesions like this in the baby's mouth. If the child is irritable, you can use an over-the-counter analgesic gel, like Dologel (Choline Salicylate and Lidocaine Topical) over the lesion only and keep the area clean. Take lukewarm water and wipe the area with wet cotton and you can give the child a chilled teether to give relief. If there is associated fever that is also normal up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. If the lesion does not resolve in three to four, visit a pediatric dentist to get a treatment. But, from the picture, it looks like it is only a teething trouble and this will resolve on its own.

It is just a myth that your friend's child is lean because of marrying his sister's daughter. This is not true. Your child may not be gaining adequate weight for some other reason. Regarding fever, your child might be suffering probably from a viral infection like dengue. Platelet count is very low (2 lakh/mm3). Low platelet count can be caused by any viral infection per se, but now dengue cases are occurring.

I recently started chiropractic treatment for my back and neck pain. My chiropractor also taught me exercises that I should do at home daily. After about two months of two chiropractic sessions per week and daily exercises, my neck and back did get better. However, I realized that one of my ribs about two inches below my collarbone was popping out. I had trouble with breathing for about two days since my rib popped out. After about two days, the breathing problem subsided and there was no pain in the area. It did not hurt when I pushed down on it. I consulted my chiropractor about this problem and he said that my ribs were misaligned due to one of my daily exercises that I was told to do. That particular exercise involved pulling on a band with my shoulders. I feel like my ribs were misaligned due to the chiropractic sessions when he was pushing with pressure on my back and not the daily exercises. My chiropractor said that this could happen and there was nothing for me to worry about. He also said that I should continue doing my daily exercises. I do not know if I should continue to trust him or consult another doctor. Can my ribs really pop out because of shoulder exercises with a band?","Doctor":"Hello. Ribs or for that matter any bone is unlikely to pop out by simple exercises as the exercises are done for a short period of time and any displacement that would occur due to exercise is small and lasts the time you are exercising. Prominence and associated pain are more significant. Please send me a discrete photo of the swelling as the location helps to assess the cause. Most likely your rib swelling is located at the costochondral junction where bone and cartilage meet. I reassure you that this will settle with time and ask you to refrain from any resistive exercises at present. You need to ice the area nicely.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: The serum protein and creatinine levels are a bit high possibly due to increased protein intake or associated dehydration in recent times. Monocytes are mildly elevated and BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels are in the upper normal range. Monocytes may indicate ongoing chronic inflammation. It is only mildly elevated and does not have much significance. For polycythemia vera, hemoglobin levels or hematocrit levels are important. If they are normal, then there is nothing to worry. If the pain is in the fingertips and toes and if there is any associated tingling or burning sensation, we can think of peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements should be beneficial. Looking at other symptoms like chronic bloating, indigestion, stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea, gastritis, increased acidity in the stomach is a possibility. You need to use antacids along with proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole to reduce the acidity. You also need to reduce stress, avoid spicy foods, and take regular meals.

One of the side effects of GABA is anxiety and anxiety is a big cause of palpitations. This is why the Holter monitor is not showing anything to indicate a problem.  In the case of diastolic pressure up to 100 mmHg, this is a very common situation and it is not dangerous. But in general, I will advise you to lose weight very seriously. This will go a long way in helping you achieve normal blood pressure with reduced dependence on drugs. As the time goes on, if you do not reduce weight, your body's dependence on antihypertensives will increase. Talk to your physician about GABA.

My thyroid results are T3 at 4.6 pmol/L, T4 at 14.25 pmol, and TSH at 1.48 mcU. E2 66.4 pg/mL, progesterone at 0.81 ng/mL, testosterone at 0.25 ng/mL. I want to know if this is in order and I need your advice. I am currently on multivitamins, calcium, and vitamins.","Doctor":"Hello. Your thyroid profile is absolutely normal. Your other hormones show postmenopausal status which is normal at your age. For osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D which you are already taking. You should also start with hormone therapy for the shortest duration and lowest dose as it is not harmful This will help to strengthen your bones which is very important for osteoporosis.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a cough at certain times almost every day due to post-nasal drip. I take allergy medication (Cetirizine) but it does not seem to help. I have tried other techniques like lavage and have tried thinning my mucus by drinking more water, as advised by all the medical web sites. All the explanations I read online say that post-nasal drip is caused by a thickening of the mucus, that the mucus membranes make about a quart a day of mucus, which normally is thin enough to slide down the throat unnoticed and ends up in the stomach, but if it is too thick it is noticeable and it ends up going down the windpipe and needs to be brought up through coughing. Here is what I do not understand, normally the passage that is open is the trachea. The epiglottis only closes when swallowing, and furthermore it is behind the esophagus, so why the thin mucus which is sliding down our throat unnoticed does not go down into our lungs? It makes no sense. If I do not notice it and thus do not consciously swallow it, how does it go down the esophagus? It should be the opposite. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I am so delighted to read your query. My initial thoughts were that you were kidding. But when I thought I realized how beautifully you have thought about the question. We need to know about mucociliary clearance, direction of mucus movement, closure of airway by the epiglottis/supraglottis and by the glottis. Mucociliary movement occurs towards the throat and that is what brings the mucus towards the throat. Like you said, when the mucus gets thick due to allergy or infection or rhinitis, one gets a feeling of the movement. Cilia are small brush like extensions from cells which beat in a particular direction so as to drive the mucus film over the cilia towards the throat. From the throat, the brush border epithelium, that is the ciliated columnar respiratory epithelium pushes the mucus towards the pyriform fossa preferentially. The epiglottis and aryepiglottic fold and the inter arytenoid region form the supraglottic closure which acts as the first check point towards aspirating one's own saliva. The next check point is the glottis or the vocal cords which remain closed to prevent aspiration in such times. When the mucus drip is constant and thick then some microaspirations occur due to the nature of the mucus as well as due to any lax behavior of the closures causing some cough or chest infection. You must understand that the vocal cords, trachea and the respiratory pathways further below are also lined by ciliated epithelium which also have a mucus layer on top of them. This mucus layer traps smaller particles which escape the upper airways and bring them away from alveoli. They also moisturize the air we inhale. In your case, you need to arrest the cause that is causing the thick mucus. That is inside the nose. You need a steroidal nasal spray, taken in a particular way for a few weeks. This supplemented with an antacid like Protonix and Cetrizine will provide you lasting relief. You should also take mucolite for a few days to lighten the mucus. Couple this with steam and plenty of water. Avoid exposure to sun, smoke, pollution, and dust."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am not able to retract my foreskin from one month. Applying Betnovate ointment has not improved. Now inside the foreskin has become red and painful. Please suggest me medications.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. The problem of the tight foreskin is a month old and now it is associated with pain and redness. All the symptoms are indicating towards some sort of local infection. Infection can be any of these like contact dermatitis, sweat dermatitis, balanitis, eczema, or psoriasis etc. The type of infection can be ruled out only with the help of clinical examination. So I advise you to consult a urologist so that he can rule out the type of infection and can make a proper diagnosis. Once a proper diagnosis is made, it would be easier for you to get treatment and you will also come to know about your condition. Maintain local hygiene of penile area and wear comfortable inner garments too. Follow up after three weeks.

Earlier I gave her Maxtra and Levolin for five days. She had a cough for two to three days and it got settled. But, the cold was still there. So, I gave her Xyzal for three days with improvement in the cold and now again the cough has started. She is coughing in every 30-minute interval. What shall I do? Previously, she was down with typhoid fever one year ago and the immunity is very low now.","Doctor":"Hello. A frequent cough and cold are common in children in this age group unless it is associated with a high-grade fever. Do not panic. I suggest you give her some Mucolitic (Carbocisteine) syrup and an antiallergic or an antihistaminic syrup. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. In case there is an associated fever, consider an evaluation with a pediatrician before starting any antibiotics.

They had to put her to sleep soon after the surgery. I am assuming less than six months that she started having seizures. Could the surgery or medicine they used made her develop these seizures? She is on medications for the seizures.","Doctor":"Hello. It is highly unlikely for the medicine used during the surgery to cause the seizures now. Regarding the surgery causing this, the only possible explanation is the development of a stroke during or after surgery which can lead to seizures later. But, I guess she did not have stroke symptoms like facial deviation or limb weakness. So this is also less likely. However, we can get an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain done to look for the cause. If it is showing some structural abnormality like the previous stroke findings then we can assume that it might have occurred during the surgery. If not, then this is epilepsy which occurs due to electrical problems in the brain and is not related to any specific cause. Regards.

My poor fiance is constantly getting sucked into my expert level fight tornadoes. I am a master at it. It is like I am enjoying every bit of it. I truly do not want to. I wish I could change.

Following tips can help you tame your anger. We are basically trying to prevent you from acting out. Practice relaxation techniques like breath relaxation exercise daily. Whenever you feel like getting angry, breathe slowly and deeply from your diaphragm. You can either do reverse counting from 20 to zero or imagine a relaxing imagery while deep breathing. Many times logic defies anger. Try to tell yourself that anger is not going to solve the problem. Retrospectively think of an alternative behavior in that situation and try to change it. Regards.

My pain is in my neck and arm. I have occasional fever and night sweats. I am already using a cervical collar for a week now. I am using hard collar during the day and soft collar at night. I am undergoing physiotherapy which includes infrared ray treatment and neck traction. Until two weeks ago, I used to swim 30 minutes a day for five days of a week. However, the biggest challenge I am facing now is my left arm. My left arm is so weak and stiff. I cannot raise my left arm up and across while sitting. It can be done only when I am lying down. I had chronic fatigue syndrome about 10 years ago and recovered significantly. My current medication includes Lyrica 75 mg, Tramadol BP 50 mg and Clofenac 50 mg. Could you give an indication how long my recovery will take?","Doctor":"Hello. For further information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

You can take tablets of misoprostol by mouth, usually within 48 hours of mifepristone. Depending on the dose, this could be as soon as 6 hours after the mifepristone. Mifepristone causes the placenta to separate from the endometrium. It also softens the cervix and increases uterine contractions to allow the uterine contents to pass. Misoprostol causes uterine contractions so that your body passes the uterine contents. In some clinics, you may have asked to stay for 4 hours after misoprostol is given, because if serious side effects occur; they usually occur in this time period and can then be treated.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

According to your complaints, it looks like a BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) which is a problem occurring due to some calcium crystal deposition in the internal ear, the part which helps in maintaining a balance of the body. You need to visit a nearby neurologist or a physician for physical treatment with Epley maneuver. In rare cases, it could be a cerebellum-related problem which needs imaging studies. But first, we need to rule out benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. You will be fine in a few days. You need a referral to a neurophysician. Preventive measures include avoiding non-vegetarian foods for few weeks. Drink plenty of water. Avoid sudden waking up from bed or bending forward from a chair.

I gave up gluten, soy, and milk, and along with Levothyroxine, my health has been great. However, two years ago, I was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. After six months of treatment, I recovered. Then after having a second baby last year, I started having strange symptoms.  My symptoms included:Numb spots on my legs.Electric shock sensations between my legs.Cramps in my calves and ankles.TirednessI was very tired but I was also up all night with a new baby. So, I do not know if that is a symptom or not. Then early this year, I went for my yearly physical. It showed that my TSH was high. Apparently, after my son was born they put my medication to low (normally I take 100 mcg but they put me down to 75 mcg a day. I took this amount for four months. I then started taking 100 mcg a day again.A few weeks later, I developed chronic pain all over. This included cramps, burning and stinging sensations, and electric shocks. The first doctor thought it was just hormonal and said it would go away. After about three months, I finally saw an endocrinologist. He did a thyroid panel and everything was normal. So, he referred me to an internal medicine doctor. The internal medicine doctor thought it might be ‘active b12’ deficiency. They do not have the 'active b12' test where I live. So my doctor decided to treat me as if I had a b12 deficiency.So after taking some oral supplements, I was started on weekly injections for four weeks. My startup symptoms were rough, basically, I felt much worse - more electric shock sensations, joints popping, etc. Then I began to feel better. Then after my fourth injection, I was pain-free and feeling great.However, this only lasted about four or five weeks. Then the pain came back. My doctor then recommended one shot every day for six days, then weekly shots for six weeks. The week I was having a shot every day, I began to feel better again (though not quite pain-free). Once that was finished and I started with weekly shots it was more up and down. I began to notice a pattern. After each shot (Friday), I would feel a little worse but then by Wednesday, I would feel better (but not pain-free). After six weeks, I was pain-free but only for about five days. Then the pain came back and now I feel worse.I was negative for intrinsic factor (although I have read false negatives happen 50 % of the time). And as I stated before all my serum levels are normal. But I responded to the b12 therapy really well initially. Can you help me? I feel like my doctor is close to giving up on me.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have hypothyroidism and you are on treatment with Levothyroxine. It is known that hypothyroidism causes vitamin B12 deficiency over time and if you are on a high dose of Levothyroxine, then you have a high chance of having decreased calcium levels as well which is compensated by your bone demineralization process. So, you have basically another deficiency which is calcium as well. I suggest you take tablet Neurobion forte (Vitamin B complex) twice a day for your b12 deficiency and tablet Calcium 500 mg once daily spacing it four to six hours from Levothyroxine. Also, restart your Vitamin D 5000 IU daily. Mind you, these are recommended daily allowance (RDA) for a person. So, if you wish for a test, you can go ahead but the treatment plan will still remain the same. Hope you find my advice beneficial. Good luck.

However, this week, she had only the symptom lightly once in two days in a row. Otherwise, she had no other symptoms. I have attached the urine sample report. I also have urinalysis strips. On the day of the laboratory sample, the strip was positive for nitrites, but nothing for RBCs or leukocytes. We increased her mannose to 3 g for two days and then 2 g for three days. Then, the dipstick test showed leukocytes, nitrites and RBCS 200. Today, two tests showed traces or negative nitrites (3 hours bladder retention). However, the RBCs are still high at 200 and the urine sample showed a pink tinge. I have been given approval by a urologist to give my mother Fosfomycin. My mother's E. coli in the past have shown resistance to Bactrim, Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, etc. She has no symptoms at this point other than being more tired and she is 90. Someone told me if nitrites are getting less, she might be able to get over this incident without a formal antibiotic. She does take 15 mg Xarelto daily. It was ceased last night, but taken today again. Is Xarelto playing a factor here? She also used to take estrogen cream more regularly, but now once a week if she remembers it. She had spot bleeding on her underwear a few months ago around once or twice and an ultrasound showed nothing. She has an ovarian cyst.She drinks 1 to 1.25 liters of water daily. We are just trying to gauge the significance of the blood in the urine. She has no specific urinary symptoms, but more sleepy overall. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi.

You are suffering from hyperprolactinemia and borderline subclinical hypothyroidism. Both of which can cause delay in ovulation and hence irregularity in cycles. Ideally, menses between 23 to 35 days are considered normal as per definition. In your case, the concern is AMH levels (anti-mullerian hormone), which are indicators of ovarian reserve for ovums. It is not affected by day of the test or any other hormone like thyroid or prolactin.

I have visited orthopedic specialist he took x-ray of both legs, knees, and tell that it is an early stage of osteoarthritis of knee and he suggested for MRI and I had done MRI. In the MRI report it is mentioned that left knee has affected with osteoarthritis. After that, he gave some medicines for 10 days and referred to a physiotherapist for exercise and weight loss. I have visited as he told and now I reduce my weight. Now there is very little pain in my left knee but now my other joints, hips joints, like left hand thumb finger and both hand knees has popup sound during movement.

I had gone through your all reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Nothing looks like alarming except slightly low vitamin D levels. For yellow urine, I assure you it is totally insignificant as your all liver related test are normal including bilirubin level and fibroscan so do not go on chasing it I had seen doctor did all test which was very costly and not needed for your issues. So more doctor you go more test they will do. Now coming to your popping sound from joints, let me tell you it has nothing to do with stomach related issues if you are thinking of gas from the stomach causing this then forget it as it is not the cause. Poping most of the time is a normal phenomenon when cartilage or ligaments rub against bone. Some percentage of person have osteoarthritis which can lead to this but alarming poping is always with pain, swelling, redness, and deformity in walking. So chill I do not think you should worry about this thing unless the above symptoms present and at your age arthritis is very unlikely. So my advice is to regularize your daily activities which include milk for vitamin D in your diet. Do exercise of any kind for 45 minutes daily. For stomach upset, you can use syrup Gaviscon two tablespoons whenever you get symptoms as it is safe and locally acting.  Do not do doctors shopping."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently got EBV test done. My result was IgG positive and IgM negative. What does this mean? Is it life threatening like HIV? Is it contagious? Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. IgM (immunoglobulin M) negative and IgG (immunoglobulin G) positive means that you do not have acute infection, but may be a carrier of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which is not as dangerous as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and can be easily treated. You may develop symptoms of sore throat, swollen glands, fever, rashes, abdominal pain, cough and runny nose. Symptoms generally last for between a week and a month although it can recur when the body is under stress. EBV is contagious and spreads via saliva, often through kissing, sharing of drinks, eating utensils, toys, towels, etc. Treatment in children includes rest, plenty of fluids. Painkillers are usually prescribed to relieve fever and pain. If there is extensive swelling of the throat or glands which compromise breathing then steroids may be given.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I have no idea what has brought this on or whether it can be reversed. I am so stressed out. I have to be on my feet for my job for about four and a half hours every morning. Can this be tested to see if the nerve cells are either dead or just damaged and can it be reversed? This feels like it is going to ruin my life. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would agree with you on the fact that your symptoms could be related to a peripheral nerve damage.  Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting a neurologist and performing an NCS (nerve conduction study) to examine your nerves. Other tests to investigate the possible causes of your symptoms would be: You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

This has been there for approximately two months. I have attached photos for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern and I have viewed the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can see several dark nodular lesions on the back. I would keep a possibility of nodular prurigo or hypertrophic lichen planus. I suggest you use a topical ultrapotent steroid either Clobetasol propionate 0.05% or Betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% or Halobetasol propionate 0.05% twice daily. In addition to that, you may take oral antihistamines like tablet Cetrizine (Cetirizine) 10 mg once daily for symptomatic relief from itching. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Regards.

I have been feeling tired and hopeless. I want your help for recovery. I am currently on Fluvoxin 50 mg BD.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Depressive disorder or depression is a neurochemical disorder. A suicidal tendency is one main symptom of depression. You should be able to distinguish between mental disease and mental disorder. Your problem is a mental disorder and not a mental disease. These mental disorders are usually treated with a combination of medicines and other modalities like awareness, meditation, psychotherapy techniques, lifestyle changes, etc. Regards.

The doctor put her on Keppra 500 mg and she still gets her seizures and complains a lot of side effects. I am wondering is it catamenial epilepsy or PNES. Please advise. Of note, we are planning for a baby too.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that the catamenial epilepsy is a very specific type of epilepsy where a seizure occur every month at the same time closely related to the menstrual cycle. This type of epilepsy is usually refractory to many epileptic drugs. Anyway, the dose of Levetiracetam that your wife is taking is low. If she does not tolerate this drug, it is not possible to raise the doses. Coming to this point, considering the fact that you are planning to have a baby, I would recommend switching to Lamotrigine starting with very low doses and increasing gradually up to 100 mg per day. Further increase in the dose may be done later up to 200 mg daily if her seizures persist.  Another possible treatment would be Acetazolamide taken usually for some days every month before the time when seizures usually occur. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the above medicines. Meanwhile, I would recommend checking her thyroid hormone levels to exclude the possibility of thyroid dysfunction which may trigger seizures. I would also recommend to video register her seizures if possible in order to have a more professional opinion on the type of her seizures. It is not rare to have a normal EEG (electroencephalography) during seizures. That is why video registering is necessary. A prolonged EEG study for a week with video monitoring EEG or a sleep deprivation EEG would give more information on her seizures. Hope you find this answer helpful.

She is taking Eltroxin 50 mcg for hypothyroidism, Olmezest 20 mg for hypertension, Gemcal D3 and Kondro OD for osteoarthritis of the knee joints and Folvite for mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.6. Since the past one month, she reported mild to moderate pain in the middle portion of her waist joint. She had taken three to four Ultracet tablets, applied ointment, and a hot bag. Although the pain is reduced, the waist joint is not that flexible as one month before. When we spoke this to our orthopedic doctor, he advised starting the spinal exercise in addition to her daily quadriceps and hamstring exercises. I request you to share some details on what exact exercise is suitable for her waist pain, some video or image link on how to do that and the number of times she needs to do it. She currently does 30 times of quadriceps exercise twice daily and five times of hamstring exercises twice daily. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, quadriceps and hamstring exercises alone will not help in getting the waist pain corrected. She needs to do trunk rotation exercises, slow and rhythmic rotation to each side of the body left and right. Repeat them twice a day for a count of 15 times each. She needs to do cat and camel exercise. Ask your mother to come to a quadruped position with her hands and knees like a cat and now try to inhale and lift her spine up and remain for 10 seconds and exhale moving the spine downwards and head up. Repeat this for 15 times each twice a day. Bridging exercises could be done. The patient has to lie on the bed with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Now slowly lift up the waist and the pelvic area upwards keeping the feet flat on the floor. Do this thrice a day with 10 counts in each session. Remember every exercise should be performed slowly and do not exert pressure. Continue for one month and follow up after that.

I have ordered blood tests done last week. She is on daily pills. She is on Aspirin 81 mg, Oxybutynin 5 mg, Docusate 200 mg Vitamin D3 at 2000 units, Estradiol 0.5 mg, Folic acid 1 mg, Centrum Silver daily tablet, Gabapentin 1200 mg, Lialda 2.4 g, Senna two tablets, Lorazepam 1.5 mg, and Oxycodone 10 mg three per day. Her albumin is 3.3, AST 46, ALT 90, hemoglobin 10.7, and hematocrit 33.1, iron 19, and saturation percent is 7. Everything else is normal. She is scheduled to go see a doctor in two days. Is it fine for her to wait for two days? She has started on iron supplements. Are there any suggestions? Lab reports have been enclosed.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I understand you are worried about your mother's health. She has got a surgery and due to that too there is also some weakness in this phase of convalescence. Her blood tests show a little lower than normal hemoglobin. But this is all that we can expect after a major surgery. Iron supplements will cover up her deficiencies but it will take some time to kick in. This is not something that needs an urgent attention unless there are severe symptoms that warrant a blood transfusion. Some of them can be shortness of breath, extreme and debilitating weakness, unable to move around etc. Her liver enzymes AST (aspartate transaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) are on higher sides. This increase in liver enzymes can be due to any reason ranging from surgery, medications or a prior liver disease. Her physician can guide her better in this regard. To me, it is fine to wait for her next appointment and keep taking medications as prescribed. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent, continue the medicines. Hope it helps. For more information consult a general medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been bitten by a stray dog on the left leg on March 10th. The next day I went to a nearby doctor and he advised me to take two doses of vaccine as I had taken three doses earlier before four years. There was no blood visible at the wound and I washed it in soapy water also for five to ten minutes but from March 23 I am feeling pulsating sensation at the bite site often, they come and go. It does not happen always. I have consulted with four nearby doctors and they all told me this not a sign of rabies. So is it for rabies or for extreme anxiousness? The dog is still alive and fine.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Firstly, yes this is not a symptom of rabies and it would have progressed by now if it was rabies. Also, since you are vaccinated and the dog is still alive, you are unlikely to get rabies. So, it is unlikely to be rabies and trust local doctors. Also, keep watch over the symptoms. So, you should not worry at present."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I wish to know what are the practical chances of me being infected with HIV from only receiving unprotected oral sex. It happened multiple times in the course of a one-hour encounter with a CSW. There was absolutely no vaginal or anal intercourse. Exactly one month after this encounter, I suffered somewhat flu and common cold type condition. It developed as follows:  Day 1: It started in the afternoon with continuous sneezing (mostly dry, but not entirely)   Day 2: I started feeling a scratchy sensation in the throat. The sneezing lasted but less frequent.   Day 3: The throat sensation continued, getting worse. Mild coughing with a runny nose though not severe and little nasal congestion. Mild body aches at times here and there. Slight malaise type feeling.   Day 4: Throat discomfort and coughing sensation.   Day 5: Constant coughing, throat pain, throat discomfort, breathing problem, getting worse. Deep mouth-inhaling resulting in a cough.  There was no rise in body temperature, no noticeable fatigue, no serious or persistent body ache, no trouble doing usual chores, no unusual body rashes, and no unusual gastrointestinal problem. I visited the GP on the fifth day of this encounter. He examined my chest with a stethoscope and said no serious cough in the chest and that my condition may be from some mild viral attack, nothing serious. My queries are :  What are the chances based on the encounter described above of me having HIV assuming my partner was HIV-positive?   Are the symptoms being experienced by me HIV related?","Doctor":"Hello. Before clarifying your doubts, I just want to let you know a few basic details about HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and its transmission. HIV is spread mainly by having an unprotected anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV, sharing needles or syringes of an infected person, or from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Transmission from homosexual males is more than transmission from a female to male. HIV can also be affected by receiving blood transfusions and blood products. About your query, every infection does not need to be related to HIV and having unnecessary anxiety as does your general physician states. Without knowing the health status of your partner, we cannot judge the acquaintance of HIV virus. If you are in doubt, you can go for HIV investigation to confirm this. Without any proper evidence of active infection, there will not be any point in making this diagnosis. Regards.

For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Pulse rate remains on lower side during rest and sleep and on the upper side during activity, fear, fever etc. During exercise, it may go well beyond 100.  Monitors are machines, these are not error-free. For confirmation of your pulse rate, the best way is to count your pulse for one full minute. If it is within range of 60 to 100, it is perfectly normal.

A month ago he was not taking any medication and was not performing any exercise. At that time, his sugars were around 380. Now he is doing some yoga and playing volleyball. Suddenly, his sugars decreased a lot to around 100. Our family doctor suggested that this would have happened because he was not eating on time. The last couple of days he was suffering from low sugar which is causing him vertigo and sweating. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern.  You have not mentioned if your father is currently taking any medication for blood sugar control. If he is still not taking any medication and has managed to control blood sugar just by diet and exercise, his efforts are really great. For low blood sugar, he might just need some dietary modification. But if he is on medication and his blood sugar is dipping down, his prescription might need to be revised. A blood sugar of 100 is not very low (if in fasting state) and may not cause dizziness. Sometimes dehydration may cause symptoms similar to low blood sugar. So check if his water intake is adequate. Also, it is a good idea to check his blood pressure since variation in blood pressure can lead to similar symptoms.

A week ago my thumb became numb below the fingernail. It was numb for two days and this went away. Now my left middle finger and the ring finger are numb and my right thumb feels sore. I also have a burning sensation in the feet, sometimes it feels like there is water or ice on my feet. My right knee feels stiff and then I switch to my left knee. My doctor looked confused and said it was all anxiety. Really, I do not think so. Could this be an early sign of diabetes?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read through your question and I would like to tell you that peripheral neuropathy can happen in a patient with diabetes which does present in the form of burning sensation in the feet and neuropathic pain. At your age, type 1 diabetes that is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is more common. It can be diagnosed by a blood sugar profile. I would advise you to get an ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), RF (rheumatoid factor), and CRP (C-reactive protein) done to diagnose the cause of the stiffness. If these tests come clear then most likely it a neuropathic pain caused due to a nerve compression for which we may need to get an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). In the meanwhile, I suggest you can start taking tablet Neurobion Forte (multivitamin supplement) and let me know if you feel any improvement.

The old protocol dictates one should try Rose K contact lenses though it will improve vision but will not affect the progression of the disease. It also increases scarring. Nowadays one should straight away go for C3-R (Corneal Collagen Crosslinking with Riboflavin), a small procedure that will strengthen the cornea and will prevent progression of the disease and it is not that costly.

Since a year, after my surgery, I have what seems to be smegma covering my inner labia. It is not in my vagina but covers the skin in the folds of my lips. I shower daily but stopped using soap 10 years ago because it was too irritating. I occasionally use soap, but no more than once a week. Every day when I shower, my skin is covered in thick white stuff that I almost have to scrape off. Sometimes there is a bit of smell, but nothing strong. I have had problems with yeast in the past which seemed to be linked to other inflammation in my body. I had some problems with vaginal itching, but a round of OTC cream cleared it up. Mostly this is embarrassing. I was single for quite a while, but have a fiance now. I cannot afford health insurance and gynecological visits. I also have psoriasis on my scalp, ears, and toenails. Could this be psoriasis? Is this just the way my vagina functions now after my hysterectomy? Is there anything that I can do? All that Google has to say about it is that I am unhygienic which is not my problem. Any help is much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. If you had a history of recurrent yeast infections then get high vaginal swab culture test and check your fasting blood sugar and postprandial blood sugar. According to the culture report, the above is the treatment that should be given. Is your partner having problems in his private parts? I suggest you go to some gynecologist in a government set up and get a clinical exam done to look exactly what is going on. Generally, after removal of both ovaries, the hormone production ceases then the senile changes appear. But, your one ovary is still there and we can check its functioning by measuring the FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) levels in the blood.

Her recent scan showed endometrium was 16 mm thick. She has crippling pains, and she is completely immobile during her period, and sometimes in between. It is getting worse month by month. She is infertile. It is painful going to the toilet when on her period. She often has migraines. She has huge agonizing pain, that does not feel better with Ibuprofen or Paracetamol. The pain starts two days before her period and majority of it ending 1 to 2 days after she starts bleeding. She describes the pain as an extremely heavy weight pushing down on her abdomen, vagina, and bottom. This is happening from the past 6 to 7 years, but it is getting worse over the past 6 to 7 months. A local doctor prescribed Clotrimazole and Tinidazole. I personally think a Progesterone cream is the best course of action, yet it interferes with the Clotrimazole, so I do not know what course of action to take. We did try the Minidril pill, but it messed up her hormones pretty bad, and she started feeling suicidal, so we stopped. The pain has started happening midway through her cycle now and is getting worse and worse. She becomes completely immobile, not even able to get herself to the toilet, and I have to carry her.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The problem of hair fall arises if the person loses more than 100 strands of hair which tends to make a visible scalp leading to androgenetic alopecia or male pattern baldness. The main culprit is the DHT-dihydrotestosterone (the pivotal androgen in men) to which the hair is sensitive to, therefore DHT blockers will prevent hair fall. None required. Androgenetic alopecia. The treatment for hair loss has an individual variability, not all treatments will suit for all people and the treatment takes a minimum of 6 months for its full effect. 1. You can continue with Grocapix gel (Capixyl) and Capsule Logihair for now, since these treatments will take some amount of time to show the effect. 2. A new technique called platelet-rich plasma can be tried which should be taken in an interval of 2-3 weeks for 5-6 sittings. 3. Other treatments include Minoxidil, Saw Palmetto lotion and lasers.

But, chance for recurrence is always there. It use to occur in people with diabetes, hypertension or on any other medications for immunosuppression. More common chance of recurrence is due to tight clothing, poor ventilation of that area by wearing frenchie.

Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have gone through your query and have seen the photos of your third molar region (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a condition called as pericoronitis, that is, inflammation of the pericoronal flap that gets raised when the third molar is erupting. There is no need to worry. Buy a bottle of Hydrogen peroxide. Put four caps full of hydrogen peroxide in a glass of water and rinse thoroughly four to five times daily it will be alright. In case it gets reinfected, then you have to go for a minor surgical procedure called as operculectomy. In that treatment, the flap which is infected will be cut under local anesthesia, and it will not be painful. In case you have an infection lasting more than five days, then take an antibiotic for three days such as tablet Amoxicillin Clavulanate 625 mg twice a day for three days.

First of all, I would like to inform you that spermatogenesis is a long process and the sperm cells produced already may be available for the next two and a half months (72 days).

So I came to my hometown and started seeing my family dentist to whom my entire family is going for a couple of years. One week ago, I started the treatment which was deep cleaning on one side of the teeth. I always dreaded about cross-contamination and I explained this to my doctor who showed me their autoclaving procedure and also the instruments used by him was removed from a sealed pouch by him in front of me and so were the gloves and I was happy about the safety protocol. Yesterday, I went for my second sitting and during the part where the anesthesia was given to my gums, the instruments used was as usual removed from a sealed pouch by him but for the actual cleaning part which was done in an adjacent clinic, the nurse who helped him gave the dental motor probe and the tweezer in an open tray. I immediately asked both the nurse and the doctor about this and both assured and swore that those instruments were the ones that were removed from the sealed pouch and the nurse had brought it to this room with the help of a tissue paper and I need not be scared about the cross-contamination as they do not ever use the instruments on others. He even took me to the autoclave room and showed me how the procedures are done and explained to me how the attendees and nurses are instructed to adhere to the rules. Since I have cross-contamination phobia, I am unable to believe him though I want to. The time difference between the last patient and me was about 10 to 15 minutes. It was an airconditioned room. I have no idea about the last patient's medical history. He was a middle-aged person and a laser treatment was done for him but again I have no clue what sort of treatment he had.

Your symptoms are mostly dizziness, which worsens with sudden eye movements or body movements, and are sometimes associated with headaches. Based on the symptoms, the most common cause in your age group is a vestibular migraine or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). I assume you do not have any other risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke or diagnosis of epilepsy. A simple neurological exam using Dix Hallpike Maneuver can help differentiate between BPPV and vestibular migraine. Also, further questions on the quality of headache, location and associated symptoms such as light sensitivity, loud noise sensitivity and nausea are other important questions, that can happen with vestibular migraine. Treatment for BPPV is physiotherapy with some specific exercises and medicines such as Topiramate or Valproic acid for vestibular migraine.

I have reviewed your query and can well understand you are worried about the lesions (bumps) on the corner of your lips. There are many reasons behind this kind of lesions.

No specific treatment is needed for that too. In worst case scenario, it can be cancer due to any reason. Mostly, smokers are the target of this type of serious disease.

I found a new doctor with whom I am having problems. The doctor diagnosed me with diabetes 24 years ago when I was 39. I was tried on a couple of different types and dosages of pills, but I cannot remember the names and was eventually placed on insulin. Currently, on Lantus and NovoLog. I asked her several times which type I have and she said it was type 1. She got me through a pregnancy at age of 39 and also approximately five years ago I was hospitalized with ketoacidosis. Shortly after my pregnancy, I was diagnosed and treated for Graves disease and I am currently on Synthroid. After having to select a different doctor, he said I could not possibly be type 1 since I was 39 and that I was type 2. He wanted me to stop insulin and try Metformin. I said no to stopping insulin but would add Metformin if he wanted to see what it would do. I took it for one month but I could not tolerate it due to GI issues and refused to continue it. My last A1c was 7.2 one month ago but frankly, I thought it would be higher since the last six months dealing with my mother's Alzheimers and getting her into a nursing home and father getting sick and dying recently and dealing with Medicaid insurance issues with both parents. Things are now beginning to settle down. A1c prior to this last one, six months prior was 6.7. I looked at my lab report in the electronic medical record and am concerned about my kidney function. He told me last year that my kidneys looked fine but the labs show a GFR of 57.51. A repeat GFR in six months was 59.41. He has not mentioned kidney function since. Is not this indicative of chronic kidney disease stage 3? What should I do about it? The previous doctor did put me on Enalapril Maleate, not for hypertension but to help the kidneys. He keeps wanting to stop it since my blood pressure is 90/60. It has always been that as long as I remember. I am also having trouble with not knowing when I am hypoglycemic. It gets down to about 35 before I notice anything. I told him but he did not seem too concerned one way or the other. I have tried to find another doctor but there are not many internal med specialists around here. Kindly suggest me what should be done.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you indeed have type 1 diabetes. Regarding your hypoglycemia, I would suggest that you decrease the dose of NovoLog (insulin aspart injection) by two units in the morning and night. Your kidney function has decreased so I suggest you discontinue Metformin and just take insulin only. I suggest you continue with Enalapril no matter what your blood pressure readings are. It would certainly help with the kidney function improvement.  If your blood pressure drops too much then only in that case break the tablet Enalapril in half and take half a tablet daily. If your blood sugar drops again to less than 100 then the next time further decrease the dose of NovoLog by two units. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and do all the changes in the medicines with their consent. Hope you find my advice beneficial.

Your HbA1c is in good control and the other parameters are within the normal range. ACR is slightly high. You need to recheck the albumin-creatinine ratio after three months. Please repeat your uric acid levels after two weeks. If it is still high, you may need medication. In the meantime, continue all the medicines as you are taking. There is no need to worry. Do check your BP regularly and fasting blood sugar after two weeks and follow-up, please. As you are 68 years old, you need to take Aspirin tablet 75 mg for cardioprotection.

Since then I have not encountered any blood clot and have been on Acitrom 5 mg, Ecosprin 75 mg and Azathioprine 100 mg. Three weeks back neurologist had replaced Azathioprine with HCQ 300. My ANA test was done before changing. ANA result was negative. Now for the last two days, I am experiencing pain near the heart line. The pain lasts for around one minute. Pain is such that it starts from deep inside and it pulls the skin/organs inwards. I have experienced such pain three to four times since two days. My query is, is this due to a change in medication? Whether HCQ be stopped and Azathioprine be restarted? What is the use of Azoran in APS and are these both drugs somewhat similar? Kindly guide as I am worried. Should I continue with HCQ and if not is Azoran safe in the long run? I am taking Azoran for more than 2.5 years.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. What treatment did you get during Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome? Was your APLA, LA test was positive? Azoran is an immunomodulatory drug and has some role in APLA syndrome. HCQS is a good drug for APLA as it has an anti-inflammatory plus anticoagulant effect but your symptoms started after three weeks of HCQS. Please try to consult your physician as he has examined you and he knows complete details. So he can guide that Azoran should be restarted or not? According to my opinion in your case, I think you should restart Azoran and stop HCQS."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 57-year-old male and the results of my recent annual resting echo showed the following:  Tri-leaflet aortic valve with well-compensated moderate regurgitation (2-3/4) as well as mild aortic sclerosis but no stenosis. Normal size left ventricle (130 mL) and no evidence of hypertrophy or remodeling. Low normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 54. A normal right ventricle size and function. Mildly dilated left atrium. Mildly dilated aortic root (41 mm) and ascending aorta (41 mm).  In addition, it is noted that my resting ejection fraction last year was 64 and my stress echo taken this year (for atypical chest pain) was 62. My cardiologist says all my echo parameters are stable and he does not want to see me for another year. Despite my cardiologist reassuring me and I having nothing to worry about, I remain a little concerned about the drop in my ejection fraction from last year to this year. Should I be worried about this or is it still in the normal range?","Doctor":"Hello. So, due to all the above reasons, I think this borderline value of ejection fraction is due to a measurement variation. I do not think it has dropped significantly and there is no need for excessive worries. At this stage of regurgitation, it only needs monitoring. Surgery is considered in case of severe regurgitation, significantly enlarged ventricles along with low ejection fraction. So, no need to worry and the future plan should be monitoring with echoes.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have been to the doctor and received Amoxicillin and steroids for it as well as Ciprodex ear drops and a Bromide nasal spray but my ear is still plugged. I woke up last week with this condition and debilitating vertigo as well. This is the first time I have had such debilitating vertigo in general. I went to urgent care and received a shot of Zofran to stop the nausea and purging. The dizziness has tamed down a bit, but still, I get woozy when I turn my head or look up and down. I am worried about the lasting condition of my ear and would love some help as I have not been to an Otolaryngologist yet.","Doctor":"Hi. Your ear bulging is mostly because of eustachian tube dysfunction and middle ear inflammation. Use nasal decongestant drops as Otrivin while lying down on your back and your head is lower than your whole body (Trendelenburg position). Chewing gums may help in opening the obstructive eustachian tube too. Now about vertigo, it is now related to certain positions as looking up or down. So, this type of vertigo is related to your inner ear. Many drugs can end this vertigo but it has a dramatic side effect as it destroys the normal compensatory mechanism of your vestibular system. So, the best choice is to get help from an audiovestibular specialist who can help you performing a maneuver (something like physical therapy) in the form of 1 or 2 visits after which the vertigo can be completely treated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About six weeks ago, I had protected sex with a male. About two weeks later, I developed a cold, which got better. Now, I have been feeling random zings (not really painful) in my armpit. I have also got five “pimples” in a cluster on my back. Do I need to be worried about HIV?","Doctor":"Hello. Protected sex is safe and there is no risk of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Having cold or flu is not a specific symptom or sign of HIV. Cold is otherwise very common in the general population and is not a reason to suspect HIV. For pimples, I would suggest you use a triple antibiotic like Neosporin ointment (Bacitracin Topical, Neomycin, and Polymyxin) twice daily. I do not think you even need to worry about HIV. Moreover, since it has already been six weeks from your sexual encounter, you may take a fourth generation HIV screening test for your own satisfaction that is HIV combo test (p24 antigen and anti-HIV antibody). The results would be conclusive. Regards. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old female. I was submitted to myopia correction surgery (LASEK) some eight months ago. The surgery was successful and the ophthalmologist said my vision was at 100%. Before that, I had used glasses since I was 12 for myopia and astigmatism. My myopia kept evolving and I had to wait until it was stable enough to perform the surgery. I am not sure if this is relevant but both my parents wear glasses for myopia and now for presbyopia as well since they are in their 50s but my 16-year-old younger brother does not wear glasses. However, for my new job, I spend eight hours a day in front of a computer plus it has a lot of white bright lighting. Sometimes at the end of the day, my eyes feel tired and dry. I even put lubricant drops throughout the day but still, they get dry. I am afraid that because of that my myopia will come back. So, I thought I could use reading glasses while I am on the computer to help prevent it and filter the blue light from the screen. Do you think that is beneficial or it would be a waste of money? Is there any evidence that reading glasses help prevent reoccurrence of myopia? Of note, in the past I have been on Sertraline 50 mg one pill a day, Alprazolam 0.25 mg one pill a day, Sodic Levothyroxine 125 mcg one pill a day, and an oral contraceptive.","Doctor":"Hello. There are three reasons for your dry eyes. You make sure of the following: The display of your screen should have a good resolution. For example, a retina display and the height of the screen should be just below the eye level. Every 20 minutes move your eye from the screen and gaze at an object as far as possible for 20 seconds and then get back to work. Blink your eyes for at least 15 to 20 times per minute. Make a rule that whenever you click on a mouse you need to blink. Take a break every 45 minutes for five minutes. Use your lubricant four to six times a day and whenever your eyes feel tired. The light in your room should come from behind your head and not in front of you. As long as the reading glasses are concerned, use at work if you have a refractive error. The above steps will definitely give you relief.

However, all my symptoms are that of anorexia, restricting food intake, starving and inducing vomiting. I have lost my weight from 73 kg to 58 kg. I have been confused, immensely, since then regarding what illness do I really have? My query is can a person show symptoms of anorexia but not be anorexic? Can they just have an eating disorder?

Anorexia is a type of eating disorder where the weight is 85 % or below the normal range. In addition to eating disorder symptoms like restricted food intake, self-induced vomiting, menstrual disturbances, etc., the body weight has to be 15% below normal to diagnose anorexia nervosa. Based on your reported weight and height, your body weight and BMI (body mass index) fall within the normal range. Perhaps that is why your counselor may have said it is an eating disorder and not anorexia nervosa. Irrespective of this technicality, it is important to get appropriate treatment to address the eating disorder cognitions and behavior which is important.

My colleague and I managed to push the chairs away from me. Eventually my right hand was sore causing me to hand tingling feels and irritation to cold weather which I did not have before but no pain. This Monday that had gone by it started causing me burning sensations on both my back hand including the one that has not been injured. It was extremely discomfortable and unpleasant feeling. I even found it hard to sleep at night. By Tuesday and Wednesday it began to slowly progress the burning sensations, inflammation towards my wrist and towards my arms through the biceps and even towards my neck. I have started taking Amitriptyline, and anti inflammatory medicines which have slightly helped but not much. I did see an emergency doctor in between and suggested that it could be potentially CRPS or nerve irritation but they cannot know for certain. Due to the pandemic of Covid-19 it is very difficult to see any doctors at this present moment and I am self-isolating myself at home. Having said that I am very worried about my situation and would like to get more clarity to this situation. Is this a continuous problem that will go on? Is this CRPS and if so can I recover? Can it be a nerve compression and is my nerves misfiring or is this a sign of recovery? Currently, these are the following feelings I currently experience burning sensations in my hands and neck now, hypersensitivity skin irritations wearing clothes using blankets, etc., affected areas feel weak and sore.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are suggestive of a pinched nerve (nerve compression). The nerve compression could be on the wrist (carpal tunnel or) or in the neck (a possible bulging intervertebral disk), which is causing radicular nerve pain in the arm and hand. For this reason, it would be necessary consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam, a cervical spine x-ray study and nerve conduction studies. Anyway, considering the virus infection, I think that all these tests can wait as it is not a serious medical condition. I would recommend avoiding weight loss and wearing a splint in the hand during the night (wrist splint for carpal tunnel syndrome), which you can find in the drug store. If it helps improve your situation, it would indicate carpal tunnel syndrome as the main cause underlying your complaints. I would also recommend taking Gabapentin, to help relieve the burning sensation.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old male and I need you to tell me if it seems like I could have a heart rhythm problem.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

This is a hormonal contraceptive pill which could reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding. This will occur in this cycle as well as probably in all your next cycles and this is entirely normal. The recommendation is to continue the pills for 21 days throughout and then wait for 7 days. Again, start a fresh pack from the 8th day.

My left leg was burned so bad that the hospital wanted to amputate, but my parents refused. I am 36 years old now. My circulation has gotten increasingly worse as I have aged to the point that I have severe neuropathy in my left leg and right foot. Winter is severely painful. My leg and feet will turn extremely purple and freezing cold and it is difficult to get the temperature back to normal and the feeling to return. I have tried pressure hose, warmer clothes, etc. It does not work. I was wondering if there is anything I can do besides warm shower, laying putting my feet up, and a warming blanket. It takes all of this to get my legs to stop hurting and it takes a couple of hours each time. It is directly affected by temperature. In the summer I cannot sweat. So, my legs swell. In the winter they turn purple and I cannot walk. I just hate this. I cannot stand the pain and the way it interferes with my life every day.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I did try to put olive oil. And also I did not suffer from cold or flu lately.","Doctor":"Hello. From the details you have given in your query it seems to me that it is indeed wax only. As it pushes against the eardrum and further increases the block when you smile, laugh or wink, it is more likely impacted wax than anything else. However, one can be sure of that only if you see inside through an otoscope. If the doctor looked in through an otoscope and then said it as ear wax then it is most probably correct. In such a case you may apply Soliwax or Waxsolve ear drops of five to six drops around five times a day for four to five days. After that get the pliable wax removed at an ENT clinic. However, if the doctor had not used an otoscope to see into the ear, then we cannot be sure about whether it is wax or anything else. Since you are ruling out nose and throat infection, the ear block can be due to any furuncle or localized infection in the ear canal which is blocking the canal and increases the occlusion when you smile, wink and laugh.

She is 30 years, 5 feet 1 inch and 63 kg, working in the IT sector. She is married for the last three years and seriously trying for conception from a year. She missed her period once in the beginning of this year. During her obstetrics consultation, beta hCG was done. It was repeated after two days. A transvaginal ultrasound scan was done and repeated after 10 days. The end result was diagnosed as a blighted ovum. So, it was evacuated by D and C.Our daughter is of normal build and nutrition. Her menstrual history was normal since the beginning in terms of cycle, duration, and flow. But, one month after D and C, she did not have her period. On the doctor’s advice, she took some medicines and bleeding occurred. She was known hypothyroid. So, she was taking Thyroxin 50 or 75 to keep the TSH near about 2.5 Uiu/ml. Her Hb % and sugar are within the normal range.Again, she tried to conceive since three months ago along with Aspirin and folic acid. She missed her period last month. Her beta hCG was 9.20 mIu/ mL. It was repeated after two days. It came down to 1 Miu/ml suggestive of 'chemical pregnancy'. This time, after a few days, a spontaneous jelly-like bleeding occurred for two days. I would like to add that her husband requires to take Penegra 50 mg tab before a performance. Our daughter is immunized with triple antigen, polio, MMR, chickenpox and hepatitis B vaccine in childhood. The transvaginal scan (done at a later phase of the first conception) showed normal anatomical and physiological pattern of the ovary and uterus to me at least (report attached).Two consecutive miscarriages brought great disappointment to all. Presently, the doctor told her to take Aspirin 150 mg, folic acid, and Vitamin B12 combination tablet and to try for pregnancy again.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He was given intravenous and Ativan. He was discharged from the hospital and he will go to his doctor regarding his meds. The problem is he was never told if he needs to stay away from certain foods that might cause his serotonin levels to elevate. I was just reading online about foods to avoid with serotonin syndrome and after reading this I am not sure what he can eat. Sadly, the hospital did not give him any information on what he could eat. There is a list of foods that increase serotonin levels which include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as tuna, and those high in tryptophan, an amino acid found in eggs, soy and soy beverages, turkey, eggs, pumpkin seeds, peanuts and peanut butter, chicken and cheeses. A diet rich in folate may also contribute to increased serotonin levels. Some foods rich in folate include leafy green vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts, bread, and cereals. It sounds like there really is nothing he can eat without worrying about causing any additional problems. After reading all this, what can he eat? This is extremely scary as I have no clue about what he can and cannot eat.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Before opting for ovulation induction in your case, it would be important to learn if your partner's semen analysis is normal on the first hand. Your cycle seems to be regularly irregular, which is often seen in cases of women with estrogen deficiency and the ones with progesterone deficiency. As you have mentioned that your thyroid is normal, but my primary concern with regards to ovulation remains the estradiol levels, FSH, LH, AMH, serum testosterone on day 3 of your cycle and serum progesterone on day 21 of your cycle. Without having these reports handy, it would not be recommended to opt for Clomiphene citrate to induction ovulation. Please share your latest ultrasound pelvis as well to check for your endometrial thickness in proliferative or mid-cycle. Also, app tracker for LH is futile, rather it is suggested if you can opt for LH ovulation kits to actually determine your LH surge during cycle as that would be more objective."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The person is currently suffering from a thrombosed hemorrhoid vein. The treatment which the doctor has proposed is Movicol a stool softener 1-0-0, Daflon 2-2-2-0 for the first four days and afterwards for three more days 2-0-2-0, and Anusol a local cream to apply to the outside of the anus. My question is could the PSA values be related to the thrombosis syndrome? Or is there a reason to check the prostate gland independent of the lower intestine syndrome? What should be done in terms of the follow up of the prostate gland monitoring, tests, frequency, treatment and follow-up over time? Many thanks for your help and support.","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I will try to remain as simple as possible in my conversation so that everything is pretty much clear and easy understandable to you.  I have seen the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values in your attached laboratory reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I appreciate the efforts you put in to upload the reports. I want to add that on looking only the PSA values in this range concludes nothing. We usually take this first reading as a baseline result and compare future results with this PSA level to see if the values are going up or down. The future values when compared to this reference baseline value, give us a clue if there is any disease and its progression or regression. Only the PSA levels especially the ones you presented in attachments never concludes that it is a prostate cancer.  Urologist has to take complete history to see if there is some blockage to urine flow due to enlargement of prostate. Actually prostate gland has a tough and non-expandable covering capsule around it. If there is any growth as a tumor inside this gland, it causes a pressure on the urethra. The urethra (urine pipe) is passing through this prostate gland en route to penis opening. Any local lesion causes the urethra to get obstructed causing issues with flow of urine (urinary symptoms).  Urologists may also go for serial diagnostic tests and radiological imaging studies to see if there is an abnormal growth inside. So an in-person evaluation from an urologist is necessary and to keep a follow up is the best strategy as I think he will go for look and see policy. He will go for a conservative approach or as appropriate.  Follow up may be done after 6-8 weeks for redoing the laboratory investigations and all that.  Regarding thrombosed hemorrhoids, I want to explain that it is a different disease and has little to absolutely no relation with the prostate as is in this patient.  Treatment given by the physician for hemorrhoids is all good to go without any change. Sometimes we have to send the patient for surgical resection of the thrombosed vein area. You have not uploaded pictures of the anus. Otherwise, I may have been in a better position to assist you in its management options that best suits in this specific patient. I also want to see and know the color of the anal lesion. Picture will also help to decide whether it is a healing or a non-healing hemorrhoid. Also please add, how long has he been having hemorrhoids? And since when these thrombosed veins are there? If there is still burning or any kind of discomfort in anal area, I suggest you to apply ProCort rectal ointment outside and inside using a special applicator that comes with the ointment. 1. Avoid constipation. Keep a judicious supply of fluids. 2. Bland diet is best for him. 3. Physical activity is necessary as much as possible easily.

Urticaria is a disease where there is a transient vascular reaction in the skin due to some allergens. The eruptions are usually raised skin rashes with redness and severe itching.

This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Later in school, I have been bullied for 4 years constantly, physical and mentally by my \\"school friends\\". Could not get into relationship till 25th year old, had 7 times sex, with 10 seconds each. Troubling to stay erect, fast ejaculation, and even lower self-confindence than before. Now I am troubling and overthinking what will happen next time, will there be next time, although it is hard to get into relationships because of that, cannot stop pressuring myself with being bad in bed and unexpirienced, as time pass, it only gets worse.","Doctor":"Hello. I am so sorry to hear about your situation, I can imagine how hard it is for you. So you are describing a few things here, when is the problem of premature ejaculation, second is performance anxiety which is making you overthink, third is low self confidence. Probably that came from the bullying and the trauma that you endured. I would suggest you to start therapy sessions to help you build your confidence which will help you in decreasing the performance anxiety and then it will of course improve the problem of premature ejaculation. If the mental health is stable, sexual issues often resolve. Is there some neurological issues you will need to talk to a neurologist or a urologist for that. Try doing kegel exercise regularly which will help you in strengthening the muscle of pelvis which helps in premature ejaculation. Apart from that you will require therapy sessions to work on your confidence building and reducing anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy will help you in achieving this."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I was recently in a sexual encounter with a sex worker. It was a condom-protected sex.

I saw many doctors and had a nasal septum deviation surgery last year too, to control the allergies but nothing helped. I have to take antihistamines twice every day. I take 180 mg Telfast. The symptoms are very similar to having the flu. I have a runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing, extremely itchy nose, and cough every now and then. It is impossible to control them now.

When I wear a cap during the night (helps a lot with the morning crisis). When I apply some pressure on my nose, on both sides. When I take any medicine that has an antihistamine.

The color Doppler of cavernosal arteries was done after an intracavernosal injection of 0.8 ml of Papaverine (30 mg/ml) into the right corpus cavernosum. The initial diameter of the cavernosal artery prior to Papaverine injection was 0.5 mm, and after the injection, it became 0.9 mm.

After 10 minutes, the diastolic pressure reduced. The flow was present continuously in the dorsal vein. The PSV in a flaccid state was 0 and in the erect state at 5 minutes was 7.45 cm/sec, at 10 minutes was 12.65 cm/sec and at 15 minutes was 8.0 cm/sec.
