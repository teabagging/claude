Because 2xy is a square, it follows that x and y are both positive or both negative. If (x, y) is a solution, then (-x, -y) is also a solution, so we may assume in the following that x and y are positive and add the solution (-x, -y) at the end for each found solution (x, y).Combining 2xy = a^2 and x^2 + y^2 = p gives (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = p + a^2. By moving a^2 to the other side, we findp = (x+y)^2 - a^2 = (x+y+a)(x+y-a).Since x+y+a is positive, x+y-a must also be positive. The prime number p can only be written as a product of two positive integers in two ways: 1 cdot p and p cdot 1. Since x+y+a geq x+y-a, it follows that x+y+a = p and x+y-a = 1.If we add these two equations, we find that 2x + 2y = p + 1. We also know that x^2 + y^2 + 1 = p + 1, so 2x + 2y = x^2 + y^2 + 1.

Hence, P(A_{2}|overline{A_{1}})=frac{2}{3}.Therefore, the probability that the second question drawn is a conceptual description question is calculated as follows:[P(A_{2})=P(A_{1})times P(A_{2}|A_{1})+P(overline{A_{1}})times P(A_{2}|overline{A_{1}})=frac{1}{2}timesfrac{1}{3}+frac{1}{2}timesfrac{2}{3}=frac{1}{2}]So, the final answer for part (1) is boxed{frac{1}{2}}.# Part 2Let's define the events for student A drawing from Box A:- B_{1}: Drawing two conceptual description questions.- B_{2}: Drawing two calculation questions.- B_{3}: Drawing one conceptual description question and one calculation question.And let C denote the event that student B draws from Box B and the first question is a conceptual description question.Calculating the probabilities for each event:- P(B_{1})=frac{{C}_{2}^{2}}{{C}_{4}^{2}}=frac{1}{6}, since there are 2 ways to choose 2 conceptual questions out of 4 total ways to choose any 2 questions.- P(B_{2})=frac{{C}_{2}^{2}}{{C}_{4}^{2}}=frac{1}{6}, similarly for choosing 2 calculation questions.- P(B_{3})=frac{{C}_{2}^{1}{C}_{2}^{1}}{{C}_{4}^{2}}=frac{2}{3}, for choosing 1 conceptual and 1 calculation question.Given these events, the probabilities that student B draws a conceptual description question first from Box B are:- P(C|B_{1})=frac{{C}_{4}^{1}{C}_{3}^{1}+{A}_{4}^{2}}{{A}_{7}^{2}}=frac{4}{7}, considering the new composition of Box B after B_{1}.- P(C|B_{2})=frac{{C}_{2}^{1}{C}_{5}^{1}+{A}_{2}^{2}}{{A}_{7}^{2}}=frac{2}{7}, after B_{2}.- P(C|B_{3})=frac{{C}_{3}^{1}{C}_{4}^{1}+{A}_{3}^{2}}{{A}_{7}^{2}}=frac{3}{7}, after B_{3}.Thus, the overall probability that student B draws a conceptual description question first from Box B is:[P(C)=P(B_{1})P(C|B_{1})+P(B_{2})P(C|B_{2})+P(B_{3})P(C|B_{3})=frac{1}{6}timesfrac{4}{7}+frac{1}{6}timesfrac{2}{7}+frac{4}{6}timesfrac{3}{7}=frac{3}{7}]Therefore, the final answer for part (2) is boxed{frac{3}{7}}."},{"problem":"11、(20 points) Given the hyperbolaC: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a>0, b>0)F_{1}, F_{2} are the left and right foci of the hyperbola C, respectively, and P is a point on the right branch of the hyperbola C such that angle F_{1} P F_{2}=frac{pi}{3}.

(The denominator of a rational number  q is the unique positive integer  b such that  qequal{}a/b for some integer  a with  gcd(a,b)equal{}1.) (Note:  gcd means greatest common divisor.)","solution":"1. Given Conditions and Initial Setup:   We are given that ( f: mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) is a continuously differentiable function such that for every rational number ( q ), the number ( f(q) ) is rational and has the same denominator as ( q ). 2. Analyzing the Derivative:   Since ( f ) is continuously differentiable, ( f' ) is continuous. We need to show that ( f' ) is an integer. 3. Choosing Rational Points:   Pick an arbitrary ( x in mathbb{R} ) and let ( epsilon > 0 ). By the continuity of ( f' ), there exists ( delta > 0 ) such that if ( |x - y| < delta ), then ( |f'(x) - f'(y)| < epsilon ).4. Selecting Rational Numbers:   Choose rational numbers ( frac{2m-1}{2^n} ) and ( frac{2m+1}{2^n} ) such that ( x - delta < frac{2m-1}{2^n} < x < frac{2m+1}{2^n} < x + delta ).5. Applying the Mean Value Theorem:   By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists ( zeta ) in the interval ( left( frac{2m-1}{2^n}, frac{2m+1}{2^n} right) ) such that:   [   f'left( zeta right) = frac{fleft( frac{2m+1}{2^n} right) - fleft( frac{2m-1}{2^n} right)}{frac{2m+1}{2^n} - frac{2m-1}{2^n}}.   ]6. Denominator Condition:   Since ( f left( frac{2m+1}{2^n} right) ) and ( f left( frac{2m-1}{2^n} right) ) are rational numbers with the same denominator ( 2^n ), the difference ( f left( frac{2m+1}{2^n} right) - f left( frac{2m-1}{2^n} right) ) is also a rational number with denominator ( 2^n ). Thus, ( f'(zeta) ) must be an integer.7. Conclusion on ( f' ):   Since ( f'(zeta) ) is an integer and ( f' ) is continuous, ( f' ) must be constant. Therefore, ( f'(x) = k ) for some integer ( k ).8. Form of ( f ):   Integrating ( f'(x) = k ), we get ( f(x) = kx + C ) for some constant ( C ).9. Determining ( C ):   To satisfy the condition that ( f(q) ) has the same denominator as ( q ) for any rational ( q ), we need to check specific values. For ( q = 0 ), ( f(0) = C ) must be an integer. For ( q = 1 ), ( f(1) = k + C ) must also be rational with the same denominator as 1, which implies ( k + C ) is an integer. Thus, ( k ) must be an integer.10.

Show that ( max_{|z| = 1} |p(z)| ge 1 ) for any ( p in P ):   Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a polynomial ( p in P ) such that:   [   max_{|z| = 1} |p(z)| < 1.   ]   This implies that for all ( z ) with ( |z| = 1 ), we have:   [   |p(z)| < 1.   ]4. Apply Rouché's theorem:   Consider the polynomial ( z^n ) and ( p(z) ). By Rouché's theorem, if ( |z^n - p(z)| < |z^n| ) on the unit circle ( |z| = 1 ), then ( z^n ) and ( z^n - p(z) ) have the same number of zeros inside the unit disk.   Since ( |p(z)| < 1 ) for ( |z| = 1 ), we have:   [   |z^n - p(z)| ge |z^n| - |p(z)| = 1 - |p(z)| > 0.   ]   This implies that ( z^n - p(z) ) has ( n ) roots inside the unit disk.5. Contradiction:   However, ( z^n - p(z) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ), and if ( |p(z)| < 1 ) for all ( |z| = 1 ), then ( z^n - p(z) ) would have ( n ) roots inside the unit disk, which contradicts the fact that ( z^n - p(z) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ) and cannot have more than ( n-1 ) roots inside the unit disk.6. Conclusion:   Therefore, our assumption that there exists a polynomial ( p in P ) such that ( max_{|z| = 1} |p(z)| < 1 ) is false. Hence, for every ( p in P ), we have:   [   max_{|z| = 1} |p(z)| ge 1.   ]Thus, the minimum value of ( max_{|z| = 1} |p(z)| ) for ( p in P ) is indeed ( 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 1 } )."},{"problem":"Example 2 Given a positive integer n and a positive number M.

Let O be the center and r the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Since arcsin frac{35}{37} < frac{pi}{2}, the angle at vertex A is obtuse, so O and A are on different sides of line BC.

Since gamma contains point A and is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle ABC, the point of tangency is precisely A, so we have O O_{1} = r + r_{1}.

Two fields are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Find the smallest possible number of good paths Alice can obtain, as a function of n. (Serbia) Answer: 2 n^{2}-2 n+1.","solution":"We will call any field that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers a well. Other fields will be called non-wells. Let us make a second n times n board B where in each field we will write the number of good sequences which end on the corresponding field in the original board A. We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in B. We note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in B in increasing order with respect to their values in A, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields. We note that there is at least one well in A, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in A. Hence, the sum of values of fields in B corresponding to wells in A is at least 1. We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e., of the entries in B corresponding to the non-wells in A. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is 2 n(n-1). Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in B is at least 2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in B larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other. We will now prove that the lower limit of 2 n^{2}-2 n+1 entries can be achieved. This amounts to finding a way of marking a certain set of squares, those that have a value of 1 in B, such that no two unmarked squares are adjacent and that the marked squares form a connected tree with respect to adjacency. For n=1 and n=2 the markings are respectively the lone field and the L-trimino. Now, for n>2, let s=2 for n equiv 0,2 bmod 3 and s=1 for n equiv 1 bmod 3. We will take indices k and l to be arbitrary non-negative integers. For n geqslant 3 we will construct a path of marked squares in the first two columns consisting of all squares of the form (1, i) where i is not of the form 6 k+s and (2, j) where j is of the form 6 k+s-1, 6 k+s or 6+s+1. Obviously, this path is connected. Now, let us consider the fields (2,6 k+s) and (1,6 k+s+3). For each considered field (i, j) we will mark all squares of the form (l, j) for l>i and (i+2 k, j pm 1). One can easily see that no set of marked fields will produce a cycle, that the only fields of the unmarked form (1,6 k+s),(2+2 l+1,6 k+s pm 1) and (2+2 l, 6 k+s+3 pm 1) and that no two are adjacent, since the consecutive considered fields are in columns of opposite parity.

Each angle of the pentagon A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} E_{1}, when added to the corresponding angle of the decagon, gives 360^{circ} (see the diagram on the right).

What is the largest integer mathrm{n} for which this is possible?","solution":"Solution to Exercise 12 In this problem, we are looking for the largest integer satisfying a certain property. Suppose we want to show that the largest integer sought is the integer c. To show that c is indeed the largest integer, we will on the one hand show that if an integer n satisfies the property, then n ≤ c, and on the other hand we will show that we can find a table with exactly c columns.The statement presents a hypothesis concerning the rows and columns of a table.We start by looking at the information we have about the rows of this table. There are 8 rows, so there are (binom{8}{2} = 28) pairs of rows.We then look at the information we have about the columns of the table. Since the hypothesis in the statement mentions identical letters within the same column, we will count how many pairs of identical letters belong to the same column. We fix a column of the table and see how many pairs of identical letters we can form at a minimum. After several trials on a column of size 8, we conjecture that there are always at least 4 pairs of identical letters within the same column. Indeed, in a column there are 8 letters, so a letter appears at least 2 times.- If each letter appears at most 2 times, then each letter appears exactly 2 times since there are 8 cells in the column and 4 possible letters. We thus have 4 pairs of identical letters in the column.- If a letter appears exactly 3 times, say the letter P, then we can form 3 pairs of letters P. Among the 5 remaining letters, at least one of the letters O, F, and M appears twice according to the pigeonhole principle, which gives us a fourth pair of identical letters.- If a letter appears at least 4 times in the column, say the letter P, we can form 4 pairs of letters P.Thus, in a column, we can always find 4 pairs of identical letters. Therefore, for each column, there are at least 4 pairs of rows such that the intersections with the column have the same letter. But according to the hypothesis in the statement, a pair of rows can be associated with at most one column such that its intersections with the two rows are two cells containing the same letter. We deduce that there are at most (4 times n) pairs of rows. Therefore, (4n leq 28) and (n leq 7).Conversely, there exists a configuration with the following 7 columns:| P | P | P | P | P | P | P || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || O | O | O | O | O | P | O || F | F | F | F | O | O | P || M | M | M | M | P | O | O || P | M | F | O | F | F | F || O | F | M | P | M | F | M || F | P | P | M | M | M | F || M | O | O | F | F | M | M |The largest integer n of columns is therefore n = 7.Comment from the gradersMany students managed to find the answer n = 7 and provided an example. Most propose a correct argument to show that it is optimal, but sometimes this reasoning is written in a somewhat unclear manner."},{"problem":"Determine all three-digit numbers N such that the average of the six numbers that can be formed by permutation of its three digits is equal to N.","solution":"1.

Therefore, the law of motion can be written as ln s=k t.The value of k remains unknown. It can be determined from the condition that after 2 seconds, the point is at a distance of e (where e is the base of the natural logarithm). Thus, ln e=k cdot 2 or 2 k=1, from which k=1 / 2.Therefore, the law of motion of the material point is ln s=t / 2, i.e., s=e^{t / 2}."},{"problem":"Given that in the obtuse triangle triangle ABC, the three sides are a=k, b=k+2, and c=k+4, find the range of values for k.","solution":"From the problem, we know that c is the longest side, meaning that C is the obtuse angle.By applying the cosine rule, we get (k+4)^{2}=(k+2)^{2}+k^{2}-2k(k+2)cdotcos C geq (k+2)^{2}+k^{2}, which simplifies to (k+2)^{2}+k^{2}  k+4.

These lines form a triangle A_1B_1C_1 similar to triangle ABC (Fig. 46). The center of similarity is the point S, where the lines AA_1, BB_1, CC_1 intersect; point S is the centroid of triangle ABC, as well as of triangle A_1B_1C_1. The similarity is inverse, because corresponding points, e.g., A and A_1, lie on the rays SA and SA_1 in opposite directions. The ratio of similarity isSince the ratio of the areas of similar figures equals the square of the ratio of similarity, the area of triangle A_1B_1C_1 is 4 times larger than the area of triangle ABC, which is also directly visible.Returning to the main topic, let's briefly recall the properties of similar figures in space. Let a figure F be given in space, whose points are A, B, C, ldots Choose any point S and a positive number k. When we measure segments SA, SB, SC, ldots on the rays SA, SB, SC, ldots, the points A form a figure F directly similar to figure F relative to point S in the ratio k. If, however, we measure the same segments SA_1 = k cdot SA, SB_1 = k cdot SB, SC_1 = k cdot SC, ldots on the extensions of the rays SA, SB, SC, ldots, we obtain a figure F_1 inversely similar to figure F relative to point S in the ratio k (Fig. 47). From this definition, it easily follows that the figure similar to the segment AB is the segment A_1B_1, with the lines AB and A_1B_1 being parallel (or coinciding, which happens when the line AB passes through point S). The figure similar to the triangle ABC is, therefore, the triangle A_1B_1C_1, with the planes of the triangles being parallel (or coinciding in the case where the plane ABC contains point S). The figure similar to the tetrahedron ABCD is the tetrahedron A_1B_1C_1D_1. The ratio of similar segments equals the ratio of similarity, the ratio of the areas of similar triangles (or generally: planar figures) equals the square of the ratio of similarity, and the ratio of the volumes of similar tetrahedra (or generally: solids) equals the cube of the ratio of similarity.To solve the problem, we will also need the following theorem:The segments connecting the vertices of a tetrahedron with the centroids of the opposite faces intersect at one point, which divides each of these segments in the ratio 3 colon 1.The proof of this theorem is simple; it suffices to prove it for one pair of such segments. Let M be the centroid of the face BCD, and N be the centroid of the face ACD of the tetrahedron ABCD (Fig. 47). The lines BM and AN intersect at the midpoint P of the edge CD.The segments AM and BN connecting the vertices A and B of the triangle ABP with the points M and N of the sides BP and AP intersect at a point S inside this triangle. Since AP = 3 cdot NP and BP = 3 cdot MP, it follows that MN parallel AB and AB = 3 MN; hence, AS = 3 cdot SM and BS = 3 cdot SN, which is what we had to prove. The point S is the centroid of the tetrahedron.Applying the above knowledge, we can briefly state the solution to the problem: We construct the figure inversely similar in the ratio 3 to the tetrahedron ABCD relative to its centroid S. This figure is the tetrahedron A_1B_1C_1D_1, whose vertices lie on the extensions of the rays SA, SB, SC, SD, with SA_1 = 3 cdot SA, SB_1 = 3 cdot SB, SC_1 = 3 cdot SC, SD_1 = 3 cdot SD.The plane B_1C_1D_1 is parallel to the corresponding plane BCD, and it passes through the vertex A, since from the equality AS = 3 cdot SM it follows that point A is the point similar to point M of the face BCD. Therefore, the tetrahedron A_1B_1C_1D_1 is the tetrahedron mentioned in the problem.

We are given two fixed points, O(0,0) and A(3,0), and a moving point P(x,y) that satisfies |frac{PA}{PO}|=2. Our goal is to find the equation of the locus of point P, denoted as curve Gamma, and then to determine the maximum area of triangle AMN under the given conditions.Step 1: Find the Equation of GammaGiven that |frac{PA}{PO}|=2, we express PA and PO in terms of P(x,y):- PA = sqrt{(x-3)^2 + y^2} (distance formula between P and A)- PO = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} (distance formula between P and O)Setting up the equation |frac{PA}{PO}|=2, we get:[|frac{sqrt{(x-3)^2 + y^2}}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}| = 2]Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root and the absolute value, we obtain:[(x-3)^2 + y^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)]Expanding and simplifying this equation leads to:[x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 4x^2 + 4y^2][3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x - 9 = 0][x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 3 = 0]Rearranging, we find the equation of the circle:[(x+1)^2 + y^2 = 4]Thus, the locus of P is a circle with center D(-1,0) and radius 2.Step 2: Determine the Maximum Area of Triangle AMNTo find the maximum area of triangle AMN, we first note that |AM|=sqrt{|AD|^2-|DM|^2}. Given D(-1,0) and A(3,0), we calculate:[|AD| = 4, quad |DM| = 2][|AM| = sqrt{4^2 - 2^2} = 2sqrt{3}]Next, we consider the midpoint N of BC. Since DN perp BC and |BC| = 2sqrt{3}, the length of DN can be found by:[DN = sqrt{|DB|^2 - |BN|^2} = sqrt{4 - 3} = 1]Therefore, the locus of N is a circle with equation (x+1)^2 + y^2 = 1, center (-1,0), and radius 1.The maximum distance from N to the line AM is the sum of the radii of the two circles, which is 2 + 1 = 3. Thus, the maximum area of triangle AMN can be calculated using the base AM = 2sqrt{3} and the height (maximum distance from N to AM) as 3:[Area_{AMN} = frac{1}{2} times base times height = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{3} times 3 = 3sqrt{3}]Hence, the equation of Gamma is boxed{(x+1)^2 + y^2 = 4}, and the maximum area of triangle AMN is boxed{3sqrt{3}}."},{"problem":"12 cdot 29 Find the pairs of positive integers (x, y) that satisfy the following conditions:(1) x leqslant y;(2) sqrt{x}+sqrt{y}=sqrt{1992}.(Australian Mathematics Competition, 1991)","solution":"[Solution] Since sqrt{1992}=2 sqrt{498},it follows that (x, y)=(498,498) is clearly a positive integer solution to the equation.If (x, y) is a positive integer solution to the equation, then by the conditionwe havebegin{array}{c}x leqslant y x leqslant 498 .end{array}However, fromwe havebegin{array}{c}sqrt{x}+sqrt{y}=sqrt{1992} y=1992+x-2 sqrt{1992 x},end{array}it follows that 2 sqrt{1992 x}=4 sqrt{498 x} is an integer, becausebegin{array}{c}498=2 cdot 3 cdot 83 x geqslant 498 . x=498 .end{array}is square-free, sothus we can only havewhich means the equation has only one unique positive integer solution (498,498)."},{"problem":"11.

Understanding the Ivanight's Movement:   An Ivanight moves like a knight in standard chess, which means it can move to any of the 8 possible positions: ((pm 2, pm 1)) and ((pm 1, pm 2)). However, if the move takes it out of the board, it wraps around to the other side.2. Color Distribution:   We need to color the ( 8 times 8 ) board such that each Ivanight's 8 possible attack squares contain all ( n ) colors equally. This implies that ( n ) must divide 8, as each color must appear exactly once in the 8 attack squares.3. Possible Values of ( n ):   The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. We need to check if these values of ( n ) can satisfy the condition.4. Case ( n = 1 ):   If ( n = 1 ), the entire board is of one color. This trivially satisfies the condition since all 8 attacked squares will be of the same color.5. Case ( n = 2 ):   If ( n = 2 ), we need to color the board such that each Ivanight's 8 attack squares contain both colors equally. This can be achieved by alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern.6. Case ( n = 4 ):   If ( n = 4 ), we need to color the board such that each Ivanight's 8 attack squares contain all 4 colors equally. This can be achieved by repeating a ( 2 times 2 ) block pattern of the 4 colors.7. Case ( n = 8 ):   If ( n = 8 ), we need to color the board such that each Ivanight's 8 attack squares contain all 8 colors equally.

Identify the Characteristics of the Quadratic Function:   The quadratic function given is y=-x^{2}+x+2. This is a parabola that opens downwards because the coefficient of x^2 is negative. The vertex form of a quadratic function is y=a(x-h)^2+k, where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola. For our function, the axis of symmetry can be found using the formula x=frac{-b}{2a}, where a and b are the coefficients from the quadratic equation in the form ax^2+bx+c.   - Here, a=-1 and b=1, so the axis of symmetry is x=frac{-1}{2(-1)}=frac{1}{2}.2. Determine the Interval Where y Increases:   - Since the parabola opens downwards and the axis of symmetry is at x=frac{1}{2}, y increases as x increases for x<frac{1}{2}. This means that the interval ends at x=frac{1}{2}, so a+3=frac{1}{2}, leading to a=-frac{5}{2}.3. Find the Intersection with the Line y=-4:   - To find the common points with the line y=-4, we set the function equal to -4: -4=-x^{2}+x+2.   - Solving this equation, we rearrange it to x^2-x-6=0, which factors (or can be solved using the quadratic formula) to find x=-2 or x=3. We discard x=3 because it does not fall within the interval where y is increasing as x increases based on the parabola's shape and the axis of symmetry.4. Determine the Range of a:   - Since the graph must have a common point with the line y=-4 within the interval aleqslant xleqslant a+3, and we found x=-2 to be a valid solution, the minimum value of a must allow -2 to be within this interval. Thus, the minimum a can be is when a=-2-3=-5.   - We already determined that the maximum value of a is -frac{5}{2} from the condition a+3=frac{1}{2}.Therefore, combining these findings, the range of values for a is -5leqslant aleqslant -frac{5}{2}.

This will help us determine the period of the function. The key to solving this problem is to apply the double angle formulas effectively.Step 1: Simplify the function using double angle formulasWe have f(x)=cos frac{x}{2}left( sinfrac{x}{2}-sqrt{3}cosfrac{x}{2} right). Expanding this expression, we get:f(x)=cos frac{x}{2}sinfrac{x}{2}-sqrt{3}cos^{2}frac{x}{2}.Now, applying the double angle formulas, we have:cos frac{x}{2}sinfrac{x}{2}=frac{1}{2}sin x and cos^{2}frac{x}{2}=frac{1+cos x}{2}.Substituting these expressions into our function, we obtain:f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-sqrt{3}left( frac{1+cos x}{2} right).Step 2: Simplify further and find the periodNow, let's simplify the expression further:f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}left( 1+cos x right).Distributing the -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we get:f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos x.Rearranging the terms, we have:f(x)=frac{1}{2}sin x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos x-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.Recall that sin(x-a)=sin xcos a-cos xsin a. Comparing this identity with our simplified function, we can rewrite f(x) as:f(x)=sinleft( x-frac{pi}{3} right)-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.Now it's clear that the function is in the form Asin(Bx+C)+D, where A=1, B=1, C=-frac{pi}{3}, and D=-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. The period of the function can be found using the formula:T=frac{2pi}{|B|}.Since B=1, the period of the function is:T=frac{2pi}{1}=2pi.Step 3: ConclusionThe smallest positive period of the given function is boxed{2pi}."},{"problem":"4.

Understanding Euler's Totient Function:   Euler's totient function ( phi(k) ) counts the number of integers up to ( k ) that are coprime with ( k ).2. Expression Analysis:   Consider ( m^n - 1 ). We need to show that ( n ) divides ( phi(m^n - 1) ).3. Order of ( m ) modulo ( m^n - 1 ):   Let ( d ) be the order of ( m ) modulo ( m^n - 1 ). By definition, ( d ) is the smallest positive integer such that ( m^d equiv 1 pmod{m^n - 1} ).4. Divisibility:   Since ( m^n equiv 1 pmod{m^n - 1} ), it follows that ( d ) must divide ( n ). Hence, ( d leq n ).5. Euler's Totient Function Property:   The order ( d ) of ( m ) modulo ( m^n - 1 ) must divide ( phi(m^n - 1) ). Since ( d ) divides ( n ), and ( d ) divides ( phi(m^n - 1) ), it follows that ( n ) must divide ( phi(m^n - 1) ).Thus, we have shown that ( n mid phi(m^n - 1) ).(blacksquare) Part (b)To prove that the number of elements in the sequence ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) whose greatest common divisor with ( n ) is ( d ) is ( phileft(frac{n}{d}right) ).1.

Simplify the Condition:   The condition ( gcd(m, n) = d ) can be rewritten as ( gcd(m, dk) = d ). This implies ( m = d cdot m' ) for some integer ( m' ), and ( gcd(m', k) = 1 ).4. Range of ( m' ):   Since ( 1 leq m leq n ), we have ( 1 leq d cdot m' leq dk ). Thus, ( 1 leq m' leq k ).5. Counting Coprime Integers:   The number of integers ( m' ) in the range ( 1 leq m' leq k ) that are coprime to ( k ) is given by ( phi(k) ).6.

Considering that a total of 150 bugs were distributed, we get x leq 10.On the other hand, in the tenth jar there should be no more than 2 x bugs, in the ninth - no more than 2 x-1 bugs, and so on. This means that in the first jar - no more than 2 x-9 bugs, and the total number of bugs - no more than 20 x-45.

Suppose there is a sequence of n jumps of lengths 1,2, ldots, n in some order such that the frog never lands on any of the numbers 1,2, ldots, k for k geqslant 1. Note that if the frog is on a number a geqslant k+1, it actually stands on a number a geqslant k+1 since it cannot be on any of the numbers 1,2, ldots, k. This means the frog can only jump left if it is on a number a geqslant k+1, so it cannot reach a number less than k+1-n. Therefore, the frog can only land on numbers i that satisfyk+1-n leqslant i leqslant 0 quad text { or } quad k+1 leqslant i leqslant nConsider what happens at the moment the frog makes a jump of length exactly k. After this jump, it must remain on the same side of the numbers 1,2, ldots, k because a jump of length at least k+1 is required to jump over all these numbers.If this jump is made from a position a>0, it will end up at the number a-k, so it must be true that a-k geqslant k+1 or 2 k+1 leqslant a leqslant n. Thus, we have 2 k+1 leqslant n in this case.If this jump is made from a position a leqslant 0, then k+1-n leqslant a leqslant 0. It will then end up at the number a+k, so it must be true that a+k leqslant 0 and 2 k+1-n leqslant a+k leqslant 0. Again, we conclude 2 k+1 leqslant n.Thus, we have shown that k leqslant frac{n-1}{2}=1010.5.

After the first jump, the frog lands on the number k+1>k. Suppose the frog is at number 0 or k+1 and is about to make a pair of jumps of lengths first k+i+1, and then i. If it is at number 0, the first jump takes it to the number k+i+1>k, and the second to the number k+i+1-i=k+1>k. If it is at number k+1, the first jump takes it to the number k+1-(k+i+1)=-i<0, and the second to the number k+1-(2 k+2)=-k-1<1.

Shifting this graph to the right by frac{pi}{4} units, we get y=2cos[2(x-frac{pi}{4})+frac{pi}{3}]=2sin(2x+frac{pi}{3}).

The ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg in these smaller triangles is exactly 2: 1. We will use these general observations in our problem in several ways:First, the line A C is the axis of symmetry of triangle E C F, so angle A C E has a measure of 30^{circ}. Second, the ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg in the right triangle A B C is given as 2: 1, so it is half of an equilateral triangle, with the remaining internal angles B A C and A C B having measures of 30^{circ} and 60^{circ}.From this, we deduce that angle B C E has a measure of 30^{circ} (the difference between angles A C B and A C E).

We need to find the smallest b such that b^2 + 1 is not square-free. Checking small values of b:   - For b = 2: b^2 + 1 = 5 (square-free)   - For b = 3: b^2 + 1 = 10 (square-free)   - For b = 4: b^2 + 1 = 17 (square-free)   - For b = 5: b^2 + 1 = 26 (square-free)   - For b = 6: b^2 + 1 = 37 (square-free)   - For b = 7: b^2 + 1 = 50 = 2 times 5^2 (not square-free)   Therefore, the smallest b such that b^2 + 1 is not square-free is b = 7.

At the same time, Z_{X}=4 X^{2}, Z_{Y}=Y.Then the PPF equation is: 4 X^{2}+Y=100.The country's income, which uses its resources most efficiently in this case, is T R=8 X+Y=8 X+100-4 X^{2}.

Similarly, we obtain frac{P_{B}}{P}=frac{8}{34}, frac{P_{C}}{P}=frac{9}{34}, frac{P_{D}}{P}=frac{10}{34}. Second SolutionThe probability is defined as favorable cases/possible cases; here we will consider \\"case\\" any possible ordering of the 40 cards. We count the possible cases, i.e., the possible ways to reorder 40 cards so that cards A, B, C are in three of the positions 1-10, cards D, E are in two of the positions 11-20, and card F is in one of the positions 21-30. To do this, we first fix the positions of the \\"obligatory\\" cards: we can position A, B, C in 10 cdot 9 cdot 8 ways, D, E in 10 cdot 9 ways, and F in 10 ways. So we have 103 cdot 92 cdot 8 ways to fix the positions of the six known cards. The remaining cards can go into the remaining free positions in any order, and these arrangements are 34! (indeed, each possible ordering of the 40 cards that meets the required conditions is obtained in one and only one way by choosing the positions of the 6 \\"obligatory\\" cards and the order in which the 34 \\"free\\" cards appear in the free spaces). Therefore, the possible cases are P=103 cdot 92 cdot 8 cdot 34!. A similar calculation provides F_{A}=103 cdot 92 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 33! for the cases where we add the constraint that the 7 of coins is in A's hand, and similarly F_{B}=103 cdot 92 cdot 82 cdot 33!, F_{C}=103 cdot 93 cdot 8 cdot 33!, F_{D}=104 cdot 92 cdot 8 cdot 33!. Therefore, the probabilities to compare are frac{F_{A}}{P}=frac{7}{34}, frac{F_{B}}{P}=frac{8}{34}, frac{F_{C}}{P}=frac{9}{34}, frac{F_{D}}{P}=frac{10}{34}, and the greatest is frac{F_{D}}{P}."},{"problem":"15 Find the smallest positive integer n(n geqslant 3), such that in any set of n points in the plane with no three points collinear, there must be three points that are the vertices of a non-isosceles triangle.","solution":"Solution: First, if the 6 points in the plane are the 5 vertices of a regular pentagon and its center, all triangles formed by these 6 points are isosceles triangles. Therefore, the required positive integer n geqslant 7.Second, if there exist 7 points in the plane (where no three points are collinear), such that all triangles formed by these 7 points are isosceles triangles. Let the set of these 7 points be E.Without loss of generality, assume the two farthest points in E are A and B. Draw arcs with A and B as centers and AB as the radius, intersecting at points M and N.Let l_{1}=widehat{MAN} cup widehat{MBN}, l_{2}= line segment MN.Take any P in E, P neq A, P neq B, then triangle PAB is an isosceles triangle. Thus, at least one of the following three cases must hold: (1) PA=PB leqslant AB; (2) PA=AB geqslant PB; (3) PB=AB geqslant PA, so P in l_{1} cup l_{2}.Since no three points in E are collinear, there are at most 2 points of E on l_{2}, so overparen{AM}, overparen{BM}, overparen{AN}, overparen{BN} (excluding endpoints) contain at least 7-2-2=3 points of E.Without loss of generality, assume overparen{BN} has one point C (C neq B, C neq N), and overparen{BC} contains no points of E. Draw arcs with A and C as centers and AC=AB as the radius, intersecting at points M' and N'.Let l_{3}=widehat{M'AN'} cup widehat{M'CN'}, l_{4}= line segment M'N', similarly, all points of E belong to l_{3} cup l_{4}. Therefore, E subseteq (l_{1} cup l_{2}) cap (l_{3} cup l_{4}), and overparen{BC} contains no points of E. So E subseteq overparen{M'B} cup overparen{CN} cup {A} cup {O} cup {T} cup {R}, where point O is the intersection of l_{2} and l_{4}, T is the intersection of l_{2} and mathscr{M}'A, and R is the intersection of l_{4} and overparen{AN}.Let S_{1}=overparen{M'B} cup {T}, S_{2}=overparen{CN} cup {R}, thenS_{1} cup S_{2} contains at least 7-3-1=3 points of E different from A, B, C. So S_{1} or S_{2} contains at least 2 points of E different from A, B, C. Without loss of generality, assume S_{2} contains two points P, Q of E different from A, B, C, then there are only the following two cases.(1) P in overparen{CN}, Q in overparen{CN}. Since triangle PBC is an isosceles triangle, and PB > BC, so PC = BC. Similarly, from triangle QBC being an isosceles triangle, we get QC = BC. Therefore, CP = CQ, i.e., C lies on the perpendicular bisector of PQ, but the perpendicular bisector of PQ only passes through A and not through C, a contradiction.(2) P in overparen{CN}, Q = R, similarly, we get PC = BC.Also, triangle RBC is an isosceles triangle, and BR = BN > BC, so RC = BC, so RC = PC = BC. In triangle BCP and triangle BCR, BC = BC, PC = RC, angle BCP geqslant angle BCN > angle BCR, so BP > BR. This contradicts BP leqslant BN = BR.It is evident that there do not exist 7 points in the plane (where no three points are collinear) such that all triangles formed by these 7 points are isosceles triangles.In summary, the smallest positive integer n=7."},{"problem":"Given the sequence {a_n} satisfying a_{n+1} = frac{4a_n + 3}{4} (n ∈ ℕ*), and a_1 = 1, find the value of a_{21} ( ).A: 13B: 14C: 15D: 16","solution":"From a_{n+1} = frac{4a_n + 3}{4}, we can simplify and rearrange the equation to a_{n+1} - a_n = frac{3}{4}.

Then, the first three terms are a, a+d, and a+2d, and their sum is 3a+3d=34. The n-th term of the arithmetic sequence can be expressed as a+(n-1)d. Therefore, the last three terms are a+(n-3)d, a+(n-2)d, and a+(n-1)d, and their sum is 3a+3(n-2)d=146.The sum of all terms of the arithmetic sequence is frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)=390.From the equations 3a+3d=34 and 3a+3(n-2)d=146, we can subtract the first from the second to get 3(n-2)d-3d=112, which simplifies to 3(n-3)d=112. Dividing both sides by 3 gives (n-3)d=37.333. Since d must be an integer (as it's an arithmetic sequence and the terms given are integers), this equation seems to have been simplified incorrectly in the process. The correct approach would be directly solving the system of equations given by the problem statement.Let's correct the process:1. From 3a+3d=34, we have a+d=11.333. This equation was initially used to establish a relationship between a and d.2. From 3a+3(n-2)d=146, simplifying gives a+(n-2)d=48.667. This equation relates a, d, and n.3. The sum of all terms given by frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)=390 provides a direct way to find n when a and d are known.However, the direct solution to find n without explicitly solving for a and d involves using these equations to set up a system that directly relates to n. The mistake in the simplification process led to an incorrect intermediate step. The correct approach involves solving these equations systematically to find n.Given the sum of all terms is 390, and considering the nature of arithmetic sequences, the correct method to find the number of terms n involves correctly solving the system of equations derived from the given sums. This typically involves using the formulas for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence and the sum of any three specific terms within it.Without the correct intermediate steps, the direct jump to the solution is not justified.

Coloring with 4 Colors:   - We can use a 4-color pattern to ensure that no two cells of the same color are reachable by a beaver or a knight move.   - The pattern can be repeated every 4 rows and 4 columns. Here is an example of such a pattern:[begin{array}{cccccccc}1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 end{array}]3.

Understanding the Problem:   - Let ( S = {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7} ).   - We need to find the maximum number of 3-element subsets of ( S ) such that any two subsets intersect in exactly one element.2. Counting the Subsets:   - Each subset is a 3-element subset of ( S ).   - We need to ensure that any two subsets share exactly one common element.3. Using Combinatorial Design:   - This problem can be approached using combinatorial design, specifically a Steiner system ( S(2, 3, 7) ).   - A Steiner system ( S(2, 3, 7) ) is a collection of 3-element subsets (blocks) of a 7-element set such that every pair of elements from the set appears in exactly one block.4. Properties of Steiner System ( S(2, 3, 7) ):   - The number of blocks in a Steiner system ( S(2, 3, 7) ) is given by:     [     frac{binom{7}{2}}{binom{3}{2}} = frac{21}{3} = 7     ]   - Therefore, there are 7 such 3-element subsets.5. Constructing the Subsets:   - We can explicitly construct the 7 subsets as follows:     [     {a_1, a_2, a_3}, {a_1, a_4, a_5}, {a_1, a_6, a_7}, {a_2, a_4, a_6}, {a_2, a_5, a_7}, {a_3, a_4, a_7}, {a_3, a_5, a_6}     ]   - Each pair of elements from ( S ) appears in exactly one of these subsets.6. Verification:   - Verify that any two subsets share exactly one common element:     - For example, ({a_1, a_2, a_3}) and ({a_1, a_4, a_5}) share (a_1) and no other elements.     - This property holds for all pairs of subsets in the constructed list.Conclusion:The maximum number of 3-element subsets of a 7-element set ( S ) such that any two subsets have exactly one common element is 7.The final answer is (boxed{7})"},{"problem":"2.

Thus, the answer can be determined.SolutionSince the equation a^2x^2 + (a+2)y^2 + 4x + 8y + 5a = 0 represents a circle,therefore a^{2} = a + 2 neq 0, solving this gives a = -1 or a = 2.When a = -1, the equation becomes x^{2} + y^{2} + 4x + 8y - 5 = 0,Completing the square yields (x + 2)^{2} + (y + 4)^{2} = 25,The coordinates of the center of the circle are (-2, -4), and the radius is 5;When a = 2, the equation becomes x^{2} + y^{2} + x + 2y + 2.5 = 0,At this time, D^{2} + E^{2} - 4F = 1 + 4 - 4 times 2.5 = -5 < 0, the equation does not represent a circle,Therefore, the answer is the coordinates of the center boxed{(-2, -4)} and the radius boxed{5}."},{"problem":"Find the value of tan 80^{circ}+tan 40^{circ}- sqrt {3}tan 80^{circ}tan 40^{circ}.","solution":"1.

According to the problem, the sum of the lengths of all the edges of the rectangular solid is 24, which includes 4 edges of length x on the base, and 4 vertical edges. Each vertical edge length is given by frac{24 - 4x - 4x}{4} = 6 - 2x, where (0  0 for (0 < x < 2) and V'(x) < 0 for (2 < x < 3), the volume V(x) is increasing before x = 2 and decreasing after. Therefore, the volume function V(x) has a unique maximum at x = 2.At this value of x, the height of the rectangular solid is 6 - 2 cdot 2 = 2 meters. Hence, the diameter 2R of the circumscribed sphere is the diagonal of the rectangular solid, which by the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions is sqrt{x^2 + x^2 + (6 - 2x)^2} = sqrt{4 + 4 + 4} = 2sqrt{3} meters. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is R = sqrt{3} meters.Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = frac{4}{3}pi R^3, we find the volume of the circumscribed sphere to be: V = frac{4}{3}pi (sqrt{3})^3 = 4sqrt{3}pi text{ cubic meters} Thus, the answer is boxed{4sqrt{3}pi text{ cubic meters}}."},{"problem":"1.

From the first equation, we get p=frac{a+5 b-10 q}{5}, and substituting this into the second equation gives a+2 b=6 cdot frac{a+5 b-10 q}{5}+8 q, which simplifies to 5 a+10 b=6 a+30 b-20 q, or a+20 b=20 q.

This means that the ratio of the corresponding components of overrightarrow{b} and (overrightarrow{b}-overrightarrow{a}) must be equal. However, since we're dealing with vectors in the plane, another way to ensure they're parallel is to check if their cross product is zero or, in simpler terms for 2D vectors, if their dot product equals zero, indicating they're orthogonal, which is not applicable here, or if the scalar multiplication leads to one vector being a scalar multiple of the other. Given the problem statement, we're actually looking for a scalar relationship, not a direct proportionality or orthogonality, so let's correct the approach:Given (overrightarrow{b}-overrightarrow{a})∥overrightarrow{b}, this implies a scalar multiple relationship, not a direct dot product to zero. The correct interpretation for parallel vectors in this context is that one is a scalar multiple of the other, meaning if overrightarrow{b} = k(overrightarrow{b}-overrightarrow{a}) for some scalar k, then their components must satisfy this scalar multiplication. However, the given solution directly jumps to an equation without clearly stating this principle. It seems there's a misunderstanding in my explanation regarding the use of dot product and the concept of parallel vectors.

The mistake in my explanation was suggesting an incorrect method for determining parallelism between two vectors in this context.Let's proceed with the calculation given in the original solution, which correctly applies the concept of parallel vectors without incorrectly introducing the dot product for zero condition:Given (overrightarrow{b}-overrightarrow{a})∥overrightarrow{b}, we directly jump to the equation that represents their relationship:begin{align*}-6x-(x+2)times (-3) &= 0 -6x + 3(x+2) &= 0 -6x + 3x + 6 &= 0 -3x + 6 &= 0 -3x &= -6 x &= 2.end{align*}Therefore, the correct value of x that satisfies the given condition is x=2.Thus, the answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"3.

Then c=a b and a b c=1, from which it follows that c^{2}=1, c= pm 1, i.e., one of the three given logarithms is equal to pm 1.The converse is also true, namely, if one of the three given logarithms is equal to pm 1, then since the product of all three logarithms is 1, the product of the other two is also pm 1, i.e., equal to the first logarithm.Note that for all three given logarithms, the base and the argument are never equal for any x, so they are different from 1.Thus, the requirement of the problem is satisfied if and only if one of the logarithms is equal to -1 (and all logarithms exist). A logarithm is equal to -1 when the product of its base and argument is equal to 1.

Find the derivative of the function y=x^2:   - The derivative of y=x^2 is y'=2x. This represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph at any point x.2. Determine the slope of the tangent line at (a_n, a_n^2):   - Since the slope of the tangent line is given by y'=2x, at the point (a_n, a_n^2), the slope is 2a_n.3. Write the equation of the tangent line at (a_n, a_n^2):   - The equation of a line with slope m passing through (x_1, y_1) is y-y_1=m(x-x_1). Therefore, substituting m=2a_n and (x_1, y_1)=(a_n, a_n^2), we get the equation of the tangent line as y-a_n^2=2a_n(x-a_n).4. Find the abscissa a_{n+1} where the tangent line intersects the x-axis (y=0):   - Setting y=0 in the equation of the tangent line gives 0-a_n^2=2a_n(x-a_n). Solving for x, we find x=frac{1}{2}a_n. Therefore, a_{n+1}=frac{1}{2}a_n.5. Recognize that {a_n} is a geometric sequence:   - Since each term a_{n+1} is obtained by multiplying the previous term a_n by frac{1}{2}, {a_n} forms a geometric sequence with the first term a_1=32 and common ratio frac{1}{2}.6. Find the general formula for the sequence {a_n}:   - The general formula for a geometric sequence is a_n=a_1 cdot r^{n-1}.

Set up the recursive relations:   Given the connections between the pubs, we can write the following recursive relations:   [   A_{n+1} = frac{B_n + C_n}{3}   ]   [   B_{n+1} = frac{A_n + D_n}{2} + frac{C_n}{3}   ]   [   C_{n+1} = frac{A_n + D_n}{2} + frac{B_n}{3}   ]   [   D_{n+1} = frac{B_n + C_n}{3}   ]3.

III. o. t.)II. Solution: Since overline{a b c} squared is only a five-digit number and also starts with a, then a=1, and thus overline{a b c}<sqrt{20000}<142. Therefore, overline{b c}<42.A square number can only end in two identical digits if the number itself ends in (considering overline{b c}<42): 00,12,38.But 00 is not possible, because c neq f, 12 is not possible, because b neq 1=a, and thus only 38 satisfies the conditions.Indeed,overline{a b c^{2}}=138^{2}=overline{a d e f f}=19044Piroska Rétey (Debrecen, Svetits lg.

Boundedness and Monotonicity:   - First, we show that the sequence ( u_n ) is bounded above by 1. We use induction to prove this.   - Base case: ( u_0 < 1 ) and ( u_1 < 1 ) (given).   - Inductive step: Assume ( u_n < 1 ) and ( u_{n+1} < 1 ). We need to show ( u_{n+2} < 1 ).     [     u_{n+2} = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{u_{n+1}} + sqrt{u_n} right)     ]     Since ( 0 < u_n < 1 ) and ( 0 < u_{n+1} < 1 ), we have ( 0 < sqrt{u_n} < 1 ) and ( 0 < sqrt{u_{n+1}} < 1 ). Therefore,     [     sqrt{u_n} + sqrt{u_{n+1}} < 2     ]     Dividing by 2, we get     [     frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{u_{n+1}} + sqrt{u_n} right) < 1     ]     Hence, ( u_{n+2} < 1 ). By induction, ( u_n < 1 ) for all ( n ).2. Convergence:   - Since ( 0 < u_n < 1 ) for all ( n ), the sequence is bounded.   - To show that the sequence is monotonic, we need to prove that it is either non-increasing or non-decreasing from some index ( n_0 ).   - Consider the function ( f(x) = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{x} + sqrt{u_{n-1}} right) ). This function is continuous and strictly increasing for ( x in (0, 1) ).   - If ( u_n leq u_{n+1} ), then ( u_{n+1} leq u_{n+2} ) because     [     u_{n+2} = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{u_{n+1}} + sqrt{u_n} right) geq frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{u_n} + sqrt{u_n} right) = u_n     ]   - Similarly, if ( u_n geq u_{n+1} ), then ( u_{n+1} geq u_{n+2} ).   - Therefore, the sequence ( u_n ) is eventually monotonic.3. Finding the Limit:   - Let ( L ) be the limit of the sequence ( u_n ). Since the sequence is convergent, we have     [     lim_{n to infty} u_n = L     ]   - Taking the limit on both sides of the recurrence relation, we get     [     L = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{L} + sqrt{L} right)     ]     Simplifying, we obtain     [     L = sqrt{L}     ]   - Solving ( L = sqrt{L} ), we get ( L^2 = L ), which gives ( L(L - 1) = 0 ). Therefore, ( L = 0 ) or ( L = 1 ).   - Since ( 0 < u_n < 1 ) for all ( n ), the limit ( L ) must be within this interval.

For it, we now haves leq 4+4+2+14 cdot 1=24On the other hand, the trivial lower bound s geq 17 also holds, which we can sharpen to s geq 19 because of x_{1} geq x_{2}>1.

It remains to mark 21, 25, and 27, and this is also done for free: 25 is divisible by the marked number 5, and 21 and 27 are divisible by the marked number 3. In any way of solving the problem, the prime numbers 17, 19, 23, and 29, which exceed 15, will have to be marked at a cost - they are not divisors or multiples of any numbers on the board.

In fact, after marking the \\"large\\" prime numbers, we could have marked any of the remaining numbers on the board instead of the number 2. Indeed, then we will freely mark its smallest prime divisor p. If p=2, we act according to the algorithm described above. If not, we mark 2p (this can be done since p < 15), then mark the number 2, and from there everything else is done in the known way.A similar solution is applicable for an arbitrarily long set 2, 3, 4, ldots, N - we are forced to mark all \\"large\\" prime numbers (exceeding N / 2) at a cost, and then mark any of the remaining numbers for a ruble. Then we freely mark the number 2 in the way described above, then all even numbers, then all \\"small\\" prime numbers (not exceeding N / 2), because any \\"small\\" p will be a divisor of 2p.

This does not satisfy the condition for a right triangle since none of the angles is 90^{circ}.3. For condition ③, given angle A : angle B : angle C = 1:2:3, we understand that the ratio of the angles is in the simplest form.

This means:   [lbot alpha Rightarrow (lbot m land lbot n)]2. However, the converse is not necessarily true. If lbot m and lbot n, this does not always imply that lbot alpha. A specific case where m and n are parallel to each other within alpha demonstrates this. In such a scenario, l being perpendicular to both m and n does not guarantee l's perpendicularity to the plane alpha itself because l could very well be parallel to another line in alpha that is not parallel to m and n.3. The relationship described shows that lbot alpha is a sufficient condition for lbot m and lbot n because if l is perpendicular to plane alpha, it will indeed be perpendicular to any lines m and n within alpha.

What is the maximal possible number of edges in such a graph?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a simple graph with 300 vertices where no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent. We need to find the maximal possible number of edges in such a graph.2. Claim:   The maximal possible number of edges is given by:   [   frac{1}{2} (299 + 298 cdot 2 + cdots + 276 cdot 24) = 42550   ]3. Proof of Bound:   - We need to show that we can have at most ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ).   - Consider the degrees of the vertices. Since no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, the vertices with the same degree must form an independent set.   - The maximum degree a vertex can have is 299 (since there are 300 vertices in total).   - If we have ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ), then these vertices form an independent set, and thus, they do not contribute to each other's degree.4. Summing the Degrees:   - We need to sum the degrees of all vertices to find the total number of edges.   - The sum of the degrees of the vertices is given by:     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k cdot (300 - k)     ]   - This is because we can have ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ) for ( k ) from 1 to 24.5. Calculating the Sum:   - We need to calculate the sum:     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k cdot (300 - k)     ]   - This can be expanded as:     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} (300k - k^2)     ]   - Separating the sums, we get:     [     300 sum_{k=1}^{24} k - sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2     ]6. Using Known Summation Formulas:   - The sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}     ]   - The sum of the squares of the first ( n ) natural numbers is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}     ]   - For ( n = 24 ):     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k = frac{24 cdot 25}{2} = 300     ]     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2 = frac{24 cdot 25 cdot 49}{6} = 4900     ]7. Substituting Back:   - Substituting these values back into our sum, we get:     [     300 cdot 300 - 4900 = 90000 - 4900 = 85100     ]   - Since each edge is counted twice in the sum of the degrees, the total number of edges is:     [     frac{85100}{2} = 42550     ]8. Construction:   - Label ( k ) vertices with the label ( k ) for ( k ) between 1 and 24.   - Connect all pairs of vertices except those with the same label.   - This construction ensures that no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, and it achieves the bound.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 42550 } )"},{"problem":"7.2.

This inequality can be derived from the fact that the sum of squares is always greater than or equal to twice the product of the terms, i.e., (a^2 + b^2 geq 2ab).3. Applying the Inequality:   [   4s^2 + t^2 geq 4st   ]   Dividing both sides by (5st):   [   frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st} geq frac{4st}{5st} = frac{4}{5}   ]4. Example to Achieve Minimum: To show that the minimum value of (frac{4}{5}) can be achieved, consider a specific configuration of the quadrilateral (ABCD). Let (|AB| = |BC| = 1) and (|CD| = |DA| = sqrt{2}), with (angle ADC = angle ABC = frac{pi}{2}).5. Verification Using Ptolemy's Theorem: Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD), the sum of the products of its two pairs of opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals:   [   |AB| cdot |CD| + |BC| cdot |DA| = |AC| cdot |BD|   ]   Substituting the given lengths:   [   1 cdot sqrt{2} + 1 cdot sqrt{2} = |AC| cdot |BD|   ]   [   2sqrt{2} = |AC| cdot |BD|   ]   Since (|AC| = sqrt{2}) (diagonal of a square with side 1), we get:   [   |BD| = frac{2sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2}} = 2   ]6. Angles and Areas: Given (angle ADC = angle ABC = frac{pi}{2}), the areas ([ACB]) and ([ACD]) can be calculated using the right triangle properties. For (triangle ACB):   [   s = frac{1}{2} cdot |AB| cdot |BC| cdot sin(angle ABC) = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot 1 = frac{1}{2}   ]   For (triangle ACD):   [   t = frac{1}{2} cdot |AC| cdot |CD| cdot sin(angle ACD) = frac{1}{2} cdot sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} cdot 1 = 1   ]7. Substituting into the Expression:   [   frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st} = frac{4 left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + 1^2}{5 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot 1} = frac{4 cdot frac{1}{4} + 1}{frac{5}{2}} = frac{1 + 1}{frac{5}{2}} = frac{2}{frac{5}{2}} = frac{2 cdot 2}{5} = frac{4}{5}   ]Thus, the minimum value of (frac{4s^2 + t^2}{5st}) is indeed (frac{4}{5}), and it is achieved when (|AB| = |BC| = 1), (|CD| = |DA| = sqrt{2}), and (angle ADC = angle ABC = frac{pi}{2}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{4}{5}})."},{"problem":"16.

Define the problem and initial conditions:   - We need to determine the largest \\"profundity\\" of a word in the dog dictionary with ( n ) letters.   - The profundity of a word is the number of subwords that can be obtained by removing some letters.   - We denote ( A_n ) as the value of the greatest profundity of an ( n )-letter word in the dog dictionary.   - We aim to prove by induction that ( A_n = F_{n+3} - 3 ), where ( F_n ) is the Fibonacci sequence.2. Base cases:   - For ( n = 2 ):     - The word ( AA ) has profundity 1 (subword: ( A )).     - The word ( AU ) has profundity 2 (subwords: ( A, U )).     - Thus, ( A_2 = 2 = F_5 - 3 ).   - For ( n = 3 ):     - The word ( AAA ) has profundity 2 (subwords: ( A, AA )).     - The word ( AAU ) has profundity 4 (subwords: ( A, U, AA, AU )).     - The word ( AUA ) has profundity 5 (subwords: ( A, U, AU, UA, AA )).     - The word ( AUU ) has profundity 4 (subwords: ( A, U, AU, UU )).     - Thus, ( A_3 = 5 = F_6 - 3 ).3.

Statement 1:   - Consider the word ( AUAU ldots ) (with ( n ) letters).   - Every subword starting with ( A ) is either ( A ) or of the form ( AX ), where ( X ) is a subword of ( UAUA ldots ) (with ( n-1 ) letters).   - By hypothesis, there are ( 1 + A_{n-1} ) such subwords.   - Every subword starting with ( U ) is either ( U ), ( UAUA ldots ) (with ( n-1 ) letters), or of the form ( UY ), where ( Y ) is a subword of ( AUAU ldots ) (with ( n-2 ) letters).   - By hypothesis, there are ( 2 + A_{n-2} ) such subwords.   - Therefore, the total number of subwords is:     [     (1 + A_{n-1}) + (2 + A_{n-2}) = 3 + A_{n-1} + A_{n-2}     ]   - By the induction hypothesis:     [     3 + (F_{n+2} - 3) + (F_{n+1} - 3) = F_{n+3} - 3     ]   - Thus, ( AUAU ldots ) (with ( n ) letters) has profundity ( F_{n+3} - 3 ).5. Statement 2:   - Let ( T = X_1 X_2 ldots X_n ) be an ( n )-letter word with profundity ( A_n ).   - Suppose ( X_1 = A ).   - If all ( X_i = A ), then ( A_n = n-1 < F_{n+3} - 3 ), which is a contradiction.   - Therefore, there exists ( c in {2, ldots, n} ) such that ( X_c = U ) and ( c ) is minimal.   - Every subword starting with ( A ) is either ( A ) or of the form ( AX ), where ( X ) is a subword of ( X_2 ldots X_n ).   - By hypothesis, there are at most ( 1 + A_{n-1} ) such subwords.   - Every subword starting with ( U ) is either ( U ), ( X_c ldots X_n ), or of the form ( X_c Y ), where ( Y ) is a subword of ( X_{c+1} ldots X_n ).   - By hypothesis, there are at most ( 2 + A_{n-c} ) such subwords.   - Therefore:     [     A_n leq (1 + A_{n-1}) + (2 + A_{n-c}) = 3 + A_{n-1} + A_{n-c}     ]   - Since ( A_n ) is non-decreasing:     [     A_n leq 3 + A_{n-1} + A_{n-2}     ]6.

Since ( p(0) = 0 ), we can write ( p(x) ) as:   [   p(x) = a_d x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + cdots + a_1 x   ]   where ( a_d neq 0 ).3.

Since ( d = 0 ) would make ( p(x) ) a constant polynomial, which does not satisfy the given conditions, we must have ( d = 1 ).9. Therefore, ( p(x) ) is a linear polynomial.

Prime Divisors of ( d(n) ):   Suppose ( p ) is a prime divisor of ( d(n) ). This implies ( p ) divides each of the binomial coefficients (binom{n+k}{n}) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ). 3. Using Lucas' Theorem:   Lucas' theorem states that for non-negative integers ( m ) and ( n ) and a prime ( p ), the binomial coefficient (binom{m}{n}) modulo ( p ) can be computed using the base ( p ) representations of ( m ) and ( n ). Specifically,   [   binom{m}{n} equiv prod_{i=0}^k binom{m_i}{n_i} pmod{p}   ]   where ( m = m_k m_{k-1} ldots m_0 ) and ( n = n_k n_{k-1} ldots n_0 ) are the base ( p ) representations of ( m ) and ( n ).4.

We start by recognizing that the right-hand side of the differential equation can be written as a product of derivatives. Notice that:   [   frac{d}{dx} (sin (sin (sin (x)))) = cos (sin (sin (x))) cdot cos (sin (x)) cdot cos (x)   ]   Therefore, we can rewrite the differential equation as:   [   frac{d}{dx}F(x) = sin (sin (sin (sin(x)))) cdot frac{d}{dx} (sin (sin (sin (x))))   ]3.

Then:   [   frac{d}{dx} u = cos (sin (sin (x))) cdot cos (sin (x)) cdot cos (x)   ]   Hence, the differential equation becomes:   [   frac{d}{dx}F(x) = sin (u) cdot frac{d}{dx} u   ]4.

Convert the mixed number 2frac{1}{4} to an improper fraction to get frac{9}{4}, then raise it to the power of -frac{1}{2} which is the same as taking the square root and inverting: (frac{9}{4})^{-frac{1}{2}} = (sqrt{frac{9}{4}})^{-1} = (frac{3}{2})^{-1} = frac{2}{3}.4. The square root of a squared number is the absolute value of the original number, so sqrt{(-2)^{2}} = sqrt{4} = 2.5. (frac{25}{36})^{0.5} is the square root of frac{25}{36}, so it equals frac{5}{6}.Now, summing these up:begin{align*}(2frac{3}{5})^{0} + 2^{-2}cdot(2frac{1}{4})^{-frac{1}{2}} + (frac{25}{36})^{0.5} + sqrt{(-2)^{2}} & = 1 + frac{1}{4} cdot frac{2}{3} + frac{5}{6} + 2 & = 1 + frac{2}{12} + frac{10}{12} + 2 & = 1 + frac{12}{12} + 2 & = 1 + 1 + 2 & = boxed{4}.end{align*}For question (2):1. Utilize the logarithm properties to simplify frac{1}{2}logfrac{32}{49}. Since logfrac{32}{49} = log32 - log49 = 5log2 - 2log7, we have frac{1}{2}(log32 - log49) = frac{5}{2}log2 - log7.2. For -frac{4}{3}logsqrt{8}, notice that sqrt{8} = 8^{frac{1}{2}} = 2^{3 cdot frac{1}{2}} = 2^{frac{3}{2}}, so -frac{4}{3}logsqrt{8} = -frac{4}{3}cdotfrac{3}{2}log2 = -2log2.3. Since logsqrt{245} = frac{1}{2}log245 = frac{1}{2}(2log7 + log5) (by prime factorizing 245 into 7^2times5), this becomes frac{1}{2}(2log7 + log5).4. Combine all terms to get the final expression: frac{5}{2}log2 - log7 - 2log2 + frac{1}{2}(2log7 + log5).5. Simplify further by consolidating the terms: frac{1}{2}log2 + frac{1}{2}log5 is equivalent to frac{1}{2}log(2times5), which is frac{1}{2}log10.6. Since log10 = 1, the result becomes frac{1}{2}cdot 1 = boxed{frac{1}{2}}."},{"problem":"2. A math test consists of 20 questions.

What amount of money did Cathrin have left after shopping?","solution":"If the number of two-mark coins that Cathrin had before shopping is denoted by x, then at the same time she had (18-x) fifty-pfennig coins. The amount of money she had before shopping was thus(2 x+(18-x) cdot 0.5) text { marks }=(1.5 x+9) text { marks }Since she spent exactly half of this amount, she had (0.75 x+4.5) marks left after shopping. According to the problem, this amount consisted of (18-x) two-mark coins and x fifty-pfennig coins. Therefore,0.75 x+4.5=2(18-x)+0.5 x=36-1.5 xfrom which we get 2.25 x=31.5, hence x=14.Thus, Cathrin had exactly 14 two-mark coins and exactly 4 fifty-pfennig coins, which is a total of 30 marks, before shopping. After shopping, she had exactly 4 two-mark coins and exactly 14 fifty-pfennig coins, which is a total of 15 marks.2. Alternative solution:If Cathrin had exactly p marks after shopping, then she had exactly 2p marks before. If we were to lay out the same number of coins (each of the same value) as she had before, and add the same number of coins as she had after, this would amount to 18 two-mark coins and 18 fifty-pfennig coins, which is (36+9) marks =45 marks; on the other hand, this would also be (2p+p) marks =3p marks. Therefore, 3p=45, so p=15.Thus, Cathrin had exactly 15 marks after shopping."},{"problem":"Factorization: 1-4y^{2}=______.","solution":"To factorize the expression 1-4y^{2}, we recognize it as a difference of squares.

Therefore, we need to move upwards.And we need to find angle A K M. Triangle A K M is also not a good one; it is unlikely to expect properties of equilateral or even isosceles triangles from it. Therefore, we extend angle A K M to another triangle: we extend K M.It will intersect A B at some point P. In this triangle, we immediately note that angle P is 30^{circ}. Therefore, triangle A P M is isosceles. Let's try to express the lengths of the sides of triangle A K P. For this, we denote the side of the square as a. Then triangles P B M and A B M are equal, so A P = 2a. Next, P M = A M = 2 B M (the leg opposite the 30^{circ} angle is half the hypotenuse) and M K = 2 M C.Then P K = 2(B M + M C) = 2a. As expected, triangle A P K is isosceles, angle K in it is 75^{circ}, and the required angle is 75^{circ}.## Second SolutionK A turned out to be the bisector of angle M K D. M A is the bisector of angle B M K. These are the external angles of triangle M K C. It remains to see that A C is the bisector of the internal angle C of this triangle. Therefore, point A is the excenter of triangle M C K. We draw the diagonal A C in the square. Then point A is the intersection of the bisectors of the internal angle C of triangle M C K and the external angle M of the same triangle. That is, point A is the excenter of this triangle. Consequently, the line passing through the third vertex of this triangle and point A will also be the bisector of the external angle K of this triangle.

Formulating the Problem:   - A northern walk can be broken down into segments of north steps and segments of east or west steps.   - We need to count the number of ways to arrange these segments such that the total length is 6 steps.3. Counting the Segments:   - Let ( k ) be the number of segments in the walk.   - The number of ways to divide 6 steps into ( k ) segments is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{5}{k-1} ). This is because we need ( k-1 ) dividers to create ( k ) segments from 6 steps.4. Assigning Directions:   - For each segment, we can choose to go north, east, or west.   - If a segment is a north segment, it contributes no sideways steps.   - If a segment is an east or west segment, it contributes one sideways step.5. Calculating the Total Number of Walks:   - We need to consider all possible values of ( k ) and sum the contributions from each.   - For each ( k ), we calculate the number of ways to assign directions to the segments and multiply by the number of ways to divide the steps.6.

Label the vertices and define the problem:   Let the vertices of the convex n-polygon mathcal{P} be labeled as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n in clockwise order. We need to determine the number of different nice 3-colorings of these vertices such that every interior point of mathcal{P} is inside or on the boundary of a triangle formed by vertices with pairwise distinct colors.2. Characterize the nice coloring:   A nice coloring requires that every interior point of mathcal{P} is inside or on the boundary of a triangle formed by vertices with pairwise distinct colors. This implies that no two adjacent vertices can have the same color, and all three colors must be used.3. Reduction to smaller polygons:   If A_i, A_{i+1}, A_{i+2} have pairwise distinct colors, we can reduce the problem to a smaller polygon by removing A_{i+1}. This motivates the following characterization:   - If the coloring uses all three colors and no two adjacent vertices have the same color, the coloring is nice.   - If two adjacent vertices have the same color, then the coloring is not nice.4. Induction and base cases:   We proceed by induction. If A_i, A_{i+1}, A_{i+2} pairwise distinct does not exist, then the color of A_i is the same as the color of A_{i+2} for every i, which implies the polygon is 2-colorable. Hence, such a configuration must exist.5. Counting the number of nice colorings:   Let f(n) be the number of ways to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color and all three colors are used. Let g(n) be the number of ways to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, and the first and last vertices are different colors.6. Recurrence relations:   - f(n) + 2g(n) = 2^n: Each vertex has 2 choices depending on the color of the previous vertex.   - f(n) = 2g(n-1): The first and last vertices must be different.   - g(n) = f(n-1) + g(n-1): The last vertex can be either of the two colors different from the previous vertex.7. Solving the recurrence relations:   - From f(n) = 2g(n-1) and g(n) = f(n-1) + g(n-1), we get f(n) - g(n) = -(f(n-1) - g(n-1)).   - Using the initial conditions f(2) = 2 and g(2) = 1, we solve the recurrence relations to get:     [     f(n) = frac{2^n + 2(-1)^n}{3}     ]     [     g(n) = frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3}     ]8.

We will show by complete induction that the vertices can be colored with three colors such that in each triangle of the decomposition, the three vertices have different colors. This is trivial for n=3. If n geq 4, there is a triangle that lies on two sides of the n-gon. (For example, because there are more sides than triangles, and a triangle cannot lie on three sides.) This triangle is bounded by two adjacent sides of the n-gon, and its third side is a diagonal. If we remove this triangle, the remaining (n-1)-gon can be colored. The two vertices of the removed triangle have been colored with different colors, because the diagonal is also a side of another triangle. Therefore, we can choose an appropriate color for the third vertex.Thus, color the vertices with three colors, and consider the color that appears the least frequently. By placing a guard at each vertex of this color, the guards will see every wall and every interior point of the polygon, and their number cannot exceed frac{n}{3}.From the work of Nikolett Győri (Fazekas M.

The expected value of the number of practical cats is frac{m}{n}, where m and n are positive integers with gcd(m,n)=1. Compute 100m + n.[i]Proposed by Brandon Wang[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - There are 100 cats at a party.   - Each pair of cats flips a coin and shakes paws if the coin comes up heads.   - There are exactly 4900 pairs of cats that shook paws.   - Each cat is assigned a happiness index uniformly at random in the interval ([0,1]).   - A cat is considered practical if its happiness index is strictly greater than the index of every cat with which it shook paws.   - We need to find the expected number of practical cats and express it in the form (frac{m}{n}) where (gcd(m,n)=1), and then compute (100m + n).2. Setting Up the Problem:   - Let (X_i) be an indicator random variable that is 1 if cat (i) is practical and 0 otherwise.   - The expected number of practical cats is (Eleft[sum_{i=1}^{100} X_iright] = sum_{i=1}^{100} E[X_i]) by the linearity of expectation.3. Calculating (E[X_i]):   - For cat (i) to be practical, its happiness index must be greater than the happiness index of every cat it shook paws with.   - Let (d_i) be the degree of cat (i) in the graph where an edge represents a pair of cats that shook paws.   - The probability that cat (i) is practical is the probability that its happiness index is the maximum among (d_i + 1) values (its own index and the indices of the (d_i) cats it shook paws with).   - Since the happiness indices are uniformly distributed, the probability that cat (i) has the highest index among (d_i + 1) values is (frac{1}{d_i + 1}).4. Expected Degree Calculation:   - The total number of edges in the graph is 4900, and there are 100 cats.   - The sum of the degrees of all cats is (2 times 4900 = 9800) (since each edge is counted twice).   - The average degree (bar{d}) of a cat is (frac{9800}{100} = 98).5. Expected Value of Practical Cats:   - The expected value of (d_i) for a randomly chosen cat is 98.   - Therefore, the expected value of (frac{1}{d_i + 1}) is approximately (frac{1}{98 + 1} = frac{1}{99}).   - The expected number of practical cats is (100 times frac{1}{99} = frac{100}{99}).6. Simplifying the Fraction:   - The fraction (frac{100}{99}) is already in its simplest form since (gcd(100, 99) = 1).   - Thus, (m = 100) and (n = 99).7. Final Calculation:   - Compute (100m + n = 100 times 100 + 99 = 10000 + 99 = 10099).The final answer is (boxed{10099})."},{"problem":"14.

Bipartite Graph Argument:   - Suppose ( G ) is bipartite, split into two sets ( X ) and ( Y ).   - In a bipartite graph, the sum of degrees in each partition must be equal:     [     sum_{v in X} d(v) = sum_{v in Y} d(v) implies k|X| = k|Y| implies |X| = |Y|     ]   - Since ( n = 2021 ) is odd, it is impossible to split ( G ) into two equal parts.

Since ( G ) is triangle-free, ( r geq 5 ).   - For any vertex ( v notin C ), ( v ) can have at most 2 neighbors in ( C ).

If the minimal possible value of AL is sqrt{n}, where n in mathbb{Z}, find n.","solution":"1. Observation of Tangency:   - The first thing to observe here is that HJ is in fact tangent to the incircle of triangle ABC at L. To prove this, we see that A is the circumcenter of triangle HIJ, so by the incenter-excenter lemma, I is the incenter of triangle HJM. In addition, observe that by Euler's theorem, d^2 = R^2 - 2rR, so the inradius of triangle HJM equals the inradius of triangle ABC.2. Intersection Points:   - Let HJ intersect AB at N and AC at O. The main observation is that triangle AON is similar to triangle ABC. To prove this, observe that by the power of a point theorem, AN times NB = HN times NJ = AI^2 - AN^2 implies AN(NB + AN) = AN times AB = AI^2. Similarly, AO times AC = AI^2. Hence, AN times AB = AO times AC implies frac{AN}{AC} = frac{AO}{AB}. Thus, by SAS similarity, triangle AON is similar to triangle ABC.3. Excenter and Incircle Tangency:   - Let the A-excenter of triangle ABC be tangent to BC at U and the incircle of triangle ABC be tangent to BC at R. It is well known that BR = UC = s - b = 6, where s is the semiperimeter of triangle ABC.4. Height Calculation:   - Since the height from A of the triangle is 12, we have by the Pythagorean theorem that:     [     12^2 + (14 - 6 - 5)^2 = AU^2 implies AU = sqrt{153} = 3sqrt{17}     ]5. Ratio of Inradius to Exradius:   - It is well known that the ratio of the inradius to the A-exradius is frac{s - a}{s} = frac{7}{21} = frac{1}{3}. Hence, AL = frac{AU}{3} = sqrt{17}.6.

First, we express 2^{30} as a power of a sum:2^{30} = (2^3)^{10} = (8)^{10} = (7 + 1)^{10}Next, we expand (7 + 1)^{10} using the binomial theorem, which states that (a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} {C}_{n}^{k} a^{n-k}b^k:(7 + 1)^{10} = {C}_{10}^{0}7^{10} + {C}_{10}^{1}7^{9} + cdots + {C}_{10}^{9}7^{1} + {C}_{10}^{10}7^{0}Every term in this expansion, except for the last one, is divisible by 7, because they all contain a factor of 7 to some power. The last term, {C}_{10}^{10}7^{0}, simplifies to 1, since {C}_{10}^{10} = 1 and 7^{0} = 1. Therefore, when we divide 2^{30} by 7, all terms except for the last one give a remainder of 0, and the last term gives a remainder of 1. This means the remainder when 2^{30} is divided by 7 is 1. Since the cycle of days of the week repeats every 7 days, and today is Monday, the first day of the week, a remainder of 1 means that the 2^{30}th day will also be a Monday.

Given a natural number x=9^{n}-1, where n is a natural number. It is known that x has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 11. Find x.","solution":"Answer: 59048.Solution. Since the number x is even, one of its prime divisors is 2. Therefore, we need to find all x that have exactly two odd prime divisors, one of which is 11. First, let's prove that the number 3^{s}+1 cannot be a power of two when s>1, and the number 3^{s}-1 cannot be a power of two when s>2. Indeed, for s>1, the number 3^{s}+1 is greater than 8 and is not divisible by 8, as its remainder when divided by 8 is 4 or 2. Now let s>2. If s is odd, the number 3^{s}-1 is greater than 8 and is not divisible by 8, as its remainder when divided by 8 is 2. If s=2k, then 3^{s}-1 is divisible by the number 3^{k}+1, which is not a power of two. From the above, it follows, in particular, that 9^{s}-1 will be a power of two only when s=1.The remainders of the powers of 9 when divided by 11 are 9, 4, 3, 5, 1 and then repeat cyclically. Therefore, the divisibility of x by 11 means that n is a multiple of 5, i.e., x=9^{5m}-1. If m=1, we get x=9^{5}-1=59048=2^{3} cdot 11^{2} cdot 61, which fits our criteria. Let's show that there are no solutions for m>1. Consider two cases.1) m is odd. By the formula for the sum of a geometric progression,x=p cdot q, quad text{where } p=9^{m}-1, quad q=1+9^{m}+9^{2m}+9^{3m}+9^{4m}Let's prove that the numbers p and q are coprime. Indeed, let the number r divide both p and q. Then5=q-(9^{m}-1)-(9^{2m}-1)-(9^{3m}-1)-(9^{4m}-1)Differences of the form 9^{km}-1 are divisible by p and, therefore, by r. Thus, r is a divisor of 5. But p is not divisible by 5 when m is odd, so r=1.Suppose p is divisible by 11. Then m vdots leq 5, i.e., m=5k. If k=1, then p is divisible by 11 and 61. For k>1, we can apply the same reasoning to p as to x. In both cases, p will decompose into two coprime factors that are not powers of two. Therefore, x has at least three different odd prime divisors, which is impossible.Now suppose q is divisible by 11. Note that p has an odd divisor, and q is odd and coprime with p. Then q must be a power of 11, i.e., q=11^{s}. But the remainder of 11^{s} when divided by 8 is 3 for odd s and 1 for even s, while the remainder of q when divided by 8 is 5. Therefore, the number q cannot be a power of 11.2) m is even. Then n=2k for k geq 5, andx=(9^{k}-1)(9^{k}+1)=(3^{k}-1)(3^{k}+1)(9^{k}+1)The factors on the right side are coprime, since the pairs of numbers 3^{k} pm 1 and 9^{k} pm 1 are odd and differ by 2. Moreover, none of the factors is a power of two. Indeed, we have already proven this for the first two, and 9^{k}+1 is greater than 8 and gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 8. Thus, x has at least three different odd prime divisors, which is impossible."},{"problem":"Example 5, find a four-digit number that can be divided by 11, and the quotient obtained is 10 times the sum of the digits of this four-digit number.","solution":"Let overline{a b c d}=110(a+b+c+d), then we have890 a=10 b+100 c+109 d text {. }Also, since 11 divides overline{a b c d}, we have a-b+c-d= pm 11 or a-b+c-d=0.If a-b+c-d=0,then from left{begin{array}{l}a+c=b+d,  890 a=10 b+100 c+109 dend{array}right.(2) -10 times(1) we get880 a=110 c+99 d leqslant(110+99) times 9=1881 text {. }If a=1, substituting into (3) gives 80=10 c+9 d,therefore d=0, c=8, b=9 text {; }If a=2, substituting into (3) gives 1760=110 c+99 dtherefore d=0, c=16 text { (not valid). }Therefore, the required four-digit number is 1980.If a-b+c-d=11,then from left{begin{array}{l}a+c=11+b+d,  890 a=10 b+100 c+109 d text { (5) }end{array}right.(5) -10 times (4) we get110 c=880 a-99 d+110 geqslant 990.

Which values of n are possible, if P is circumscribed?","solution":"1. Claim: The only possible value of ( n ) for which a convex ( n )-gon ( P ) can be dissected into equal triangles by diagonals non-intersecting inside it, and ( P ) is circumscribed, is ( n = 4 ).2. Verification for ( n = 4 ):   - Consider a square (a convex quadrilateral) which is circumscribed around a circle.   - Draw one diagonal of the square. This diagonal divides the square into two equal triangles.   - Thus, ( n = 4 ) works.3. General Case for ( n > 4 ):   - Suppose ( P ) is a convex ( n )-gon with ( n > 4 ) and is circumscribed around a circle.   - Assume ( P ) is dissected into equal triangles by diagonals that do not intersect inside ( P ).4. Properties of Circumscribed Polygons:   - For a polygon to be circumscribed, all its sides must be tangent to a common circle.   - This implies that the polygon is cyclic (all vertices lie on a common circle).5. Diagonal and Triangle Properties:   - Consider a diagonal ( AB ) of the ( n )-gon.   - Suppose ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ABD ) are two triangles formed by this diagonal in the triangulation.   - Since the triangles are equal, the angles subtended by the arcs ( AC ) and ( AD ) at the circumference must be equal.6. Angle Analysis:   - Let ( angle ACB ) and ( angle ADB ) be the angles at vertices ( C ) and ( D ) respectively.   - Since ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ABD ) are equal, ( angle ACB = angle ADB ).   - In a cyclic polygon, the sum of opposite angles is ( 180^circ ). Therefore, ( angle ACB + angle ADB = 180^circ ).   - Given ( angle ACB = angle ADB ), we have ( 2angle ACB = 180^circ ) which implies ( angle ACB = angle ADB = 90^circ ).7. Implication of ( 90^circ ) Angles:   - If ( angle ACB = angle ADB = 90^circ ), then ( AB ) must be a diameter of the circumscribed circle.   - This means that any diagonal used in the triangulation must be a diameter of the circle.8. Intersection of Diameters:   - Since any two diameters of a circle intersect at the center, it is impossible to draw more than one diameter without them intersecting.   - Therefore, at most one diagonal can be drawn, which implies ( n leq 4 ).9. Conclusion:   - Since ( n ) must be greater than 3 and the only value satisfying ( n leq 4 ) is ( n = 4 ), the only possible value is ( n = 4 ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 4 } )."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, b=2, B=45^circ.

We are looking for a p(x) for which there exists a polynomial q(x) such thatp(x)=q(x) p^{prime}(x)From this, if n=0, it follows that p(x)=0, which is not a solution because division by 0 is not allowed. For the rest, we assume that n>0, in which case we can also assume that alpha_{n} neq 0, i.e., p is exactly of degree n. Then p^{prime} is of degree (n-1), so (3) can only hold with a first-degree q:q(x)=b x+cSubstituting this into (3) and using the fact that the equality of two polynomials is equivalent to the equality of the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we get the following relationships:begin{aligned}& a_{0}=n b a_{0} & a_{1}=(n-1) b a_{1}+n c a_{0} & vdots & a_{k}=(n-k) b a_{k}+(n-k+1) c a_{k-1} & vdots & a_{n}=0+c a_{n-1}end{aligned}From these, on the one hand, n b=1, and on the other hand,a_{k}=frac{n-k+1}{k} n c a_{k-1}, quad(k=1,2, ldots, n)follows.

Moreover,p^{prime}(x)=n a_{0}(x+d)^{n-1}which indeed satisfies (3) if we choose q to be the polynomialq(x)=frac{1}{n}(x-d)Thus, (6) gives all solutions to the problem.Strommer Pál (Budapest, Piarista Gimn., IV. o. t.)II. solution. In the first solution, we showed thatp(x)=frac{1}{n}(x+d) p^{prime}(x)i.e., p is divisible by (x+d). Let k be the highest power of (x+d) by which p(x) is divisible:p(x)=(x+d)^{k} h(x)where h is no longer divisible by (x+d), i.e., h(-d) neq 0. Thenp^{prime}(x)=k(x+d)^{k-1} h(x)+(x+d)^{k} h^{prime}(x)Substituting this together with (8) into (7) and dividing by (x+d)^{k}, we geth(x)=frac{k}{n} h(x)+(x+d) h^{prime}(x)Substituting x=(-d) into this, we get k=n because h(-d) neq 0, i.e., h(x) is constant. In this case, (8) is equivalent to (6), so (6) gives all solutions.III. solution. If in (3) q is not identically 0, then (3) implies frac{p^{prime}}{p}=frac{1}{q}. Since frac{p^{prime}}{p} is the derivative of the function log p(x), and the function frac{1}{q}=frac{n}{x+d} is the derivative of the function log (x+d)^{n}, it follows that the difference between the functions log p(x) and log (x+d)^{n} is constant:log p(x)-log (x+d)^{n}=Ai.e.,p(x)=B(x+d)^{n}where A=log B, again giving us (6)."},{"problem":"16th Putnam 1956 Problem A3 Find the trajectory of a particle which moves from rest in a vertical plane under (constant) gravity and a force k v perpendicular to its velocity v .","solution":"Take the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis vertically downwards.

Let's break down the solution step by step:1. Starting with the given equation:    x^{2}-2x-3=0   We can rearrange this equation to isolate the quadratic term and the linear term on one side:   x^{2}-2x=32. Expanding the given algebraic expression:    We need to find the value of left(2x-1right)^{2}-left(x-1right)left(x+3right). Let's expand both parts of this expression:   - For left(2x-1right)^{2}, applying the square of a binomial formula (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, we get:     left(2x-1right)^{2} = 4x^{2}-4x+1   - For left(x-1right)left(x+3right), applying the distributive property (FOIL method), we get:     left(x-1right)left(x+3right) = x^{2}+2x-33. Subtracting the second expansion from the first:   4x^{2}-4x+1 - (x^{2}+2x-3)   Simplifying this expression by combining like terms:   = 4x^{2}-4x+1 - x^{2} - 2x + 3   = 3x^{2}-6x+44. Using the given equation to simplify further:   Since we know x^{2}-2x=3, we can substitute 3 for x^{2}-2x in our expression:   3x^{2}-6x+4 = 3(x^{2}-2x) + 4   Substituting 3 for x^{2}-2x, we get:   = 3 times 3 + 4   = 9 + 4   = 13Therefore, the value of the algebraic expression left(2x-1right)^{2}-left(x-1right)left(x+3right) is boxed{13}."},{"problem":"Given that f(x+1) = x² + 1, find f(2).","solution":"According to the problem, the function f(x) satisfies f(x+1) = x² + 1.Let x+1 = 2, then x = 1.Thus, f(2) = 1² + 1 = 2.Therefore, the answer is boxed{2}.In the function f(x+1) = x² + 1, we substitute x+1 with 2 to find the value of x.

Let the height of the pyramid be h. The formula for the volume of a square pyramid is frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height}. In this case, the base is a square with side length 4sqrt{2}, so the base area is (4sqrt{2})^2 = 32.

The sum is thus congruent to 2 bmod 4, but that is never a square.Now assume that p and q are both even. Then they are both equal to 2. This gives p^{q+1}+q^{p+1}= 2^{3}+2^{3}=16=4^{2}, so this pair satisfies the condition.Finally, assume that one of them, say p, is even and the other is odd. We then have p=2 and 2^{q+1}+q^{3}=a^{2} for some positive integer a.

Both factors are divisible by q^{k}, so their difference is also divisible by it. Thus q^{k} mid 2 cdot 2^{b}=2^{b+1}. But q is an odd prime, so the only q-power that is a divisor of a power of two is 1. Therefore, k=0. We now get q^{3}=a+2^{b} and a-2^{b}=1, so q^{3}=left(2^{b}+1right)+2^{b}=2^{b+1}+1. From this, it follows that2^{b+1}=q^{3}-1=(q-1)left(q^{2}+q+1right).However, q^{2}+q+1 equiv 1 bmod 2 and further, q^{2}+q+1>1, so it can never be a power of two.

Determining the possible Sundays:   - Let the three even-numbered Sundays be (2k, 2k+14, 2k+28) where (k) is an integer.   - Since the maximum number of days in a month is 31, the highest possible even-numbered Sunday is 30.4. Finding the possible values for (k):   - The smallest even number is 2, so (2k = 2).   - The largest even number that can be a Sunday is 30, so (2k + 28 leq 30).   - Solving for (k), we get (2k leq 2), which implies (k = 1).5.

Step 1: Establish the general form of the circle's equation. Since the circle is tangent to the y-axis at A(0,2), its center must be on a line parallel to the x-axis and passing through (0,2). Thus, the center of the circle can be represented as (a,2), where a is the distance from the y-axis. The radius of the circle is |a|, leading to the equation of the circle as left(x-aright)^{2}+left(y-2right)^{2}=a^{2}.Step 2: Determine the distance from the center of the circle to the tangent line. The distance d from the center (a,2) to the line 4x-3y+9=0 is given by the formula d=frac{{|4a-3(2)+9|}}{sqrt{4^2+(-3)^2}}=frac{{|4a+3|}}{5}. Step 3: Equate the distance to the radius. Since the circle is tangent to the line, this distance d must equal the radius |a|. Therefore, we have frac{{|4a+3|}}{5}=|a|. Step 4: Solve for a. This equation simplifies to |4a+3|=5|a|. There are two cases to consider based on the absolute value:- Case 1: 4a+3=5a or 4a+3=-5a. Solving these gives a=3 or a=-frac{1}{3}.Step 5: Write the equation of the circle for each value of a.

A sequence that meets the given condition is called 'good'. We will determine the number of good sequences indirectly by first counting something else.We first look at the possible ways to color the numbers from 1 to 12, each with blue or red.

We call such a coloring 'good' if there is at least one red and at least one blue number, and the largest red number is greater than the smallest blue number. There are exactly 13 colorings that are not good, namely when no number is red, or when the red numbers are exactly the numbers 1 to k for some k=1,2, ldots, 12 (if k=12, there are no blue numbers).

Additionally, you will learn to find the smallest and largest values of a function continuous on an interval and to investigate the local behavior of a function using its higher-order derivatives.Using the package SOLVER.VM, you can compute the derivatives of a function (of any order), solve equations to find points of possible extremum and inflection, find the values of the function at the required points, perform all numerical calculations, and verify the correctness of the results you have obtained.## 5.1. General Scheme for Constructing the Graph of a FunctionProblem Statement. Investigate the function y=f(x) and construct its graph.Plan for Solution. The results obtained in each step are sequentially recorded on the diagram as elements of the desired graph, and in the end, we obtain a sketch of the graph.1. Find the domain D of the function f(x) and investigate its behavior at the boundary points x=x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}, pm infty of the domain D, including x= pm infty.a) Let x=x_{k} quad(k=1,2, ldots, n) be a finite boundary point of the domain D (i.e., f(x) is not defined at this point). Compute the one-sided limitslim _{x rightarrow x_{k}-0} f(x) text { and/or } lim _{x rightarrow x_{k}+0} f(x) .If at least one of these limits is infinite, then x=x_{k} is a vertical asymptote of the graph of f(x).b) Investigate the behavior of the function as x rightarrow+infty:If there exist finite limitslim _{x rightarrow+infty} frac{f(x)}{x}=k quad text { and } quad lim _{x rightarrow+infty}[f(x)-k x]=b,then the line y=k x+b is an oblique asymptote of the graph of the function f(x) as x rightarrow+infty (if k=0, i.e., b=lim _{x rightarrow+infty} f(x), then y=b is a horizontal asymptote).Similarly, investigate the behavior of the function as x rightarrow-infty.Note that the asymptotes as x rightarrow+infty and as x rightarrow-infty may be different.2. Determine the evenness and periodicity of the function.If f(-x)=f(x), then the function f(x) is called even. The graphs of even functions are symmetric with respect to the O Y axis. Therefore, it is sufficient to construct the graph of an even function for x>0 and then draw the entire graph by reflecting the obtained curve with respect to the O Y axis.If f(-x)=-f(x), then the function f(x) is called odd. The graphs of odd functions are symmetric with respect to the point (0,0). Therefore, it is sufficient to construct the graph of an odd function for x>0 and then draw the entire graph by reflecting the obtained curve with respect to the point (0,0).If f(x+T)=f(x) for some T>0, then the function f(x) is called periodic. The graph of a periodic function has the same shape on each of the intervals ldots,[-2 T,-T],[-T, 0],[0, T], [T, 2 T], ldots Therefore, it is sufficient to construct the graph on any one such interval and then reproduce the obtained curve on the other intervals.3. Find the points of intersection of the graph with the coordinate axes. For this, compute f(0) and solve the equation f(x)=0.4. Find the points of maximum and minimum of the function and the intervals of monotonicity. For this:a) compute the derivative f^{prime}(x) and find the critical points of the function, i.e., points where f^{prime}(x)=0, pm infty or does not exist. Note that if f^{prime}(a)=0, then the tangent to the graph at this point is horizontal, if f^{prime}(a)= pm infty, then the tangent is vertical.b) by determining the sign of the derivative, find the intervals of increase and decrease of the function: if f^{prime}(x)>0, the function is increasing, if f^{prime}(x)<0, the function is decreasing;c) if the derivative changes sign at a critical point a, then a is a point of extremum: if f^{prime}(x)>0 for x in(a-delta, a) and f^{prime}(x)<0 for x in(a, a+delta), then a is a point of maximum; if f^{prime}(x)<0 for x in(a-delta, a) and f^{prime}(x)>0 for x in(a, a+delta), then a is a point of minimum;if the derivative retains its sign when passing through a critical point, then there is no extremum at this point.5. Find the points of inflection of the function and the intervals of concavity up and down. For this:a) compute the second derivative f^{prime prime}(x) and find the points belonging to the domain of the function where f^{prime"},{"problem":"A certain product plans to reduce its cost by 36% over two years.

For simplicity, let M_{x_{0}} and m_{x_{0}} denote the maximum and minimum values of the function x mapsto x^{2} on the interval [x_{0}; x_{0}+1]. We distinguish several cases based on the possible values of x_{0}.1. case: x_{0} geq 0. In this case, the function is strictly increasing on the interval [x_{0}; x_{0}+1], taking its minimum at x_{0} and its maximum at (x_{0}+1).M_{x_{0}} - m_{x_{0}} = (x_{0}+1)^{2} - x_{0}^{2} = 2 x_{0} + 1 geq 12. case: x_{0} leq -1.

To determine the range of values for m, we need to find the minimum value of the expression on the right-hand side, |x - 2| + |x + 3|, because m must be less than this minimum for the inequality to hold for all x.4.

After noting its tedious nature, I recommend looking for the solution using Zsigmondy.We rewrite (a+b)left(a^{2}-a b+b^{2}right)=p^{n}. Since a+b geq 2, we know that p mid a+b. We have a^{2}-a b+b^{2}=(a-b)^{2}+a b, so a=b=1 or a^{2}-a b+b^{2} geq 2 and thus p mid a^{2}-a b+b^{2}. Let's consider the second case. Then p also divides (a+b)^{2}-left(a^{2}-a b+b^{2}right)=3 a b. We recall that p mid a+b, so p mid a if and only if p mid b. Thus, either p=3, or p mid a and p mid b. In this case, we rewrite a=p a^{prime} and b=p b^{prime}, and we get a^{prime 3}+b^{prime 3}=p^{n-3}, noting that n-3>0 because a^{prime} geq 1 and b^{prime} geq 1.

Similarly, the difference of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be less than the length of the remaining side. Given sides of lengths 2 and 5, we calculate the possible range for the third side:   - The difference between 5 and 2 is 3, so the third side must be greater than 3.   - The sum of 5 and 2 is 7, so the third side must be less than 7.

For points P(x_{0},y_{0}) and Q(-x_{0},y_{0}) on C and symmetric about the y-axis, we proceed as follows:1. Slope of Line AP: The slope of line AP, denoted as k_{AP}, is calculated by the difference in y-coordinates divided by the difference in x-coordinates between points A and P. Thus, k_{AP} = frac{y_{0} - 0}{x_{0} - (-a)} = frac{y_{0}}{x_{0} + a}.2. Slope of Line AQ: Similarly, the slope of line AQ, denoted as k_{AQ}, is frac{y_{0} - 0}{-x_{0} - (-a)} = frac{y_{0}}{a - x_{0}}.3. Product of Slopes: The product of the slopes of lines AP and AQ is given by k_{AP} cdot k_{AQ} = frac{y_{0}}{x_{0} + a} cdot frac{y_{0}}{a - x_{0}} = -frac{y_{0}^{2}}{x_{0}^{2} - a^{2}}. According to the problem, this product equals frac{1}{3}.4. Relation in Ellipse Equation: Substituting the coordinates of P into the ellipse equation, we get frac{x_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac{y_{0}^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1. Rearranging for y_{0}^{2}, we find y_{0}^{2} = b^{2}(1 - frac{x_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}}) = frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}(a^{2} - x_{0}^{2}).5. Substituting y_{0}^{2}: By substituting y_{0}^{2} from step 4 into the equation from step 3, we get -frac{frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}(a^{2} - x_{0}^{2})}{x_{0}^{2} - a^{2}} = frac{1}{3}, which simplifies to frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}} = frac{1}{3}.6. Calculating Eccentricity: The eccentricity e of an ellipse is given by e = frac{c}{a}, where c = sqrt{a^{2} - b^{2}}. Substituting frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}} = frac{1}{3} into the formula for e, we get e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}} = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{3}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}.Therefore, the eccentricity of the ellipse C is boxed{frac{sqrt{6}}{3}}."},{"problem":"G6.3 Each interior angle of an N-sided regular polygon is 140^{circ}.

Let this new person be ( P_{n+1} ). According to the induction hypothesis, the ( n ) people can share all information among themselves with ( 2n - 2 ) calls.4. First Call:   The new person ( P_{n+1} ) makes a call to any one of the ( n ) people (say ( P_1 )). After this call, ( P_{n+1} ) knows everything that ( P_1 ) knows, which is all the information of the ( n ) people.5. Last Call:   Finally, one of the ( n ) people (say ( P_n )) makes a call to ( P_{n+1} ). After this call, ( P_{n+1} ) shares all the information they have (which includes the information from the first call) with ( P_n ). Now, ( P_n ) knows everything that ( P_{n+1} ) knows, which is all the information of the ( n+1 ) people.6. Total Calls:   The total number of calls made is the ( 2n - 2 ) calls for the initial ( n ) people plus the 2 additional calls for the new person, which sums up to ( 2n ).7. Optimality:   To prove that ( 2n - 2 ) is the minimum number of calls, consider that each person must receive information from at least one other person. This requires at least ( n ) calls. Additionally, for ( n > 1 ), the first person must receive at least one additional call to ensure they know everything, and similarly for each subsequent person. Thus, the minimum number of additional calls required is ( n - 2 ). Therefore, the total minimum number of calls is ( n + (n - 2) = 2n - 2 ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 2n - 2 } )."},{"problem":"8.3 On the side BC of the rhombus ABCD, select a point M.

Let A B be a side of a convex polygon M, which has diagonals of only two possible lengths x and y.

The choice of these side lengths uniquely determines the vertex C, as it must lie on the same side of the line A B as the entire polygon M. However, there are only four such combinations of sides: C A=C B=x ; C A=C B=y ; C A=x, C B=y; C A=y, C B=y.

For all initial states and operation methods, find the maximum possible number of operations.(Zhu Huawei)","solution":"8. First, prove that the number of operations cannot exceedmathrm{C}_{n}^{2}=frac{n(n-1)}{2} text {. }When there are n sets on the blackboard, consider the number of pairs of sets that are in a containment relationship. After each operation, this number increases by at least 1.Assume transforming sets A and B into A cap B and A cup B.First, A and B are not in a containment relationship, but A cap B and A cup B are in a containment relationship, so this operation increases the number of containment pairs by at least one.For another set C, if C is in a containment relationship with either A or B, by symmetry, assume A subseteq C, then A cap B subseteq C, meaning C is in a containment relationship with at least one of A cap B or A cup B; if C is in a containment relationship with both A and B, then since A and B are not in a containment relationship, it must be that either A subseteq C and B subseteq C, or A supseteq C and B supseteq C. If the former, then A cap B subseteq C and A cup B subseteq C; if the latter, then A cap B supseteq C and A cup B supseteq C.Thus, after the operation, the number of other containment pairs does not decrease, so the number of containment pairs increases by at least 1 after each operation.Since this number can be at most mathrm{C}_{n}^{2}=frac{n(n-1)}{2} and at least 0, the number of operations is at most frac{n(n-1)}{2}.Next, provide an example where the number of operations is frac{n(n-1)}{2}.Define the setsA_{i}={i, i+1, cdots, i+n-2}(i=1,2, cdots, n).Next, prove that starting from A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n}, frac{n(n-1)}{2} operations can be performed.Use mathematical induction.When n=2,A_{1}={1}, A_{2}={2},frac{2(2-1)}{2}=1 operation can be performed.If the conclusion holds for n, consider the case for n+1.Perform one operation on A_{1}={1,2, cdots, n} and A_{2}={2,3, cdots, n+1}, obtaining the intersection {2,3, cdots, n} and leaving it, and the union continues to operate with A_{3}={3,4, cdots, n+2}, obtaining the intersection {3,4, cdots, n+1} and leaving it, and the union continues to operate with A_{4}, and so on.After n operations, the union of all original sets {1,2, cdots, 2 n} and another n setsbegin{array}{l}{2,3, cdots, n},{3,4, cdots, n+1}, cdots, {n+1, n+2, cdots, 2 n-1} .end{array}are obtained.Finally, consider only the operations among the last n sets.Since reducing all elements by 1 does not change the relationships between sets, consider the setsbegin{array}{l}{1,2, cdots, n-1},{2,3, cdots, n}, cdots, {n, n+1, cdots, 2 n-2} .end{array}By the induction hypothesis, these sets can be operated on mathrm{C}_{n}^{2}=frac{n(n-1)}{2} times, so the original n+1 sets can be operated onfrac{n(n-1)}{2}+n=frac{n(n+1)}{2}=mathrm{C}_{n+1}^{2},times, meaning the conclusion holds for n+1.In summary, the maximum possible number of operations ismathrm{C}_{n}^{2}=frac{n(n-1)}{2} ."},{"problem":"If sin x + cos x = frac{1}{5}, and 0 < x < pi, then the value of tan x is (　　)A: - frac {4}{3}B: - frac {4}{3} or - frac {3}{4}C: - frac {3}{4}D: frac {4}{3} or - frac {3}{4}","solution":"Given sin x + cos x = frac {1}{5}, squaring both sides yields 1 + 2sin xcos x = frac {1}{25}.

Then the given equation implies f(x)+a[y]=f(x-f(y))=f(x-f(z))=f(x)+a[z] whence [y]=[z]. Conversely, if [y]=[z] then f(x-f(y))=f(x)+a[y]=f(x)+a[z=f(x-f(z))]. It follows from previous observation that [x-f(y)]=[x-f(z)] for all x. Set x=frac{f(y)+f(z)}{2}, then left[frac{f(y)-f(z)}{2}right]=left[-frac{f(y)-f(z)}{2}right], so f(y)=f(z). The lemma is proved.Now we claim that f(m) in mathbb{Z} for any m in mathbb{Z}. Setting y=m in the given equation we obtain f(x-f(m))=f(x)+ am for any m in mathbb{Z}, x in mathbb{R}. Suppose that f(m) notin mathbb{Z} for some m in mathbb{Z}. Choose t in(0,1) such that [f(m)]=[f(m)+t]. Then for x=0 we have f(-f(m))=f(0)+ am and for x=-t we have f(-t-f(m))=f(-t)+a m. Using the lemma we have f(-f(m))=f(-t-f(m)), so f(0)=f(-t)=f(-1), which contradicts the lemma.From now on we will use in the given equation f(x-f(y))=f(x)+a y (1) only integer numbers x, y. Setting y=1 in (1) we obtain that a in mathbb{Z}. Further, for y=0 we have f(x-f(0))=f(x) and therefore x-f(0)=x (by lemma), whence f(0)=0. Now set x=f(y), then f(f(y))=-a y (2); replacing y by f(y) in (1) we get f(x+a y)=f(x)+a f(y) (3). Denoting f(1) by n and setting y=1 in (3) we obtain f(x+a)=f(x)+a n (4). Applying (4) to x=0 we get f(a)= an. From (4) we easily conclude that f(k a)=k a n for any k in mathbb{Z}; in particular f(a n)=a n^{2}. Now setting y=a in (2) gives -a^{2}=f(f(a))=a n^{2} as stated.It remains to note that if a=-n^{2} then the function f(x)=n[x] satisfies the given condition: n[x-n[y]]=n[x]-n^{2}[y], which is obvious."},{"problem":"4.022.

We start with the equation (2005x + 2007y = m) and seek the largest (m) for which this equation has a unique solution in natural numbers (x) and (y).2. Consider the specific value (m = 2 cdot 2005 cdot 2007). We need to check if this value of (m) results in a unique solution.3.

Let (x = 2007x_1) and (y = 2005y_1). Substituting these into the equation, we get:   [   2005(2007x_1) + 2007(2005y_1) = 2 cdot 2005 cdot 2007   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   2005 cdot 2007 (x_1 + y_1) = 2 cdot 2005 cdot 2007   ]   Dividing both sides by (2005 cdot 2007), we get:   [   x_1 + y_1 = 2   ]5.

Now, assume (m > 2 cdot 2005 cdot 2007) and check if the equation (2005x + 2007y = m) can have a unique solution. Suppose (x leq 2007) and (y leq 2005).

Gavriil saw a squirrel sitting on a tree branch right in front of him at a distance of 3 m 75 cm through the window.

Will the squirrel be able to catch the nut if it can jump in any direction at a speed of 2 m 70 cm? Assume the acceleration due to gravity is g=10 mathrm{~m} / mathrm{c}^{2}, and neglect air resistance.","solution":"Answer: No. Solution: The coordinates of the squirrel at the initial moment: x=a ; y=0. The nut moves according to the law: x(t)=V_{0} t ; y(t)=frac{g t^{2}}{2}.Therefore, the square of the distance from the sitting squirrel to the flying nut at time t is: r^{2}=left(V_{0} t-aright)^{2}+left(frac{g t^{2}}{2}right)^{2}=frac{g^{2} t^{4}}{4}+V_{0}^{2} t^{2}-2 V_{0} a t+a^{2}.

Since f^{prime}(t)=64 t^{3}+8 t-12=4left(16 t^{3}+2 t-3right), we solve the equation 16 t^{3}+2 t-3=0. Since 16 t^{3}+2 t-3=0=(2 t-1)left(8 t^{2}+4 t+3right) and the equation 8 t^{2}+4 t+3=0 has no real roots, the equation 16 t^{3}+2 t-3=0 has a unique root t=frac{1}{2}. This will be the minimum point of the function f(t)=16 t^{4}+4 t^{2}-12 t+9, as the derivative changes sign from negative to positive at this point.Therefore, left(r^{2}right)_{min }=frac{25}{16}left(frac{16}{16}+frac{4}{4}-6+9right)=frac{25 cdot 5}{16}, and r_{min }=frac{5 sqrt{5}}{4} (m).We need to compare this number with 2.7=frac{27}{10}.

Choose one number from each group:   Since we need to choose 1003 numbers and there are 1003 groups, we must choose exactly one number from each group.

Then the second right digit must be odd in order to be divisible by 4 . Thus the last 2 digits must be of the form 12,32,52,72 or 92 . If a number ends in 12,52 or 92 , then the previous digit must be even in order not to be divisible by 8 and we have 4 admissible even digits. Now the left most digit of such a 4-digit number can be any non-zero digit and there are 9 such ways, and we get 9 times 4 times 3=108 such numbers. If a number ends in 32 or 72 , then the previous digit must be odd in order not to be divisible by 8 and we have 5 admissible odd digits. Here again the left most digit of such a 4-digit number can be any non-zero digit and there are 9 such ways, and we get 9 times 5 times 2=90 such numbers. Thus the number of 4-digit numbers having non-zero digits, ending in 2 , divisible by 4 but not by 8 is 108+90=198.(B) If the number ends in 4 , then the previous digit must be even for divisibility by 4 . Thus the last two digits must be of the form 24,44,54,84. If we take numbers ending with 24 and 64 , then the previous digit must be odd for non-divisibility by 8 and the left most digit can be any non-zero digit. Here we get 9 times 5 times 2=90 such numbers. If the last two digits are of the form 44 and 84 , then previous digit must be even for non-divisibility by 8 . And the left most digit can take 9 possible values. We thus get 9 times 4 times 2=72 numbers. Thus the admissible numbers ending in 4 is 90+72=162.(C) If a number ends with 6 , then the last two digits must be of the form 16,36,56,76,96. For numbers ending with 16,56,76, the previous digit must be odd. For numbers ending with 36,76 , the previous digit must be even. Thus we get here (9 times 5 times 3)+ (9 times 4 times 2)=135+72=207 numbers.(D) If a number ends with 8 , then the last two digits must be of the form 28,48,68,88. For numbers ending with 28,68 , the previous digit must be even. For numbers ending with 48,88 , the previous digit must be odd.

Also, given f(0)+f(3)=6, we need to analyze the properties of f(x) based on these conditions.1. Since f(x+1) is an odd function, we have:   - f(1)=0 because odd functions satisfy f(-x)=-f(x), and for x=0, it implies f(1)=-f(1), which means f(1)=0.   - The function f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0) because f(x+1)=-f(-x+1).2.

When x = -3, the denominator becomes 0, making the fraction undefined.Option C: To verify this statement, let's substitute x = -4 into the fraction:frac{(-4)^2 - 9}{-4 + 3} = frac{16 - 9}{-1} = frac{7}{-1} = -7This calculation confirms that the fraction's value is indeed -7 when x = -4, making the statement correct.Option D: For x > 3, both the numerator x^2 - 9 and the denominator x + 3 are positive.

For every move where a ball is placed from urn A into urn B, there are exactly m equally likely possibilities; for a move where a ball is placed from B into A, there are exactly n+1 equally likely possibilities.In total, there are therefore exactly m^{2}(n+1)^{2} different equally likely possibilities for the sequence of the first four moves.2.

For each of the 1 cdot m cases (where a red ball was drawn in the 2nd move), there are m possibilities to draw a red ball and 0 possibilities to draw a blue ball.Finally, in the 4th move, for each of the (m-1) cdot n cdot m cases (2nd move blue, 3rd move red), there are 2 possibilities to draw a red (and n-1 possibilities to draw a blue) ball; for each of the 1 cdot n cdot m cases (2nd and 3rd move blue), there is exactly 1 possibility to draw a (and n possibilities to draw a blue) ball; for each of the m cdot 1 cdot m (2nd and 3rd move red) cases, there is exactly 1 possibility to draw a red (and n possibilities to draw a blue) ball.Thus, the number S of favorable cases (i.e., a red ball is drawn in the 4th move) is:S=2 cdot(m-1) cdot n cdot m+1 cdot 1 cdot n cdot m+1 cdot m cdot 1 cdot mTherefore, we need to find all integer pairs (m ; n) for whichfrac{m cdot n+2(m-1) n cdot m+m^{2}}{m^{2}(n+1)^{2}}=frac{1}{2}is true.
