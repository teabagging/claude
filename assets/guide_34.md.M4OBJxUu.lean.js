Whether they are painful or not, itchy or not, it gives an orientation. The spreading of the lesions and the characteristics is very important. Recurrent rashes could demand a serious evaluation. Exposures to particular allergens or specific environmental conditions could lead to continuous recurrence of similar rash each time the allergen is contacted. A complete evaluation and examination of these lesions to actually detect the actual nature of these rashes and their characteristics might be helpful for a long term and effective management.

Thanks for writing in to HCM & for a detailed history & clinical features which does make our task of helping you out that much easier! From all that you have stated, No it does not appear to be a fungal infection to me. It appears more to be an 'allergic' phenomenon & most likely a 'photoallergic reaction' & /or more specifically a 'phyto-photodermatitis' & it may be related to the plants in your region. Please trying applying a topical betamethasone-fusidic acid cream locally to the area & taking an antihistamine. This should help relieve your symptoms. Ideally, go across to a dermatologist & do some 'patch' or 'prick' tests depending on what the suspicion is on (allergen i meant) & this may help give you a clearer picture for closure & one can avoid implicated allergens. Trust this was clear advice & gives you a clear action plan. Good Luck!

Fungal infections burn and itch and can even crack and bleed and be very painful.  If you can be seen by a physician, they can take a sample and look under the microscope for the fungus.  If not, an antifungal powder might be better suited to begin with initially and then once the area is less irritated, you could use one of the anitfungal creams.  Also, note that if you have other conditions such as Diabetes or other health issues, these can be difficult to clear up once they have gotten as bad as yours seems to be."},{"Patient":"My 6 year old son has rash on his arm and knee Small bumps about 1/8 inch in diameter, not red eleven bumps on his knee eight bumps on his chest very localized bump not red around bump other skin looks ok suggestions??

The bumps are bright red and raised. Wondering what over the counter creams I could try.","Doctor":"hello dear, Thanks for the query. You might be suffering from a fungal infection, Tinea cruris. It starts in groin region. Hydrocortisone as steroid . initially it might help a bit but in fact it will worsen the condition. you might need treatment with anti fungals.

Unfortunately , not having a family history of eczema or psoriasis does not entirely exclude the possibility that you have those conditions. However those are not the only possibilities. Poor venous blood return from the lower leg may also cause this, sometimes recognizable by the presence of varicose veins. Also diabetes may cause this, through damage to the small blood vessels. As you can see , the causes are many and wide ranging. Please get to a clinic for medical evaluation. I trust this helps you."},{"Patient":"hey i have a rash that started a couple weekes ago as one little spot on my hand and now all the itching ive done it has spread to me arms and elbows and the other hand is starting to get bad as well, they are small pimple like spots, very itchy especially at night and when i think about it it itches more of course lol. i itch them and the scab and i itch them ans they bleed and then there are some that just stay read and dont scab, but they are definitely multiplying more and more, and the doctor today gave me hydrocortisone hyderm 1%, do you think that will help or do you think it could be scabbies???","Doctor":"Thank you for your query. It is possible that this might be scabies, sometimes diagnosed by the visible little tortious lines in the skin , caused by the parasite tunneling. The problem with most rashes, if they have been present for a while and scratching has taken place, is there is secondary infection and the diagnosis is more difficult. Cortisone might help for the itch, but will not treat scabies and can aggregate bacterial infection . For that reason I feel you should see a dermatologist whom can examine your skin under magnification and thus diagnose and treat appropriately. I trust this information helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi,I m woman 31 yrs old and yesterday was my 15th day n gone through sonography in which right ovary is 15mms and left is nil and endo is 8 mms. so can i conceive? tomorrow i will go through sonography again. doctor told me that if your endo will incrase by 9 mm thn you can conceive by IUI. what is the increament size of endo day by day?","Doctor":"Hi, there is no fixed rate of endometrial lining growth. The thing is that if your endometrium thickness is more than 8 mm on day of injection of rupture, there is a good chance of getting pregnant.  The endometrial thickness increases after the ovulation and changes the pattern also. So, you can take injection for rupturing the follicles when endometrium is more than 8 mm. IUI can be done the next day.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Hope I have answered your question.

It could be necessary to actually trace what is causing the rash. A history of a recent change in the environment, diet, sleeping room, job site should worth considering. Other accompanying symptoms like fever, wheezing, rhinitis are important to consider to know if its an allergic reaction or not. An initial response to anti biotherapy could indicate an infectious cause. Persistence of symptoms should warrant an appointment with the dermatologist for a proper evaluation.

This is a very common with people who shave armpits or bikini area. I shall try to explain you The skin over the arm pits and bikini area is thin and sensitive and hair are thicker and coarser. Due to shaving very close to the skin, the sharp cut edges of the hair (may go under skin once you release skin after a stroke of razor) irritate the surrounding skin or internal structures in case of under skin hair , which leads to inflamatory process leading to itching and bumps . Once you scratch , this initiates a scratch itch cycle which further increases itching ang aggravates the condition. So it is best to avoid shaving too close to the skin. Since you have tried new blades , different creams lotions, I suggest you to go for permanent hair reduction with lasers.

Your problem seems to be due to heat urticaria which occurs due to heat, hot water etc. You may change to cold water and see if it disappears. Otherwise consult a dermatologist.

It increases the chance of pregnancy.  But alone it can't do much. You can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound. when follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.

About...I want to say...5 years ago...I developed this odd rash on the inside of my upper arm...close to my underarm . It happened while I was at the beach. It went away...and I don t know if its linked or not...but I started to see bruise spots there. And then on the other side of my upper arm to the shoulder area. It spread to my upper thighs...and now I have them on my stomach . Some are big...some are small. I have had them for about 4 years I wanna say...and I am still starting to see more. I found 3 more.

Addison’s disease  is a rare and  chronic endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient steroid hormones.The most common symptoms are fatigue, light headedness upon standing, muscle weakness, fever, weight loss etc.as of skin changes, hyper pigmentation is noted in sun-exposed areas, as well as darkening of the palmar creases, sites of friction, recent scars, the vermilion border of the lips, and genital skin.Are you noting any of these?The skin changes you have mentioned , do not point towards the above and i don't think that can be the only basis of the suspicion of addison's disease. However, you have not described the 'odd' rash you are having .But since it is a chronic disorder persisting since 4 years , it is necessary you visit a dermatologist and undergo a biopsy to know the exact nature of the eruptions.

What can I do and should I be really concerned about it?","Doctor":"hi...thanks for your query. First i would like to mention that a wart is a viral infection of skin.it is important to get that removed by a trained doctor by one of the several methods like electrocautery, cryo, lasers etc.Else it persists and gives rise to many more similar growths in the surrounding areas.A duct tape cannot remove it. You have probably developed a contact allergy to the adhesive material in the duct tape.You may apply a mold topical steroid on it once daily for 5-7 days.It should subside .Have an oral anti-allergic to reduce the itching and avoid itching as this might spread the wart in the same area. hope this helps..take care!"},{"Patient":"I went to the drs. on Tuesday and they told me my red rash on my ankle to my calf was from the elastic from my socks.

It doesn t itch and it isn t painful","Doctor":"hi..thanks for your query The rash if is due to the socks you are wearing,should be present on both legs and on all the areas where the socks can come in contact with you skin.If so, then you should do a patch testing to know exactly that are you sensitive to.In future, you can avoid any such ingredient present in anything you wear etc.Also instead, you can wear cotton socks and have them loose and not occlusive at all. If it is simple redness on contact with the socks, it should so away just by avoiding the use again.However certain cases require topical steroids and emollients ( Cetaphil Cream) to reduce the lesions.

Rashes at a particular anatomical site can be due to excessive sweating, some allergy, non-infectious seborrheic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, etc. You should apply 1% hydrocortizone cream for a week or 10 days or 1% clotrimazole cream if you suspect it to be fungal infection, anti-histamines like cetirizine and medicated lotions and moisturisers can be helpful.

This year the same treatment is not at all working on me, instead the rashes are spreading towards my lower legs with severe itching. I want proper advise and treatment for this.","Doctor":"Your symptoms are suggestive of Acute Urticaria. This is usually caused by either intake of a new prescription drug like penicillin or an OTC drug like aspirin, systemic infection (either bacterial or viral), food additives, seafood or intestinal worms. The last is usually only of significance in children. Stress is also a major cause of an outbreak. Now about the drugs you are on - they are unlikely to be the culprit since you have been on them for so long. Many times it is not possible to find out the cause, however since most episodes of acute urticaria are self limited within 4-6 weeks of onset of symptoms, it is not imperative to do so. I would recommend taking Tablet Claritin 10 mg once or twice a day for 2 weeks + calamine lotion over the affected areas whenever symptoms occur and seeing whether they recur on stopping the medicine after 2 weeks. If they do then restart treatment for another four weeks and then stop and see. If they still recur then you will require some blood tests and will need to see a doctor in person. Please note that if you have any lip swelling or difficulty in breathing you should see doctor right away. Hope this information is useful, please feel free to ask if you have any queries.

I started him on it that evening. By Sunday the 3rd of February he started getting little bump rashes breaking out on his side cheek, then it would move to the other side, and would move to his arm , his legs, his stomach , back. The rashes were itchy to him and he also was starting to get mild fever . He complained and still does that his head hurts, and his body basiclly hurts all over. He is very tired, eyes look very tired, his bottom of his feet are itchy at times he says. I stopped giving him the Amoxicillin after that morning dose on the 3rd, and the rashes are much less it seems but still coming on at times. The doctor said he is allergic to the Amoxicillin which I assumed, and has prescribed Omnicef 250 MG 4ML by mouth once a day for 10 days. I have not started him on it yet in fear that it may cause worse conditions for him, that was on February the 6th.

He is not having much of a desire to eat or drink. He still complains he hurts in his head, chest and basiclly all over he says.

Wait around 2 weeks after the embryo transfer and then better to do a blood test for pregnancy. As you are on progesterone, you will not get your periods even if you are not pregnant.

Patients occasionally can experience a burning sensation.A potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of skin scrapings may be diagnostic in tinea corporis. Topical therapy is recommended for a localized infection. topical creams having anti fungal components,eg, ketoconazole/ clotrimazole/ miconazole should be applied to the lesion and at least 2 cm beyond this area once or twice a day for at least 2 weeks.

When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after your injection.

What is most important here is whether or not you have a sexual history my friend. Are you married? And how many sexual partners do you have? The only reason I am asking this is, to ask you to abstain from sexual contact for a while. At least till a doctor can examine you and finalize a diagnosis. The doctor will be requiring information like, when did these rashes first appear, and when was the last time you had sexual contact with a person? Please keep all information ready. In my opinion, it is best to avoid using any substance on these rashes. You could consult an infectious disease specialist or if they are difficult to find you could even consult a Physician who could help you. Yes, as you have been wondering, there is a chance that this is a fungal infection, but it is best we first examine and later test it to come up with a confirmed diagnosis, before treating it.

In most of the cases, urticaria has no underlying cause. However worm infestation, particular food intake, foods with preservative like jams pickle and sauce, medicines, infections can cause urticaria. To treat the same, you might require a course of oral anti allergic like fexofenadine or cetirizine for couple of weeks. You can also apply calamine to soothe rashes. Hope that answers your query.

Your history and clinical picture are suggestive of 'Recurrent Folliculitis ' associated with secondary eczema . 1. Mupirocin ointment twice a day for 5-7 days whenever the bumps come. If there is no improvement within 3 days of this then you will require a addition of steroid cream along with that . 2. Dial Antibacterial liquid soap for bathing. Continue this even when asymptomatic. 3. Mupirocin cream twice a day in the inside skin of the nose for 14 days. This may seem strange since you have no symptoms there but this is the commonest site of carriage of the bacteria that causes this condition (staph). Infection keeps recurring from here through carriage by the fingers to other parts of the body. NOTE: Steroid and mupirocin will require a prescription so I would recommend discussing my recommendations with your GP/family physician. Bacitracin is an OTC alternative to Mupirocin cream.

I have what I believe is Norwegian crusted scabies; and caught this infestation about 5 months ago. At first I developed 2 crusty lesions on my back that itched and burned. Then they began making long \\"scratch-like” burrows (where they lay their eggs) mostly on my back, flanks and stomach. I tried many topical medications: permethrin, Kwell, and a home-made sulfur cream. These helped some, but did not rid me of the pests. I developed burrows in my vagina and noticed eggs and black larvae in my stool.( my fiance has been in the medical profession for over 25 years and has a microscope at home which we used to id the mites). Only when I began taking ivermectin did I start to have real relief; but the amount prescribed isn't enough to completely rid me of this infestation. I believe that the amount needed is more like 0.25 milligrams up to 0.5 milligrams per kg of body weight. With the technology that we have today it is ashamed that a mite is allowed to cause such misery. Comment from: msMED, 25-34 Female (Caregiver) Published: April 03 I am a medical student. Last October, I developed rashes with intense itchiness at night. As I was rotating in an OBGYN department and allergic to surgical gloves, I didn't pay much attention to it. Eventually, it became noticeable, and the itchiness became worse, which affected my studies. I consulted a dermatologist, and she told me that I had scabies and asked if anyone in my family had ever had it. I told her no. She then told me that the hospital where I'm rotating had an outbreak of scabies. She then gave me lotion to apply every two weeks and loratadine for itchiness. Still, it persists. I sought treatment again. This time, she gave me prednisone and betamethasone cream. After a few days, I noticed a great improvement. The pustules are slowly disappearing, and the itchiness at night is gone."},{"Patient":"i am 20years,weigh 84kg and have itches on my body after i have taken my bath.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcare magic forum.

This started out like small but many bites but after a few hours of itching the lumps spread into each other and looked like bubbles with fluid inside that did pop if scratched. After a few hours I noticed a similar group of bites on my elbow upon an area of skin that had healed from a graze approximately 3 months ago. Again, after a scratching the small bumps linked to each other and bubbled. Several hours later I began to find other smaller areas of what first looked like bites, we re very itchy and when scratched, they leaked clear fluid and then bubbled and reddened. I have a third patch on my knee that is a more recent area of scar tissue that was perfectly healed but is affected with the rash. The rash has spread to my hands in small areas and my ankles in larger patches. I have since been reminded that the largest and first patch on my head is in exactly the same pattern as a recent (3 months ago) head injury I sustained when I banged my head and caused some scabbing. I have checked a photo of the original injury to confirm this. It was quite a heavy blow to the head but apart from concussion I sustained no other problems.

This only happens when I eat strawberries, berries, pineapples, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers or any food similar to it. Also when I use any cosmetics were it contains glitter or when I use lipsticks closer to red tones I develop this hive, but when I use eyeliner, face powder containing no glitter, nothing happens. I only develop this hive the day after I eat or use these cosmetics. First symptoms, my face would turn red and it will feel itchy. Then a few hours later, my face will become swollen around the eye area. I used to be able to eat and use this product with no problem, I don t know what trigger my body to develop this allergy to certain products. Any idea what is going on? Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, The symptoms you describe and the relation to foods does seem consistent with urticaria that can be triggered in some people by foods rich in salicylates. Urticaria is a condition when mast cells in the skin release histamine after simple triggers such as scratching (physical), but also to temperature change (such as hot shower or cold-induced urticaria), stress, infections etc. Foods high in salicylates can also trigger and the foods you mention do fall in that category. Long-acting antihistamines such as allegra 180mg once daily for 3 months should be tried to see the effect. Removing foods high in salicylates as a trial for a maximum period of 4 weeks is recommended, but not longer if there has no obvious effect. If there is evidence of tree or grass pollen allergy, then these can act as secondary triggers. You can visit the patient information website allergy.or.uk for more information on salicylates if you wish. Hope that helps.

Locations of lesions, clustering or not. The dermatosis you are having might not even be directly related to your pregnancy. But if they are pregnancy related, then you should allow sometime for hormonal balance to be established in your system and suppress the symptoms by either applying hydrocortisone 0.05% cream on the lesions or taking oral antihistamines. Another possibility is if the above treatment doesn't work, you might be having scabies ( strange right? but it is quite possible given the locations you have mentioned). If that is the case, you'll need to take appropriate treatment with anti-scabies lotions. Your daily skin lotion too, should be re-checked as it might be the cause and by stopping and switching your soap might help your situation. I will suggest you pay a visit to a dermatologist for close examination and proper management if above do not work. Not able to examine the rashes myself makes it difficult to give you exact management.

It isn't possible to diagnose your condition without a thorough evaluation, but the spots on your legs might be a condition called erythema nodosum.

Many of these disorders could account for your other symptoms, too. I suggest you see your primary care physician at your earliest convenience.

We thought it could be impetigo but we treated it with antibiotic cream ourselves and it went. a week or so later, it came back! whenever I get a spot and I squeeze it the itchy scab appears and then spreads to other areas of my face. I wonder if you have any ideas as to what it could be because it has returned again.","Doctor":"Hello. I'm sorry you and your boyfriend are having problems. You're undoubtedly already aware that impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin, most commonly due to Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. Over-the-counter antibiotic creams are often effective, but many of the organisms responsible for impetigo have developed partial or complete resistance to these preparations. Therefore, you might see partial or temporary clearing of your skin after using an antibiotic cream, only to have the infection recur within a few days to weeks when resistant organisms begin multiplying in your skin. I would suggest that either your or your boyfriend (or both) see your physician to confirm that you're really dealing with a bacterial infection and, more importantly, to characterize the organism that's causing this problem. (This can be done with a culture of one of the infected areas on your face.) You'll probably need an oral antibiotic to get this situation under control. Keep in mind that if you've been colonized with methicillin-resistant staph, this problem could recur from time to time in the future; antibiotic treatment will typically quiet MRSA infections down, but it usually isn't possible to completely eradicate these organisms. I hope that helps, and good luck to you!"},{"Patient":"i went to bed after a shower and felt itchy like flea bites or dust mites.....not quite .....woke up the next day and notices lumps like itchy bites on my upper shoulder on my back and the top of my left breast. 2 days later the bite on chest looks like a round rash (raised) and what was itchy on my upper back looks like welt marks.....still itchy but not very.

Your clinical observations are very astute if i may say so & would help any dermatologist pinpoint the diagnosis. I may be wrong as this is only an online portal & for best results, you need to visit your dermatologist on the ground; But, your condition seems to be what we call Acne Rosacea or plain Rosacea. This will need visual confirmation & as such, feel free to upload clear digital photos on this site. Do ensure you use a sunscreen from dawn till dusk, avoid hot & spicy foods eg hot tea etc & UV light in general.

Thank you for the query. Jaundice is not a disease but the symptom. To make it disappear the cause needs to be removed. So it is advisable to have some diagnostics and find the cause of jaundice. Udiliv or any other medicine wont help without knowing what is causing it. Jaundice can be caused by many diseases like bile ducts blockage by stones, liver cirrhosis, liver viral infection, blood disorders with hemolysis, pancreas cancer, liver cancer and many many more. So it is advisable to have abdominal ultrasound, liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP), pancreas enzymes (amylase), HCV and HBV antibodies, urine analysis. Abdominal CT might be necessary if no finding in ultrasound. Hope this will help.

It first started with that I thought was thrush, so I got an over-the counter medicine for that. But I found the creams releaved my itchyness only periodically and stung a little when applied. As this has kept going, I have developed a rash around my pubic mound - looks like a lot of pimples / ingrown hairs which have become more and more itchy as it grows. I also have noticed that the skin becomes flaky and peels off. I have a little more discharge than usual, but havent noticed an abnormal smell.","Doctor":"Hi there, i think things are not very clear and ofcourse its not possble for you to tell each and everything in detail. Now there are two things in mind as i gathered according to your condition, 1:IT could have been a Yeast infection and the cream that you have bought over the counter may contain steroids and after the application there is a steroid induced acne,which you have reffered as \\"lots of pimples\\". so if that is the case then you need to stop the cream. 2:You might have developed a condition called Lichen Simplex Chronicus in which the skin becomes thickend,dry and roughened due to constant rubbing and itching. At this point i think you need to see a doctor so that he can have a good look at the rash and ssoaciated factors and proceed further.

I am allergic to sulfa. History: I am a 56 year old female with type II diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol , & depression for 4 years. Medications: Janumet 50/1000 mg.- one in the morning, one in the evening Glipizide 5 mg.- two in morning, one in the evening Lisinopril 5mg.- one in the morning Simvastatin 40 mg.- one in the evening Cymbalta 60 mg.- one in the morning One year ago- Rash began to develop on trunk, then arms, a few on back, buttock, and legs. Some began resembling a lesion type. Diagnosed by family doctor for scabies and treated repeatedly over a course of 6 weeks with permethrin cream 5% and then once using pills given for it. Skin became red and dry do to repeated treatments for scabies but did not affect rash. Rash continued developing more lesions for another month and then all lesions began to heal up on their own. October 2012- Began an aggressive more severe looking outbreak of lesions starting on my arms, then spread to my stomach, back, buttock, hands & legs, back of neck, chest, palms of hands, & soles of my feet. Most affected areas are on the arms and the soles of the feet which are completely covered with the lesions that hurt and are extremely itchy. Dermatologist diagnosed lichen planus & also oral lichen planus & saying cause not known & no cure. Prescribed triamcinolone .1% cream. Clobetasol propionate ointment .5% for soles of feet. Tested for hepatitis. Test results- no hepatitis. During all this time I have had an overall slight sick feeling with upset stomach.","Doctor":"Hi,Firstly to confirm the diagnosis of lichen planus or lichenoid drug eruption, one needs to get a skin biopsy done. The test for hepatitis c was done as at times lichen planus is associated with the same. Sometimes drugs meant to treat hypertension and diabetes can lead to drug eruption simulating lichen planus. In your case glipizide(it's a Sulfa drug) or lisinopril could be the offending drug. The best treatment option to treat a lichenoid drug eruption is to change the offending drug. So the best management protocol is to first get a definite diagnosis through skin biopsy and start the treatment accordingly. You should also consult your physician to prescribe you other alternative drugs for blood pressure and diabetes.Take care"},{"Patient":"in last week or so toes 2 and 3 on both feet have suddenly become itchy around the nail bed.

It lasts for about an hour and then completely dissapears leaving no clue of the rash. Please let me know what this is. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello dear, From your description, as the rash appears and disappears, this could be the result of an allergic reaction. In all cases of allergic reactions, we need to find out the allergen (the causative agent). My advice would be to monitor the food you consume, try to think back and remember what you ate or came in contact with on the days you experienced the rash. Allergens range from food products (fish, etc), clothes (cotton, silk, etc), seasonal (more often in autumn and spring), insect bites, accessories (deodorants, perfumes, henna, etc.) , medication, and many more. Think back and see if there were common items you consumed or came in contact with when the rash occurred. Try to change your bed sheets often, and install grills or meshes for your windows. Protective lotions like calamine lotion, could help in providing a barrier between you and the contact allergen (if external). Finding the allergen and avoiding it can help you prevent the rash completely. Also, I would advice you carry an anti-histamine drug that best suits you at all times to avoid a sudden allergy caused by accidental contact with the allergen. Hope this information has helped you. Wishing you the best."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 32 years old, preparing for getting conceive for second baby , also taking treatment for last one year. The abdomen scan report says ever thing is normal.

I would say that Zyrtec is not a cure for scabies,the only recommended medication of choice is 5% Permethrin cream or lotion. Zyrtec is an anti histamine and and can only help in reducing the itch caused by the infestations. If there is no one else affected in the family it doesn't mean that Scabies is ruled out,someone in his school or may be some other kid in your neighbourhood may be affected.

In between you can use Topical steroids and sedating anti histamine like Atarax 25 mg once before going to bed. I am sure these measure will prove helpful but if not then you have to do some blood tests like liver,renal and thyroid function tests along with a full blood count to exclude internal causes of the itch because its not always the local(environmental) causes which result in itch.

When follicles reach a size more than  17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.

However, you have described certain specific areas where patches of dryness are present. There are couple of disorders which cause dryness of skin in patches. The next step is to visit a dermatologist to find out the cause . Mean while, you are take general measures to avoid the dryness and the pruritis (itchiness) associated with it (if any). You should use a mild soap for cleansing and bathing. Do not scrub the skin too much as it causes loss of moisture. Use good quantity of moisture in especially during winters.

The problem i have is, i started to get rash now and than. It comes and goes in 5/10 mins. It is like hives . what could be the orginal cause since i was given allegra 180 and i am having it for past 10 days, but still i see the problem.","Doctor":"Hi, The problem with dermatographism is that most of the times there is no specific cause for it. However at times hot baths, stress, anxiety, exercise and skin friction( rubbing, scratching, minor pressure over skin) can flare it up. The disorder usually goes into remission on its own , may be in few days or  it might take few years to go. So the only thing that can be done is to take antiallergics to relieve the symptoms. As you said with allegra you are not having much of response, in that case you can consult the doctor to add one more group of antihistaminic. You can also apply soothing calamine lotion, it will reduce the itch to some extent. Take care."},{"Patient":"I Have Red Dots That Appear And Disapear Randomly, They Seem To Be Connected With Changes In Heat And Cold .

You have to do some labs aswel like a FBC,LFTS and a Urine R/E. But the good news is you can use certain anti histamines in the meanwhile like Tablet Fexofenadine 180mg daily in the day and Tablet Zyrtec 10 mg in the night for atleast 2-4 weeks before you come up with your results.

For irritation/itching, I suggest you to use oral antihistaminics. Candid-B cream does not cause skin cancer, but its long term use can lead to several side effects like skin atrophy, dyspigmnetation, telengiectasia, striae, dryness etc. You should stop using candid-B cream. Approach a dermatologist and initiate proper treatment. Regards, Dr. Ajit Singh Kulhari MD - Skin & VD"},{"Patient":"I have had a red, flat itchy rash on my neck for 3 days. I have not changed any part of my routine. The rash seems mildly hot to the touch and becomes very hot feeling in the shower.

I am a type 1 diabetic and am looking into any over the counter relief. Please advise. It seems to be almost blotchy looking","Doctor":"Hi, As you said that you are suffering from type 1 diabetes. Diabetics are more prone to fungal and bacterial infections. You may have developed dermatophytosis. Usually the infections grow when your blood sugar is not under control. Keep track of that. You can start plain antifungal cream (without steroid) and oral antihistaminics. If improvement is not seen or if it aggravates then consult a dermatologist, because secondary bacterial infection may also take place with due course of time.

I just want to know I could be preggers or just stress?","Doctor":"Hi, I think you should do a urine pregnancy test at home.  Sometimes failure of ligation occurs, but it is rare. So, just clear your doubt by a pregnancy test.  If negative, it can happen due to some stress factor.  So, wait for your periods. If you don't get your periods within 2 weeks of your expected date, and test is negative, you can take some medicines for inducing periods.  Frequent urination can be due to urine infection. Get a urine routine and microscopy and a culture done. Drink lot of water. Hope I have  answered your question.

Take tab ivermectin 12 mg stat and apply 5% permethrin all over the body below neck overnight. Take bath next day and get your used clothes washed properly. Both the medicines have to be taken just once. From next day onwards start applying a mild steroid cream over scrotal area twice in a day atleast for 5 to 7 days. Stop applying itchguard or betnovate cream. Scabies can involve scrotum and other body areas too and it can occur even if no one in your family is having it.

Please suggest how to make sure that rashes go away soon. Also suggest if I need to do something for more for her loose motion. Thanks, Harveen.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome! I would be pleased to answer your question . From the description of the lesions they seem to be either a eczema or  irritant contact dermatitis. The Allergy can be due to external or internal allergic agent. Here is what will help: 1. Clobetasol propionate cream + Mupirocin cream: Mix and apply over the affected area on the right shoulder twice a day for 5days then switch to Fluticasone propionate cream once at night for 2-4 weeks. In the groin/upper inner thigh use Fluticasone in place of Clobetasol from the beginning. The specialist to see will be a dermatologist and he or she can prescribe these for you. Nothing over the counter will help much, the only product with some benefit is 1% Cortizone cream. 2. Syrup Claritin  twice a day for 5 days to get relief in itching. 3. Sarna sensitive lotion can be used 2-3 times a day to give further relief from itching. This can be continued even when the above creams have been stopped. 4. Avoid scratching the affected areas as much as possible. This is most important. Whenever it is not bearable soak a towel in ice cold water and keep it on the affected areas or apply the Sarna sensitive lotion. Lastly keep the affected areas as well moisturized as possible with a moisturizer of your choice. NOTE: 1% Cortizone cream, Claritin and Sarna lotion can be bought without a prescription.

I have tried creams to try to deal with the complaint including Lamisil, Mycil Cream, Corstisone cream and finally an iodine spray, but nothing seems to work. I have had angioplasts inserted through the groin about six weeks ago and I was concerned that this may be related to the situation. Is this something or nothing to be concerned about please?","Doctor":"Hello ic.brooks, Thanks for posting your query. I think your problem is not the infection but the intertrigo, it is a condition of moist raw itchy skin which becomes reddish and develops in areas that are in contact all the time, like in the armpits, the outer side of labia/scrotum and inner side of the thighs. Wearing synthetic under garments hampers the circulation of air and retains moist making the problem worse. You should avoid tight pants and synthetic under garments and keep the region dry most of the times. Immediately wipe and dry yourself with thick cotton towels after you take bath. You should use a medicated dusting powder containing Clotrimazole/miconazole/salicylic acid, thrice a day. The cannulation for angioplasty through local skin does not seem a probable cause.

One of the possible cause might be bite by parasitic insect Cimex lectularius commonly known as bed bug.When bed bugs bite, they inject an anesthetic and an anticoagulant that prevents a person from realizing they are being bitten. Most people do not realize they have been bitten until bite marks appear anywhere from one to several days and sometimes even upto 14 days after the initial bite.

As your Dermatologist told this does not seem to be herpes or genital warts and as your tests for Syphilis and HIV were negative you just forget about these diseases. It could most probably due to yeast infection or may be due to some irritants like condoms ( latex or due to lubricants), soaps or other topical applications. If it is not adequately treated an yeast infection, it may recur. Then your sexual partner's are not treated for the same then also you may likely to have the recurrences. So take your sex partner also to your physician and treat her, then you will be alright totally. Get well soon.

When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles. Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days.  take progesterone for next 2 weeks.

So it would be great if you could upload some good clear photographs of the rash onto this site using the 'upload data' icon on the right side of your screen. In the interim, your guess of an insect bite reaction seems fairly accurate & intelligible. The reason it does occur indoors is probably due to the presence or infestation of dust mites/fleas etc in our indoor surroundings including carpets/rugs/ blankets etc! There are two approaches you could take. First, visit a skin specialist (dermatologist) nearest you & get an opinion/skin biopsy & then move onto the treatment or simply apply a potent corticosteroid cream that you may get over the counter if you have a friendly neighbourhood pharmacist on hand & do remember to treat the fomites & spray the surroundings etc! But, do remember if you go with the cream, then no biopsy can be done for at least two weeks after stopping said cream. In any case if the cream & and a non sedative antihistamine (fexofenadine 180) does not work, then best visit the dermatologist. Cheers & Good LUck!

I read your question with interest. To be very specific, you need to visit a dermatologist. However seeing as you are disgruntled with your 2 prior experiences, make sure you review with the previous biopsy report. If as you say you have psoriasis, it may be part of the same feature as in 'flexural psoriasis'. This is termed 'intertrigo' in your case & it is very possible there is some superadded candidal infection given your age. Hence perhaps 2 tablets of fluconazole 200mg taken at a one week interval (total 2) may do you a world of good.

But 1 week back it became worse and everyday it is getting worse. I normally use johnson and johnson baby oil after shower and cocoa butter lotion , Ucerin lotion whenever i feel my skin to be very dry. 2 days back I called my OB for the suggestion as Itchy skin is getting worse and having rashes on my stretch marks on my abdomen . As her suggestion I have applied Cortaid cream but it is not helping me. I am not able to sleep on my bed as the skin touches on the bed or with the contact of my clothes,it starts itching tremendously. Please help ..... sruti","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your query. It's not uncommon to feel itchy, particularly around your growing belly and breasts as your skin stretches to accommodate them. Hormonal changes may also be partly to blame. It usually disappears right after delivery. But you should remember severe itchiness in the second or, more commonly, the third trimester can be a sign of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). The itchiness can be extremely intense and is typically worse at night. This ICP has very bad effect on fetus. So better to visit your obstetrician first and if he/she suspects, you should do a liver function test with special mention on bile salt and acid and also frequent Ultrasound monitoring of the fetus to see his well being. Best wishes"},{"Patient":"Hello dr. I have an underarm rash that is read, a little swollen & very dry. I haven t put anything on it.

I try keeping it dry and I wear loose fitting shirts so I don t irritate it. Is there anything that I can put on it?","Doctor":"Thanks for writing in HCM. An underarm swelling  is most likely related to swollen underarm lymph nodes, of which there are numerous causes. Other possiblities include a skin lump that appears under the arm, such as an infected skin follicle in underarm hair. Less likely is a particular local underarm condition. Don't apply any type of deodorants or ointments over it. You should wear cotton clothes. You are keeping the area dry that is very good. You can take antibiotics for 5 days and  anti- inflammatory drugs  for swelling. You can wash the area with antiseptic solution.

Some persons may not have many symptoms at all and it is just found on a random check. To find out if you are diabetic, you should visit your doctor for a check up. Rash between the legs can be due to a fungal infection.Treatment involves keeping the area dry and clean, avoiding clothing that would irritate the area, the use of antifungal powders which can usually be obtained over the counter. Other causes of itching in the groin are : (1) eczema- the skin has a allergic or hyperactive response (2) lice in the pubic area (3) lichen simplex chronicus which is a skin disorder that  leads to longtermed itching and scratching. It can be found in eczema, psoriasis, nervousness. It is a cycle: something scratches or irritates the skin, the person scratches it which causes the skin to thicken. The thick skin itches more which causes more scratching and more thickening and so on. The first part of treatment is to stop the scratching. You may need to visit a dermatologist to get an accurate diagnosis of the rash, he or she will tend initiate appropiate treatment based on the history and examination. I hope this information is helpful to you and I wish you the best."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. I have a dime sized bump filled with a marbling of clear fluid and pus on my inner thigh, just above my knee .

Injection will help in rupturing the follicles and releasing the egg which can fertilise with the sperm. You can have intercourse for next 2 to 3 days after the injection.  Rupture occurs about 34 to 36 hours after the injection.  Egg remains available for fertilisation for 24 hours and sperm can fertilise the egg till 72 hours.  So, 2 to 3 days contact starting on the day of injection will increase the chance of pregnancy.  Hope I have answered your question.

Last night a couple of them began to itch but not all of them. I woke up this morning with more red spots, more that had become larger and swollen as well as more that started to itch.

Other than the white ring around them they look very similar to a mosquito bite just without the annoying itch all day long. Do you have any idea what these may be?? I showed the doctors i work for today and they had no idea.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. Based on the symptoms it appears to be contact dermatitis. Treatment includes washing with lots of water to remove any traces of the irritant that may remain on the skin. You should avoid further exposure to known irritants or allergens. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area. Emollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. They protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. They are a key part of preventing and treating contact dermatitis. Corticosteroid skin creams or ointments may reduce inflammation. Carefully follow the instructions when using these creams. Overuse, even of low-strength over-the-counter products, may cause a skin condition. I advice you to follow the conservative approach as mentioned and if symptom persists i advice you to see dermatologist for exact diagnosis. Hope I have provided the information you needed.

It will go away for a bit but it comes right back in the exact same areas and looks virtually identical as the previous affected areas befor.","Doctor":"hello I would be pleased to answer your question . Seborrheic Dematitis: These grains sound like small crusts and your condition sounds like seborrheic dermatitis. This is a condition where the body loses tolerance for a yeast called Malassezia (which is present normally on all our skins) and starts attacking it leading to symptoms. This condition responds fastest to a steroid and antiyeast lotion applied on the area twice a day. This requires a prescription and your doctor can write one for you. If you cannot see your doctor for any reason then here is what I would recommend trying: Nizoral- cream: to apply alternate day (e.g Mon-Wed-Fri). Use regularly for 4-6 weeks then start decreasing the frequency of application gradually till you reach once a week and maintain. Also use over the counter cortaid cream ( steroid creams) Avoid picking the area . Please feel free to ask if you have any queries.Thanks and Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi I had a tattoo done 5 to 6 weeks ago and it was all ok untill i court it and opened the skin after that it healed ok but has now had little red spots come up like (milk spots that a new born baby would have) if i scratch them it makes it pain full could you hepl me and is it ok to keep the tattoo as i have lots and this is the only one that has done it","Doctor":"Hi.

Track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.

Do not take Benadryl during the day. It would make you extremely sleepy.  You'll be better in 1-2 weeks. If it does not improve, please see a general physician.

The rash has grown in size each day, but not significantly (maybe a 1/2 inch in diameter over the last 3 days). There is also a similar onset of bumps and tingling beginning to form just beneath my armpit. In the past couple of weeks I have done a lot of hiking outdoors and in secluded forest-like areas. I have not changed soaps or anything along those lines recently. After doing some simple research on the internet I m still rather clueless as to what this rash could be.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM. I have gone through your query. Based on the description and sites of lesion, it is highly likely to be a fungal infection Tenia corporis( Ring worm). It is a common fungal infection, usually seen on areas of body where there is moisture like underarms, groin region, finger spaces. But it can present virtually anywhere on the body. As you have been experiencing less itching and more pain it could be due to a wild strain ( as ou have mentioned that you have done hiking and secluded in forest areas). Do not worry. Using topical preparations that contains anti fungal( clotrimazole, micanazole or ketoconazole), a steroid ( betamethasone ot triamcinilone or clobetasone) and an antibiotic ( neomycin or gentamycin) should help you. If you have severe pain using NSAIDS like Aceclofenac or diclofenac along with serratio peptidase will help you. But please see a Dermatologist to rule out other possibilities for the lesions ( as i did not see the lesion i can not be accurate with my diagnosis but probabality of you having ring worm infection is high) and get treated accordingly.

There many bumps on my whole body and it is itchy as well. Can you please help me and recomend me what exactly I should do to cure this ASAP ?","Doctor":"Hi: Thank you for your question. First of all I want to make sure you have scabies.  Sometimes patients get scaird and think they have scabies and it is not.  I am assuming that you know this for sure. The cream has to be applied from head to toe (excluding your scalp and pubic hair, eyes, ears,).  It needs to stay on 8-12 hours so I usually tell patients to do this before bed.  The next morning they need to shower it off.  Wash all bedsheets and clothing in very hot water.  Check other family members for a rash. The itching will go on for a few more days as scabies is actually a 'mite' which is a microscopic organism that burrows in the skin and lays eggs.  You can use Benadryl which is over the counter.  Vistaril requires a prescription.  Some cases require a steroid because the itching goes on for weeks. If in one week, you still have lesions, the cream should be reapplied.

Apply a moisturizer or calamine lotion to the skin while it is damp.[ when you stop betamethasone]. Wear cotton or silk clothing. Avoid wearing wool and acrylic fabrics next to your skin.

Both tend to itch at first, but can also become painful. Yeast and Fungi do happen a lot on children and especially in the buttock region (just like diaper rash). The more concerning bacterial infection (staphylococcus) will usually spread very fast and if the skin breaks down, it will form a \\"honey crusting\\" type of appearance. The swollen ring you described and spreading by small \\"satellite lesions\\" makes me think this is a fungal or yeast infection. You can try ketoconazole cream on the area to see if it controlls it.

Is there any fever / altered behaviour as in irritability etc/ cough/ runny nose ? What is the nature of the rash - papule /pustule/ petechiae(pin point small red dots)/ vesicles ( small blisters). If any of these symptoms are present , it would be better if you take your baby to the paediatrician. If it is just a patchy reddish rash associated with itching it is most likely due to an allergic cause. You could give her anti histamines  ( medication that you normally give her for cold). I cant really comment on the drug or dosage as of now , since I dont know the age/weight of the baby. Apply calamine lotion onto the area of rash. Calamine lotion application will be soothing to the child. Normally this kind of rash should go away in a day . However , if this rash is associated with any fever /excessive crying/ cough/sorethroat/altered behaviour/ if the rash persists for more than a day, please consult with a paediatrician immediately.

Regarding your previous miscarriage, if you took depo while you were pregnant, then it might have caused the abortion, but if you had taken it prior to pregnancy, it can't cause abortion.  So, I think you should go for evaluation first.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  If everything is fine, you can take some medicines for growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after your injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.

Fertile period or ovulation period is 2 weeks prior to the onset of the next period. Regular unprotected intercourse during this period is needed for conception. Rest flat for 30 minutes after the intercourse to help proper ascent of the sperm. Rest on your abdomen if you have a retroverted uterus.Hope I have answered your query.

I have always been in superb health except and on and off depression and anxiety.

Unfortunately, I kept waiting the right man which I didn t meet yet. Now, I am going through a crisis every time I have my cycle I think of how many eggs I am loosing. My cycle is regular but noticed a change, e.g. they are heavy for two days then very light the rest of cycle. Also, I have fibroids that made my cycle heavier but less than four years ago. I am sad that I am not a Mom and start thinking that I may still have a chance.

I m very much depressed.","Doctor":"Hi, How are you doing ?I understand your concern, but by getting into depression, you get a negative wave on you. You should be determined to have tat baby, no matter what comes.I have to agree that TB is a bad disease, it destroys the inner lining of uterus & mostly is the reason for both tubes blockage, which lead to the pregnancy to settle in tube. Luckily TB cannot enter ovary so your eggs are still safe & will be in normal number. These medicines for TB also don't damage the eggs.Completing the AKT-4 is right choice. It will completely remove the TB Bacteria from uterus. As both tube are not functional , IVF is the ideal option. Your only problem is that healthy uterus is unable to get a baby from the tube block. In IVF they bypass the tube & place the baby directly into the uterus. In each IVF they remove more  than 1 egg, usually around 12-15 eggs & you may have 8-10good embryos which can be frozen. They keep max of 2 embryos at a time. Then once you have a baby few year later you can keep more. Age of the embryos will be stuck at 32yrs, even if you reach 40 or 50 etc . So see the positive side , you can have a baby at any age.Don't worry You will do good, pray  well All the best, Hope I could clear queryDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"As per EEG report i suffered from epilepsy on 25th august. my MRI report is normal.

Only if no other alternative safer drug available only if benefit of using is more than risk of stopping , you should use it.Before trying for pregnancy it is better to get it to control level, avoid the predisposing factors like - sleeplessness, too much stress, straining reading on screen for too long etc. Use the safest drug in pregnancy & keep it to lowest dose.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. Please do not worry. As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of cycle. If you happen to have unprotected sex act in the fertile period of cycle, then you stand chance to get pregnant. Secondly, most women get watery , thin discharge  from a day before ovulation that lasts for 48 hours. It is not white but it's colourless discharge.  I will suggest you to get USG done for ovulation study, this will help to know about the exact day of egg formation. You can simply opt for unprotected sex act on and around that time or opt for IUI -  intrauterine insemination. Please start on Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 supplements. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. May God bless you with a bundle of joy. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks. Dr. Purushottam Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"Hi.

On day 25 of the cycle, it will not give reliable result. Since your last menstruation was on 15th of November, you should perform the pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample any day after the 22nd November. This test gives the result instantly. If you want to know the pregnancy status earlier, you can opt for Beta hCG test. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the conception; i.e. 10 days after the unprotected sex. You have not mentioned when did you have your last unprotected sex. You may perform this test 10 days after the last unprotected sex. You can get the results of this test from the laboratory, generally on the next day. Urinary tract infection may change the milliu internii of the semen and may affect the quality of the sperms; hence may cause problem in conception. Please get your husband's urinary infection treated first before attempting for pregnancy.  I hope this helps you to resolve your dilemma.

When woman is aroused sexually, she gets copious vaginal discharge to facilitate easy penile entry. Such increased discharge has made your underwear wet.

My weight is 57 and height is 5.3 and age is 25 . I completed this course 2 days back , i had taken pregnancy test before the course of tablets, i m waiting for mh period, and last night i have unprotected sex, what are the chances of pregnancy due to last night intercourse","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I-pill provides protection against pregnancy effectively when taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sexual intercourse. It does not prevent the pregnancy from any sex after the consumption of the pill. Primolut N does not offer any contraceptive effect when taken only for 5 days for induction of withdrawal bleeding. Pregnancy test before the course of tablets does not provide any relevant information; particularly when performed before missing a period. Since your last unprotected sexual intercourse is not protected by any contraceptive method, you should consider the possibility of pregnancy. If you have missed period, then to find out the pregnancy status:1. Perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample about a week after the missed period; earlier the test may  report false negative results. 2. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after the last unprotected sex. Values more than 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in non pregnant state, the values remain under 5 mIU/ml.I hope this will clarify your doubts.

I am simmi, 26 years old, 153 cms and wt is 65 kgs.3 months b4 I was diagnosed wid multiple cysts in ovaries(mild degree). I was on medication. Recently i get an ultrasound and found no cysts. But now I found my husband spermcount is 25 mn and sperm motality is 15%. can I get pregnant? What is the chance?","Doctor":"Hi, it is possible to get pregnant with sperms count of 25 million and motility 15 %. Your husband can take some antioxidants for 2 to 3 months after consulting a doctor. It helps in improving motility. A motility of 32 % is required to get pregnant naturally. So repeat a semen analysis after 2 months.  If improvement is seen you can try naturally every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. It increases the chance to get pregnant.  If there is no effect, then you can go for IUI. In this semen is processed and count and motility is increased to a great extent.  Then it is instilled into your uterus on day of ovulation. Talk to your doctor regarding this.  Hope I have answered your question. If you have any other query I will be happy to help.Regards Dr khushboo"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, i had my first iui on 27/06/2014 and my doc suggesed susten 200 mg 1-0-1 daily.

In your case your periods may get delayed due to use of susten tablets. You can get your periods in 2 weeks if pregnancy test is negative. Hope I have answered your question.

My husband was out at the ranch this weekend having (I am sure)  quite a few beers.  I am supposed to ovulate in a couple of days.  Will his sperm be toxic?

All these conditions can be treated. For pregnancy, you may need some medicines for growth of your eggs and also some progesterone for supporting pregnancy.

Doctor asked me to come on day 15 for scan and hcg injection. But on day 15 we found that 2 of my follciles had ruptured naturally. There was lots of free fluid so they said it had ruptured recently. They did an IUI within 4 hours of the scan. My husband's sperm count was 41 mil with 15% motility. Was this a well timed IUI? When did ovultaion occur? What are my chances?","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. Please do not panic. You have ovulated within last 6 to 8 hours. And your iui  is was done in the correct time frame. Secondly, as per research chance of  getting pregnant is almost 16% . Which is considered as a very good result. Thirdly,  please get husband's semen analysis done later on with 4 days gap of sexual activity.  His counts are ok but 15 % motility needs attention.

First of all do not worry. Your ability to get pregnant depends upon the ovarian reserve or  capacity to form eggs. You can get  certain blood  tests done to confirm your ovarian capacity.  I will suggest you to get blood levels of FSH, LH, PROLACTIN, AMH  on second day of the cycle. You can get it done 6 months before you plan to get pregnant. Secondly, I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Drink plenty of water in the day. Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products and refined sugars. Use of vitamin B 12 and Folic acid supplements is advisable at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant.

If you have history of  unprotected sex act, if you have history of regular cycles then your dates of sexual activity fall in the fertile period of cycle.

If you happen to cross your dates, then please get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help.

One Dr. prescribed siphene 50 mg. is it good for me?","Doctor":"Dear Smitha, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a condition which is characterised by infertility due to non release of the eggs (anovulation) from ovaries. Along with, there are high levels of Insulin and Androgens. Siphene contains Clomiphene citrate as an active medicine. This medicine helps inducing ovulation. Since the Insulin levels are high, adding Metformin helps success to Clomiphene citrate by reducing Insulin. There is another view that Myo inositol reduces both the Insulin and androgen levels and hence has better success than Metformin. Clomiphene citrate should be tried for not more than 6 cycles. If it fails, then some other medicines like HMG/hCG combination should be tried. You seem to be rather obese. Obesity also is a classic feature of PCOS. Please modify your diet (high protein, low fat and low carbohydrates) and start daily exercises to bring down your BMI between 18 and 23.9. All your other reports are within normal limits. However, please get your husband's semen also tested in a laboratory. I hope this provides you some guidelines based on your brief history.

Repeat the tests and once IgM values are negative, you can plan to get pregnant. I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Drink plenty of water in the day. Avoid deep fried foods,,bakery products and refined sugars.

These pills can prevent the pregnancy if taken regularly throughout the cycle. Some high dosage emergency contraceptive pills may help preventing the pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of the unprotected intercourse. However, these sorts of pills cannot terminate the pregnancy once the conception has occurred. Primolut N is Progestational medicine and will not be useful to avoid pregnancy if conception has already occurred. If you have missed your period, please get pregnancy test done on the overnight morning first urine sample after about a week of the missed period. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test on the blood to detect the pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, some progestational medicine like Promult N or Deveri for 5 days will help you get the withdrawal bleeding. However, if you are pregnant, Medical termination of pregnancy will help you terminate the pregnancy safely and effectively and within legal frame upto 7 weeks of pregnancy (if you are in India). After the results of the pregnancy test(s), please report to your Gynaecologist without wasting time. I hope this helps you.

I have heard of some women taking soy isoflavones vitamins with metformin and it helping them get pregnant. Is this true and is it safe for me to try this? I have been trying to concieve for 5 years now.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, In Polycystic Ovarian syndrome, the main disorders are infertility due to failure to release eggs (ovulation) as a result of dysfunction in reproductory hormones, raised insulin levels and raised androgens. Metformin helps bring down the levels of Insulin. It acts as a good adjuvant to the medicines used for induction of ovulation. The success of only Metformin for the treatment of anovulatory infertility is questionable. According to some scientists, Myo inositol brings down the levels of Insulin as well as androgens and hence is more effective in the treatment of infertility due to PCOS. For induction of ovulation, Clomiphene citrate may be tried for 6 cycles (along with Metformin or Myo inositol). If it fails, HMG/hCG combination may be tried. PCOS is characterised by obesity. Please calculate your BMI. You should maintain your BMI between 18 and 23.9 by reducing weight by apt diet and exercises.

Though you are married for 1 year and 4 months, you are sincerely trying for pregnancy for last 6 months only. If you are above 25 years of age, it is  the time now that you start investigating both of you. You may not carry all the investigations straight a way. Initially try to find evidence of your egg release. Though in the market home kits are available, I would advise you initially to get the evidence by ultrasonography. This will ensure whether you are ovulating or not; and if you are ovulating, it will inform you the day of your ovulation (egg release). Egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 24 hours. Hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is fertile window. Then get husband's semen examination done for the quality and quantity of the sperms. If both these investigation reports are within normal range, try to plan your intercourse at and around the day of ovulation. Lying on your back for about an hour after the intercourse is advisable. After intercourse, some amount of semen does flow out passively, it is hardly 10% to 20% of the total semen; so not an issue. To minimise this flow of semen, the penis should not be withdrawn while it is hard. Let it slip out of vagina passively when it is placid.  If you fail to conceive even after six months fair trial like this, get Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy done to find out the condition and patency of the tubes and uterus. However, if you are above 30 years of your age, get both of you investigated completely without delay. Report then to your Infertility consultant for further advice. You may ask me a Direct question on this forum with all these reports uploaded.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1. As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of cycle. If you happen to have unprotected sex act in the fertile period at least on alternate days, then you stand chance to get pregnant. 2. Even a single sexual activity right on the day of ovulation can cause pregnancy. 3. As precautions to minimise problems during pregnancy, I will suggest you the following for your wife-Please opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen . Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Drink plenty of water in the day. Avoid deep fried foods , bakery products and refined sugars. Use of vitamin B 12, Folic acid and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant.

Can you guide me please... I need Baby... --","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, If you have failed to conceive for 2 years and your age is 29 years, you need to undergo investigations along with clinical examination (both of you). Please assess your egg release (ovulation). Though study of uterine lining (endometrium), hormonal levels and many other tests can provide you this information, ultrasonography is most suitable at this stage. If you find that you are ovulating, please try to plan your sexual activities on and around the day of ovulation. Ultrasonography will provide you information about the anatomical view of the uterus and tubes also. Also look for the anatomical normalcy  and patency of your reproductory organs. Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy will provide you the information. If there is any block, adhesions or any other abnormality, you may requires surgical intervention. Get your husband's semen examined after 4 days of sexual abstinence. Then please report to your infertility consultant. Alternatively, you may upload all your reports and ask me Direct question on this forum for further continued detailed advice. I hope you start acting on these initial guidelines.

It is  a good sign that in spite of tuberculosis she had conceived. This proves that her tubes are patent. It is likely that her uterine lining has been damaged by tuberculosis. She is on an anti-tuberculosis treatment. Macorm Plus contains Rifampicin(600mg) and Isoniazid(300mg). These medicines are  used for treatment of tuberculosis.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1. First of all do not not panic. 2 . Yes, PCOS and endometriosis can create difficulties in getting pregnant. But since your laparoscopy reports are normal, you need not worry about it. 3. Please try to understand that PCOS is a lifestyle disorder. I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Drink plenty of water in the day. Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products and refined sugars. Avoid substance abuse if any. Start on Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements 4. Mild endometriosis usually does not cause much difficulty in getting pregnant. Many a time mild endometriosis can get completely treated by proper treatment with medicines. Please fully trust in your treating doctor. Please follow the treatment protocols as suggested. You can get ovulation study done from day 10 of the cycle,to know the date of egg formation.  You can have natural sex activity or intra uterine insemination in and around the day of ovulation. May God bless you with a bundle of joy. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

I used an ovulation predictor kit from days 12 to 18, and according to it, I wasn´t about to ovulate on those days (the sticks only showed one red line and never the 2 of them). Given that my doctor didn´t do an ultrasound, I took a progesterone test on day 25 of my cycle and the result was 24 ng/ml, which according to the lab´s values meant that I had ovulated in the past days. The next day after taking the test, I noticed a brownish discharge in my underwear which lasted 5 days and then it stopped (I had no need to use a pad). I took a home pregnancy test on day 28 (during the time I experienced the discharge) and it was negative. I´m on day 37 of my cycle and I still haven´t got my period. I´ve also been experiencing mild cramps in the lower part of my abdomen. Is it possible that I ovulated, even if the ovulation kit showed a negative result? If I don´t get my period in the following days should I take a blood test to see If I´m pregnant or is it impossible, considering that both the ovulation kit and the home pregnancy test showed negative results? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. First of all do not panic. As there is confusion over ovulation and there is no definite menstrual bleeding, I will suggest you to get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy, after 5 to 7 days. As doing urine pregnancy test on day 28 can be too early and xanthine be inconclusive. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. If you are pregnant, please start on Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements .If test is negative, then you can simply wait for the onset of periods. If you want, you can induce the periods with progesterone tablets. Your treating doctor can guide you further about it. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

To know about structural normalcy of the uterus and Ovaries. 2.  HSG - hysterosalpingography, within first ten days of the cycle. This will help to know about the patency of the fallopian tubes. 3.Semen analysis of the partner. To know about the quality and quantity of the sperms. With normalcy of these 3  reports, you can simply have Sexual activity at least on alternate days from day 10 to 20 of the cycle.  This is the most fertile period of cycle. Alternatively, you can get ovulation study from day 10 of the cycle. You can have sexual activity or intra uterine insemination on and around the day of ovulation.

Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% of them conceive by the end of second year. As it is almost a year since your marriage, I suggest that you both consult  gynecologist and get hormone tests, Fallopian tube patency test for your wife and semen analysis done for you. Based on these test results further treatment can be planned. To increase the chances of conception, you both should maintain normal BMI, stop smoking (if smoker) and have sex 4-5 times in a week.

I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns today. I have read your notes. Since you have had unprotected sex in the fertile period, there is a possibility of pregnancy.

The earlier it is taken, greater is its efficacy. If you wish you may consider copper IUCD  insertion to prevent the possibility of pregnancy.  It needs to be inserted within 5 days of ovulation date. It can be continued as a contraception.I hope this is helpful. If you have further concerns, do contact me through healthcare magic.

But this medicine is required only when she gets pregnant, I mean when her urine tests positive. The other indication for taking it is if she has DVT ( Deep Venous Thrombosis) or clotting tendency even before pregnancy, but then she will need it for life long , why 3 yrs!!She should have an APLA testing done ( Anti Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome) before next pregnancy.

AWAITING YOUR REPLY REGARDS SP","Doctor":"Hi SP, Let me explain the cycle for you to understand use of the medicine.For a lady with cycle of 28 days, around 6-7 follicles ( eggs within them) are put forward. Out of these only 1 will rupture in normal cycle, multiple if stimulated with hormone injections. Around 13-14th day of periods(around 18-24mm size), the follicle will be right size to rupture & push the egg out, it stays alive for 24 hrs. This is the time you should have intercourse & sperm meets egg. It forms the baby/ embryo.Once follicle ruptures, remains of the follicle will produce progesrone hormone which will act on inner lining of uterus & make it right thickness for baby to sit, further it will maintain the embryo in uterus & prevent early pregnancy bleeding/ abortion. This support is required till 12 weeks of pregnancy ,when the placenta appears. SUSTEN is this hormone progestrone. Especially in PCOD these hormones are not well formed naturally, so supplementation is required.I don't see any use of that follicle of 34 mm. Once more than normal range, they are not healthy.Only when right sperm , meets the right egg , at right time , at right place ,in right hormonal status of body & reaches right thickness of uterine lining will healthy baby occur. Every attempt will not lead to pregnancy. You have to patiently try for the right opportunity. You will surely get it , as luckily you are ovulating in spite of PCO.

I will be answering your concerns.I wish you had given me some more information like your age, BMI, results of previous investigations if done, etc.Dear, among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. You have hardly stayed with your husband. So don't be worried. Make arrangements to stay with your husband continuously for a year. You will conceive.As your doctors say that you are okay, there is no specific advise that I need to give you. Get your husbands semen analysis done.It is extremely important that you maintain normal BMI. Otherwise it can interfere with ovulation. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. There is no need to calculate the fertility period. It unnecessarily causes stress. having sex 3-4 times in a week automatically takes care of the fertility period.If you do not conceive in six months time, I suggest you consult doctor and do your baseline hormone tests and HSG for tubal patency and semen analysis for your husband. Based on the results of these tests further treatment can be planned.Do continue to take tab folic acid daily.I hope this is helpful.If you have any further concerns do contact me through Healthcare Magic.Best wishesDr Rama"},{"Patient":"I have been on the depo shot for about two years now and mostly never have problems.

When you get pregnant, your BP falls as a compensatory mechanism to improve blood supply to baby. You will feel giddy if BP falls.

So all these rights have to occur. These are under control of all mighty . If you two don't have any obvious problems , just pray well  & try, you will get the jackpot.Even after trying for continuous 1yr , if you don't succeed  , then go for investigations.If you start on investigations very early, it will only create anxiety & spoil your health.Ofcourse if you two have any problem, which you have not mentioned , go ahead with investigations.There is no easy pregnancy.I can give you the timing for high pregnancy chances. Once bleeding of periods stops, start having sex, daily or alternate days or as per your wish, till day 10 of periods ( First day of bleeding is day 1 of periods). This time is to throw out the old sperms.Then have no sex for 3 days, so now fresh , young sperms accumulate.Start having sex daily at least once from Day 13-16 of periods. This is time of ovulation.

You have periods for 4-7 days, during which time the eggs which are to come out of ovaries are getting ready. As they get ready , the inner lining of uterus keeps increasing ,so that it's thick enough for the baby to fix or implant on time.In a 28 days cycle, the eggs ,(inside the follicle) is growing in size & around day 12 of periods follicle ruptures letting out the egg. Egg moves into the Fallopian tube, a bridge between the uterus & ovaries, where it waits for the sperm for 24 hrs( that's the lifetime of egg - 24 hrs!), if you have sex around that time or just before that, Sperm will be waiting in the tube ( lifetime of sperm is 3 days/ 72 hrs !)If they meet they form baby, which swims into uterus to get fixed there.Doctor gave those pills to increase the health of eggs  & also to increase the number of eggs recruited.You can have sex whenever you want, any number of times , no problem.Best timings are- Daily or alternate days once bleeding of periods stops, so that old/ elderly sperms are thrown out, till day 10 of periods .

Like Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile, APLA syndrome screening & ultrasound scan to rule out any problems in uterus & ovaries.

Second concern is the FSH level- Values above 7miu/ml means there are no sufficient eggs in ovaries. But your history doesn't correlate with that value. To confirm have a Serum AMH level in first week of periods . It will give a more specific value. Serum Progesterone is done to know if she is ovulating, but that is done on Day21 of periods not 12 , so meaningless. As your semen report is ok, kindly also have a tube patency test done ( Tube is the bridge between uterus & Ovaries , where egg & sperm meet to form baby. it's size of a hair follicle, can't be seen on scan.You will never know if it is blocked).

I have noticed my breasts have increased in size and are very tender but i am still having a withdrawl bleed, does this mean i am not pregnant?Thanks Sally","Doctor":"Hi.Conception is not possible whilst having a withdrawal bleed, so I don't think pregnancy will be possible whilst on levlen, and not only that levlen is used to prevent pregnancy, so getting pregnant is not possible whilst on it.As for the breast enlargement and tenderness, they are both side effects of the pill.

A regular or close to regular menstrual cycle is a strong indicator of a normal or close to normal hormonal function, which equals fertility and an environment good enough to support pregnancy as well.Only after your menstrual cycle is regular, we can introduce fertility drugs (e.g. clomiphene, hCG injections, etc.) which will help you conceive in no time.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hi there I was taking norethisterone to skip a period on holiday yet I started my period half way though just before I started I had intercourse I have nt had another period since done a test and theres a positive result yet 2 more test are negative would u say I am pregnant my daughter I never showed up on pregnany test had to go to hospital every week for test and internal scan even on week 6 the test came back negative yet when they scanned me they found her heart beat and her","Doctor":"Hi.So you had unprotected sexual intercourse and then had your period?

I am getting treated with a Fertiliy clinic. I have gone through 2 IUI failed cycles. I am on third one now. Also my follicles grow erratically. With these do you think what are my conception chances?Regards,Devi","Doctor":"Hi Devi, I find your result erratic. FSH once raised ( More than 7 mIu/ml, bad if > 12miu/ml) cannot just come down like that, you have been mislead.FSH is a hormone produced by a gland, Pituitary , in brain. FSH ( Follicle Stimulating Hormone) stimulates ovaries to produce eggs(which lies within follicles) . If eggs come in first say , FSH will not raise further, but if number of eggs in ovaries is reduced or not responding, especially around menopausal age, FSH will try to stimulate again , I mean higher dose of FSH come. It keeps increasing till eggs are released. So lesser the eggs , more the FSH will be. It will stay so. If your periods are regular with good flow forget about FSH or LHFSH is always to be checked on DAY 3or 4 of periods. Even further confirmatory is Serum AMH in first half of the periods. For IUI to be successful you will need good hormone stimulation from 2nd or 3rd day of cycle, till the day 10-13 of periods when follicles are right size to rupture. As you have not given any other details like your age,other hormone levels, scan findings, husband factors etc.Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is doneHusband- Semen analysis at least 2-  done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center ( examination done by andrologist), Blood sugarsWife - Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile Ultrasound scans to evaluate Uterus , Ovaries & adnexa          Confirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.

Your other risk factor is age of 38 yrs.Tubal pregnancy is due to some sort of damage to inside of tube, may be infection or surgery etc. Usually if one tube is damaged by infection , other one also s at risk of damage , you never get cold in one nostril !!So no matter what you do, IUI or injections Sperm & egg may not be meeting at all . Keeping history of failed treatments , History of tubal damage & most important age of 38 yrs, I would advise you to try IVF.

I am looking for a baby.. Pls suggest me..","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Unfortunately, if your follicle study show that there was an egg present on the 11th day and then on the 16th the follicle was gone, that means you already ovulated for that cycle.The timing of ovulation when trying to get pregnant is critical even within a few days. So, missing an appointment can sometimes unfortunately miss the window of opportunity if you were planning insemination or some other procedure at your ovulation time as there is only a 72 hour window between when the egg ovulates and when you can conceive.The good news is, the fact that your follicle disappeared shows that you actually do ovulate – sometime between your 11th and 16th day.  So unless you've already failed trying to get pregnant through timed intercourse, making sure that you have sex between the 11th and 16th day of your cycle may be able to increase your chance of pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes in getting pregnant,Dr. Brown"}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],O={key:0},N={key:1};function Y(a,e,h,u,n,r){const y=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[f,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(o(!0),i(w,null,b(r.filteredPoems,(s,m)=>(o(),v(y,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[n.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,C)):k("",!0)])}const j=c(q,[["render",Y],["__scopeId","data-v-d6939c55"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/34.md","filePath":"guide/34.md"}'),z={name:"guide/34.md"},W=Object.assign(z,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(o(),i("div",null,[I(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,W as default};
