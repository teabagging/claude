My teeth were hurting me after (same bottom left side) the filling was uneven. I went for filling adjustment. It still continued to hurt when I chew or was biting on that side. I went for another filling (second filling, same teeth, bottom left) and it was still hurting. It hurt me when I floss. All my teeth r fine except these two bottom left when I floss it hurts. So the dentist saw inflammation in that spot so he gave me antibiotic liquid to rinse for 2 weeks. It still hurts. Then he said to rinse with salt water so I did it for a while. It still hurts. It hurts when I floss. The minute the floss touches teeth surface I feel pain and when i put it deeper to the gum it doesn t hurt, so I assume the gums r not the problem. They wanted me to see periodontist. I don t see the need for that. They did x-ray of these bottom teeth and it didn t show anything. So what can I do. They ll do anything not to take the responsibility for their actions. Please help.","Doctor":"hello and welcome to hcm forum, i would like to inform you that as they x-ray of both the teeth were fine, therefore the problem lies within the interdental space(space between those two restored teeth), what i can recommend is keep your teeth free from food debris because ,moment food lodgement occurs ,their would be inflammation in the gums and  pain. i would suggest, continue doing antibacterial rinses(betadine), avoid flossing that area too much, rinse your mouth with plain water after every meal, also, use topical gel(metrohex) ,apply with finger, leave it for half an hour(3-4 times/day), do not worry inflammation will resolve soon, i wish you good health, take care"},{"Patient":"I went to my dentist Tuesday who said I have an infection and need a root canal on tooth number 19.

I am worried that this is mouth cancer. Thanks Lauren","Doctor":"Hi Lauren, More than mouth cancer, I would attribute it to the minor esophageal variceal tear that could have possibly occurred. To stop the bleeding, we need to find the cause of it. If it is due to esophageal tear, then the bleeding veins are to be ligated surgically. If it is a primary bleed from the mouth, it may be due to aphthous ulcer in view of his general condition. In that case, multivitamin supplements will help him. Pressure compresses can be used locally to arrest the fresh bleeding. If it is due to mouth cancer, then again, management will be surgical. These are only my broad views. A physical examination would be ideal to know the cause. Hope this helps. Regards,"},{"Patient":"Hi! During my last dental check up I was told I would need a nightguard.

In older children, the reason could be food-related  or even from non-food items. Eating or sucking on colored non-food items such as crayons might also turn stools different colors. Most children show signs of physical readiness to begin using the toilet as toddlers, usually between 18 months and 3 years of age, not all children have the intellectual and/or psychological readiness to be potty trained at this age. The common causes of stool soiling include: * Need for more toilet training * Toilet \\"phobia\\" (scared of using the bathroom) * Irritable bowel syndrome In very few children stool soiling is caused by disease or birth defects. Constipation may cause painful or incomplete bowel movements. If bowel movements are painful, a child may try to \\"hold\\" his or her stools, making constipation worse. In children who have constipation, formed, soft or liquid stools can leak from the anus (the opening to the rectum) around a mass of stool stuck in the lower bowel and cause soiling. This happens because the amount of stool can become so large that it leaks out of the anus causing soiling. Often, these stools have a very bad smell. Constipation may occur if your child is not eating enough high-fiber foods, drinking enough fluids or getting enough exercise. In many children, a cause for constipation cannot be found. Painful bowel movements may cause a child to begin resisting the urge to have a bowel movement. Not having a bowel movement when the urge occurs can lead to constipation. Your child could be scared of being alone in the bathroom or scared of the toilet."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Chakraborty How are you? On Monday, my gums on the upper left side started to feel sore.

However, for the last week or so every time i bend down or tilt my head back i get tons of pressure in that tooth. It will even ache on it s own and not because i m using the tooth to eat. Does it sound like he drilled into my sinus cavity and will it heal on it s own? Should i be antibiotics to speed up the process or prevent further injury?","Doctor":"root canal done tooth can never give and sensation to cold or hot. moreover the pain and pressure felt on tilting the head clearly indicates that the pain is due to irreversible pulpitis and a root canal treated tooth does not have pulp in it. so my friend the pain you are feeling is due to the tooth adjacent to the one which already s been root treated. tell your dentist to take a fresh x ray of that area including adjacent teeth. there is a possibility that you will need another RCT in different tooth this time. take care."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I have a small red spot on my gumline, right below my bottom lateral incisor.

He states the pain is relieved when he sits up, but at it worst when he lays supine. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello, the pain may be due to injury to the gum or bone during deep cleaning.

For the 2nd procedure the endodontist said I did not need to take antibiotics again.

I am supposed to go for a final crown today but am worried.","Doctor":"its normal to have some discomfort after rct completion for 1 to 2 weeks. the root cannal filling makes the tooth tender. the reason for your pain can also be food impaction around the cut tooth which is the space created to fit the crown. if your dentist has done the RCT procedure well then your pain will go in another week or so. meanwhile you should avoid chewing food from the affected side. take some anti inflammatory drug like paracetamol 500 twice for 3 days. and most importantly while getting the crown placed be sure that all the teeth are in contact.  sometimes the new crown is high relative to adjacent teeth and this can aggravate the pain. take care"},{"Patient":"Hi Can you help?

My mother passed away at the time I had the filling so one dentist said it was stress .","Doctor":"Hi, if the filling was done without a proper cavity preparation, which could be by two ways- one, if the carious structure was not cleaned up properly, it leads to caries spreading underneath. Secondly if there is pulp exposure while deep cavity preparation, it leads to persistent pain after the filling. Please take an ray and go for a root canal treatment to get rid of the pain.  you may need a crown also if there is discoloration.

One morning last week after brushing it the night before, I woke up with a sore tongue at the front and at the back, I brushed it again and when I spit into the sink there was streaks of bloods. Ever since then I have been spitting out blood in the morning and have recently gotten a sore throat and swollen glands. I looked at my tongue in the mirror and noticed that my circumvallate papalae are slightly enlarged and believe that the source of blood is coming from that region. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow but I am extremely worried that this may be something serious like oral cancer or another serious desease. I am wondering what your thoughts may be on this issue and if I should concerned as I am.","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to healthcare magic ! i understand your concern. from your post it appears that you have been very harsh on our tongue applying a lot of pressure and the whitening toothpaste. The whitening toothpastes mostly contain hydrogen peroxide which may damage the oral mucosa if used concentrated. The same reason could be for your sore throat. Another reason for all these symptoms could be a bacterial or viral infection since you have swollen glands also. Please apply Mocopain and Hexigel ointments alternatively on the tongue. Use Betadine gargles twice or thrice a day for sore throat and you can also take antibiotics in case there is some throat infection.  please go for a complete oral examination. Please do not panic about cancer. The doctors will advise the course of treatment and rule out cancer if they feel the need.

I am happy to address your questions, the dark brown/black stains you see are extrinsic (meaning on the outside) stains. They're caused most commonly by tobacco products and tea and with some antibiotics. These stains adhere readily to tartar left behind. You probably see it behind your front bottom teeth because that's where we humans get the most tartar build-up (due to salivary glands down there depositing minerals). So, since they're on the outside, and nice little scraping and polishing at your next appointment from your dentist will clean them right off. To prevent them, limit the tobacco/dark drinks and instead of brushing your lower front teeth with the brush horizontal, turn it vertical and brush the backs of teeth straight up and down.

If bleeding from gums occurs unprovoked or without any injury or if there is unexplained bruising or prolonged bleeding from any cut site then you need to look into it and get a routine hemogram along with BT and CT done.

I ve been in for a few different check ups on it, the area has been re-cleaned a few times, scanned for a cyst , been to my dentist and a peridontist (sp?). My dentist mentioned she has another patient with the same problem but no clues how to resolve it. I assume the initial irritation was done by the cleaning (more aggressive on the top two front teeth then usual) but it won t calm down. Wonder if it is caught in a cycle - irritation leads to swelling leads to irritation etc. Darrell","Doctor":"Hi Darrell, since the time period written in your is long i.e 6 months. if it is because of irritation, then it would have gone after deep cleaning. swelling usually subside in 3-4 days maximum after removal of irritants. if you still feel stucking sensation in your upper inter dental papilla you need to go for gingival re contouring or you can say gingivectomy procedure. In this procedure they will reshape your gum line and remove the thick pad of gingiva in between the tooth area. as you had already seen a periodontist, consult him again and go for re shaping of gums.

The filling was replaced but it fell out again and the dentist decided to readjust/enlarge the cavity so a new filling would stay. This procedure was done under local anaesthetic. Once the effect of the anaesthetic wore off, my tooth was very sensitive. I suffered very unpleasant sharp pain especially when drinking and eating either hot or cold. Back to the dentist to readjust the tooth (with carbon). But this didn t help. I gave it 10 days or so to see if time would heal and went back to the dentist. By that time I was using only my right side to chew . The dentist suspected that the filling was putting pressure on the tooth. They took the material away, investigated inside to check the root canal was alright and replaced the filing using less pressure (I think they also changed the type of material) and in two parts so it would impart less pressure. It did relieve the pain I was having to some extent but I was still experiencing pain regularly. Still chewing using the right side only, I began to develop pain in my jaw and cheek bones and basically, for a while, across all my teeth and my whole mouth. This lasted a week or more. I was taking pain killers (although with no efect) and had to blend my dinner as I couldn t chew properly because of the pain. Back to the dentist. I described all the symptoms mentioned above. The treated tooth was the source of the most pain: it was like biting a very small stone giving a sharp pain. Also I mentioned that food was concentrating between the tooth and its neighbouring second bicuspid and the resulting pressure was also giving sharp pain. (The filling was on the side of the first bicuspid). They investigated again, used carbon again to readjust a little more, a fracture/crack on the tooth was also investigated and the idea eliminated, took new X-rays (can be provided), and the conclusion was: We don t know why you are still in pain . Since then (a week ago) I have been suffering very acute sharp pain when I eat and drink, hot and/or cold from the treated first bicuspid to the Second molar (sometimes to the third molar inside my gum!). The pain is much the same each time and varies from tooth to tooth (all top left), but I am also having similar pain periodically now on my cupid to my second molar on bottom left. Pain, pain, pain, each time a different tooth. I am helping myself with massaging the teeth and gum. I am also taking pain killers but they have been of no help. Really don t know what to do next or who to ask for help. (fem-46yrs)","Doctor":"Hello there. Im sorry to hear you are experiencing such problems. I will try to help. First and foremost i cannot make any definitive decisions or a definitive diagnosis without considering your full history and undertaking a full examination, but i will use to above information to try and advice you accordingly. Pain around a tooth can either originate from the tooth itself or from the tissues surrounding the tooth. 1 - If the pain originates from the tooth itself it is usually either due to decay which is encroaching onto the pulp (the nerve chamber) or the filling is so deep that it is close to the nerve and some of the constituents of the filling material are stimulating pain as they find their way through the dentinal tubules into the nerve chamber. Another possibility is that a composite resin material was used (white filling) and as it contracts when cured (hardened) it pulls against the walls of the cavity which causes pain. One final posibility is that you may have a fracture through the tooth. I know you say this was ruled out, but in fact it is very difficult to rule out fractres in teeth. They certainly dont show up very well on radiographs (xrays) and they are hard to identificy clinically (in the mouth) unless they are extensive. I would like to see the radiographs if possible. Solutions to the above problems involve removing the existing filling, check the base of the cavity, placing a sedative dressing in the cavity for a week to see how things resolved. This sedative dressing is made of Zinc Oxide Eugenol. If this temporary dressing works, then we can confirm that the pain is tooth-borne and a result of the size of the filling and its proximity to pulp (nerve chamber). If the temporary dressing does not relieve the pain then it is likely that the pain is either due to a fracture or no longer tooth-borne and the pain involves problems with the periodontal ligament (the tissue surround the tooth). 2- If the pain originates from the surrounding tissues it means that your nerve is damaged beyond repair and their is resulting inflammation in the tissue at the end of the root. Typical symptoms of this include, continuous pain, throbbing pain, pain when pushing the tooth down into the socket, mobility of the tooth, swelling in the gum, etc. To treat this, one would have to undergo root canal therapy to remove the nerve tissue in the camber and canals and replace it with a resin material. This will then resolve the inflammation around the root of the tooth. An alternative and more definitive and more successful treatment option is to extract the tooth. For this we would have to be confident that the tooth was indeed non-vital (dead) due to irreparable damage to the nerve. I would like to know the following: 1-What the xray looks like? 2- Does that pain wake you up at night? 3- What sort of pain - stabbing, shooting, dull ache, throb? 4- Is the pain continuous? 5- Does anything make it better? 6- Is it worse at any particular time during the day? Lets hope we can come closer to finding an answer for you. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Not sure where to ask this but I had MMA (double jaw ) surgery two years ago and have had consistent pain in the lower left jaw from ear to chin .

Also try to keep your mouth clean with warm saline gargles.Use toothbrush with soft bristles to avoid further trauma to the gum line.It generally takes a week to recover from problems like you are suffering from."},{"Patient":"Hi, I recently probed behind my left last molar with my tongue and discovered it was an unusual feeling but I disregarded it as bits of food. This was until I brushed my teeth and it was not coming out so I attempted to pinch it out with ny hands which caused bleeding but then I eventually got out a part of it but there is still a bit left between the molar and the gum nd it keeps bleeding now. If this isn t a bit of food what could it be?","Doctor":"hello, first of all its very difficult to assess from ur description as ur last molar can be second molar or third/wisdom too.. and the bleeding from gums is due to food lodgement and subsequent infection of region.. it is a typical pericoronitis case if ur third molar is in eruption stage.. ur age is b/w18-25.. then food lodgement is commonest in region.. use a good interdental aid to clean the area along with frequent gargle with mouthwashes and gum massage.. get radiograph done of the region to assess bone pattern in the region or any erupting tooth..if all is fine in radiograph , get professional cleaning and try to maintain proper oral hygiene with regular follow up visits.."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor My 4 year old son has sore gums which bleed when brushed, and a white coating on his tongue . His lower lip is slightly swollen with a few blisters on the inside. His mouth is so sore that he has eaten or drunk very little today. He had a fever from Saturday night until yesterday, but his temperature is now back to normal and his energy was better today. He mentioned a few times that his head and stomach had been sore, but not today.

If it persists later then that investigations are performed..  our body defense mechanism is sufficient to cope up with disease if we are in healthy stage..

Ok and bye."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m really hoping u can put my mind at rest cos I am driving myself mad. I found a lump right up high on my gum above a front tooth which is a crown. I did go to the dentist a couple if days before finding it because the area felt strange when I applied pressure to it, like the crown was going to fall out. The dentist examined the area and said it was fine, it was 2 days later I felt the lump. When you look at the area u can t see anything, the gum looks totally normal and it doesn t cause me any pain at all but I can sometimes feel it when I smile and my lips put pressure on it. It is a hard lump, like bone and I ve no idea how long it s been there.","Doctor":"The data you have given is not sufficient to reach a definitive diagnosis. Was the tooth infected and/or operated for a root canal treatment before the crown placement? How long has it been since the RCT/crown placement done? For now, with the data given, i would guess it might be due to a periodontal abscess in the region. And if there had been an infection and RCT was done, chances are infection may not have resolved completely before the obturation which may have caused a periapical cyst or an abscess. A radiograph of the tooth is needed to confirm/rule out the diagnosis. If present, it may require an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment and if that doesn't work you may need to get your RCT redone. Either case you will need to visit your dentist to get a clear picture."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 27 year old female.

Could the becosules have caused the tongue ulcer and gum sores, as I very rarely get them otherwise? Thank you for the help.","Doctor":"Hi,Neerajaji, Welcome to HCM, It seems that you might have apthous ulcer. Only smile gel is not enough.

As u had taken aleve ur inflammation is reduced.. as per ur description i think its disease of tmj related muscles and is called MPDS.. your clinical and radiographic investigations can properly diagnose the condition. pain in tmj region is commonest by MPDS .. causes include excessive occlusal load on tmj.. Removal of excessive load on tmj, Soft diet, Muscle relaxation by muscle relaxants, NSAIDs gel/ tablet, warm fomentation  will resolve the tenderness and swelling in region..Carotid artery is rarely involved in TMJ diseases.. so dont worry.."},{"Patient":"I have had a filling come out and while it was exposed the same tooth chipped a little more off, i was diagnosed with periodontis and have been keeping the area clean of food and debris I put a temporary filling in and now my gums are swollen and sore to the touch.. Is this infected from too much digging and scraping or a worse problem?","Doctor":"hello, No this is not infected from too much digging and scraping.. the problem u had discussed  arised basically due to food lodgement in between the teeth.. because of that cavity/caries (proximal) occured in tooth... for which filling for first time in tooth was done few year back.. if i m not wrong your problem of food lodgement in region was temporarily solved..And you missed your regular check up appointments.. Now when your old filling/restoration got dislodged.. the chipping of tooth indicates.. that u had secondary caries( caries in tooth around the restored area).. to treat the secondary caries the further digging/ removal of all carious part of tooth was done which was necessity.. it might be possible that caries has infected ur pulp/nerves of tooth.. so u r still having pain in the region after temporary filling. This pain can go only by endodontic therapy or RCT of involved tooth.. Ur gums need to be scaled/ clean properly now and if required periodontal surgery(minor) should be done to prevent food lodgement in region again.. and proper oral hygiene including brushing, flossing, interdental aids, mouthwashes should be followed..with proper follow up in future appointments."},{"Patient":"I have a cold now but have had dry mouth in the winter months. a few times per week I may see streaks of blood in my spit, it goes away after a hour or so","Doctor":"hello. welcome to HCM. Spitting thin streaks of blood during or immediately after recovery from sore throat infection is a common finding and is due to increased blood flow in the pharynx during inflammation. So, it is not something to be worried about.  You can have soothing effect or relief by having sips of warm water instead of normal temperature water whenever you are thirsty. Coughing out or spitting blood in your case may be a cause of worry if you also have otherwise cough with sputum  production, or have other symptoms (loss of weight or loss of appetite)suggestive of tuberculosis. In any case if this finding of cough with blood streaking persists beyond sore throat, you must have X ray and visit a chest specialist. take care"},{"Patient":"my lower gum line looks like it has a dark red line from horozontially and occasionally a hard lump keeps coming and going in the same spot its tender but doesnt really hurt but it feels like kind of like its swollen when it does appear? also about two nights ago my gums started to really get sore and caused me pain i had developted what sort seemed to be a tiny blister except that it came to a white head, i felt really flushed hot then nauseated to my stomach and i could slightly taste a leaking some kind of fluid?","Doctor":"hello, As per ur description it seems u r having draining abscess/sinus.. the blister is opening of infection from either soft tissues (gingiva, periodontal ligament) or from hard tissues ( bone,tooth) It has to be assesed clinically and radiographically about the origin of abscess.. most commonly it is from carious or  traumatised tooth.. and to treat it permanently RCT of involved tooth is done.and blister resolves forever.. if its from gums only..then gums /periodontal surgery is done..to treat it.. meanwhile u can use chlorhexidine mouthwash/ gels on ur gums temporarily.."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor I am suffering from wisdom tooth growth problem.

I have brownish black stains on my molars and it seems that all my teeth stain quite easily. I have excellent oral hygiene (brush, floss, fluoride mouth wash every day) but i seem to be very susceptible to staining. The dental hygienest and dentist tell me I have no cavities and my teeth are in great shape but tell me I have excessive staining, and then remove the stains during the cleaning. How can I remove these stains myself ad be proactive to keep them away in the future? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello there. Its great to see you are taking great care of your oral hygiene. Your cleaning regime appears perfect from the information you provide. Here are some things to consider. 1- Whilst you say that you brush your teeth, how often do you brush? How long do you brush for? What technique are you using to brush? What kind of toothbrush are you using? You should be brushing twice a day minimum, using circular motions and not back and forth scrubbing motions for at least 2 minutes each time. You should then spit out the toothpaste but dont rinse. 2- What mouthwash are you using? Some of the best mouthwash products contain Chlorhexidine Gluconate. This is fantastic to preventing plaque accumulation and protecting against gum disease. But it promotes the uptake of staining and makes your teeth go yellow or brown. This is a superficial \\"extrinsic\\" stain and can be easily removed. To prevent this, either change your mouth wash or avoid eating and drinking for 8 hours after use of mouth wash (i.e. over night). 3- What food are you eating? Curry, tea, wine, etc are all food stuffs that can increase staining regardless of how good your brushing is. 4- Do you smoke? Smoking is a leading cause of staining, not to mention decay (due to xerostomia - dry mouth) and periodontal disease (gum disease). Consider quitting if you do smoke. Hope that helps. Good luck and keep up the good work with your oral hygiene."},{"Patient":"i am 60yrs old having deep jaundice & want to undergo molar tooth extraction.what complications may develop after the extraction procedure?

You could ask your dentist or pharmacist for stronger painkillers. Pain that starts to get worse after two days is considered abnormal and you may want to see your dentist.

In that case, the bone and fine nerve endings are not protected and exposed to air, food, and liquids. Dry socket delays the healing process and can be very painful. If you suspect dry socket, see your dentist. S/he will place a medicated dressing in the socket which will almost instantly relieve pain. If the area is infected, your dentist may also prescribe a course of antibiotics. The medicated dressing should be changed every day or two at the start, and then at longer intervals.

When you have insurance or have saved for your treatment then get the splinting and perio procedure done. There is hardly anything you can do at home.

It will most likely have to be extracted, however just a few minutes ago, I see that the area of my gum under the tooth is red and part of my lip and chin is getting numb.

In the meantime, what can I do to ease the pain?","Doctor":"hello, cavity in the teeth should be restored immediately , if there is sensitivity to hot and cold, then it is easy to restore normally, and if there is pain in the cavity, then this will go to RCT followed by crowning. and if you observe numbness and redness in the area near this tooth , then it means there is periapical infection and may be there is periodontal abscess as well. so i will advice you to go for a dentist check up. and radio graph can show the best results in this situation. medication will be given to you by the dentist . regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, myname is christina. ihave had a tooth ,rootcanel done several years ago, A year ago it broke, i couldnt afford the dentist ( the check up cost 197 dollars..for 10 minutes make another appointment.. ) two days ago my right ear started to go numb and now my ride side of my face is numb/tingly. i HAVE made an appointment with the dentis ( i been saving up) andmy apponintment is in TWO days .

After I started taking these pills I started having to urinate often and I really haven't been drinking alot of water at all yet every time I do urinate its water colored. Is there anyway that Ibuprofen or Cephalexin is causing this?","Doctor":"hi ibuprofen is known to be toxic to kidney in very high doses for prolonged duration and impairs its function. so it could have decreased your urine output , not increased it. as regards cephelxin, theirs no scientific study to link the output of urine to that of cephalexin. so its not drug related. but it can be due to the fact that while having these drugs three time a day, you are using water to ingest them. so this water three times a day is the real culprit here. so no need to worry. its perfectly normal. with regards Dr Ankit"},{"Patient":"I have these black spots on the tip of my tongue--had them for so many years--at times there would be more spots and at times less.

It is there from 2 months","Doctor":"White patch on the tongue can be due to various conditions / diseases. If your husband is tobacco addict (smoking or chewing), it can be leukoplakia, which is a precancerous lesion. Try to scrape this patch with a toothbrush, if it doesn't go it can be any precancerous lesion or precancerous condition (like leukoplakia, lichen planus etc). If he doesn't have any oral habits but his oral hygiene is poor (dirty teeth, swollen gums, foul mouth odor), than it can be a fungal infection called oral candidiasis. If the patch is non-itchy, you can rule out the fungal infection. Moreover, it can be a feature of HIV infection: hairy leukoplakia. This patch looks white with raised scaffoldings which appear like hair on it. Its an oral manifestation of AIDS and it occurs mostly on the side of tongue. Complete clinical oral examination along with required tests is recommended. Its advised not to delay the treatment. A white patch in oral cavity for more than 2 months is something to worry about."},{"Patient":"I had a root canal done on my front tooth about 5 years ago. It has an enamel cap on it.

Infection could be of the tooth or gums.Accordingly treatment can be obtained."},{"Patient":"I noticed a skin tag on the lining of my cheek on the left side. I only noticed it because I bit my jaw and decided to take a look at it. I have never seen anything like this before and I do not have a history of any type of oral abnormalities. Could you help by identifying what exactly this is?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM. Do not worry, since you do not have a history of any oral abnormalities, then it is probably just a line of oedematous tissue, developed due to chronic physiological irritation of the Buccal Mucosa rubbing on the line of occlusal contact of the maxillary and mandibular teeth, called the \\"Linea Alba\\", which is completely physiological, and no treatement is required for the same. However, if you have a chronic habit of biting on your cheek, then it is a lesion called \\"Morsicatio Buccarum\\", (commonly known as \\"Chronic Cheek Biting\\"), which has, though very rarely, still been sometimes reported to be a pre-malignant lesion also, so you need to be careful. Consult a good dentist, who will tell yo the proper treatement. Surgical excision of the white tissue tag may be a good option, but incase there is less space between your cheeks and teeth, then there is still going to be more irritation of the wound by the teeth, which will delay healing and can still cause an oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma, so, not going for any surgical treatement, and just using a proper Oral screen would be a better idea. Also, incase you are over-weight with puffy cheeks, then shedding-off the extra pounds will also help, as when the \\"Buccal pad of fat\\" lessens, it will then increase the area between your teeth and buccal mucosa (cheek mucosa), eliminating the impingement of your buccal mucosa on to your teeth.

It is mainly due to trauma from sharp cusps that injure the tissue of your cheek while biting. You can wait for a few days and it should disappear by itself. In the meantime you can apply Hexigel on the spot twice or thrice daily. If the spot doesn't heal up in a week, I suggest you see a local dentist who will evaluate the spot and may ask you to get a biopsy done to ascertain a diagnosis. Hope this helps. Thanks"},{"Patient":"I have gum pain, sensitive to touch only (not hold or cold) in “extreme upper gum” next to nose. Teeth did/do not hurt when chewing or when tapped on. I have had the sensitivity there for appx 2 months but only when touching it. If I poked at it too much the pain would linger a bit but would go away (but constant when touched). There was no mass there. But the sensitivity was always there when I touched it. I have 4 bridges (all quadrants). I guess I have not had the best oral hygiene and I am a smoker. But I have had a lot of money spent on my dental work and the bridges have been in appx 10 years. FYI: I did have sensitivity in the upper tooth (#5) appx June 2011 but it went away. I went to a new dentist (in my new location) and he examined and took x-rays and said I need a root canal on #5. At least I think it is #5 (the one next to the vampire looking tooth). The root canal was completed yesterday and sealed permanently as he said it went well. He had prescribed me Cephalexin 500 mg (one capsule 3 times a day). I am allergic to penicillin. I have now taken my 7th dose of 21 capsules. I have had root canals in the past for which there was obvious pain in the tooth and gum and I always had tenderness afterward but always had immediate relief. I feel more pain in the “extreme upper gum” (same spot) now than I did before. I am taking motrin and the Cephalexin and the motrin is providing some relief. There now appears to be a “little” swelling/lump in that area of the gum. Is this normal? Should their still be abscess/infection there even after the root canal? Will the Cephalexin cure this by the time I have taken my 21st capsule (day 7)? Was this new noticeable swelling caused by the injection that was done right in that area? When should I become concerned or seek follow-up? The reason I ask these questions is because I am a smoker, have not had the best oral hygiene, this is not like other symptoms/root canals I have had, and I am concerned that it could be something else. I have been told that I may have allergies in the past, but I do not think so (maybe just some minor sinus issues, if at all). I know that had I went to my doctor for this first he would have sent me to the dentist anyways.

Usually crown is given after root canal, or in severely mutilated tooth structure. In your case you lost the temporary crown due to which the tooth has grown out a bit. The new permanent crown which was placed was very high and was irritating you. it finally popped off because a high point acted like a lever. You have a swelling indicates infection .

Am taking pain killers like panadol and have started the Novaclox 500mg today. Do I need to go for tooth extraction or will it be fine after I finish the antibiotics course?","Doctor":"If its rotten it definitely needs some intervention, intervention will range from just a filling to possible Rootcanal or you may even have to get it extracted. The disgnosis may be in these range with your symptoms however they can be presented diffrently as well and the dentist takes a call on examination: if its pain with lodgement of food it might just require a filling, if its a continuous pain or u cannot relate the origin of pain to any specific action of yours it must be very well an infection. Depending on the position of the teeth within the jaw and oral cavity and depending on the amount of tooth structure rotten decision of extraction will be made. If the destruction is minimal limited to the upper chewing surface, and its just a dull aching pain it may get relieved with your current medication. the golden rule for wisdom teeth is there should be minimum three bouts of inflammation around the non carious tooth for its removal."},{"Patient":"Hi Just wanted to let you ALL know that although I asked for help regarding my son s illness , you can review the question by seeing my account,...although this was the response: Orthodontic braces are not likely to cause the abdominal pain .

If you suffer from any of the above symptoms than your pain in hand and legs can be due to your dental infection. Extraction is not the only treatment of infected wisdom teeth.

Geographic tongue is more commonly found in people who are affected by environmental sensitivity, such as allergies, eczema, asthma. It may be linked to stress or diets high in sugar or processed foods. Females are affected three times more than males. Causes vary, but may include zinc or vitamin B deficiencies, allergies, and hormonal changes. Geographic tongue is said to occur more often in women, especially during high hormonal times, such as during ovulation or pregnancy, and while taking birth control. There is no known cure or commonly prescribed treatment for geographic tongue, there are several ways to suppress the condition, including avoiding foods that exacerbate the problem. Some get relief chewing mint leaves or sucking on a mint candy or gum during a flareup.  Zinc supplements  has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the incidence of the condition in many cases. Vitamin B supplements with antioxidants need to be taken by you. Soda might be a causative factor as overdose or may be metoprolol. Hope this helps. Get well soon.

When I went back to have the crown fitted, my dentist decided she needed to do a root canal treatment on the adjacent molar (number 26), which had caused the problem in the first place (cavity spreading from that molar to the premolar). As I live abroad, and could only go back to have the crown fitted at the beginning of March, she put a heavy-duty temporary dressing on. Unfortunately, I was unable to go back in March. At the end of March, the dressing was beginning thinner, and one evening, the cap sealing the tooth moved: I had to yank it back on. Over the course of the next days, the gum above that tooth became tender and I eventually developed an abscess , the size of a molar. The lymph node under the same side of the jaw was also swollen and tender. I managed to see a dentist where I am (hard work!). She removed what was left of the dressing, cleaned the inside of the tooth, put a new dressing on, and, after some hesitation, lanced the abscess (not very easy as you had to press very hard to get something to come out, and then it was more blood than pus, yuk!). She gave me a prescription of amoxicillin 250mg, 3 times a day for 5 days, and told me to do mouthwashs with salt water, and to keep pressing the abscess to try and evacuate the pus if I could. I did as told, except for the abscess pressing which did not seem to work very well. The antibiotic worked like magic and the abscess had completely disappeared by the end of the 3rd day. It s now been 5 days since the end of the treatment, and I m wondering whether I could start going to the swimming pool again, before I see my dentist in 2 weeks time. When I had my wisdom teeth extracted, I was banned from swimming for 2 weeks when all went well, and a whole month when the wound for one of them didn t heal and became infected.

What can it be and what do I do","Doctor":"Hi , Firstly good to know that you know about the name of the papilla. You have not provided any pain/itching history in relation to the blister & duration of the blister being there. If it is painful then give fresh fruits & juices so as to give vitamins & minerals as no treatment is needed. If it is painful, then please consult some nearby dentist. Also, the pimple you mentioned is just enlargement/hypertrophy of the papilla,no need to worry. Just take good care of her.

I am in panic mode. brought my 16 year old daughter to doctor today. she has been complaining about a sore on the roof of her mouth that swells after she eats. after a few hours it goes away. dr saw it today it was not swollen but saw white spot and indentation. sending us to ENT. I asked the cancer question and was told that its rare in someone her age. she does not smoke or drink and is in good physical condition. could this be something other then cancer","Doctor":"It seems she has oral thrush i.e oral candidiasis. This can be due to poor oral hygiene, low immunity or hormonal problems. It looks like a white rough patch which is itchy and ulcerates easily. But only proper oral examination can help diagnose the exact problem. Don't go to ENT, go to a dentist, as he is more aware of oral diseases and their differential diagnosis. All sores are not cancers and all cancers don't form sores. Biopsy is recommended if the ulcer is non-healing. In your daughter's case I am sure its not what you are presuming. My god bless her."},{"Patient":"I developed a raised lump on my tongue about 2 to 3 months ago. I had a dental appointment about a month ago and was asked how long it had been there. I said about a 6 weeks. I spoke to the dentist and he said it looked like scar tissue and asked if I had bite my tongue. I said not that I recall. He said as it was same color as my tongue it was ok but keep an eye on it. A week ago I noticed that it was white with a very small red dot in the middle. Now it is just white. It is on the top of my tongue but nearer to the left edge. It does not hurt and never did. Should I go back to the dentist or the doctor?","Doctor":"Mostly U have some glossitis due to trauma. Lump suggests any reaction to physical abuse or infection. It might be a healing lump as the blood supply to the tongue is high. It is best if you observe it regularly for a while. If it increases in size or becomes painful u need to rush to a dentist. Whitish and reddish colour is common for healing mucosa in the mouth. Please do not use a tongue cleane. Just gently brush your tongue  once a day."},{"Patient":"my breath smells like blood one of my wisdom tooth broke so Its leaking, Ive been having this bad breath smell for years though. and I cannot afford a dentist nor have medicare . how can I fix it?","Doctor":"hi since you have a broken tooth and that too foul smelling that means its already infected and this could be dangerous as you are avoiding this for years..now the right treatment for this can be two depending on the amount of tooth structure present...firstly one can try for a RCT if considerable tooth structure is present... but if not then extraction is the final option available that too under proper antibiotic cover so as to avoid spreading of infection... no other treatment would help...and please get an xray done before opting for any teatment measure... thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Thanks in advance for your advice.

There is no problem with the 3rd molar removal it is regular procedure where in it is done under local anesthesia. Please do not have a myth that 3rd molar extraction results in complications. The swelling can be controlled by cold pack, avoid hot food and start antibiotic coverage. Get the tooth removed during the antibiotic cover to avoid retrograde infection.

Nothing to worry about it. You just need to meet a nearby dentist & get your wisdom tooth extracted if it is misaligned or partially erupted or is of no use. Try some warm saline rinses. The condition is called as pericoronitis. Thanx for referral....

Stress is the main cause of such sores. Medicines can heal your ulcers but cannot stop formation of new ones. So you need to destress yourself. Are you taking any other medication?

Third phase is full blown disease which consists of several complications in the body and it is called AIDS, acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome. 2 different types of tests can confirm false +ve & false -ve HIV reports.

Is there anything I can do to get rid off this irritation besides taking lysine (i also suffer from chronic oral herpes )?","Doctor":"Its a very unusual condition: fusion of gum & cheek post implant failure. How are the cheeks related to dental implants! It seems the implant was either not placed by a specialist or the patient didn't follow the post operative instructions & the implant got infected. I think due to long standing infection or complex infection, your cheek muscle fibres are fibrosed. Take multivitamins plus lycopene for faster healing & recovery. Eat tomatoes which contain lycopene. If infection is there proper antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs are advised. Consult a good dentist.

I decided to keep the whiskey in my mouth to kill bacteria , I know I was wrong now. I don t know how long I kept the whiskey in my mouth but I probably did it at least twice for twenty minutes each time. The next day I didn t notice much difference and didn t even remember the incident but as the day went on I noticed that I was having gum pain on eating. The next day things got worst, I look at my gums with a mirror and notice they were burnt looking all on the inside of my mouth where I held the whiskey. White dead skin was coming off and I had very red sore gums around the base of my teeth on the bottom and top insides where the liqueur was. I nursed this condition for four days with warm salt water rinses three times a day and ate only soft non-chewable foods. Now after 5 full days my gums look better but still some red patches that are very sore. The redness is not as vivid as it was a few days ago but the pain is excruciating and has not subsided much. Ibuprofen isn t helping much. Bottom line most of my gums are looking better and slightly less pain except one spot that hurts constantly no matter what I do, it s red in this area covering about three teeth at the gum line, (number 30 and teeth next to it). If I didn t have the non-stop pain I wouldn t be writing, I can t sleep, eat or do much without constant pain. Any suggestions? It s been five full days. I haven t drank any alcohol since and don t plan on it after this episode.

You still need to avoid spicy and hot foods for few more days as it takes a couple of weeks for the repair or healing of the gums. so you need to wait till then. dont worry its going to be fine in few days. avoid smoking and alcohol till complete healing and even after for a month to help the tissues growth.

If Antibiotic coverage is not been given this is quite possible. If the extractions are done in heavy infection and trauma it might lead to carcinoma.

Dry socket has also not been an issue.

These dentures are placed in the mouth directly after the remaining teeth are extracted. This approach is utilized when a person does not want to be without any teeth for several months. It also helps for the extraction tooth sockets to heal while a denture is fabricated. These Immediate dentures are the first denture of a two-denture process and should be considered as a temporary interim prosthesis until a second refined and esthetically enhanced denture may be constructed after complete healing of the sockets."},{"Patient":"Male, 36. i had a molar pulled exactly a week ago today, the stitches have been removed and the doctor said everything is healing quickly and in great shape, i am gay and want to return to having oral sex with a man, when is it safe, as i am no longer in pain.","Doctor":"an extracted tooth to get heal completely of three weeks so first two weeks dont have oral sex becaz infection may hamper healing so during ur third week u can but with precautionary measures and ur oral hygiene should be maintained well"},{"Patient":"I had an abscess removed which was outside but adjacent to one of my front upper teeth.

It is not advisable to wait for the teething process to be complete. Dentists may recommend against the use of fluoride toothpaste during teething.

I m teething at 55 years old! j/k I have a Lt upper wisdom tooth that is just a simple straight up and down angle. The tooth is giving me pain into my Lt. ear and temple. I went into the dentist and of course they send you to a specialist. (sigh) (Whatever happened to the dentists who could actually do there job and pull out a simple wisdom tooth?) Anyway...this specialist tells me that it will be ONE THOUSAND dollars to pull out my tooth! Why so much? The specialist says I need a bone graft as well. I m sorry but I don t believe it. What did people do before bone grafts when they had a wisdom tooth extracted? I have another tooth #4 that is shattered under the gumline and that is where I would need the bone graft imho. Can I find a dentist to pull out my wisdom tooth without using a bone graft? If get another opinion...I will be down another 85.00! (sigh) I asked the specialist how long the extraction would take. she said not more then 1hr. Again..I m having a problem with someone making ONE THOUSAND dollars an HOUR. Dental charges are out of control and just as bad as MDs...its not right! Yeah, yeah...I know..they went to school and have office upkeep etc. I would be embarrassed to ask for that much money from a person who clearly is in need of help.

I can't keep a job because of this because every morning when i get up and get ready to go to work I'm fine until its just about time to leave then it happens. When it happens its always just instantly happens then I have run to the bathroom because using the restroom for about 30 minutes then putting a heating pad of my stomach for an hour or so is the only way to make it go away. Last year when I still had insurance (I'm 19 now) I went to the doctor and he said that its just my nerves and constipation that are causing it so he told me to buy miralax and take it daily and he perscribed 25mg of Atarax to be taken 4 times a day. The two combined helped but i never took the 4 atarax a day because when i took just one i'd be asleep just 10 minutes after taking it so i only took them when i got the stomach ache. All different situations cause the stomach ache going to work/school the idea of going to hang out with friends going on vaction and even things as simple as watching an exciting movie cause this to happen. But now I ran out of the Atarax and don't have any insurance so I can't afford to go to the Doctor or get a refill of the Atarax but I don't really want to keep taking the pills because the make me fall asleep. So for the most part I have stopped this from happening because I haven't had a job in the last 8 months, haven't gone out to hangout with my friends. I just usually stay home and do nothing but watch tv but now watching exciting shows are causeing it to happen. The stomach ache that I'm getting is pretty bad because if i don't make it to the bathroom within a minute after it starts it is painful enough to bring tears to my eyes and i've cracked bones while riding dirtbikes and I believe that this stomach ache is more painful. I dont know for sure maybe it feels like it because of how often it happens.. People say it just in your head and that I should keep doing what I was going to do and that i'd forget about it and it'd go away but every second I wait not going o the bathroom it gets worse and worse. Ive tried to just bare with it and that doesn't work. I'm tired of this and want to get my life back on track so if anyone can help it'd be much appreciated. I really want to get back out there.","Doctor":"your problem seems to be very complex, the exact cause in you has not been evulated i suppose, you should get a endoscopy, colonoscopy or barium x-ray studies, it may just not be nerves, it could be irritable bowel syndrome. get checked by an gastrosentrologist with multiple tests, this will help you to come to a diagnosis and once the diagnosis is there, it will be easy to go for the treatment."},{"Patient":"i have a question i wanted to know how much it will cost to get my web cut with out insurance?","Doctor":"hi it is minor surgical procedure and cost depend upon the city ,country and doctor. plastic surgeon take more then other surgeon it range from 5000 to 9000 rs only. give me more detail about ur age ,problem ,city and sex."},{"Patient":"I am a 40 yr young female and currently have a tooth abscess .

Regards, OHMI","Doctor":"I can introduce about a  toothpaste which I have been using it.It really works well. I feel that you better try to use this product instead of using other toothpaste. This is not only a toothpaste alone which can be used for multiple purpose: Ganozhi toothpaste alone contains ganoderma, the renowned super medicinal mushroom, to provide extra strength and a host of nutrition for the gums themselves. This all-natural product contains no artificial sweeteners, flavours or colouring. Now, the visible effects of gum disease are one thing.  Of more concern, is what happens when even a mild case of gum infection and bleeding gums are left untreated. That's because when gum infection and inflammation spreads from the gums to the ligaments and bone that support the teeth. And when treatment for gingivitis is ignored, those teeth become loose and eventually fall out. Definitely not a pretty sight! As if that's not bad enough, potentially, gum disease is detrimental to your general health. Again, if treatment for gingivitis is ignored, such action can actually increase the risk of heart disease, pancreatic cancer, and a whole host of other life-threatening diseases.  That's because millions of bacteria rapidly multiply where your toothbrush can't get to them.  They flood directly into the bloodstream via those bleeding gums, bypassing the body's first line of defence and wreaking havoc. And without early treatment for gingivitis, the prognosis is for expensive and uncomfortable specialist surgery, and a lifetime of care.

As per your symptoms you are having orthodontic relapse. After finishing the orthodontic treatment the teeth tend to move back to its original position, so a retainer is given to patient (removable or fixed) to hold the teeth in the new position. According to American standards it has to be given till the age of 22. At this age the growth of the body stops completely. Now that relapse has occurred in your case, you need to go again for orthodontic therapy that is fixed or removable depending on the severity. If minor correction has to be done better go for removable. If enough space is not there to align the teeth then to gain the space extraction of premolars (to gain more space) or proximal stripping (to gain less space) has to done. And yes, orthodontic treatment can definetely be done at this age. Its called Adult orthodontics.

Improve his nutrition if it is poor. Let him eat healthy nutritious balanced diet which should include fresh fruits and green leafy veggies. Brush his teeth twice a day and keep him off Junk and chocolates.  Change his toothpaste brand every three months and avoid using mouthwashes if swollen gums are caused by sensitivity to toothpaste or mouthwash. The Dentist will examine and take  dental x-rays and dental bone measurements  to determine whether the inflammation has spread to the supporting structures of the teeth.

Here is some background info (i do not know how relevant this might be): I got both of my right wisdom teeth pulled over 2 weeks ago. my dentist put in dissolvable stiches. Because of my TMJ, my jaw was basically locked after that. When I went back to the the dentist, he just told me to keep prying my jaw open. My jaw still hurts, although it can now move. It is constantly in pain.","Doctor":"Hi There, Your condition is called post-surgical TRISMUS. This generally is a complication after impactions & extensive bone removal. It shd last for max 3-4 weeks till the healing is complete. The open wound exposes the jaw bone & also the root of the adjacent tooth,hence the sensitivity to cold. You need to do the following; a) Make sure the procedure was properly done: this can be achieved by a post-op X-ray or a 2nd opinion by an oral & maxillo-facial surgeon. b) Take a muscle-relaxant along with pain medication to unlock the jaw muscles like IBUGESIC-MR. c) Chew on a sugar-free gum like orbit/wriggley for 15min every 3hrs.

I am 21 F. I had all my wisdom teeth removed 6 days ago. The first few days the pain wasn t as bad as I had expected, I was just quite swollen. Anyway I started eating more solid foods but have kept a regime of antibiotics , painkillers and mouthwash and haven t smoked or anything. But today, particularly after lunch and worsened after dinner, my bottom left cavity is hurting a LOT more than it did before! At first I thought I must have just aggravated it a bit from eating but the pain isn t going away. I still have my stitches in, and to be honest, although it s difficult to distinguish between the two, the pain feels centred around the wound exactly where the stitches are rather than actually inside my gum, but even slight movement of my facial muscles causes pain to the entire area, almost reaching my ear . It s basically a constant ache, not sharp pain unless I move my tongue over and touch the stitches. I wouldn t say it s excruciating but I m not sure how much longer I ll be able to take it! Does this sound like dry socket? Or is it normal healing process? And if so why is it hurting so much more than my other ex teeth, which in comparison (especially the upper ones) feel hardly any pain!

It is proposed that the tooth be drilled into and the suspect decay treated. Or cap removed ? I do hope the suspect decay is actually that, rather than something else giving that kind of image . e.g cement/filling etc. As the treatment is NHS funded, cost is not a problem to me.

Analgesics (medication which subside pain) is not treatment, its just temporary relief to buy some time for you to get complete treatment. so, its not going to solve your problem. Your cheeks are swelling thats is due to Infection, aerobic as well as anaerobic, and the fever is due to the infection. And just pain killers arent going to solve your problem. You need to consult your dentist and he or she will take a Radiograph or X-ray, and will advice you treatment, mostly extraction or Root canal treatment, but in few cases, incision and drainage is also needed if the infection is very much spread. But from your case presentation, i guess your swelling will be subsided with the help of Antibiotics which cover both aerobic as well as anaerobic infection, (dont try to self medicate yourself, consult your dentist) and pain killers, they will act efficiently when you are taking antibiotics alongwith it.

Metformin can cause a decrease of appetite, food consumption and induce weight loss but I don\\"t think that Metformin is the cause of your 110lbs weight loss. Metformin can lower the A1c by an average of 1.5% for 3-6 months therapy if it is well-combined with proper diet and physical activities. About your symptoms, if you were my patient,  I will suggest doing some blood work like total blood count to check for anemia, basic metabolic panel to check the status of kidneys, electrolyte and acid/base balance,a thyroid panel  to check for hypothyroidism and a spinal X-ray of your lumbosacral zone to see if there is any reason that causes your back pain.

The diabetes diet is a healthy meal plan and simply means eating the healthiest foods in moderate amounts and sticking to regular mealtimes. It is rich in nutrients and low in fat and calories.

About the drinks with high oxalate content i suggest to avoid: Black tea, Chocolate milk, Instant coffee, Hot chocolate and Soy drinks. If you are a regular tea drinker,i suggest to try green teas and oolong tea because they have lower oxalate contents.

You will need to take it very regularly. And usually, if the sugars are not well controlled, antibiotic course will need to be prolonged so as to be effective. Last and most important, meet your dentist before stopping the antibiotic for any possible visual inspection of the site for possible confirmation regarding the infection control.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Glycomet 2 is a combination of two drugs, which seem to have effectively lowered your blood glucose levels to an acceptable level. Glycomet 1 is only one drug, Metformin, not the combination drug which is sometimes considered to be more effective at lowering blood glucose than Glycomet 1. Is there some reason you wish to switch since you are already well controlled? My advice to you if you wish to go to Glycomet 1 is to try it while testing your blood sugar and managing a consistent carbohydrate/calorie count in your diet to see if you get the same control from the Metformin (Glycomet 1) alone. If the same control is achieved then you will be able to stay on Glycomet 1 only without the combination Glycomet 2 treatment, but the switch must be monitored for effectiveness.

Ever since my mum bought a big ass bottle of maple syrup i ve been eating 5 to god knows how many spoons of syrup a day. I drink a lot of water afterwards but I m still unsure. I ve researched a bit about it and too much syrup can cause diabetes. Im kinda freaked out i know i need to stop but does drinking plenty of water break down the sugar you eat? thanks :)","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I understand you are frightened and afraid you might develop diabetes from eating too much sugar. Simply put, eating sugar does not \\"cause\\" diabetes, but is very unhealthy for you and can cause many nutrient deficiencies that may provide an environment in the body for diabetes to develop, particularly if it runs in the family and/or you develop a weight problem putting you at risk for \\"maturity onset diabetes in youth\\" or MODY. The second fear is why are you craving maple syrup by the spoonfuls? This is a form of craving indicative of a nutrient deficiency or possible metabolic abnormality. My advice to you is to stop eating sugar or foods containing added sugar and replace them with fresh fruit and water. If you crave the maple flavor, you may ask your mum to buy some maple flavoring and add it to vanilla Greek yogurt or vanilla Greek yogurt plus 2 Tb. of light whip cream plus a drop or two of maple flavoring as a yogurt dessert. This is a high protein, low calorie, low sugar dessert that tastes like maple syrup. Next, I would advise you to have your blood sugar checked  to assure you are not craving sugar due to an abnormal sugar metabolism already present and to check your iron and hemoglobin, low iron being a frequent cause of abnormal food cravings. In addition do not fear. You have taken the first step and that is seeking knowledge. Now we identify and treat the underlying condition, if one exists. Next, you understand that sugar is not good for the body and you can control your cravings and substitute other foods for them. I wish you the best of health and happiness."},{"Patient":"I am having difficulty staying awake.  I sometimes fall asleep during a conversation.

You have secondary diabetes because it is the consequence of a pancreatic condition. Secondary diabetes will often be permanent and \\"how \\" it is managed vary quite significantly depending on which condition has caused it. Generally the pancreatitis cause loss of pancreatitis function. In these forms of secondary diabetes, injections of insulin may need to be taken to keep blood sugar levels under control. However, in some cases, taking diabetes medication in tablet form may be sufficient. I agree with your doctor's decision. Metformin can be very effective to help your body to manage your blood sugar, especially if you are overweight or obese. At the other side it is very important to start a diabetic plan meal and to do more physical activities. If this is not enough and you have upper range blood sugar, the insulin injections will be the right treatment for you.

Children with Down syndrome are at a considerably increased risk of diabetes. It can be type 1 Diabetes and generally it is coexistent with other autoimmune diseases but even Type 2 diabetes may also present at an early age in Down syndrome due to obesity and insulin resistance. From your description, I can deduct that the measurement was a random blood sugar result. Random blood sugar test is the primary screening test for type 1 diabetes. A blood sample is taken at a random time. Regardless of when the child last ate, a random blood sugar level of 200mg/dL or higher suggests diabetes. So,to resume:204 mg/dL is not normal. It's higher than the normal  blood sugar level and it is suggestive for the diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus. In these circumstances,my advice it to do a fasting blood sugar level and HbA1C test. These test are important to clarifies the situation. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher and an A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates  Diabetes.

How common is perforated peptic ulcer? What are the complications of perforated duodenal ulcer ?","Doctor":"With good medical management of the peptic ulcer he incidence of perforated duodenal ulcer and the hospitalization rate for treatment have decreased. However, the rate of complicated perforated duodenal ulcer appears to be unchanged. In most cases of perforation, gastric and duodenal content leaks into the peritoneum. This content includes gastric and duodenal secretions, bile, ingested food, and swallowed bacteria. The leakage results in peritonitis, with an increased risk of infection and abscess formation. Subsequent third-spacing of fluid in the peritoneal cavity due to perforation and peritonitis leads to inadequate circulatory volume, hypotension, and decreased urine output. In more severe cases, shock may develop. Abdominal distension as a result of peritonitis and subsequent ileus may interfere with diaphragmatic movement, impairing expansion of the lung bases. Eventually, atelectasis develops, which may compromise oxygenation of the blood, particularly in patients with coexisting lung disease. Several surgical techniques have been employed in the treatment of perforated peptic ulcer. These include conservative surgery with patching of the ulcer, peritoneal lavage, and antiulcer medication, and definitive surgery with truncal vagotomy, highly selective vagotomy, or partial gastrectomy. Some studies have reported a high rate of ulcer recurrence in the conservative surgery group and have recommended definitive ulcer surgery for perforation."},{"Patient":"I am type 1 diabetic (50 Yrs), had triple bypass abt 8 yrs ago, and have been on ramipril, atenolol and amlodipine ever since. \\" months aga the amlodipine was increased to 10mg.

I ve not found another close to me as of yet. Before she retired, she had taken me off Farxiga because I was having urinary retention and I had fallen and broke and fractured numerous bones and it was thought to maybe have added to my problem. I am on metformin 1000 mg ER twice daily and I take a shot of 34 units of lantus each night. They did not replace the Farxiga and since my blood sugar has continuely gone back up. I had last HA1C that had went back up from 7.8 t0 10.4 and I m sure it s heighten now since we ve had holidays and now it s already Feb of a new year. I called to remind them I was still awaiting another replacement med before they completely closed their office and their nurse called, left me a message that she had called in a new med and I would not be able to call them again for they would be closed. I went the next day to get the medicine and she had called in Farxiga again! Even my pharmacy said, I think this was one you can not take. Now what do I do? My primary care doc is in a walk in type clinic and with flue rampage right now, they don t advise me to come in as a well patient. I cannot take the flu vaccine so I ve been waiting for a good time, and right now it just is too much to put myself at risk; I ve tried to stay away from crowds and children for the time being. I know I have to have something else to bring down my blood sugars. My morn reading is from 165 to 210. I vary during the day, but no reading has been low where it should in several months.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. It seems that your diabetes is well out of control. Stopping Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) is not a good enough reason to explain the rise in HbA1c levels. Perhaps you should check your food intake as well? The quantity and quality of food is an important parameter. Another really important parameter is physical activity. Walking every day (or at least every other day) is as effective as a new pill. 20-30 minutes of fast walking is enough. Regarding your current regimen. I usually advise patients like you to increase their insulin dosage gradually until they reach acceptable fasting measurements. For older patients a little higher readings are acceptable as well. Targeting a fasting blood glucose around 100 mg% per day is fine. When the fasting blood sugar gets under control again, you can start checking your postprandial glucose levels. You can send another question then. Until you get your blood sugar under control again, make sure you drink enough fluids. Dehydration is a danger is your water intake cannot match the increased losses due to hyperglycemia. I hope you find my comments helpful! You can get back to me if you'd like more information or any clarification."},{"Patient":"Im type two diabetic. I woke up at noon feeling like my blood sugar was low.

It floats when I flush. I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes a number of years ago and am wondering if I have passed the pre phase. I am now retired and have a different PCP. Should I purchase a BG monitor to bring to her if it shows high numbers?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. My opinion is preferably not to buy a BG monitor. Because it is usually intended for checking blood glucose in patients who are on insulin. So as to check and adjust dose according to their blood sugar levels. I don't recommend it for patients who are newly diagnosed or in pre-diabetic stage and are on oral diabetic medication as it becomes a regular obsession to check BG on and off even though not required. Also, medication can be initiated or changed only depending on your vein blood sample (i.e. FBS, PLBs and HbA1c) and not on basis of BG monitor as it is capillary blood and it's reading depends on the way sample is taken. Hence, I advise you that rather than buying and checking BG with BG monitor, preferably get the above tests done. Until you are initiated on insulin therapy, there is not much of a requirement of BG monitor. Hope I have answered your query.

Nausea is a condition wherein vomiting sensation and hunger is more common.But, vomiting might occur more commonly in people with severe dyspepsia (acidity) along with diabetes.Hence, strictly make sure he takes carbs and diabetic diet when he is using insulin pump to avoid hypoglycemic symptoms as these might cause a lot of morbidity in the patient.

The bruising went away last week, but now has re-appeared, and is also darker (purple). Is this normal? Should I be concerned","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Bruising should not occur as this is not normal to have bruises on abdominal wall after hysterectomy at all. This indicates that the hemostasis (control of bleeding) was not proper, or it occurred as a result of reactionary hemorrhage, meaning blood vessels can open up after the blood pressure shoots up during the post-operative period. Clearing up of the bruises was a good indication, but re-appearance of darker bruises indicates that there is bleeding under the skin.Yes, you should be concerned and consult the operating Surgeon immediately to see whether you need a conservative medical approach or surgical exploration for ligating the offending blood vessels."},{"Patient":"Hi!

It is a natural very normal concern to question a major move such as this. Most certainly if there is any question about a plan of care; seek out a second opinion from a specialist. I do not think your personal physician would take offense at this.I cannot express an opinion on this matter without seeing all of your labs and health history, however, I noted that a c-peptide test was done and that was low indicating to your doctor that you needed the insulin.One thing I would be concerned with is whether or not you received any type of medical/nutritional advice on controlling blood sugar with diet, exercise and lifestyle. Such interventions can reduce need for medication.Regardless, the blood sugar needs to be controlled to prevent cardiovascular and neurological complications without delay. If you decide on obtaining a second opinion, I would do so without hesitation as time is of importance.If indeed your body is not producing insulin, then you will need insulin injections. If it is a matter of insulin resistance, this may be a different situation where perhaps insulin may be used until other lifestyle modifications are made such as losing weight if overweight, et cetera.Hope I have answered your query.

Welcome to HealthcareMagic! I understand your concern. Diabetes may develop due to various factors.

I also have scoliosis, degenerate disc disorder and sciatica. I take a tablespoon of cod liver oil a day. I also have got  vitamin d deficiency, severe astma. Am I doing the right thing by taking cod liver oil daily","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to HealthcareMagic,Well, it is not the best way to replete your vitamin D and you are overdosing on vitamin A, a fat soluble vitamin stored in your tissues causing a toxic buildup.This is what I would suggest if you were my patient. To replete vitamin D you need to supersaturate  for a good 6 weeks with 10,000IU D3 per day for 5 days per week and then be re-checked for levels. If levels are normal then drop down to 1000IU per day.Fish oils are good for asthma control if you are not allergic to fish. Also the cod liver oil should be free from contaminants and be of a high grade if taken. I personally feel it would be safer to take omega-3 fatty acids to reduce airway hyperreactivity seen in asthma although eating fish has been shown to cause similar reductions in asthmatic symptoms. Again, the concern with cod liver oil is the excess vitamin A and inadequate vitamin D for repletion. The different brands of cod liver oil will yield varying amounts of vitamin A and D, but since A can be toxic over time, cod liver oil daily may not be the best route. For example, 1 teaspoon of cod liver oil will give you 100% of your vitamin A needs, but will provide less than 500 IU of vitamin D.With regards to your asthma, an increased intake of fruit with a high vitamin C intake from these foods may reduce phlegm and mucous seen in asthmatics. Eating whole grains rather than white refined grains is also beneficial for asthma.I hope this addresses your question.

Miss Edwina","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to HealthcareMagic,I can offer a natural suggestion to you that is quite inexpensive. Studies have shown that the herbal Berberine is as effective as Metformin with fewer side effects when used at the same dosage level as your Metformin was prescribed. So if you were taking 500 mg 3x per day of Metformin, the dosage of a high quality Berberine supplement would be 500 mg 3x per day according to the clinical studies.If you decide to try this, I would purchase a good glucometer, control strips and/or solution or a self-calibrating unit and test your blood sugar every morning while taking the Berberine to determine its effectiveness and to also check your glucometer to a lab value within 10 minutes of testing to assure good quality control of your meter. Also, discuss with primary physician before implementing this suggestion.Of course, a good nutritious diet free of added sugars and high in fiber along with a consistent exercise program is the first line of therapy to control blood sugar and medications second. The purchase of nutraceuticals should be from a high quality supplier, generally one that only sells professional brands is best.I hope this information is helpful in some manner and please remember, I do not know all the nuances of your situation or how high your blood sugar is running. I just know the clinical studies on Berberine are impressive and wanted you to be aware of a natural, cheaper, safer alternative that MAY be beneficial in your situation.There may be other opinions to this matter and without knowing intracies of your blood sugar situation, this may be a workable option for you.Regards, Kathryn J.

As you have not mentioned the exact values of your fasting and random blood sugar and the type of insulin you are taking; the dose of insulin needs to be increased in stressfull infective states and post-steroid use depending upon the blood sugar values.

She has been in 2 comas in the last 4 days. We live in Pooler Georgia ( outside Savannah) and desperately need help finding an endocrinologist.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on Healthcaremagic. The preferred treatment of type 1 diabetes is injectable insulin, the dose of which is according to the levels of blood glucose. However constant monitoring of blood glucose is important because a too high dose of insulin can lead to hypoglycaemia and coma and a too low dose can lead to high blood sugar levels. So dose has to be carefully adjusted as per the blood glucose levels. In type 1 diabetes the pancreatic beta cells are unable to produce enough insulin to take care of the needs of the body. Oral hypoglycaemic agents are not effective I type 1 diabetes because there is not enough beta cell function since OHAs act by increasing insulin action. You will need to monitor blood glucose at home with a glucometer and adjust insulin doses accordingly. Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"I have been vomiting since yesterday after eating lunch.

The most common cause of anal fissures is large or hard stool passing through the anal canal during bowel movements, also constipation and straining during bowel movements, inflammation of the ano-rectal area, such as is caused by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rarely an anal sex. Anal fissures are fairly common and usually heal without treatment or with nonsurgical treatments. Signs and symptoms may go away within two weeks, but it may take up to eight weeks for the tear to heal. If the tear doesn't heal within six to eight weeks, however, you may need surgery. Self care tips includes adding fiber to diet, taking adequate fluids, regular exercise, Soaking in warm water for 15 to 30 minutes one or more times a day, especially after bowel movements, will help ease pain and itching and Avoid straining during bowel movements.

I am overweight and am beginning to think I need to request that I be tested for diabetes.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone carefully through your concern.Yes, blood glucose should be checked as soon as possible as you are overweight and have symptoms suggesting for Diabetes.HbA1c is also recommended, to have a better diagnosis.Will  be a pleasure too help you further.Kind regards,Dr.Mirjeta."},{"Patient":"I was Dx with diabetes in 2010.. have been going to endocrinologists q 3 months since.. insulin was up to 55 daily of long acting and 20 plus sliding scale of fast acting with meals- I eat healthy.. but not on a schedule...I test 3-4 times a day- again inconsistent.. due to family schedules.. have had episodes of lows-- many down to 30 & 40.. started A1C at 10-11.. have had it down to 9.3.. but....still up- Here s the kicker-- was tested for specific peptide in March & I am in fact type 1- so now they are reducing my insulin.. and I m registering HI most of the time...they reduced b/c of the low episodes.. I m baffled, working with nutritionists & dieticians.. they see my meal plans & injection schedules(amounts) they don t seem to know how to treat me... you have any suggestions.. I am basically healthy..active, no symptoms...7 years in.. they want me to be normal numbers- My body wants to be between 200 & 300.. what can I do??","Doctor":"Welcome to HealthcareMagic,Yes, you are indeed one of the more complex cases and without the information your dietitians have, it will be difficult for me to sort this out. If you were my patient, however, I would be looking at those blood sugars, your food diary and the insulin peaks and trying to match your food intake to the insulin peaks which means you would have to eat on a scheduled basis or consider going on an insulin pump for optimal control. Has anyone discussed an insulin pump with you?Also, if you are a type I, I agree with the fact your insulin should not be decreased, but the type or mode of delivery needs to be changed. There are several types of insulin out, regular, intermediate, long acting and mixtures of  all of these. I try to match the insulin type with the person's meal schedule or vice versa. If erratic, like yours, test and cover with regular. This isn't working for you, so I say either you are on the wrong medication regime, or you need to consider another delivery system such as the pump that is compatible with your inconsistent lifestyle.Letting your blood sugar run 200-300 is too high as you will experience what we call endothelial damage to the lining of your blood vessels which will allow for more plaque formation and the eventual complications you say you haven't seen yet. Some doctors do allow their \\"high\\" patients to run above the normals, but not this high and not without trying the things I just suggested.I cannot give you an idea of the type of insulin switch you should go to without looking at the data your other clinicians have. However, in summary, you still need to work on stabilizing your sugar to avoid the lows but also the highs as they are too high and too low. I suggest that of all the dietitians you have seen, if none of them are certified diabetic educators that you seek this particular specialization of dietitian out as they are familiar with the medications more so than the general Dietitians. The endocrinologists are not trained to put together insulin peaks, food intake, blood sugar values and other variables together to calculate a meal plan so they do rely on the expertise of the Dietitian.Also, I have another question and don't like to assume that this was covered by your doctors yet. You say you were tested for a peptide, were you tested for an insulin auto-antibody? If these are present it will throw the insulin curve off, take the insulin longer to decrease the blood sugar which would account for the low blood sugars. In this case, the insulin is usually increased, but the timing of the normal curve is shifted to the right again meaning you need to eat on a schedule to keep control of your blood sugars. Everytime you treat a low you risk a high.The dietitians have counseled you on eating water soluble fiber throughout the day to help stabilize sugars? This is another thing you can try if you haven't already.Now, I have given you several suggestions to take back to your other healthcare providers to discuss. I sincerely hope this has been of some clarification, some help.Regards, Kathryn J.

You mother should be tapered off steroids if she has been instructed to be on them for one month.  After she has stopped taking steroids, her blood sugar should return to what it was before taking steroids.  She would not be diagnosed with diabetes based only on having elevated blood sugar levels while on steroids."},{"Patient":"I walk a lot to and from doctors appointments and interviews because, I do not have a vehicle and my legs have been very swollen and bruised. I am curious as to what my symptoms are and if I could have diabetes because, it does run in my family and diabetes is very hereditary.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.Usually swelling of legs is not  a specific symptom of diabetes. The symptoms which are often associated with undetected diabetes include excess urination, excess thirst, excess hunger, unexplained weight loss and tiredness. Still you get your fasting and after food blood glucose tested to rule out whether there is diabetes. Swelling in legs is more associated with high BP and/or kidney related  conditions as well as hypothyroidism. Thanks."},{"Patient":"74 year old black male np 98/74 pulse 72 6 feet 2inches weight 190 non drinker/smoker eat mostly veggies little or no meat no salt little or no sweets exercise cardio walk one hour five days weekly, stretch pushups seven days weekly worked 56 years retired two years ago 22 yrs.

It is at the lower end of the normal BP range.Metformin 1000 mg or higher has no effect on BP.

I don t know if it s at all related to the insipidus, but I feel horrible, and experience frequent urination whenever I eat too much chocolate, avocado, or eggs. Why is this? Is there a common nutrient in these three things that I may have an intollerance to?","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM,At first blush, I would say that there may be an allergenic component. Avocodo is very high in fat which should not affect hydration or urinary frequency. Since intolerances are individual, you may very well have an intolerance. As you know, diabetes insipidus concerns hydration and maintaining adequate hydration. I do not have a diet in my evidence-based manual that addresses these foods. If you were my patient I would avoid these foods just as if you were allergic to a medication you would avoid the medication. The guidelines for a diabetes insipidus diet are as follows:1) avoid salty or high sodium foods (less than 2000 mg/day or even lower - clarify with personal physician) and be certain to read labels on foods for sodium content. Salt and sodium are different. Your limit is less than 2300 mg sodium, not sodium chloride which is salt.2) avoid caffeinated products (chocolate may have caffeine in it)3) avoid processed foods - mostly because they are high in sodium4) avoid excess protein5) water based foods may help such as melons, vegetablesBeets, celery, carrots and spinach may have too much natural sodium for your body to handleA low sodium diet is characterized by the following:Eliminate salty foods from your diet and and don't use in cooking. Sea salt is no better than regular salt.Choose low sodium foods. Many salt-free or reduced salt products are available. When reading food labels, low sodium is defined as 140 mg of sodium per serving.Salt substitutes are sometimes made from potassium, so read the label. If you are on a low potassium diet, then check with your doctor before using those salt substitutes.Be creative and season your foods with spices, herbs, lemon, garlic, ginger, vinegar and pepper. Remove the salt shaker from the table. Read ingredient labels to identify foods high in sodium. Items with 400 mg or more of sodium are high in sodium. High sodium food additives include salt, brine, or other items that say sodium, such as monosodium glutamate.  Foods cooked from scratch are naturally lower in sodium than most instant and boxed mixes. Don't use softened water for cooking and drinking since it contains added salt. Avoid medications which contain sodium such as Alka Seltzer and Bromo Seltzer. So, in summary, I recommend avoidance of those 3 problematic foods and off hand I do not know of any one common ingredient in all 3 that might be troublesome in particular.Be certain to use your medication as prescribed and follow the diet guidelines I outlined and hopefully your bathroom trips will diminish and you will feel better.Be Well, Kathryn J.

It appears that your blood glucose levels shot up due to the glucocorticoid treatment. This is a common problem we see in Diabetic patients. Diabetes is also associated with increased urination and thirst. The most appropriate way to treat this condition is to reduce the blood glucose levels by taking prescription medications from your diabetes specialist/ physician.

I dont know your full medical history, but based on the information you gave me, it sounds like your diabetes is advance. Diabetics with advance disease have poor wound healing.

Are you running a lot of lows and highs? Even if your blood sugar that you checked is normal (102 is a good value for a diabetic), that one snapshot in time doesnt represent what your diabetes is doing in a day. This sounds to me like it could be a different medical condition, a lifestyle issue, or a medication side effect. However, if you want to rule out if the diabetes is doing this, i suggest checking your blood sugars first thing when you wake up, before and after each meal, and before you go to bed. do this for a week, and then show the values to your doctor.

Thanks for posting your question on Health care magic. You said that you are pre-diabetic but what is your blood sugar level? Frequent urination that is polyuria and increased thirst i.e polydipsia  are common symptoms of diabetes. I would advise you to get your fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels done. Also a glycosylated haemoglobin should be done to know the status of your blood sugar in the past. I would advice you to stop ingesting alcohol as it will only increase your chances of getting diabetes. Diabetes is often treatable by lifestyle modifications like proper diet, exercise .

Even too scared to see a doctor . About a month ago I noticed a dime sized, soft lump at the base of my belly button. I never went to a doctor, but consulted a RN who told me it was an intestinal hernia . I called and explained the syptoms to my family doctor and he made the same assesment. If I hadn't seen the lump, I wouldn't have known it was there because there was no discomfort of any sort. Over the past few days the whole left side of my stomach has become very sensitive to even my shirt rubbing over it. It's not a crippling pain, but more like a dull, falling asleep(no feeling-tingling) kind of feeling on the surface and a squezing pain inside. That in itself has me worried, but for the last three days(a little less mild today) I had crippling gas that I've never experienced. I could feel belches all the way from my stomach up and they hurt so bad that they put me on my knees. And it was 3-4 belches like that every five minutes for two straight days. What scares me is that I could belch just walking through a room and my wife and buddies would all cover their noses. They said they stunk horrible.

Approx 10 months ago I was taken off Novolog......high weight gain, Nausea, ineffective action to reduce bloodsugar levels below 200. Mailaise, increased depression.From July 2016 until January 2017. As of January 2017...new endocrinologist...put me on Apidra instead....having much better lowering bloodsugars below 200..even some below 100. Pharmacy did an exception to their formulary to get Apidra--but is charging me 200 copay wants me to go back to Novolog at a copay of 46.00 financially this is good for me because I am on limited income and disabled. However I do not wish to go back on an insulin which made me gain from 191--to 224 pounds in approximately 10 months, was not adequate to lower bloodsugar. I was taking Bolus at fingersticks and if eating right after, a restricted carb diet 3 gm carb=2 more units. I was taking upwards of 50 unites for carbs depending on meal mostly because of hidden carbs in some foods. However, it did not matter how low or high carb count was I was still over 200pts by next meal. My new Dr. has me titrating every three days up apidra 2 units and Lantus at bedtime by 2 units every three days if fasting is greater than 200. Now I am telling you that this regimen is working greatly better. I would like your opinion of how/why these two act so differently in controlling bloodsugar. I am having such nice results from apidra than novolog..side effects are less on apidra. However the cost is prohibitive and punitive from silverscript. this one medication now costs more than my total budget for ALL of my other medications. and if I go into donut hole of medicare, I will be unable to afford and have to stop some meds as I did last year.","Doctor":"Although Novolog and Apidra both are short (rapid) acting Insulins but Apidra is said to be fastest as compared to Novolog in controlling blood Sugar levels. Mostly “very short acting Insulin” is expensive than the “ short acting”. Apidra has apparently less side effects just because it is very short acting. it starts working in 10-20 minutes and has a shorter duration of action. But all rapid acting insulins have a drastic side effect, that is Hypoglycemia. Huppglycemia is rare or less in long acting insulins if given in appropriate dosage. But truly speaking there is no scientific proof which confirms which rapid acting insulin is fast or faster or fastest.

The hyperbilirubinemia (raised bilirubin levels) is mild and, by definition, less than 6 mg/dL. However, most patients exhibit levels of less than 3 mg/dL; bilirubin levels occasionally may be normal in as many as one third of patients. It is the most common inherited cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition with no associated morbidity or mortality. Mild jaundice is present intermittently in some individuals, but no other abnormal physical examination findings are evident. The common causes for this syndrome are are dehydration, fasting, Intercurrent illness, such as a viral infection, Menstrual periods, Stress, such as trauma and overexertion. The most important aspect of treatment once the diagnosis is established is reassurance. After diagnosis is made it is educated to the patient about its benign nature.

She has been really lethargic over the last week.  She wants to sleep all of the time.  Her glucose level the last several days has been in the upper 300's several times over the last few days.  Could this high glucose level be responsible for her lethargy?  We are not sure what her glucose levels were before.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for asking your query on HealthcareMagic.I have gone through your query and to give a direct answer, both high and low levels of glucose in a diabetic person can cause fatigue. High sugar levels in the blood slow down the circulation thereby decreasing the oxygen/nutrient supply to the tissues. Low blood sugar levels lead to decrease supply of fuel (glucose) to the tissue cells and hence can lead to fatigue. This means the blood glucose levels in a diabetic should be monitored and maintained at normal levels with the help of medications and lifestyle changes, at all times.Apart from diabetes, there are other causes of fatigue like anemia, low thyroid levels, infections, medicine side effects etc. and need to be taken into consideration too.

But at the same time I realized that if I move my chest muscles, I feel great pressure in my chest (still to this day). And slowly it became too painful to talk.   I have a voice, but the vibration of it hurts something in what feels like my esophagus.  It becomes very sore. (also bumps in the road etc any vibration hurts.

Yes it is possible that the endoscopy injury added on with barium study can cause such a problem / pain as you explained .2. To know what exactly is going on you need to undergo another endoscopy and probably a CT scan of the chest. 3. Remedy: for the remedy to be correct, we need the correct diagnosis as to what is the exact problems, for this you need to undergo another endoscopy. *There may probably an injury at the cricophrynx and larynx, hence you have the pain and you can not talk, you have vibrations too. CT scan of the neck is also necessary with that of the Chest. * Till then take PPI, Antacid gels 3 hourly, Domperidone, soft bland diet and continue whatever your Doctor must have advised you."},{"Patient":"I am a 19 year old female. my belly button started hurting yesterday, and I thought it was my piercing. I took the jewlery out and tonight I noticed my belly button was bleeding and had puss coming out. what could be the cause ?","Doctor":"If you have had your belly button piercing recently, the pain and pus is due to infection. You will require a good antibiotic cream locally and oral antibiotics and painkillers. Also, you can take a Tetanus Toxoid injection. If your belly button piercing has been done some time ago, remember that jewelry, especially artificial, contains many contaminants such as nickel, copper, chrome, etc. which can cause allergic reactions and inflammation. If this is the case, change the material of the belly button jewelry. After belly button piercing, the care and hygiene demands of this area increase. Avoid wearing tight clothing and belts over this area."},{"Patient":"After washing my underpants I kept them to dry , to my surprise I see thousands of red ants around it.

Should I eat a chocolate before bed?","Doctor":"HelloI have gone through your question and understood your concern.Glycomet GP1 is an antidiabetic agent that contains metformin hydrochloride  500 mg and glimepiride 1 mg. These tablets works  by increasing the amount of insulin released by your pancreas and decreasing the amount of glucose  in the blood;Glycomet GP1 can cause hypoglicemia and this risc is more possible in your case with the  ingestion of double dosage.It is not  fatal,Don't worry!You will not pass out in your sleep.But you should know that it can be very very dangerous because it can cause nocturnal hypoglicemia or low sugar that occur at night while asleep.To avoid the occurrence of hypoglicemia i suggest to eat a snack before bed.A chocolate is ok!If you were my patient ,i will ask to check your blood sugar before bed.Your blood glucose levels should not be lower than 120 milligrams per deciliter  before bed.If this night this happens, you might need to eat a larger bedtime snack. This will avoid the low blood sugar during the night.So,you have no reason to stress!My last advice: Be careful with the dosis of your drugs in the future.Hope this is helpful.If you have other questions,feel free and ask.Best regards."},{"Patient":"I am a diabetic and noticed my head was feeling light headed.

I just ate an hour ago.","Doctor":"HelloI hope you get this answer in time. Dizziness can happen for a lot of reasons but in your case being a diabetic it can happen both due to a low or a very high blood sugar level as well. Its good that you have checked your levels already and that they are a t 211. It is high but not alarmingly high because you have eaten just an hour ago and you did take a meal high in calories and also took a sugary drink along with it. So yes your last meal could be a reason for your high sugar levels after an hour of the meal. The thing which we cannot comment on right now is that are your sugar levels still rising? you will need to check again after a few hours to keep an eye. No need to panic but try to refrain from sugary foods and eat a healthy and balanced diet meant for diabetics. Your blood pressure although slightly high is not a cause of alarm for you current dizziness. Therefore I recommend you to take a good rest, assure yourself and take your regular medications on time as advised by your personal physician. Once you are feeling fine I would like you to exercise regularly and keep yourself active in a few days time. Activity goes a long way in making you healthier and keeping your blood sugars at bay.

You can help by getting the family together and try to have someone there at mealtimes to encourage feeding. Check to see if he is still on blood sugar medicine or if it has been decreased or discontinued with respect to his blood sugar. If it hasn't been adjusted, make them adjust it. Contact the State and file a complaint if you observe them sitting the tray in front of him with no assist or if you find his medication has not been adjusted to his blood sugar or you find pressure sores worsening. Discuss tube feeding or in between meal supplements per family/pt's wishes. Your loved one deserves quality of care and it is the law in the US.Document everything. Please feel free to contact me should you need any other help with your father in law or in dealing with the facility. Also, by law in the US, reports on quality of life and care should be hanging by the facility door or in another public place where you have access to it.

Why it is done? Any risks?","Doctor":"Laparoscopy is a surgery that uses a thin, lighted tube put through a cut in the belly to look at the abdominal organs or the female pelvic organ. Laparoscopy is used to find problems such as cysts, adhesions, fibroids and infection. Tissue samples can be taken for biopsy through the tube. In many cases laparoscopy can be done instead of laparotomy surgery that uses a larger incision in the belly. Laparoscopy can be less stressful and may have less problems and lower costs than laparotomy for minor surgeries. It can often be done without needing to stay overnight in the hospital. Laparoscopy is done to check for and possibly take out abnormal growths such as tumors in the belly or pelvis, check for and treat conditions such as endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease, find conditions that can make it hard for a woman to become pregnant, do a biopsy, to look whether cancer in another area of the body has spread to the belly, check for damage to internal organs, such as the spleen, after an injury or accident, do a tubal ligation, fix a hiatus hernia or an inguinal hernia, removal of  organs, such as the uterus, spleen, gallbladder, ovaries and appendix. Partial removal of the colon can also can be done and also to find the cause of sudden or ongoing pelvic pain. Risks include bleeding from the incisions, infection and damage to an organ or blood vessel. This may cause more bleeding that needs another surgery to repair."},{"Patient":"My husband is having surgery tomorrow to blast his kidney 6 stones with radio waves.

Should I seek medical treatment?","Doctor":"HelloI have gone through your question and understood your concern.The blisters on your father's shin can be a symptom of water retention (also known as fluid retention or edema) with the appearance of chronic diabetic skin blisters.In diabetics ,the blisters occur on the outside surface of the body and  cause raised areas filled with liquid.For this reason it is very very important to take regularly the water pills.If the blitsers broke,like in your father's case,it is very important to keep the clean,apply an antibiotic,cover the wound,change the dressing and watch for signs of infection like redness and pain.Diabetics are more prone to infections and the wounds are slow to heal.-In my opinion you should seek medical attention and treatement for your father because the blisters can produce dangerous compication like staphylococcal infection( that sometimes leads to amputation), bone infection near blister sites if blisters are recurring and  ulceration of blisters,if not treated adequatelly.Hope this is helpful.If you have other questions,feel free and ask.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have diabetes 2 and it has been fluctuating up and down mostly down after I take my meds .

They also seem to suppress appetite, which leads to the consumption of fewer calories.But i want to underline that these supplements can not be effective for weight loss if you don't have a nutritionally balanced calorie-restricted diet and regular exercise.These are the key elements if you want to maintain your 132 Ibs.Hope my opinion is helpful.If you have other question feel free ans ask.Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, my adult son is a type 1 diabetic, also a dialysis patient. He ALSO has gastroparesis, and his body is nothing but skin and bone. The endochrinologist remarked last week that we may have to consider a feeding tube for him! Are there different stages or categories of gastroparesis? If so, what are they? THANK YOU SO MUCH for any insights you can share! I m sorry, I ve only just realized I must pay for your answer. I don t have my card with me today. SORRY to have wasted your time.","Doctor":"HelloI have gone through your question and understood your concern.Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal spontaneous movement of the muscles in your stomach.If you have gastroparesis, your stomach's motility is slowed down or doesn't work at all, preventing your stomach from emptying properly.Diabetes is a major risc factor that increase the risc of gastroparesis.Many people with gastroparesis don't have any noticeable signs and symptoms.But depending to the cause ,the situation can aggravate and gastroparesis can produce lots of  symptoms like nausea,vomiting,a feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites,acid reflux,lack of appetite,changes in blood sugar levels ,weight loss and malnutrition.My answer for you is:Yes,there are two grades of gastroparesis.Grade 1, or mild gastroparesis, is characterized by symptoms that come and go and can easily be controlled by dietary modification and by avoiding medications that slow gastric emptying. Grade 2, is characterized by moderately severe symptoms.Hope i have clarified all your doubts.If you have other questions,feel free and ask.Regards."},{"Patient":"i eat easily food,,but after eating,i feel,something stay in my food pipe,,ear/gas come out through mouth,,i force to come out gas which stay in my food pipe,,,i feel that,,,doctor give me gastic tablet,,,,,for 6 week,,,i use it and go normal,,,again n again come this problem .is it cancer syndrome?doctor say acid come out ,,when i sleeped.10 year i use tobacoo","Doctor":"Im thinking GERD."},{"Patient":"My eighty year old mother, who is diabetic, laid down to take a nap.

I asked her to take her blood sugar level which was 83. She is currently on Metformin and she told me this morning her blood sugar was 80. I gave her some honey, should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Good morning,As we age and as you probably know, it becomes more difficult to retain our heat, particularly since the body temperature had already lowered from her being in a rested state.You did well by checking her blood sugar trend as a drop from a higher level to a lower level can still cause problems such as shivering even if both values are somewhat \\"normal\\"Also, if you ever do suspect low blood sugar, please do not give honey which is a mixture of glucose and fructose. Fructose will not raise the blood sugar quickly but glucose will. Glucose gel at the bedside for emergencies is good.Now, to answer your question of should you be concerned. No not at this point as I explained above. Keep her hydrated, away from drafts, cover her adequately when she is resting and monitor her shivering episodes and what works and what doesn't.If it continues, then I would check with a clinician and you will also have more information at that time. Please relax and do not be overly concerned.Keep her at a good weight (no big weight losses), enough lean protein, cut up fresh fruits or fruits in own juice, follow good nutritious meal plan.

One possible suggestion may be to increased your fat intake, excluding processed fats or high omega 6 foods like vegetable oils.  I would suggest moderate protein intake and low to moderate carb intake (preferably low glycemic) to avoid hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.  Both fats and protein will decreased carbohydrate absorption and result in more steady state insulin levels.

The paperwork that came with it causes me some concern as to whether or not this is the correct medicine for me. WHat do you think","Doctor":"HelloI have gone through your question and understoond your concern.You should know that Diabetic neuropathy has no known cure like all the other complications of Diabetes mellitus. Treatment for diabetic neuropathy focuses on relieving pain and slowing the progression of the disease.It is very important to keep blood sugar within a target range.This can help  delay the progression of diabetic neuropathy and may even improve some of the symptoms you already have.Gabapenrin is a anti -seisure medication and it is used to treat nerve pain.Based on current practice guidelines,the first-line treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain includes tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline ). If these agents are contraindicated, newer anticonvulsants ( gabapentin, pregabalin) should be considered.In my opinion,your doctor has carefully considered your functional status and potential adverse effects of gabapentin when he chose the treatment for your painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.So,My answer is:Yes,Gabapentin is advisable for pain related to peripheral neuropathy.It is a \\"good\\" treatement and you have no reason to be concerned.Stay in contact with your treating doctor for every problem you may have during the therapy.Hope this is helpful.If you have other question,feel free and ask.Best regards."},{"Patient":"Sir.

I m 67","Doctor":"HelloI have gone through your question.I can understand your concern.The rash can be a sign of an allergic reaction.In an allergic reaction, the immune system starts fighting substances that are usually harmless(certain foods,pollen or medicines ) as though these substances were trying to attack the body. This overreaction can cause  the rash.In my opinion, the allergen or the cause of your rash probably is one of your medicines.Usually most reactions happen soon after the contact with an allergen.It is very important  to identify the allergen and  avoid further contact with it.You take a polipharmacy.Potentially each one of your 7 drugs can be the culpit and the rebound rash is a sign that you are again in contact with your allergen.For this reason my answer is :Yes,you should call your doctor and refer to him your problem. It is very important to investigate about the possible cause/medicine that trigger your allergic reaction and to avoid the contact with it.Anyway,i want to say that you should  stay calm because rash is a symptom of a mild allergic reaction.You don't have  symptoms of a severe allergic reaction,so your situation is not life threatening.So,don't stress and contact your doctor.Hope i have clarified your doubts.If you have other questions,feel free and ask.Take care."},{"Patient":"I am interested in Thistle Milk for diabetes.

My son took thistle milk for his diabetes and he no longer has it. He was just told he was doing well...as long as he didn t over do it. He was drinking a 6pack of coca cola a day.....Anyway...just interested if this would help me.","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM!Milk Thistle is known to be possibly effective for lowering blood sugar at dosage ranges of  200 mg three times daily for 4 months. I do want to caution you that we do not have a \\"cure\\" for diabetes and by using this treatment you may not be helping yourself at all in answer to your question. I can offer a possible explanation, however, as to why your son may have \\"improved.\\" One, he could have had a viral infection that temporarily affected his pancreas and thus his blood sugar. When the infection cleared, so did his blood sugar. Or, as you say, he still has it, but his blood sugar is much lower because he quit drinking all that soda and the doctor is just saying he can keep it under control by avoiding these bad habits and eating healthier. I could possibly provide you more effective additions to your Metformin treatment if I knew more about your condition. Personally, if you were my patient and you were looking for an herbal treatment I would use Berberine at 500 mg two times per day. Studies have shown it to be as effective as Metformin in lowering blood sugars. A side-effect of Berberine might possibly be weight loss. And, I would also recommend a healthy diet and exercise program to accompany the treatment. However, you are already on Metformin with heart problems with both conditions being interrelated. Interfering with your current medical treatment by adding an herb that works in a similar manner as your medication may negatively affect your health profile as a whole.  I do advise, however, that if you have been on Metformin for 3 years or more to have your B12 level checked since deficiency of this nutrient becomes more common the longer this medication is used. Always talk to your doctor before self-treating. My sincerest regards, Kathy J.

Any thoughts?","Doctor":"HelloI have gone through your question and understood your concern.A stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is interrupted or reduced. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die.A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA).There are some risc factors for stroke like:High blood pressure,Cigarette smoking,High cholesterol.Diabetes,Being overweight or obesePhysical inactivity,Being age 55 or older and family history of Stroke.I can say without any doubt that his medications do not cause stroke.You should know that his treatements with antiaggregants like aspirin and clopidogrel and the blood pressure–lowering medications(amlodipine,carvedilol,hydralazine)  and cholesterol lowering agent(atorvastatine) and the diabetes treatement help to prevent a STROKE event.All his medications are not cause of Stroke.Anyway my advice is to consult immediately his treating doctor if you brother has uncommon symptoms that may be suggestive of stroke or other diseases.Hope i have clarified all your doubts.If you have other questions,feel free and ask.Take care.So ,"},{"Patient":"I was borderline diabetic at my last checkup....I ve been exercising daily and being more active but can t seem to lose any weight and am gaining instead....I wondered if some of my medications may be hindering my lost.... never mind...not paying for this!!","Doctor":"you need to check on your daily calorie intake. visit your local dietician or nutritionist for making an effective daily food chart so that you may consume lesser calories than usual. and start exercising more than now, it will surely help. get your blood sugar levels checked regularly."},{"Patient":"My sister is unable to sleep in Durango Colorado.

What causes this infection? What are treatment options?","Doctor":"Gallstones are solid accumulations of the components of bile, which occur when the components of bile are not in correct proportion to each other. A gallstone blocking the outlet from the gallbladder usually causes acute gall bladder infection, so that bile cannot get out. The bile can become concentrated and infected, causing the condition. Chronic gall bladder infection occurs when the gallbladder walls have become permanently damaged by repeated attacks of acute gall bladder infection. Rare causes of gall bladder include severe burns or injury, massive systemic infection, severe illness, diabetes, obstruction by a tumor of the duct leaving the gallbladder, and certain uncommon infections of the gallbladder including bacteria and worms. To treatment includes removing the gallbladder, either immediately after diagnosis or after the patient has improved. Occasionally, patients with complications require surgery immediately after diagnosis. Patients who have infection with no gallstones have about a fifty percent chance of death if the gallbladder is not quickly removed. If the patient has other serious medical problems that may increase the risks of gallbladder removal surgery, the surgeon may decide to leave the gallbladder in place.

Noted your question. At the age of 29 years, we would consider his fasting blood glucose as reasonably well controlled, however, his post lunch ( post meals) glucose of 176 is suboptimal.  However, we need serial glucose monitoring to decide further. A single reading is not enough. So kindly do regular blood glucose monitoring and maintain a chart. Please take the glucose reading chart to your doctor. In addition, your doctor need to do an Hba1c test as well. As far as jaundice and diabetes diet is concerned, it is best to discuss with a dietician. In general, in Jaundice, it is good to eat a diet which is low in fat.

Good blood glucose control can prevent or ease sexual issues so you can have a good healthy sex life.Here are some helpful tips/strategies for you:-Approach sex like exercise.(This helps prevent dreaded blood sugar lows.If you use insulin, check your blood sugar before sex and have a snack if it's low.-Consider a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).If you don't wear a monitor, you can do a quick 30-second blood sugar test anywhere,It can be very discreet.-Just go with it.There's no reason not to grab the opportunity if it pops up just because you haven't followed your diabetes exercise routine.-Keep anything you might need for optimal sex next to the bed. Include a box of juice or glucose tablets and test supplies,lubrificants or sex toys.-Limit alcohol because drinking can also make your blood sugar level drop quickly. -Relax and have fun.Stress and daily problems can damage your sexual life.2.If with your actual treatement(meteor 100 mg/day and glamide 10 mg/day),your diabetes numbers do not fall down 300 mg/dl,this means that this treatement is not effective and it probably should be changed.If you were my patient i will propose you to use insulin therapy for some time.It will help you to stabilise your diabetes,prevent the chronic complications of diabetes and improve your sexual life.Anyway i suggest to consult your treating endocrinologist and discuss with him the right treatement for you.3.About the problem with your brother,in my opinion the bulge around his buttocks can be atributted to the recent trauma and will disappear soon.Anyway i suggets to consult physically his doctor for the necessary investigations and the right treatement(if the problem is more serious).Hope i have answered to all your questions.If you have other doubts,feel free and ask.Best regards.

This test is also called a casual blood glucose test.It is true that your age,positive family history and being African American are risc factors for Diabetes.But the test result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis because it is not fasting.A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL or higher or a a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher ; on two separate tests, you have diabetes.(Actually,if you were fasting, 129 mg/dl can be suggestive of diabetes not prediabetes and the next step will be to repeat the test for the confirmation of the diagnosis)In my opinion you don't have reason to be concerned because the test result is not a fasting but a random measurement and we can not reach the diagnosis only with this test.So,be patient because the true fasting test will give the exact information about your situation.Hope this is helpful.If you have other dobts,feel free and ask.Best regards."},{"Patient":"My mom is a type 2 diabetic, and she scraped the back of her ankle on the door yesterday.

This leads to excess glucose being excreted from urine causing increased frequency and quantity of urine. In turn there will be more thirst.

My Grandfather on my Dad's side was diagnosed with hypoglycemia and my Grandfather on my Mom's side was diabetic. Should I be concerned about the spikes or where it regulates itself??","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.I have seen the details. My suggestion is get a oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) done. That will give a clear indication about whether you have any problem with blood glucose. Secondly if persistently low glucose levels are seen and are causing any problem it is better to get your C-peptide level to see if there is any excess insulin. Another important point in a normal person even when one eats any sanck blood glucose level does not go above 140 mg. So if it going beyond that (200 mg) then it appears to be presence of diabetes.  Therefore, please get an OGTT done. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My dad is diabetic and BP patient aged 75 weight 105 kg height 5'8\\" which supplement can i give him,which will not damage kidney and heart.he doesn't have any heart problem lipids are under control.We are giving him 1 Reconia G capsule per day but he is feeling weakness.Due to obesity which is mainly due to sugar control drug pioglitazones,he is not able to stand and walk for more than 5 minutes.if we switch stop pioglitazones his sugar becomes out of control,apart from pioglitazones he is also taking metformin and voligobose.His HB1ac is 7.5.suggest me a supplement in tab or capsule form that can be admistered to him safely,can be of Amway,Forever living or any other.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.I have gone through the details given and appreciate your concern. Pioglitazone does cause some weight gain, but does not lead to obesity. It also causes swelling of legs and feet. There are other drugs like Gliptins which can be used to control blood glucose and the newer ones called SGLT-2 Inhibitors not only help achieve excellent glucose control but will also lead to weight reduction of over 6 to 8 kgs. in a short time. Those drugs are safe on kidney.Cap Reconia G is a combination of multivitamins, minerals and ginseng. That may be beneficial. But most important is a better blood glucose control and some weight reduction should help him.I would definitely discontinue Pioglitazone and add either a Gliptin or SGLT-2 Inhibitor or both together. His HbA1c% of 7.5 may not be too high considering the age of the patient. However, closer to 7 % would be a better option. Weight control will help in achieving that. I hope I have been able to clarify your doubts. You can in fact talk to your diabetologist about above mentioned compounds.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I was recently diagnosed (just over a year ago) as being pre-diabetic. The symptoms that I have had leading up to this diagnosis, I have had as long as I can remember (since at least Jr. High). I am now 33 years old. I have felt slightly off today. I do have a glucose devise that I got for Christmas. I have not really used it as I was not informed by my doctor to do so. I decided to test, again because of how I am feeling. I ate about 1:30 - 2:00PM. My level at 4:30pm was 257. Do I need to be concerned about this? If so, what do I need to do?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.I have seen the details given.  A blood glucose level of 257 mg after food is a clear sign of having diabetes. The criteria to diagnose is FBG 126 mg and above, PP 200 mg and above and HbA1c% 6.5 and above. Therefore you need to initiate treatment for diabetes forthwith. Do not delay. Many persons do not get any specific symptoms when diabetes develops. That is one of the reasons why it is unrecognized for quite some time. Along with starting treatment with oral antidiabetics  (like Metformin + a Gliptin), you will have to also adapt modified lifestyle, meaning taking restricted diet, avoiding sweets, junk foods, colas, pastries, bakery items, alcohol and even smoking. Plus exercise daily for at least 1 hour. My suggestion is please your personal physician or a dibetologist and start the treatment. Take care. Also get your eyes checked for ruling out diabetic retinopathy. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi there. A couple months ago I started noticing these symptoms and they're increasingly getting worse. I've always drank a lot of water, I'm naturally just one of those people who drink a ton of water. But lately when I drink any water at all- even a small cup, my abdomen protrudes and looks extremely bloated and my bladder is immediately full. It takes little to nothing to fill it up- and this makes me need to urinate a lot more frequently. I've had blood sugar problems when I was younger- I've always been very active so I burn it all of pretty quick so I would sometimes get low blood sugar. Is there a possibility that I could have diabetes? My eyes have recently gotten worse in vision, I'm always thirsty, my bladder fills up quickly and I have frequent urination. Sometimes I have numbness in my limbs- but I always chalked that up to poor circulation.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your question. Noted your concern. These may be osmotic symptoms of diabetes. Due to high blood sugar levels body tries to flush out extra sugar through urine. Which leads to increased frequency of urination, abnormal thirst, generalized weakness. Due to change in osmolality of blood and lense fluid (because of high blood sugar levels) there is blurred vision. I may suggest to get following investigations done - Complete Blood Count- Blood sugar levels Fasting and post-prandial, - HbA1c. - Lipid Profile - Renal Function Test including Urea, creatinine, electrolytes. - Liver Function Test including Bilirubin, liver enzymes. - Urine examination.  And consult diabetologist. Hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I ve recently had a mri of the brain as a result of diabetes insipidus diagnosis. Brain scan has come back ckear and normal.

However, 171 mg after lunch if that is after 2 hours, then does signify presence of gestational diabetes. My suggestion is get a Oral Glucose Tolerance Test done immediately. If the test values are above 180 mg after 1 hour, & >153 mg after 2 hours, then it is confirmed as gestational diabetes. This has to be immediately  controlled first with dietary control. If that does not work, then Insulin injections . It is absolutely essential to maintain blood glucose between 90 to 120 mg all through out the day.

This happens particularly if you have developed high blood glucose, (above 180 mg) then only glucose is excreted in the urine by kidneys. This is a sign of developing diabetes.
