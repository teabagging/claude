Due to symmetry, we can fix (X) at some arbitrary point exactly (sqrt{2} - frac{sqrt{6}}{3}) away from the origin without loss of generality. 2. Understanding the Problem:   The problem is asking for the probability that a rotation around (X) by (60^circ) clockwise and/or counterclockwise brings (Y) to a point (Z) within the circle with radius 2 centered at (O). 3. Key Insight:   If this is true, then (Y) lies within either of the circles with radius 2 centered at (O_1) and (O_2), where (O_1) and (O_2) are the images of (O) when rotated (60^circ) clockwise and counterclockwise around (X) respectively.4.

Area of Union of Circles:   It can be verified that the area of the union of the two circles is just the area of circle sections (AO_1B) and (AO_2B), minus the area of the two triangles (AO_1B) and (AO_2B). The former is:   [   frac{10pi}{3}   ]   and the latter is just:   [   2 cdot 2 cdot sin 150^circ = 2.   ]   So, the area of the union of the two circles is:   [   8pi - left( frac{10pi}{3} - 2 right) = frac{14pi}{3} + 2.   ]9.

Define Variables and Initial Observations:   Let ( n ) be the number of students in the class. Each student has exactly 20 acquaintances, so the total number of pairs of acquaintances is ( 10n ). This is because each acquaintance relationship is counted twice (once for each student in the pair).2. Counting Common Triples:   A common triple ((A, B, C)) is defined as a set of three students where ( A ) and ( B ) are acquaintances, and ( B ) and ( C ) are acquaintances. We need to count the number of such triples in two different ways.3. Counting from the Perspective of a Fixed Student ( B ):   For a fixed student ( B ), there are ( binom{20}{2} = 190 ) ways to choose two acquaintances ( A ) and ( C ).

By condition ( iii ), there are exactly 12 possible students ( B ) who are mutual acquaintances with both ( A ) and ( C ).

Then f(u, v)=(a d-b c) u^{n} v^{k}+(b c-a d) u^{k} v^{n} has exactly two non-zero coefficients. Let m=3 and let p(x)=x^{k}+a x^{n}+b x^{ell}, q(x)=x^{k}+c x^{n}+d x^{ell} and a d-b c neq 0. Thenbegin{aligned}f(u, v)= & (a d-b c) u^{ell} v^{k}+(b c-a d) u^{ell} v^{n}+(c-a) u^{k} v^{n}+(a-c) u^{n} v^{k}+ & +(d-b) u^{k} v^{ell}+(b-d) u^{ell} v^{k}end{aligned}The first two coefficients are non-zero. Since the equalities a=c and b=d do not hold simultaneously, then at least two of the last four coefficients are also non-zero.Let now m geq 4 and let p(x)=p_{1}(x)+a x^{n}+b x^{k}, q(x)=q_{1}(x)+c x^{n}+d x^{k}, a d-b c neq 0 and any of the polynomials p_{1}(x) and q_{1}(x) has m-2 geq 2 non-zero coefficients. Then f(u, v)=f_{1}(u, v)+f_{2}(u, v)+f_{3}(u, v), wherebegin{aligned}f_{1}(u, v)= & p_{1}(u) q_{1}(v)-p_{1}(v) q_{1}(u) f_{2}(u, v)= & left(a u^{n}+b u^{k}right) q_{1}(v)+left(c v^{n}+d v^{k}right) p_{1}(u) & -left(a v^{n}+b v^{k}right) q_{1}(u)-left(c u^{n}+d u^{k}right) p_{1}(v) f_{3}(u, v)= & (a d-b c) u^{n} v^{k}+(b c-a d) u^{k} v^{n}end{aligned}and the different polynomials have no similar monomials. If p_{1}(x) neq alpha q_{1}(x), then, by the induction hypothesis, f_{1}(u, v) has at least 2(m-2)-2=2 m-6non-zero coefficients. Moreover, f_{2}(u, v) has at leas two non-zero coefficients and f_{3}(u, v) has two non-zero coefficients.If p_{1}(x)=alpha q_{1}(x), alpha neq 0, thenf_{2}(u, v)=q_{1}(v)left[(a-c alpha) u^{n}+(b-d alpha) u^{k}right]+q_{1}(u)left[(c alpha-a) v^{n}+(d alpha-b) v^{k}right].Since the equalities a-c alpha=0 and b-d alpha=0 do not holds simultaneously, the polynomial f_{2}(u, v) has at least 2 m-2 non-zero coefficients (two times more than these of q_{1}(x) ). Counting the two non-zero coefficients of f_{3}(u, v), we get the desired results."},{"problem":"1. 41 Let a, b be positive integers.

Each card can lie in one of two positions: face down or face up. The players must take turns flipping one card. The player who, after their move, repeats any of the previous situations (including the initial one) loses. Chekalin made the first move. Who can win regardless of how the opponent plays?## SolutionChekalin's winning strategy is to flip the same card (for example, the Queen of Spades) every time. All possible positions can be divided into pairs that differ only by the position of the Queen of Spades. If, in response to Chekalin's move, Germann also flips the Queen of Spades, the previous position will repeat, and he will lose. Therefore, he is forced to flip another card. By flipping the Queen of Spades in response, Chekalin will get a position that is paired with the one that just was. Thus, each move by Germann will have to \\"start\\" a new pair, and Chekalin will always be able to make a response move, \\"finishing\\" the pair. Since the number of possible positions is finite, sooner or later Germann will not be able to open a new pair and will lose.## AnswerChekalin.Submit a comment"},{"problem":"Given 0 < alpha < frac{pi}{2}, -frac{pi}{2} < beta < 0, cosleft(frac{pi}{4}+alpharight) = frac{1}{3}, cosleft(frac{pi}{4}-frac{beta}{2}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, then cosleft(alpha+frac{beta}{2}right)=　　()A: frac{5sqrt{3}}{9}B: -frac{sqrt{3}}{3}C: frac{7sqrt{3}}{27}D: -frac{sqrt{6}}{9}","solution":"From 0 < alpha < frac{pi}{2} and -frac{pi}{2} < beta < 0, we get frac{pi}{4} < frac{pi}{4}+alpha < frac{3pi}{4} and frac{pi}{4} < frac{pi}{4}-frac{beta}{2} < frac{pi}{2}.

We start with the given series:   [   sum_{n=1}^{infty}frac{phi(n)}{5^n+1}   ]   where (phi(n)) is the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of positive integers up to (n) that are coprime to (n).2. We use the series expansion for (frac{1}{5^n+1}):   [   frac{1}{5^n+1} = sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^{mn}}   ]   Therefore, we can rewrite the original series as:   [   sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{phi(n)}{5^n+1} = sum_{n=1}^{infty} phi(n) sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^{mn}}   ]3. By changing the order of summation, we get:   [   sum_{n=1}^{infty} phi(n) sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^{mn}} = sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{phi(n)}{5^{mn}}   ]4. Using the property of the Euler's totient function and the Möbius inversion formula, we have:   [   sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{phi(n)}{x^n} = frac{x}{1-x}   ]   for (|x| < 1). Setting (x = frac{1}{5^m}), we get:   [   sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{phi(n)}{5^{mn}} = frac{frac{1}{5^m}}{1 - frac{1}{5^m}} = frac{1}{5^m - 1}   ]5. Substituting this back into our series, we have:   [   sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^m - 1}   ]6. We now need to evaluate this series. Notice that:   [   sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^m - 1} = sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^m} left( frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{5^m}} right)   ]7. Simplifying the inner term:   [   frac{1}{5^m - 1} = frac{1}{5^m} left( frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{5^m}} right) = frac{1}{5^m} left( 1 + frac{1}{5^m} + frac{1}{(5^m)^2} + cdots right)   ]8. Therefore, the series becomes:   [   sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} left( frac{1}{5^m} + frac{1}{5^{2m}} + frac{1}{5^{3m}} + cdots right)   ]9. Grouping terms with the same power of (5), we get:   [   sum_{k=1}^{infty} left( sum_{m|k} (-1)^{m+1} right) frac{1}{5^k}   ]10. Evaluating the inner sum, we find that it is non-zero only for odd (k). For odd (k), the sum is (1), and for even (k), the sum is (0).11. Therefore, the series reduces to:   [   sum_{k text{ odd}} frac{1}{5^k}   ]12.

The problem states that the point moves 2 units to the left and 3 units down, landing exactly on the origin. Let's break this down step by step.1. Moving 2 units to the left: Moving a point to the left decreases its x-coordinate. Therefore, moving 2 units to the left changes the x-coordinate from 2a to 2a - 2.2. Moving 3 units down: Moving a point down decreases its y-coordinate. Therefore, moving 3 units down changes the y-coordinate from -3b to -3b - 3.After these movements, the new coordinates of point P are (2a-2, -3b-3). Since the point lands exactly on the origin, its coordinates are (0,0). This gives us two equations:[begin{align*}2a - 2 &= 0 -3b - 3 &= 0end{align*}]Solving these equations for a and b:1.

We can express overline{abcd} as 100 cdot overline{ab} + overline{cd}.4.

Since 301 = 7 times 43, we need x - 10 or x + 10 to be divisible by 7 and the other by 43.

Given A, m(A)=2 n-2, and it is achieved, for instance, by dissecting A along all horizontal (or vertical) grid lines. It remains to prove that m(A) geq 2 n-2 for every A.By holes we mean the cells which are cut out from the board. The cross of a hole in A is the union of the row and the column through that hole.Arguing indirectly, consider a dissection of A into 2 n-3 or fewer sticks. Horizontal sticks are all labelled h, and vertical sticks are labelled v ; 1 times 1 sticks are both horizontal and vertical, and labelled arbitrarily. Each cell of A inherits the label of the unique containing stick.Assign each stick in the dissection to the cross of the unique hole on its row, if the stick is horizontal; on its column, if the stick is vertical.Since there are at most 2 n-3 sticks and exactly n crosses, there are two crosses each of which is assigned to at most one stick in the dissection. Let the crosses be c and d, centred at a=left(x_{a}, y_{a}right) and b=left(x_{b}, y_{b}right), respectively, and assume, without loss of generality, x_{a}<x_{b} and y_{a}<y_{b}. The sticks covering the cells left(x_{a}, y_{b}right) and left(x_{b}, y_{a}right) have like labels, for otherwise one of the two crosses would be assigned to at least two sticks. Say the common label is v, so each of c and d contains a stick covering one of those two cells. It follows that the lower (respectively, upper) arm of c (respectively, d ) is all- h, and the horizontal arms of both crosses are all- v, as illustrated below.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_f8e625b68f0af3ff5fa8g-09.jpg?height=651&width=648&top_left_y=1302&top_left_x=681)Each of the rows between the rows of a and b, that is, rows y_{a}+1, y_{a}+2, ldots, y_{b}-1, contains a hole. The column of each such hole contains at least two v-sticks. All other columns contain at least one v-stick each. In addition, all rows below a and all rows above b contain at least one h-stick each. This amounts to a total of at least 2left(y_{b}-y_{a}-1right)+left(n-y_{b}+y_{a}+1right)+left(n-y_{b}right)+left(y_{a}-1right)=2 n-2 sticks. A contradiction.Remark. One may find a different argument finishing the solution. Since c and d are proven to contain one stick each, there is a third cross e centred at left(x_{*}, y_{*}right) also containing at most one stick. It meets the horizontal arms of c and d at two v-cells, so all the cells where two of the three crosses meet are labelled with v. Now, assuming (without loss of generality) that y_{a}<y_{*}<y_{b}, we obtain that both vertical arms of e contain v-cells, so e is assigned to two different v-sticks.

This can be simplified to give:20 a+11 b+11 c+2 d=360If we assume that a leq 7, then the maximum interior angle sum we can achieve is 20 times 7+11 times 9+11 times 9+2 times 9=356<360 (where a=7 and b=c=d=9 ). As this is less than 360 we know that a geq 8, and so a (which must be a digit) may only equal 8 or 9 . We will consider each of these two cases separately.If a=8 then it must be that b=9, or else the four interior angles are each less than 90^{circ} and the interior angle sum would be less than 360^{circ}. Substituting a=8 and b=9 into (1) and then simplifying gives 11 c+2 d=101. The largest possible value of 2 d is 2 times 9=18, and so 11 c must be at least 101-18=83.

Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles. Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as 3theta, 4theta, and 5theta for some theta. By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain 3theta+4theta+5theta=360. Solving yields theta=30. Thus, the angles of the triangle are 90, 120, and 150. Using [ABC]=frac{1}{2}absin{C}, we obtain frac{r^2}{2}(sin{90}+sin{120}+sin{150}). Substituting frac{6}{pi} for r and evaluating yields frac{9}{pi^2}(sqrt{3}+3)implies{boxed{E}}.-Solution by thecmd999","solution":"Since we know that the triangle is inscribed, we can use the properties of inscribed angles to solve the problem. At first, we can ignore actual lengths in this problem, and use the 3, 4, and 5 as ratios instead of the actual numbers. There are 360 degrees in a circle, so 3x + 4x + 5x = 360, where we find x to be 30 degrees. Thus, the arc measures in degrees becomes 90, 120, and 150. With this knowledge, the angle that cuts off the arc of length 3 is 45 degrees (an inscribed angle is frac{1}{2} the measure of the arc that it intercepts). Similarly, the angle cutting off length 4 is 60 degrees, and the last angle of the triangle is 75 degrees. Upon observing this figure, we can draw an altitude in the triangle, breaking it into two triangles, one being a 30-60-90 and the other being a 45-45-90. For now, we can set the leg of the 30-60-90 angle that is adjacent to the 60 degree angle as \\"x.\\" This makes the other leg of the 30-60-90 degree angle to be x√3, and since that happens to be the altitude and also part of the 45-45-90 triangle, it makes both legs of the 45-45-90 triangle to be x√3. We sum together the areas of both triangles and get (x^2√3 + 3x^2)/2, or x^2(√3+3)/2.Now it's time to actually find the value of x and plug it in. In order to find the value of x, we can use the length of the radius, which we identify as \\"r.\\" Now, looking back at what we had earlier about the arcs, the arc of length 3 is 90 degrees, which is one-fourth of the circumference. The circumference itself is equal to 2rπ. So we can write this equation: 3 = 2rπ/4, making r = 6/π. Now we must find the relationship of r to x, but we don't have to look far to find it. In fact, if we draw the center of the circle and connect two radii from it to points of arc length 3, we see that it creates another 45-45-90 triangle, where r is the length of the leg, and as we see from earlier, the length of that hypotenuse is 2x. Since the hypotenuse is equal to the leg multiplied by √2 in such a triangle, we write this equation: 2x = 6√2/π, and x = 3√2/π. Now, we plug our new value of x into the equation x^2(√3+3)/2.

The section NMPRQ is constructed. Let's find its area.By the condition, AM = MD = AN = NB = frac{a}{2}. Therefore, triangle AMN is a right isosceles triangle and MN = frac{a}{sqrt{2}}. Note that triangles MDM_1 and NBN_1 are right triangles. They are equal to triangle AMN by the leg and angle. Therefore, M_1D = N_1B = frac{a}{2}. Consider the plane of the lateral face SDC. Since M_1R parallel DK, then frac{RK}{CK} = frac{M_1D}{CD} = frac{1}{2}. Then RK = frac{CK}{2} = frac{b}{4}, SR = SK - RK = frac{b}{4}. Moreover, PR parallel DK, frac{SP}{PD} = frac{SR}{RK} = 1. Therefore, SP = PD = frac{b}{2}. Since P is the midpoint of edge SD and M is the midpoint of base AD, then PM is the midline of triangle ADS and PM = frac{AS}{2} = frac{b}{2}, PM parallel AS. Similarly, we can obtain that QN = frac{AS}{2} = frac{b}{2}, QN parallel AS. Therefore, quadrilateral PMQN is a parallelogram. We will prove that it is a rectangle. Indeed, the projection of AC of edge AS is the diagonal of the square ABCD. Therefore, AC is perpendicular to the diagonal BD, and since BD parallel MN, then AC is perpendicular to MN. Hence, AS is perpendicular to MN. Since PM parallel AS, it follows that PM is perpendicular to MN. Thus, the section NMPRQ consists of a rectangle PMQN with sides MN = frac{a}{sqrt{2}} and PM = frac{b}{2} and an isosceles triangle PQR with base PQ = frac{b}{2} and height RF.

The total number of cardstocks used is 14, so we have the equation:[x + y = 14]2. Since each cardstock can be cut into 2 side pieces or 3 bottom pieces, and considering the requirement for making one packaging box, we can relate the number of side and bottom pieces through the cardstocks used:[2x = frac{3}{2}y]This gives us a system of equations:[left{begin{array}{l}x + y = 14 4x = 3yend{array}right.]Solving this system of equations, we first multiply the first equation by 4 to eliminate y:[4x + 4y = 56]Then, we subtract the second equation from this result:[4x + 4y - 4x = 56 - 3y][4y = 56 - 3y][7y = 56][y = 8]Substituting y = 8 into the first equation:[x + 8 = 14][x = 6]Therefore, we find that x = 6 and y = 8. This means we use 6 cardstocks for the side pieces and 8 cardstocks for the bottom pieces. Given that each cardstock used for the side produces 2 side pieces, we have 2 times 6 = 12 side pieces. Similarly, each cardstock used for the bottom produces 3 bottom pieces, leading to 3 times 8 = 24 bottom pieces. Since 1 side piece and 2 bottom pieces are required for one packaging box, the maximum number of packaging boxes that can be made is determined by the number of side pieces, which is 12.Therefore, the maximum number of packaging boxes that can be made from these cardstocks is boxed{12}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"problem":"5 Given the parabola x^{2}=2 p y(p>0), two tangent lines are drawn from the point Mleft(0,-frac{p}{2}right) to the parabola, with A and B being the points of tangency.

We will show that the planes S_{A} and S_{G} trisect the body diagonal A G of the cube, and thus their distance is frac{A G}{3}=sqrt{3} / 3.The 120^{circ} rotations around the A G diagonal map the cube onto itself. Therefore, during these rotations, the planes S_{A} and S_{G} map onto themselves, meaning both planes are perpendicular to the body diagonal A G. Due to symmetry, the distance from point G to the plane S_{G} is equal to the distance from point A to the plane S_{A}. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that, for example, the latter distance is equal to the distance between the planes S_{A} and S_{G}.1987-03-113-1.epsFigure 1Reflect the cube over the midpoint of the face diagonal B D. Thus, we obtain a cube A B C D G^{prime} H^{prime} E^{prime} F^{prime} that shares a face with the original one (Figure 1). The reflection of the plane S_{A}=E B D is itself, and thus the distance from point A to the plane S_{A} is equal to the distance from the reflected point and the reflected plane, i.e., the distance from point C to the plane S_{A}. The latter is precisely the distance between the planes S_{A} and S_{G}, since point C lies in the plane S_{G}. This completes the proof.II. Solution. Label the vertices of the cube as shown in Figure 1, and consider the vectors overrightarrow{A B}, overrightarrow{A D}, and overrightarrow{A E} from point A to the adjacent vertices (Figure 2).1987-03-114-1.epsFigure 2It is known that the vector from point A to the centroid T_{A} of triangle E B D is the arithmetic mean of the vectors to the vertices of the triangle, overrightarrow{A T_{A}}=frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{A B}+overrightarrow{A D}+overrightarrow{A E}). On the other hand, clearly overrightarrow{A B}+overrightarrow{A D}+overrightarrow{A E}=overrightarrow{A B}+overrightarrow{B C}+overrightarrow{C G}=overrightarrow{A G}, so overrightarrow{A G}=3 overrightarrow{A T_{A}}.The obtained equality means that points A, T_{A}, and G lie on the same line, and the point T_{A}, and thus the plane S_{G}, trisects the segment A G. This is of course also true for the plane S_{G}. Since the body diagonal A G is perpendicular to the planes S_{A} and S_{G}, the distance between the two planes is one-third of the body diagonal, sqrt{3} / 3.Remark. In both solutions, only the perpendicularity of the planes in question and the body diagonal to the cube's special properties (3rd order rotational symmetry) was needed for the proof, so the solutions generally show that in any parallelepiped, the planes through the vertices adjacent to the endpoints of a body diagonal trisect the body diagonal."},{"problem":"6.

If we assign the number 1 to each vertex of the 63-gon, we get S=63, because each of its sides will be assigned the number 1. It is clear that for any chosen numbering of the vertices, it can be reached by gradually changing 1 to -1.Now let's examine how the value of S will change when we change the value at some vertex of the 63-gon from 1 to -1. Let's denote the values at the neighboring vertices as a and b (their order does not matter). By performing this change, we will obviously change the numbers on the two sides that emanate from this vertex (and on no others). In the calculation of the value of S, the values of exactly two addends will change.If a=b=1, the sum S will decrease by 4 (before the change, the numbers a, b contributed a+b=1 cdot 1+1 cdot 1=2, and after the change, their contribution will be 1 cdot(-1)+(-1) cdot 1=-2). Similarly, we can analyze the other possibilities:| a | b | change in a+b | difference in the value of S || ---: | ---: | :---: | :---: || 1 | 1 | 2 rightarrow-2 | -4 || 1 | -1 | 0 rightarrow 0 | 0 || -1 | 1 | 0 rightarrow 0 | 0 || -1 | -1 | -2 rightarrow 2 | 4 |We see, therefore, that changing one number at a vertex does not change the remainder of the number S when divided by four. At the beginning, we found that one of the achievable values is S=63, which gives a remainder of 3 when divided by four, so the smallest non-negative value must also give the same remainder of 3, hence we will look for the smallest possible value of the sum S among the numbers {3,7,11, ldots}.As we can easily verify, the value S=3 can be achieved: it is enough to place the following 63 numbers in the vertices of the 63-gon in the given orderunderbrace{1,1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1, ldots, 1,1,-1,-1}_{60 text { numbers }}, 1,1,1and we get S=3.

Using the property of logarithms (log_b (x cdot y) = log_b x + log_b y), we get:   [   log_{2015} (a^{13} cdot r^{78}) = log_{2015} a^{13} + log_{2015} r^{78} = 13 log_{2015} a + 78 log_{2015} r   ]7. Given that this sum equals 2015:   [   13 log_{2015} a + 78 log_{2015} r = 2015   ]8. Removing the logarithm by exponentiating both sides with base 2015, we get:   [   a^{13} cdot r^{78} = 2015^{2015}   ]9. Taking the 13th root of both sides:   [   (a^{13} cdot r^{78})^{1/13} = (2015^{2015})^{1/13}   ]   [   a cdot r^6 = 2015^{155}   ]10. Since (2015 = 5 cdot 13 cdot 31), we can express (2015^{155}) as:    [    2015^{155} = (5 cdot 13 cdot 31)^{155} = 5^{155} cdot 13^{155} cdot 31^{155}    ]11. We need to find the number of possible ordered pairs ((a, r)) such that (a cdot r^6 = 5^{155} cdot 13^{155} cdot 31^{155}). 12. Each prime factor of (r) can take on 26 different degrees, ranging from 0 to 25, because (6 cdot 25 = 150 < 155). Since (r) has 3 prime factors (5, 13, and 31), the number of possible values for (r) is:    [    26^3    ]13. For each value of (r), (a) is uniquely determined by the equation (a = frac{2015^{155}}{r^6}).14. Therefore, the number of possible ordered pairs ((a, r)) is:    [    boxed{26^3}    ]"},{"problem":"Given sin a= frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, and a is an acute angle, then a= （　　）A: 75°  B: 60°  C: 45°  D: 30°","solution":"Since sin a = sin 60° = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, and a is an acute angle,  Therefore, a = 60°.

Sum of Powers of Elements in (X) for Even Powers:   We also need to show that:   [   2 sum_{j in X} j^k equiv sum_{j=1}^{p-1} j^{2k} pmod{p}   ]   For (k = 1, ldots, frac{p-3}{2}), we have:   [   sum_{j=1}^{p-1} j^{2k} equiv frac{g^{2(p-1)k} - 1}{g^{2k} - 1} pmod{p}   ]   Again, the numerator is zero and the denominator is non-zero, so the sum is zero modulo (p).5. Failure for (k' = frac{p-1}{2}):   Let (n = frac{p-1}{2}). We need to show that the condition fails for (k = n).6. Using the Legendre Symbol:   For all (t = 0, ldots, p-1), consider:   [   sum_{j in X} (j + t)^n = sum_{j in X} sum_{m=0}^n binom{n}{m} j^m t^{n-m} = sum_{m=0}^n binom{n}{m} t^{n-m} left( sum_{j in X} j^m right)   ]   The inner sum vanishes whenever (m > 0). Therefore, this is simply equal to:   [   frac{p-1}{2} left( frac{t}{p} right)   ]7. Contradiction Using Quadratic Residues:   Select two (t) such that (-t notin S). Observe each term (left( frac{j+t}{p} right) in {-1, 1}) and their sum is either (frac{p-1}{2}) or (frac{1-p}{2}). This means all of (j+t)'s are quadratic residues or non-quadratic residues. Picking two of them gives a contradiction because the set of quadratic residues (S) satisfies (S+t) having (frac{p-1}{2}) elements in common for any (t).8. Symmetric Polynomials Method:   Let (P(x) = prod_{j in X} (x - j)). We know that (S_k) vanishes for all (k = 1, ldots, n). By our lemma, we can induct on (k) to prove that ([x^{n-k}]P(x)) is zero modulo (p) for all (k = 1, ldots, n) because no coefficients vanish modulo (p) and noting the existence of a (prod r_j) term exists. But this implies (p mid prod_{j in X} j), which is absurd.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ k' = frac{p-3}{2} } )"},{"problem":"Given a gt 0, b gt 0, and 9^{a}=3^{1-b}, find the minimum value of frac{1}{81a}+frac{2}{81b}+ab.","solution":"Given the equation 9^{a} = 3^{1-b}, we can rewrite 9 as 3^2, which gives us 3^{2a} = 3^{1-b}.

This allows us to express the given expression in terms of a and b:[frac{1}{81a} + frac{2}{81b} + ab = frac{2a+b}{81ab} + ab = frac{1}{81ab} + ab]We are asked to find the minimum value of this expression. To do this, we can apply the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative real numbers x and y, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Applying this to frac{1}{81ab} and ab, we get:[frac{frac{1}{81ab} + ab}{2} geq sqrt{frac{1}{81ab} cdot ab}]Simplifying the left side gives us frac{1}{2}(frac{1}{81ab} + ab), and the right side simplifies to sqrt{frac{1}{81}} = frac{1}{9}. Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we have:[frac{1}{81ab} + ab geq frac{2}{9}]Equality holds when frac{1}{81ab} = ab, which, combined with our initial condition 2a + b = 1, leads to the system of equations:[left{begin{array}{l}frac{1}{81ab} = ab 2a + b = 1end{array}right.]Solving this system of equations, we find that the equality holds for left{begin{array}{l}{a=frac{1}{3}}{b=frac{1}{3}}end{array}right. or left{begin{array}{l}{a=frac{1}{6}}{b=frac{2}{3}}end{array}right..

Let the faces of the cube in three pairs of opposite faces be denoted by A and A^{prime}, B and B^{prime}, and C and C^{prime}. It is obvious that under the conditions of the problem, the three events that A and A^{prime}, B and B^{prime}, and C and C^{prime} are of different colors are independent and equally probable.Therefore, if p denotes the probability that two opposite faces are of different colors, then p^{3} is the probability that all three pairs of opposite faces are of different colors. Thus, 1-p^{3} is the probability that there is a pair of opposite faces of the same color. We still need to calculate the value of p.Fix the color of one face. The opposite face can only receive two colors, each with a probability of 1 / 3. Therefore, whatever the color of one face, the opposite face will be of a different color with a probability of 2 / 3.

If x-0.5<0, then x-0.5=-sqrt{(x-0.5)^{2}}, and thus we arrive at the following equation:[x](x-0.5)+sqrt{[x](x-0.5)}-6=0Solving similarly to the first case, now sqrt{[x](x-0.5)}=2, and from this the equation [x](x-0.5)=4 follows. As the variable x increases, now the product decreases, because both factors are increasing and non-positive. It is immediately apparent that the solution now falls between -2 and -1, where [x]=-2. Thus x=-1.5, which indeed satisfies the original equation. In summary, the equation has two solutions, and these are x=-1.5 and x=3.5.Janos Filus (Kecskemét, Katona J.

Let D and E be the projections of points K and M onto the hypotenuse AB (see figure). Then triangle DKB = triangle CKB by the hypotenuse and an acute angle, so angle DKB = angle CKB, which means KB is the bisector of the external angle of triangle AKD, and AI is the bisector of its internal angle. Therefore, I is the center of the excircle of triangle AKD, so DI is the bisector of angle KDE. Similarly, it can be shown that EI is the bisector of angle MDE. Thus, triangle DIE is a right and isosceles triangle, meaning IH is the perpendicular bisector of DE. The point S, being the midpoint of the lateral side of the right trapezoid DKME, also lies on the perpendicular bisector of DE. Therefore, the points S, I, and H lie on the same line.

Let R be the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB. Then PS and RQ are the midlines of triangles triangle AKM and triangle AKB, so PS parallel AK parallel QR and PS = frac{1}{2} AK = QR, meaning PSQR is a parallelogram. Moreover, angle PSQ = 90^{circ}, as its sides are parallel to the sides of angle angle ACB = 90^{circ}. Therefore, PSQR is a rectangle.Let Omega be the circle circumscribed around the rectangle PSQR. From the lemma, it follows that angle SHR = 90^{circ}. Since angle SPR = angle SHR, point H lies on the circle Omega.

Define the problem constraints and initial assumptions:   - We need to find the largest positive integer ( n ) such that there exists a set ( S ) with exactly ( n ) numbers.   - Each member in ( S ) is a positive integer not exceeding ( 2002 ).   - If ( a, b in S ) (not necessarily different), then ( ab notin S ).2. Construct a candidate set ( S ):   - Consider the set ( S = {45, 46, ldots, 2002} ).   - The number of elements in this set is ( 2002 - 45 + 1 = 1958 ).3. Verify the candidate set ( S ):   - For any ( a, b in S ), we need to check if ( ab notin S ).   - Since the smallest element in ( S ) is ( 45 ), the smallest possible product of any two elements in ( S ) is ( 45 times 45 = 2025 ).   - Since ( 2025 > 2002 ), it is clear that ( ab notin S ) for any ( a, b in S ).4.

Analyze the elements less than or equal to ( 44 ):   - None of the numbers ( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ) can be in ( S_0 ). If any of these numbers were in ( S_0 ), then for each ( k in {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ), we can only have one of the elements from each pair ( (45, 45k), (46, 46k), ldots, (89, 89k) ) in ( S_0 ).   - This would imply ( b leq 1958 - (89 - 45 + 1) = 1913 ), which is a contradiction since ( b geq 1959 - 43 = 1916 ).6. Conclude the proof:   - For each element ( x leq 44 ) in ( S_0 ), its square ( x^2 ) must not be in ( S_0 ) because ( x^2 > 2002 ).   - Therefore, ( b leq 1958 - a ).

Then we can write:   [   d = k^2 - n^2 = (k-n)(k+n)   ]3. Since ( d ) is a divisor of ( 3n^2 ), we have:   [   (k-n)(k+n) mid 3n^2   ]4. Let ( k = n + ell ) for some integer ( ell geq 1 ).

Coloring the Grid:   - Consider the 2011 times 2011 square grid. Color the grid in a checkerboard pattern, starting with the top-left cell as black.

Specifically, there will be leftlceil frac{2011^2}{2} rightrceil black cells and leftlfloor frac{2011^2}{2} rightrfloor white cells.2. Removing an 11 times 11 Square:   - When we remove an 11 times 11 square, we need to consider the color of the top-left cell of this smaller square.   - An 11 times 11 square has 11^2 = 121 cells. If the top-left cell of this 11 times 11 square is black, then there will be leftlceil frac{121}{2} rightrceil = 61 black cells and leftlfloor frac{121}{2} rightrfloor = 60 white cells in the 11 times 11 square.   - Conversely, if the top-left cell of the 11 times 11 square is white, then there will be 60 black cells and 61 white cells in the 11 times 11 square.3. Remaining Grid After Removal:   - If the 11 times 11 square removed has a black top-left cell, the remaining 2000 times 2000 grid will have an equal number of black and white cells, making it possible to tile the remaining grid with 1 times 2 dominoes.   - If the 11 times 11 square removed has a white top-left cell, the remaining grid will have two more black cells than white cells, making it impossible to tile the remaining grid with 1 times 2 dominoes.4.

Considering the Position of Line L:   - If the line L lies entirely outside the triangle, we can decrease each of u, v, w by sliding L, keeping it parallel to its initial position, until it passes through one of the vertices.   - Therefore, we need only consider lines that pass through the interior (including the border) of the triangle.3. Simplifying the Problem:   - We can further slide L in a parallel fashion and decrease the sum of u, v, w until the setup is equivalent to:     - A and B lie on opposite sides of L, and L passes through C.   - This is true because u + v remains constant as we slide around if and only if B and C are on opposite sides of L.

Let's call a tile losing if the maximum power of 2 that divides its width coincides with the maximum power of 2 that divides its height. Note that a losing tile cannot be broken into two losing ones: indeed, if the tile consists of two losing parts, then their common side has a length of 2^{s}(2 k+1), and the remaining sides are 2^{s}(2 m+1) and 2^{s}(2 n+1), so the entire tile has dimensions 2^{s}(2 k+1) and 2^{s+1}(m+n+1) and is not losing.If a player receives a losing tile (at the beginning of the game) or two losing tiles (from the opponent), then, whichever of them he eats, when breaking the remaining losing tile, at least one of the pieces he gives to the opponent will be non-losing (see the note above). If, however, a player receives at least one non-losing tile (at the beginning of the game or from the opponent), that is, a tile of size 2^{s}(2 k+1) by 2^{t}(2 m+1) with s>t, then he can always break it into two losing ones, separating a piece of size 2^{t} by 2^{t}(2 m+1). Let's call this rule of breaking the tile a winning one.Thus, if the initial tile is not losing, the first player can follow the winning rule every move, so the second player will always receive only losing tiles from him, and therefore will be forced to give the first player at least one winning tile. In less than mathrm{M}+mathrm{N} moves, the size of the largest of the given tiles will drop to 1 by 1, and a pair of such tiles will go to the second player, because both are losing. At this moment, the second player will lose.Similarly, if the initial tile was losing, then the first player will give the second at least one non-losing tile every move, and the second player can apply the winning rule every move, as a result of which in less than mathrm{M}+mathrm{N} moves a pair of tiles of size 1 by 1 will go to the first player and he will lose.Second method. Note that each tile has one of two properties. Either the tile is winning, or it is losing. A winning tile is one that can be broken in such a way that regardless of the opponent's actions, it will lead to the victory of the one breaking the tile. A losing tile is one where any break leads to a loss. A winning tile can be broken into two losing ones. Accordingly, when breaking a losing tile, at least one of the tiles will be winning.Let's start looking for winning tiles. Suppose a tile has the form 1 times m. Consider winning positions. The tile 1 times 1 is losing, 1 times 2 is winning, 1 times 3 is losing, 1 times 4 can be broken into 1 times 1 and 1 times 3 and the breaker wins. If the tile 1 times m is losing, then the tile 1 times(m+1) is winning, since it can be broken into pieces 1 times m and 1 times 1. Let 1 times m be a winning tile. Up to m, winning and losing tiles alternated, so all winning tiles have an even number of squares, and m is even, while m+1 is odd. But an odd number cannot be split into the sum of two odd numbers, so m+1 cannot be broken into two losing tiles, meaning it is losing.Note that for the case (2 l+1) times 2 k the same strategy works as for the case 1 times 2 k. Break off a piece from the side 2 k. The second player will receive tiles (2 l+1) times 1 and (2 l+1) times (2 k-1). The first is losing, so he breaks the second, but after any break at least one tile will have an even side. The first player chooses this one and repeats the actions. Thus, on the one hand, he can always make a move described by the strategy, and on the other hand, he will never receive two tiles 1 times 1 since they both have odd sides. Incidentally, we have proven that all tiles of the form (2 k+1) times(2 l+1) are losing.Now consider the case when both sides are even. Suppose a tile of size n times m is winning (losing). Then a tile 2 n times 2 m is also winning (losing).We will prove this statement by induction on (m+n). Base cases m+n=2 and m+n=3: tiles (1,1) and (2,2) are losing (case m+n=2), while tiles (1,2) and (2,4) are winning.Inductive hypothesis: suppose the statement is true for all m+n leq k. Prove for m+n=k+1.First consider the case of a winning tile. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the first winning move for the tile (n times m) is to cut off a piece of size x from the side n. In this case, the tile is divided into parts x times m and (n-x) times m and both tiles are losing. In the new tile, cut off a piece of size 2 x from 2 n, the tile will be divided into parts of size 2 x times 2 m and 2(n-x) times 2 m which are proportional to x times m and (n-x) times m respectively, and therefore by the inductive hypothesis have the same outcomes. Tiles x times m and (n-x) times m are losing, so tiles 2 x times 2 m and 2(n-x) times 2 m are also losing.Now consider the case of a losing tile. Then for any break of the tile m times n, one of the tiles in the pair will be winning. Suppose the first player divides the new tile into parts x times 2 m and (2 n-x) times 2 m. Then either x is even and x=2 x_{0}, or x is odd. In the first case, the resulting tiles have both sides even. By the inductive hypothesis, their outcomes are the same as in the case of x_{0} times m and left(n-x_{0}right) times m. Tiles x_{0} times m and left(n-x_{0}right) times m are obtained by cutting off a part x_{0} from the tile n times m. The tile n times m is losing, so one of the tiles x_{0} times m and left(n-x_{0}right) times m is winning. In the second case, two tiles of the form (2 k+1) times 2 m are obtained, both of which are winning. The inductive step is proven.Suppose the first player receives a tile of size 2^{k_{1}} n times 2^{k_{2}} m, where k_{1} leq k_{2} and the numbers m, n are odd. The outcome of the game with such a tile is the same as the outcome of the game with a tile n times 2^{k_{1}-k_{2}} m. The outcome for a tile with one odd side is determined by the parity of the second side. Accordingly, if k_{1}=k_{2}, the first player will lose. In other cases, the first player wins."},{"problem":"6. Given triangle A B C.

Quadrilateral MBKE consists of triangles MBK and MKE, while quadrilateral AEC D consists of triangles AEC and ACD. We can reason in different ways.1st method. Triangles MBK and ACD are right-angled, and the legs of the first are half the length of the legs of the second, so they are similar, and the area of triangle ACD is 4 times the area of triangle MBK.Since M and K are the midpoints of AB and BC respectively, MK is the midline of triangle ABC, so MK parallel AC and MK = 0.5 AC. From the parallelism of lines MK and AC, it follows that triangles MKE and AEC are similar, and since the similarity coefficient is 0.5, the area of triangle AEC is 4 times the area of triangle MKE.Now: S_{AEC D} = S_{AEC} + S_{ACD} = 4 S_{MKE} + 4 S_{MBK} = 4 (S_{MKE} + S_{MBK}) = 4 S_{MBKE}.2nd method. Let the area of rectangle ABCD be S. Then the area of triangle ACD is frac{1}{2} S (the diagonal of the rectangle divides it into two equal triangles), and the area of triangle MBK is frac{1}{2} MB cdot BK = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} AB cdot frac{1}{2} BC = frac{1}{8} AB cdot BC = frac{1}{8} S.Since M and K are the midpoints of segments AB and BC, AK and CM are medians of triangle ABC, so E is the centroid of triangle ABC, i.e., the distance from E to AC is frac{1}{3} h, where h is the height of triangle ABC from vertex B. Then the area of triangle AEC is frac{1}{2} AC left(frac{1}{3} hright) = frac{1}{3} left(frac{1}{2} AC hright) = frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} = frac{1}{3} left(frac{1}{2} Sright) = frac{1}{6} S. Therefore, for the area of quadrilateral AEC D, which is the sum of the areas of triangles AEC and ACD, we get: frac{1}{2} S + frac{1}{6} S = frac{2}{3} S.Furthermore, since MK is the midline of triangle ABC, the area of triangle MKE is frac{1}{2} MK cdot left(frac{1}{2} h - frac{1}{3} hright) = frac{1}{2} left(frac{1}{2} ACright) left(frac{1}{6} hright) = frac{1}{12} left(frac{1}{2} AC hright) = frac{1}{12} S_{ACD} = frac{1}{24} S. Therefore, for the area of quadrilateral MBKE, which is the sum of the areas of triangles MBK and MKE, we get: frac{1}{8} S + frac{1}{24} S = frac{1}{6} S.Thus, the ratio of the areas of quadrilaterals AEC D and MBKE is frac{2}{3} S : left(frac{1}{6} Sright) = 4.Grading criteria.- Correct solution and correct answer - 7 points.- Correct solution, but incorrect answer due to an arithmetic error - 5 points."},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, points A (-4, -2), B (0, -2), and point C is on the positive x-axis.

We have f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(2x^3 - 6x^2 + aright) = 6x^2 - 12x. Setting the derivative equal to zero will give us the potential extremal points: f'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x = 0, which simplifies to x(x - 2) = 0. Thus, the critical points are x = 0 and x = 2. However, we note that x = 2 is at the boundary of the interval and does not necessarily correspond to an extremum inside it.The function's increasing and decreasing behavior can be deduced from the sign of the derivative. The derivative is nonnegative (f'(x) geq 0) for x geq 2 or x leq 0. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (-infty, 0] and [2, +infty), but it is decreasing on [0, 2] because f'(x) would be less or equal to zero in that interval.Since we are given that the function has a maximum value when x in [-2, 2], and knowing the increasing and decreasing behavior of the function, we can conclude:- f(x) is increasing on [-2, 0].- f(x) is decreasing on [0, 2].The maximum value of f(x) is given to be 3, which is reached at x = 0. Therefore, f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 3.

Since f(-2) = -37 < f(2) = -5, the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [-2, 2] is f(-2) = -37.Hence, the range of the function f(x) on the interval [-2, 2] is [-37, 3]. boxed{A} "},{"problem":"2.

Find the product of the radii of these three spheres.Answer: 26.25Solution. Let the three spheres touch the plane and each other. We need to find the relationship between the product of the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the points of tangency of the spheres with the plane and the product of the radii of the spheres.Let O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c} be the centers of the spheres, their radii r_{A}, r_{B}, r_{C}, and they touch the plane at points A, B, C with A B=c, B C=a, C A=b. The points A B O_{B} O_{A} form a right trapezoid with sides A B=c, B O_{B}=r_{B}, A O_{A}=r_{A}, O_{B} O_{A}=r_{A}+r_{B}, the bases of which are B O_{B} and A O_{A}, and B O_{B} perp A B, A O_{A} perp A B. Let, for definiteness, r_{B} geqslant r_{A}. Draw a perpendicular from O_{A} to the side B O_{B}, denoted as O_{A} D. The points A O_{A} D B form a rectangle, and O_{A} D=A B=c. O_{B} D=r_{B}-r_{A}, and for the right triangle O_{A} D O_{B}, we can write the Pythagorean theorem: c^{2}=left(r_{A}+r_{B}right)^{2}-left(r_{A}-r_{B}right)^{2}, and thus, c=2 sqrt{r_{A} r_{B}}.

Identify and use given angles:   - Given that ( angle BEA = 45^circ ), we also have ( angle BEI = 45^circ ) because ( E ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle B ).3. Establish congruence of triangles:   - Since ( angle AEB = angle BEI = 45^circ ) and ( angle ABE = angle EBI ) (as ( E ) is on the angle bisector), triangles ( triangle AEB ) and ( triangle IEB ) are congruent by the Angle-Angle (AA) criterion.4. Determine equal segments:   - From the congruence ( triangle AEB cong triangle IEB ), it follows that ( AE = EI ).5. Calculate angles in the cyclic quadrilateral:   - Since ( AE = EI ), ( triangle AEI ) is isosceles with ( angle EAI = angle AIE = 45^circ ).   - Since ( angle AHI = 90^circ ) (as ( H ) is the foot of the altitude from ( A )), points ( A, E, I, H ) are concyclic (they lie on the same circle).6. Use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to ( 180^circ ). Therefore, ( angle EAI = angle EHI ).   - Given ( angle EAI = 45^circ ), it follows that ( angle EHI = 45^circ ).7.

We will assume that the (2 times 3) rectangles can be oriented either horizontally or vertically.1. Understanding the Tiling Pattern:   - Consider a (2 times 3) rectangle. Since it contains exactly two red squares, there are several possible configurations. However, the key is to find a repeating pattern that satisfies the condition for all (2 times 3) rectangles.   - One possible pattern is a diagonal arrangement where red squares are placed in a way that every (2 times 3) rectangle contains exactly two red squares. For example, a (3 times 3) block can be tiled as follows:     [     begin{array}{ccc}     R & X & X      X & R & X      X & X & R      end{array}     ]   - This pattern can be extended to cover the entire infinite sheet.2. Extending the Pattern:   - By repeating the (3 times 3) block, we can cover any larger rectangle. For instance, a (9 times 12) rectangle can be tiled with four (3 times 3) blocks horizontally and three (3 times 3) blocks vertically:     [     begin{array}{cccccccccccc}     R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X      X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X      X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R      R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X      X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X      X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R      R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X      X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X      X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R & X & X & R      end{array}     ]3. Counting Red Squares in (9 times 12) Rectangle:   - Each (3 times 3) block contains exactly 3 red squares.   - A (9 times 12) rectangle contains (3 times 4 = 12) such blocks.   - Therefore, the total number of red squares in a (9 times 12) rectangle is (12 times 3 = 36).4. Adjusting for (9 times 11) Rectangle:   - A (9 times 11) rectangle is one column short of a (9 times 12) rectangle.   - Each column in the (9 times 12) rectangle contains 3 red squares (since each (3 times 3) block contributes one red square per column).   - Removing one column from the (9 times 12) rectangle removes 3 red squares.   - Therefore, the number of red squares in a (9 times 11) rectangle is (36 - 3 = 33).The final answer is (boxed{33})."},{"problem":"Given the proposition p: exists x in [-1,2], x^{2}-2x-m gt 0 is a false proposition.

In the interval [-1,2], the maximum occurs at x=1, yielding (1-1)^{2}-1 = -1.

Consider an arbitrary black cell A that can be reached in fewer than 10 moves from the center.

For any a in S, let the number of sets in the family mathscr{A} that contain a be denoted by r(a). These r(a) sets each contain C_{6}^{2}:=15 three-element subsets that include a. On the other hand, the three-element subsets of S are contained in the sets of the family, so,15 r(a) geqslant 91, quad r(a) geqslant 7.By calculating the total number of elements in the sets of the family mathscr{A} in two ways, we see thatn times 7=sum_{a in S} r(a) geqslant 15 times 7, quad n geqslant 15.Next, we construct a specific family of sets S=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{15}right} that satisfies the conditions of the problem. First, we label the 15 elements of S={1,2, cdots, 15} in a clockwise order on the 15 equally spaced points on a circle (as shown in Figure 1).We define A_{1}={1,2,4,5,6,11,13}, and let A_{j} (for j=2,3, cdots, 15) be the 7-element subset of S obtained by rotating A_{1} clockwise by j-1 arc segments.

Analyzing the diagram of A_{1} (Figure 2), we see that there are exactly three pairs of elements for each of the distances1,2,3,4,5,6,7in the clockwise direction. Each A_{i} has the same property. Rotating A_{i} clockwise by j-i arc segments (1 leqslant j-i leqslant 7), exactly three elements of A_{i} will move to positions where the elements are still in A_{i}.

The ratio of the lengths of the major axis to the minor axis is given as 2, which means frac{a}{b} = 2. The relationship between the semi-major axis a, the semi-minor axis b, and the distance c from the center to a focus is a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Substituting c = sqrt{3} and frac{a}{b} = 2 into the equation, we can solve for a and b:- From frac{a}{b} = 2, we get a = 2b.- Substituting a = 2b into a^2 = b^2 + c^2, we get (2b)^2 = b^2 + (sqrt{3})^2.- Simplifying, 4b^2 = b^2 + 3.- Solving for b, we find b^2 = 1, so b = 1 (since b > 0).- Substituting b = 1 into a = 2b, we get a = 2.Therefore, the equation of the ellipse C is frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1.# Part (2): Finding the Equation of the Line lGiven that the line l passes through point A(1,0) and intersects the ellipse at two distinct points M and N, and given that point B(0,1) lies on the circle with diameter MN, we proceed as follows:The general equation of line l can be written as x = my + 1, where m is the slope of the line.Substituting the equation of line l into the equation of the ellipse, we get a system of equations:1. x = my + 12. frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1Eliminating x from these equations, we obtain (4 + m^2)y^2 + 2my - 3 = 0.The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation in y is Delta = 16m^2 + 48 > 0, ensuring two distinct intersections.Using Vieta's formulas, we find {y_1} + {y_2} = frac{-2m}{4 + m^2} and {y_1}{y_2} = frac{-3}{4 + m^2}.Since B lies on the circle with diameter MN, the dot product overrightarrow{BM} cdot overrightarrow{BN} = 0. Calculating the dot product, we get (m^2 + 1)y_1y_2 + (m - 1)(y_1 + y_2) + 2 = 0.Substituting the values of {y_1} + {y_2} and {y_1}{y_2} into this equation, we solve for m and find 3m^2 - 2m - 5 = 0, which gives m = -1 or m = frac{5}{3}.Therefore, the equations of the line l are x + y - 1 = 0 or 3x - 5y - 3 = 0.boxed{x + y - 1 = 0 text{ or } 3x - 5y - 3 = 0}"},{"problem":"Let M be the intersection of two diagonal, AC and BD, of a rhombus ABCD, where angle A<90^circ.

There are ______ ways to arrange them.","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:1. Arrange the Boys:    - There are 3 boys to be arranged in a line.    - The number of ways to arrange these boys is given by the permutation formula {A}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to arrange.    - Since we are arranging all 3 boys, we have n=r=3, so {A}_{3}^{3} = frac{3!}{(3-3)!} = frac{3!}{0!} = 3! = 6 ways.2. Arrange the Girls:    - The girls must be adjacent, so we can think of them as a single unit initially.    - Now, consider the arrangement of the boys as having 4 possible spaces (including the ends) to insert this unit of girls: _B_B_B_ (where B represents a boy, and _ represents a possible space for the girls).   - There are {C}_{4}^{1} = 4 ways to choose where to insert the girls.   - Once we've chosen where to insert the girls, we need to arrange the 2 girls within their unit. This can be done in {A}_{2}^{2} = 2! = 2 ways.   - Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the girls, considering them as a unit and then arranging within that unit, is {C}_{4}^{1} cdot {A}_{2}^{2} = 4 cdot 2 = 8 ways.3. Combine the Arrangements:   - By the principle of counting (multiplying the number of ways to arrange each independent part), the total number of ways to arrange the 3 boys and 2 girls with the girls being adjacent is 6 times 8 = 48 ways.Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange them is boxed{48}."},{"problem":"2.

Claim and Example:   We claim that the maximum number of terms that can be equal to 1 is 2. To illustrate this, consider the example where (a = 1), (b = 2), (c = 3), (x = 4), (y = 27), and (z = -19). In this case:   [   ax + by + cz = 1 quad text{and} quad ay + bz + cx = 1   ]   Therefore, it is possible to have two of the terms equal to 1.2. Proof by Contradiction:   We need to prove that it is impossible to have more than two terms equal to 1. Denote the expressions as follows:   [   P(1) = ax + by + cz, quad P(2) = ax + bz + cy, quad P(3) = ay + bx + cz,   ]   [   P(4) = ay + bz + cx, quad P(5) = az + bx + cy, quad P(6) = az + by + cx   ]3. Pairwise Comparison:   If (P(1) = P(2) = 1), then:   [   ax + by + cz = 1 quad text{and} quad ax + bz + cy = 1   ]   Subtracting these equations, we get:   [   by + cz = bz + cy implies b(y - z) = c(y - z)   ]   Since (y neq z) and (b neq c), this is a contradiction. Therefore, (P(1)) and (P(2)) cannot both be 1 simultaneously.4. Graph Construction:   Construct a graph with 6 vertices (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6) corresponding to (P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), P(5), P(6)). Connect (v_i) and (v_j) if and only if (P(i)) and (P(j)) can both be 1. From the pairwise comparison, we see that no two expressions sharing a common term can both be 1. This results in a graph with two disjoint triangles.5. Maximum Number of Terms Equal to 1:   From the graph, it is clear that at most 3 terms can be 1. However, we need to check if having 3 terms equal to 1 is possible.6. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: (P(1) = ax + by + cz = 1), (P(4) = ay + bz + cx = 1), (P(5) = az + bx + cy = 1)     [     begin{aligned}     ax + by + cz &= 1,      ay + bz + cx &= 1,      az + bx + cy &= 1     end{aligned}     ]     Solving these equations simultaneously, we eliminate (z) and then (y) to find (x). This results in (x = y = z = frac{1}{a+b+c}), which contradicts the given condition that (x, y, z) are pairwise different.   - Case 2: (P(2) = ax + bz + cy = 1), (P(3) = ay + bx + cz = 1), (P(6) = az + by + cx = 1)     This case is identical to the first case by swapping (y) and (z).

Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b). Immediately, we understand that O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}, O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}, and O B = |b| = -b.Let's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point D with coordinates (0 ; d) (Fig. 12). The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D. We get -x_{1} cdot x_{2} = -b cdot d, from which, replacing x_{1} cdot x_{2} with 12b by Vieta's theorem, we get d = 12.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_5b323dccc142e96a9907g-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)Fig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7It remains to note that triangle BTD is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point M, has coordinates (0 ; 3).

Since the number x is even, one of its prime divisors is 2. Therefore, we need to find all x that have exactly two odd prime divisors, one of which is 7. The remainders of the powers of 9 when divided by 7 are 2, 4, 1 and then repeat cyclically. Thus, the divisibility of x by 7 means that n is a multiple of 3, that is, x=9^{3m}-1. From this,x=p cdot q, quad text{where } p=9^{m}-1, quad q=9^{2m}+9^{m}+1Note that the numbers p and q are coprime.

If k=1, then p is divisible by 7 and 13. For k>1, we can apply the same reasoning to p as we did to x. In both cases, p will be factored into two coprime factors, neither of which is a power of 2. Therefore, x has at least three different odd prime divisors, which is impossible.2) q is divisible by 7. Note that p has an odd divisor, and q is odd and coprime with p.

The validity of this construction can also be seen from the below proof.First proof of bound. Let d_{i} be the shorter distance from A_{2 i-1} to A_{2 i+1}.Claim - The distance of the leg of the journey A_{2 i-1} rightarrow A_{2 i} rightarrow A_{2 i+1} is at most 2 n-d_{i}.Proof. Of the two arcs from A_{2 i-1} to A_{2 i+1}, Bunbun will travel either d_{i} or 2 n-d_{i}. One of those arcs contains A_{2 i} along the way. So we get a bound of max left(d_{i}, 2 n-d_{i}right)=2 n-d_{i}.That means the total distance is at mostsum_{i=1}^{n}left(2 n-d_{i}right)=2 n^{2}-left(d_{1}+d_{2}+cdots+d_{n}right) .Claim - We haved_{1}+d_{2}+cdots+d_{n} geq 2 n-2 .Proof. The left-hand side is the sum of the walk A_{1} rightarrow A_{3} rightarrow cdots rightarrow A_{2 n-1} rightarrow A_{1}. Among the n points here, two of them must have distance at least n-1 apart; the other d_{i} 's contribute at least 1 each. So the bound is (n-1)+(n-1) cdot 1=2 n-2.T Second proof of bound. Draw the n diameters through the 2 n arc midpoints, as shown on the right half of the figure for n=5 in red.Claim (Interpretation of distances) - The distance between any two points equals the number of diameters crossed to travel between the points.Proof. Clear.With this in mind, call a diameter critical if it is crossed by all 2 n arcs.Claim - At most one diameter is critical.Proof. Suppose there were two critical diameters; these divide the circle into four arcs. Then all 2 n arcs cross both diameters, and so travel between opposite arcs. But this means that points in two of the four arcs are never accessed - contradiction.Claim - Every diameter is crossed an even number of times.Proof. Clear: the diameter needs to be crossed an even number of times for the loop to return to its origin.This immediately implies that the maximum possible total distance is achieved when one diameter is crossed all 2 n times, and every other diameter is crossed 2 n-2 times, for a total distance of at mostn cdot(2 n-2)+2=2 n^{2}-2 n+2 text {. }"},{"problem":"Example 7 Given a neq b, anda^{2}-4 a+1=0, b^{2}-4 b+1=0 text {. }Find the value of frac{1}{a+1}+frac{1}{b+1}.","solution":"Solution 1: Sincefrac{1}{a+1}+frac{1}{b+1}=frac{(a+b)+2}{a b+(a+b)+1},we only need to find the values of a b and a+b.From the given conditions, a and b are the roots of the quadratic equation x^{2}-4 x+1=0, soa+b=4, a b=1 text {. }Therefore, frac{1}{a+1}+frac{1}{b+1}=frac{(a+b)+2}{a b+(a+b)+1}=frac{4+2}{1+4+1}=1 text {. }This solution has been published in many newspapers.Analysis: Although the analysis for solving the problem is quite reasonable, and it is necessary to find a+b and a b, the conclusion is entirely correct.

Consider cases with zeros:   - If ( N ) has zeros, it can be written in the form ( 3000ldots0a ) or ( a000ldots003 ), where ( a ) is a digit from 1 to 9.4. Check modulo conditions:   - For ( N ) to be a perfect square, it must satisfy certain modular conditions.   - The square residues modulo 9 are 0, 1, 4, and 7. Therefore, ( 3 + a ) must be one of these residues.   - Possible values for ( a ) are 6, 7, 1, and 4.5.

Let M be the greatest difference of the numbers in neighbouring by side cells. What is the minimal possible value of M?","solution":"To find the minimal possible value of ( M ), the greatest difference of the numbers in neighboring cells, we need to consider the movement of the rook on an ( n times n ) board. The rook can move horizontally or vertically to an adjacent cell. We aim to minimize the maximum difference between the numbers in these adjacent cells.1. Zig-Zag Pattern:   Consider a zig-zag pattern where the rook travels through the board. For an ( n times n ) board, the rook starts at the top-left corner and moves right until it reaches the end of the row, then moves down to the next row and moves left, and so on. This pattern ensures that each cell is visited exactly once.2. Numbering the Cells:   Number the cells in the order the rook visits them. For example, in a ( 3 times 3 ) board, the numbering would be:   [   begin{array}{ccc}   1 & 2 & 3    6 & 5 & 4    7 & 8 & 9    end{array}   ]3. Calculating Differences:   In this pattern, the difference between numbers in neighboring cells is either 1 (horizontal movement) or ( 2n-1 ) (vertical movement between rows). For example, in the ( 3 times 3 ) board:   - Horizontal differences: ( |2-1| = 1 ), ( |3-2| = 1 ), ( |5-6| = 1 ), etc.   - Vertical differences: ( |6-3| = 3 ), ( |7-6| = 1 ), etc.4. Generalizing for ( n times n ) Board:   For an ( n times n ) board, the maximum difference in the zig-zag pattern occurs when moving from the end of one row to the start of the next row. This difference is ( 2n-1 ).5. Proof of Minimality:   To prove that ( 2n-1 ) is the minimal possible value of ( M ), consider any other pattern of movement. Any pattern must visit each cell exactly once, and the maximum difference will always be at least ( 2n-1 ) due to the need to transition between rows. Therefore, the zig-zag pattern provides the minimal possible value of ( M ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 2n-1 } )."},{"problem":"Simplify first, then evaluate: (a-frac{{a}^{2}}{a+1})÷frac{{a}^{2}}{{a}^{2}-1}, where a=2cos 60^{circ}+1.","solution":"To simplify and then evaluate the given expression (a-frac{{a}^{2}}{a+1})÷frac{{a}^{2}}{{a}^{2}-1} with a=2cos 60^{circ}+1, we follow these steps:1.

The midpoint formula tells us that the coordinates of M are the averages of the coordinates of A and B. Given M(2,2), we can set up equations based on the midpoint formula and the equation of the parabola to find the coordinates of A and B. However, the specific coordinates of A and B are not necessary for finding the area of triangle ABF.The key is to notice that the line segment AB is perpendicular to the axis of the parabola (the x-axis) because the parabola is symmetric and M lies on the axis of symmetry of the parabola. Therefore, the triangle triangle ABF is a right triangle with AB as its hypotenuse.The distance from F to the directrix of the parabola is 1 (since the focus is at (1,0) and the directrix is x = -1). The point M is 2 units away from the focus along the x-axis, so the length of the perpendicular from F to AB (which is the height of triangle ABF) is also 2 units because it lies on the parabola's axis of symmetry.Using the distance formula or properties of the parabola, we can find that the length of AB is 4 units. Therefore, the area of triangle ABF can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}.Substituting the known values, we get the area of triangle ABF as frac{1}{2} times 4 times 2 = 4.

Base Case:   - For ( n = 1 ), we need a single stick of length 1. The minimal total length required is ( 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 ). This is trivially satisfied.2. Inductive Hypothesis:   - Assume that for any ( k leq n ), if we have ( k ) sticks with a total length of ( k^2 - k + 1 ), we can split them to obtain sticks of lengths ( 1, 2, ldots, k ).3. Inductive Step:   - We need to show that for ( k+1 ) sticks with a total length of ( (k+1)^2 - (k+1) + 1 = k^2 + k + 1 ), we can split them to obtain sticks of lengths ( 1, 2, ldots, k+1 ).4. Case Analysis:   - If there is a stick of length exactly ( k+1 ), we can use it directly. The remaining ( k ) sticks must have a total length of ( k^2 ), which by the inductive hypothesis can be split into lengths ( 1, 2, ldots, k ).   - If no stick has length exactly ( k+1 ), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be a stick of length ( ell > k+1 ). Let this stick be the longest one.5. Splitting the Longest Stick:   - Remove a section of length ( k+1 ) from the stick of length ( ell ). This leaves a stick of length ( ell - (k+1) ).   - The total length of the remaining ( k ) sticks is ( k^2 + k + 1 - (k+1) = k^2 ).6.

Since 3 is not there and 0 cannot be the first digit, we can fill the first digit in 8 ways. But we can fill the second and third digits in 9 ways(as 0 can be included).

This aligns with the basic principles of probability, where the outcomes are distinct and cover all possibilities in the given scenario.- Statement C: Saying \\"The probability of winning a lottery is 1%\\" indicates there is a 1% chance of winning for each ticket purchased.

Past performance can indicate a trend but does not ensure future results, especially without considering other variables that might affect the outcome.Given these analyses, the only statement that correctly reflects an understanding of probability and real-world scenarios without misinterpretation is Statement B. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:boxed{text{B}}Explanation: This solution breaks down each option to highlight the understanding or misunderstanding of probability concepts. Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring, not the duration of the event or guaranteed outcomes based on past events or a specific number of attempts. Comments: This question and its solution emphasize the importance of correctly interpreting probability statements and distinguishing between the likelihood of events and deterministic outcomes."},{"problem":"6 Let n be a positive integer, and 3 n+1 and 5 n-1 are both perfect squares.

Reduce the fraction: First, we reduce the fraction frac{39}{1428}. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 39 and 1428, which is 3. Thus, we can simplify the fraction as follows:   [   frac{39}{1428} = frac{39 div 3}{1428 div 3} = frac{13}{476}   ]2. Factorize the denominator: Next, we factorize the denominator 476. We have:   [   476 = 4 times 119 = 2^2 times 119   ]   This means that the binary expansion of frac{13}{476} will be the same as frac{13}{119} but shifted two digits to the right.3. Find the period of frac{13}{119}: To find the period of the binary expansion of frac{13}{119}, we need to determine the smallest integer k such that:   [   2^k equiv 1 pmod{119}   ]   This is because the period of the repetend in the binary expansion is related to the order of 2 modulo 119.4. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem: Since 119 = 7 times 17, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the order of 2 modulo 119 by finding the orders modulo 7 and 17 separately.5. Order of 2 modulo 7: We need to find the smallest k such that:   [   2^k equiv 1 pmod{7}   ]   By testing values, we find:   [   2^1 equiv 2 pmod{7}, quad 2^2 equiv 4 pmod{7}, quad 2^3 equiv 1 pmod{7}   ]   Thus, the order of 2 modulo 7 is 3.6. Order of 2 modulo 17: We need to find the smallest k such that:   [   2^k equiv 1 pmod{17}   ]   By testing values, we find:   [   2^1 equiv 2 pmod{17}, quad 2^2 equiv 4 pmod{17}, quad 2^4 equiv 16 equiv -1 pmod{17}, quad 2^8 equiv 1 pmod{17}   ]   Thus, the order of 2 modulo 17 is 8.7. Combine the orders: The order of 2 modulo 119 is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders modulo 7 and 17:   [   text{LCM}(3, 8) = 24   ]   Therefore, the period of the repetend of the binary expansion of frac{13}{119} is 24.8.

From the equality of triangles triangle A E_{1} A_{1} and Delta C E_{2021} C_{1} by side and the adjacent angles, it follows that C E_{2021}=A E_{1}.
