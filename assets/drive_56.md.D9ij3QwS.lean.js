This leads to:(2cos frac {C}{2}, -sin C) cdot  (cos frac {C}{2}, 2sin C) = 2cos^2 frac {C}{2} - 2sin^2C = 0.Hence,2cos^2 frac {C}{2} - 4sin^2 frac {C}{2} cos^2 frac {C}{2} = 0.Since sin^2 frac {C}{2} + cos^2 frac {C}{2} = 1, we have:sin^2 frac {C}{2} = frac {1}{4}.Therefore, using the identity cos C = 1 - 2sin^2 frac{C}{2}, we get:cos C = 1 - 2sin^2 frac {C}{2} = 1 - 2 cdot frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2}. As C is in the interval (0, pi), we can deduce:C = frac {pi}{3}.

We will work backwards from the longest possible sequence to determine the initial input that produces this sequence.1. Identify the machine's behavior:   - If the input is an even number ( n ), the output is ( n/2 ).   - If the input is an odd number ( m ), the output is ( m + 3 ).2.

On the left side of the equation, we can recognize the square of (x-y). Thus, we getx^{2}-2 x y+2 y^{2}-4 y^{3}=(x-y)^{2}+y^{2}(1-4 y)=0or after rearrangement(x-y)^{2}=y^{2}(4 y-1)If y=0, then the right side of (1) is zero, so x=0. We will show that the equation has no other solution.If y neq 0, then since y is an integer, 4 y-1 is also not zero. Thus, according to (1), the product on the right side, y^{2}(4 y-1), is a non-zero perfect square. One of the factors, y^{2}, is itself a perfect square, so the product can only be a perfect square if the second factor, 4 y-1=4(y-1)+3, is also a perfect square. This, however, is impossible, since perfect squares give a remainder of 0 or 1 when divided by 4.Therefore, the only solution to the equation is x=y=0.II. solution. From the equation, we getbegin{gathered}x^{2}=2 x y-2 y^{2}+4 y^{3}, text { and } 2 y^{2}=2 x y-x^{2}+4 y^{3}end{gathered}From (2a), it is clear that x is even, so the right side of (2b) is divisible by 4. Thus, y^{2} is also even, and therefore divisible by 4. From (2a) again, it then follows that 8 mid x^{2}, which can only be true if 4 mid x. The reasoning can be continued, and we get that both x and y are divisible by any positive integer power of 2, which can only be true if x and y are both zero.The above reasoning is merely an outline. The \\"continuability\\" of what is said must be proven in a real proof, as this is the key to the solution. It can be proven by induction; we do not detail this here, instead, we take a seemingly different path.If either x or y is not zero, let d be the largest exponent for which 2^{d} divides both x and y. Then, according to (2a), x^{2} is divisible by 2^{2 d+1}, and since in the factorization of a perfect square, every prime number appears with an even exponent, x^{2} is also divisible by 2^{2 d+2}, so x is divisible by 2^{d+1}.Using this in (2b), we get that 2 y^{2} is divisible by 2^{2 d+2}, i.e., y^{2} is divisible by 2^{2 d+1}. This, however, is a contradiction, since by our assumption, 2^{d} was the largest power of 2 by which both x and y are divisible.The contradiction implies that neither x nor y can be non-zero. The pair (0,0) is clearly a solution, so we have solved the problem.Remarks. 1. Both solutions used the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that positive integers can be uniquely expressed as a product of primes.2. In the second solution, we showed that if x and y are divisible by 2^{d}, then they are also divisible by 2^{d+1}. Since every integer is divisible by 2^{0}=1, this is essentially the induction proof mentioned."},{"problem":"In a set of 5 questions, there are 3 science questions and 2 arts questions.

Find all possible values of number of divisors of 2p^2+2p+1.","solution":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of divisors of (2p^2 + 2p + 1) given that (frac{28^p - 1}{2p^2 + 2p + 1}) is an integer for a prime number (p).1. Identify the divisors of (2p^2 + 2p + 1):   Let (q) be a prime divisor of (2p^2 + 2p + 1). Since (q) divides (2p^2 + 2p + 1), it must also divide (28^p - 1). This is because (frac{28^p - 1}{2p^2 + 2p + 1}) is an integer.2. Properties of (q):   Since (q) divides (28^p - 1), by Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:   [   28^{q-1} equiv 1 pmod{q}   ]   This implies that the order of 28 modulo (q), denoted as (text{ord}_q(28)), must divide both (q-1) and (p). Therefore, (text{ord}_q(28)) can be either 1 or (p).3. Order of 28 modulo (q):   - If (text{ord}_q(28) = 1), then (28 equiv 1 pmod{q}), which implies (q) divides (27). The prime divisors of 27 are 3. However, if (q = 3), then (2p^2 + 2p + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}), which is not possible for any prime (p). Hence, (text{ord}_q(28) neq 1).   - Therefore, (text{ord}_q(28) = p), and (p) must divide (q-1). This implies (q geq p + 1).4. Bounding the number of prime divisors:   Suppose (2p^2 + 2p + 1) has more than 3 distinct prime divisors. Let (q_1, q_2, ldots, q_k) be the distinct prime divisors. Then:   [   2p^2 + 2p + 1 geq (p+1)^3   ]   However, this inequality does not hold for any prime (p), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, (2p^2 + 2p + 1) can have at most 3 distinct prime divisors.5. Possible cases for the number of divisors:   - If (2p^2 + 2p + 1 = q), where (q) is a prime, then the number of divisors is 2.   - If (2p^2 + 2p + 1 = q^2), where (q) is a prime, then:     [     2p^2 + 2p + 1 = (pk + 1)^2 = p^2k^2 + 2pk + 1     ]     This simplifies to:     [     2p + 2 = pk^2 + 2k     ]     Solving for (k), we find that (k = 1) leads to a contradiction. Hence, this case is not possible.   - If (2p^2 + 2p + 1 = qr), where (q) and (r) are distinct primes, then:     [     2p^2 + 2p + 1 = (pk + 1)(pm + 1) = p^2mk + p(m + k) + 1     ]     This simplifies to:     [     2p + 2 = pmk + m + k     ]     Since (m) and (k) are distinct, this also leads to a contradiction.Therefore, the only possible value for the number of divisors of (2p^2 + 2p + 1) is 2.The final answer is (boxed{2})"},{"problem":"2.

Due to divisibility by 5, the last digit of the number N can be either 5 or 0. If the last digit is 0, without changing the sum of the digits, we can replace 0 with 5 and subtract one from each of the five non-zero digits in other positions. Then we get a smaller number that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Next, if any digit of N between the first and last is not a nine, then by increasing it by one and decreasing the digit in the higher position by one, we again get a smaller number. Thus, all digits of N except the first and last are nines (say, n of them), and the last one is a five. The first digit x is found from the condition for the sum of the digits: x+9n+5=100, i.e., 9n=95-x. Obviously, the digit x for the divisibility of the right side by 9 is uniquely determined: x=5.

Assume the identity holds for some k in mathbb{N}, i.e.,f(x + k g(x)) equiv x + (k+1) g(x).This implies f^{-1}(x + (k+1) g(x)) equiv x + k g(x). By the given condition, for all x in mathbb{R}, we havebegin{aligned}f(x + (k+1) g(x)) equiv & 2(x + (k+1) g(x)) - f^{-1}(x + (k+1) g(x)) equiv & 2(x + (k+1) g(x)) - (x + k g(x)) equiv & x + (k+2) g(x).end{aligned}Thus, the identity also holds for k+1. This also implies that for all k in mathbb{N}, the identityf^{-1}(x + k g(x)) equiv x + (k-1) g(x), quad x in mathbb{R},holds.Similarly, we can prove that for all k in mathbb{Z}^{+}, we havef^{-1}(x - (k-1) g(x)) equiv x - k g(x), quad x in mathbb{R}.This leads to, for all k in mathbb{N}, the identityf(x - k g(x)) equiv x - (k-1) g(x), quad x in mathbb{R}.Next, note that the function f(x) + f^{-1}(x) equiv 2x is strictly increasing. Since f(x) is monotonic and invertible, f(x) is strictly monotonic. Since f(x) and f^{-1}(x) are either both increasing or both decreasing, f(x) is strictly increasing. Therefore, when k is a non-zero integer, f^{k}(x) is also strictly increasing. Finally,we prove that g(x) is a constant function.

This statement is a fundamental theorem in geometry. When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of opposite (vertical) angles that are congruent. Therefore, this proposition is true, which means A cannot be the false proposition we are looking for.- Proposition B: Corresponding angles are equal. This statement is generally true for parallel lines cut by a transversal, where corresponding angles are indeed equal. However, the proposition as stated does not specify the condition of parallelism, making it misleading or false in a general context. Thus, B is identified as the proposition that does not hold universally without the specific condition of parallel lines, making it the false proposition among the options provided.- Proposition C: The perpendicular segment connecting a point outside a straight line with all points on the line is the shortest. This is a true geometric principle. Among all the segments connecting a given point to a line, the perpendicular segment is the shortest. This proposition is based on the Pythagorean theorem and the properties of triangles, confirming its truthfulness. Therefore, C does not meet the criteria for being the false proposition.- Proposition D: In the same plane, there is one and only one line passing through a point that is perpendicular to a given line. This is a basic postulate in geometry that supports the uniqueness of perpendicular lines in a plane. For any given line and a point not on that line, there exists a unique line through the point that is perpendicular to the initial line. This proposition is true, indicating that D is not the false proposition we seek.Given the analysis above, we conclude that the false proposition among the options is:boxed{B}"},{"problem":"7.

Each team plays every other team exactly once. A win gives two points, a draw one point and a defeat no points. After the tournament, it turns out that each team has won exactly half of its points in the games against the 10 worst teams (in particular, each of these 10 teams has scored half of its points against the 9 remaining teams). Determine all possible values of n, and give an example of such a tournament for these values.## 1st solutionWe call the 10 worst teams the losers, the n-10 best teams the winners. We repeatedly use the following fact: If k teams play against each other, then the total number of points won is exactly k(k-1). We count the total number of points won in two ways. On the one hand, this is exactly n(n-1). On the other hand, the 10 losers in the games among themselves receive exactly 10 cdot 9=90 points. By assumption, this is exactly half of the total number of points that these 10 teams have achieved. Consequently, the total number of points scored by the losers is 180. The n-10 winners scored a total of (n-10)(n-11) points in the games among themselves. Again, this is half of the total number of points, the latter is therefore equal to 2(n-10)(n-11). A comparison yields the equationn(n-1)=180+2(n-10)(n-11)This is equivalent to n^{2}-41 n+400=0 and has the solutions n=16 and n=25.According to the above calculations, it also follows that the average score of the n-10 winners is equal to 2( n-11), the average score of the 10 losers is equal to 18.Of course, 2(n-10) geq 18 must now apply, i.e. n geq 20. Consequently, n=16 is not possible.Finally, we show that such a tournament exists for n=25. The 10 losers always play to a draw among themselves, as do the n-10 winners among themselves. The following diagram shows the games of the 15 winners G_{i} against the 10 losers V_{j}. Where 2 means a win for G_{i}, 0 a win for V_{j} and 1 a draw.| | G_{1} | G_{2} | G_{3} | G_{4} | G_{5} | G_{6} | G_{7} | G_{8} | G_{9} | G_{10} | G_{11} | G_{12} | G_{13} | G_{14} | G_{15} || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || V_{1} | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 || V_{2} | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 || V_{3} | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 || V_{4} | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 || V_{5} | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 || V_{6} | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 || V_{7} | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 || V_{8} | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 || V_{9} | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 || V_{10} | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |In total, the final score of each winner is 28, of which exactly 14 points come from games against the losers. Each loser has a final score of 18, half of which again comes from games against the other losers. This shows everything.## 2nd solutionHere is another example of such a tournament. Again, the losers and the winners play each other to a draw. Now assume that a winner never loses to a loser. A winner scores a total of 14 points against the other winners, so he must also score 14 points against the losers. To do this, he must win four times and draw six times. Similarly, each loser draws nine times.

Call a positive integer a hussel number if:(1) All digits are not equal to 0.(2) The number is divisible by 11.(3) The number is divisible by 12. If you rearrange the digits in any other random order, you always get a number that is divisible by 12.How many 10-digit hussel numbers are there?","solution":"## 1. Version for Grade 5 & Grade 6To begin with, we note that a hussel number can only contain the digits 2, 4, 6, and 8. Indeed, if we arrange the digits in any random order, we get an even number (divisible by 12) due to property (3). Since the last digit of an even number is always even, it must be 2, 4, 6, or 8 because 0 is not included due to property (1). Since we can place any digit at the end, this applies to every digit of a hussel number.Next, we note that a hussel number can only contain the digits 4 and 8. Suppose a hussel number has the digit 2. By suitably rearranging the digits, we get a number where the last digit is 2. The last two digits of this number are then 22, 42, 62, or 82. The number is then not divisible by 4 (and thus not divisible by 12), contradicting property (3). Similarly, a hussel number cannot have the digit 6 because a number ending in 26, 46, 66, or 86 is not divisible by 4.Since a hussel number is divisible by 3 (because it is divisible by 12), the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. If we have ( k ) eights and ( 10 - k ) fours, then the sum of the digits is ( 8k + 4(10 - k) = 40 + 4k = 36 + 4(k + 1) ). This is divisible by 3 if ( k + 1 ) is divisible by 3, i.e., if ( k = 2 ), ( k = 5 ), or ( k = 8 ). We see that a hussel number of ten digits must consist of 2 eights and 8 fours, 5 eights and 5 fours, or 8 eights and 2 fours. Note that these numbers all satisfy properties (1) and (3). We only need to check which of these numbers are divisible by 11 (property (2)).We use the 11-criterion: a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. By alternating sum, we mean that we take the digits alternately with a plus sign and a minus sign. In our case, all digits are either 4 or 8, so the alternating sum must be divisible by ( 4 times 11 = 44 ). Since the alternating sum can never be greater than ( 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 = 20 ) (and never less than -20), the alternating sum must be 0. In other words, the sum of the five digits in the odd positions must be equal to the sum of the five digits in the even positions. This means that the number of eights in the odd positions must be equal to the number of eights in the even positions. We consider the three cases we previously distinguished:- Suppose there are 2 eights in total. The only requirement now is that there is exactly 1 eight in an odd position and 1 eight in an even position. There are thus ( 5 times 5 = 25 ) possibilities.- Suppose there are 5 eights in total. Since we cannot divide the eights into two equal quantities, there are no solutions in this case.- Suppose there are 8 eights in total. The only requirement now is that there are exactly 4 eights in the odd positions and 4 eights in the even positions. In other words, 1 odd position is a four and 1 even position is a four. There are again ( 5 times 5 = 25 ) possibilities.We conclude that there are a total of ( 25 + 25 = 50 ) ten-digit hussel numbers."},{"problem":"2. A river has a constant flow rate of 3 km per hour.

The square must be small enough to fit into the hole and big enough to stick. The sticking condition is easy. Inscribe a circle in the hexagon. If the square will fit into the circle, then it obviously does not stick. So we require the diagonal of the square to be > √3, or s > √(3/2). On the other hand if the diagonal exceeds √3, then it obviously does stick because the parallel opposite sides of the hexagon are only a distance √3 apart. It seems fairly clear that the maximum square has sides parallel to a pair of opposite sides and each vertex a distance x from on endpoint of those sides.

It so happens that, when two socks are selected randomly without replacement, there is a probability of exactly frac{1}{2} that both are red or both are blue. What is the largest possible number of red socks in the drawer that is consistent with this data?","solution":"Solution 1Let r and b denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively. Also, let t=r+b. The probability P that when two socks are drawn randomly, without replacement, both are red or both are blue is given by[frac{r(r-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}+frac{b(b-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}=frac{r(r-1)+(t-r)(t-r-1)}{t(t-1)}=frac{1}{2}.]Solving the resulting quadratic equation r^{2}-rt+t(t-1)/4=0, for r in terms of t, one obtains that [r=frac{tpmsqrt{t}}{2}, .]Now, since r and t are positive integers, it must be the case that t=n^{2}, with ninmathbb{N}. Hence, r=n(npm 1)/2 would correspond to the general solution. For the present case tleq 1991, and so one easily finds that n=44 is the largest possible integer satisfying the problem conditions. In summary, the solution is that the maximum number of red socks is r=boxed{990}.Solution 2Let r and b denote the number of red and blue socks such that r+ble1991. Then by complementary counting, the number of ways to get a red and a blue sock must be equal to 1-frac12=frac12=frac{2rb}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}implies4rb=(r+b)(r+b-1)=(r+b)^2-(r+b)implies r^2+2rb+b^2-r-b=4rbimplies r^2-2rb+b^2=(r-b)^2=r+b, so r+b must be a perfect square k^2. Clearly, r=frac{k^2+k}2, so the larger k, the larger r: k^2=44^2 is the largest perfect square below 1991, and our answer is frac{44^2+44}2=frac12cdot44(44+1)=22cdot45=11cdot90=boxed{990}.Solution 3Let r and b denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively. In addition, let t = r + b, the total number of socks in the drawer.From the problem, it is clear that frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)} + frac{b(b-1)}{t(t-1)} = frac{1}{2}Expanding, we get frac{r^2 + b^2 - r - b}{t^2 - t} = frac{1}{2}Substituting t for r + b and cross multiplying, we get 2r^2 + 2b^2 - 2r - 2b = r^2 + 2br + b^2 - r - bCombining terms, we get b^2 - 2br + r^2 - b - r = 0To make this expression factorable, we add 2r to both sides, resulting in (b - r)^2 - 1(b-r) = (b - r - 1)(b - r) = 2rFrom this equation, we can test values for the expression (b - r - 1)(b - r), which is the multiplication of two consecutive integers, until we find the highest value of b or r such that b + r leq 1991. By testing (b - r - 1) = 43 and (b - r) = 44, we get that r = 43(22) = 946 and b = 990. Testing values one integer higher, we get that r = 990 and b = 1035. Since 990 + 1035 = 2025 is greater than 1991, we conclude that (946, 990) is our answer. Since it doesn't matter whether the number of blue or red socks is 990, we take the lower value for r, thus the maximum number of red socks is r=boxed{990}.Solution 4As above, let r, b, and t denote the number of red socks, the number of blue socks, and the total number of socks, respectively. We see that frac{r(r-1)}{t(t-1)}+frac{b(b-1)}{t(t-1)}=frac{1}{2}, so r^2+b^2-r-b=frac{t(t-1)}{2}=r^2+b^2-t=frac{t^2}{2}-frac{t}{2}. Seeing that we can rewrite r^2+b^2 as (r+b)^2-2rb, and remembering that r+b=t, we have frac{t^2}{2}-frac{t}{2}=t^2-2rb-t, so 2rb=frac{t^2}{2}-frac{t}{2}, which equals r^2+b^2-t.We now have r^2+b^2-t=2rb, so r^2-2rb+b^2=t and r-b=pmsqrt{t}. Adding this to r+b=t, we have 2r=tpmsqrt{t}. To maximize r, we must use the positive square root and maximize t. The largest possible value of t is the largest perfect square less than 1991, which is 1936=44^2. Therefore, r=frac{t+sqrt{t}}{2}=frac{1936+44}{2}=boxed{990}.Solution by ZeromanSolution 5Let r be the number of socks that are red, and t be the total number of socks. We get:2(r(r-1)+(t-r)(t-r-1))=t(t-1)Expanding the left hand side and the right hand side, we get:4r^2-4rt+2t^2-2t = t^2-tAnd, moving terms, we will get that:4r^2-4rt+t^2 = tWe notice that the left side is a perfect square. (2r-t)^2 = tThus t is a perfect square. And, the higher t is, the higher r will be. So, we should set t = 44^2 = 1936And, we see, 2r-1936 = pm44 We will use the positive root, to get that 2r-1936 = 44, 2r = 1980, and r = boxed{990}.- AlexLikeMath"},{"problem":"If a and b are nonzero real numbers such that left| a right| ne left| b right|, compute the value of the expression[  left( frac{b^2}{a^2} + frac{a^2}{b^2} - 2 right) times  left( frac{a + b}{b - a} + frac{b - a}{a + b} right) times  left(     frac{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2}}{frac{1}{b^2} - frac{1}{a^2}}      - frac{frac{1}{b^2} - frac{1}{a^2}}{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2}}  right).]","solution":"1.

In table tennis matches, each game is played to 11 points, with one point awarded for each winning shot. In a game, one side serves two balls first, followed by the other side serving two balls, and the service alternates every two balls. The winner of a game is the first side to reach 11 points with a lead of at least 2 points. If the score is tied at 10-10, the service order remains the same, but the service alternates after each point until one side wins by a margin of 2 points. In a singles table tennis match between players A and B, assuming player A serves first, the probability of player A scoring when serving is frac{2}{3}, and the probability of player A scoring when player B serves is frac{1}{2}.

If player A scores 3 points after the first 4 balls, it implies one lost point which could occur during A's serve or B's serve. - The probability of losing a point while A serves and winning the other three points (two of which are during B's serve) is calculated as follows:    {C}_{2}^{1}×frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{3}×left(frac{1}{2}right)^2    This accounts for choosing 1 serve out of 2 where A loses and calculating the probability of this event alongside the probability of winning 2 points during B's serves.- Similarly, the probability of winning both points during A's serve and splitting the outcomes (one win and one loss) during B's serve is:    left(frac{2}{3}right)^2×{C}_{2}^{1}×frac{1}{2}×frac{1}{2}    This calculation is for winning both serves from A and then considering the combination of outcomes for B's serves.Combining both scenarios gives the total probability of A scoring 3 out of the first 4 balls:P = {C}_{2}^{1}×frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{3}×left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{2}{3}right)^2×{C}_{2}^{1}×frac{1}{2}×frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{3}Thus, the probability that player A scores 3 points after the first 4 balls in a game is boxed{frac{1}{3}}.# Part (2)When the game is tied at 10-10, we need to find the probability that the game ends after X leq 4 additional balls are played.

The probability for this scenario is computed as:    P(X=2) = frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3}×frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}    This accounts for A winning the first point and B winning the second, or vice versa.- For X=4, the game must go through four additional balls, implying alternating wins and losses to keep the game going.

We need to find the 2019th strictly positive integer n such that binom{2n}{n} is not divisible by 5. This is equivalent to finding n such that nu_5 left(binom{2n}{n}right) = 0, where nu_5 denotes the 5-adic valuation.2. By Legendre's formula, the 5-adic valuation of binom{2n}{n} is given by:   [   nu_5 left(binom{2n}{n}right) = sum_{k = 1}^{infty} left( leftlfloor frac{2n}{5^k} rightrfloor - 2leftlfloor frac{n}{5^k} rightrfloor right).   ]   We require this sum to be zero.3. For any real number x, we have lfloor 2x rfloor geq 2 lfloor x rfloor, with equality if and only if { x } < frac{1}{2}, where { x } denotes the fractional part of x.

Understanding the Floor Function:   The floor function ( leftlfloor y rightrfloor ) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to ( y ). Therefore, for ( leftlfloor frac{x}{5} rightrfloor ) and ( leftlfloor frac{x}{7} rightrfloor ) to be equal, the values of ( frac{x}{5} ) and ( frac{x}{7} ) must lie within the same integer interval.2. Setting Up the Inequality:   Let ( k ) be the common value of the floor functions. Then:   [   k leq frac{x}{5} < k+1 quad text{and} quad k leq frac{x}{7} < k+1   ]   This implies:   [   5k leq x < 5(k+1) quad text{and} quad 7k leq x < 7(k+1)   ]3. Finding the Intersection:   For both inequalities to hold simultaneously, ( x ) must lie in the intersection of the intervals:   [   max(5k, 7k) leq x < min(5(k+1), 7(k+1))   ]   Since ( 7k geq 5k ), the intersection simplifies to:   [   7k leq x < min(5k + 5, 7k + 7)   ]4. Determining the Range:   We need to find the values of ( k ) for which the intersection is non-empty. Let's analyze the intervals for different values of ( k ):   - For ( k = 0 ):     [     0 leq x < 5     ]     Possible values: ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 )   - For ( k = 1 ):     [     7 leq x < 10     ]     Possible values: ( 7, 8, 9 )   - For ( k = 2 ):     [     14 leq x < 15     ]     Possible value: ( 14 )   - For ( k geq 3 ):     The intervals do not overlap because ( 7k geq 5(k+1) ).5.

We can use the cosine subtraction formula:cos(π - x) = -cos x.We can also use the half-angle formula for cosine, which states:cos frac{θ}{2} = pm sqrt{frac{1 + cos θ}{2}}.The plus or minus depends on the quadrant in which frac{θ}{2} lies. Since α is in the first quadrant (0 < α < frac{π}{2}), frac{α}{2} also lies in the first quadrant, which means cos frac{α}{2} is positive.However, the angle (π - frac{α}{2}) is in the second quadrant because α is between 0 and frac{π}{2}, which puts frac{α}{2} between 0 and frac{π}{4}. This makes (π - frac{α}{2}) between frac{3π}{4} and π, where the cosine is negative. Therefore, we use the negative sign in our evaluation.Thus,cosleft(π - frac{α}{2}right) = -cos frac{α}{2} = -sqrt{frac{1 + cos α}{2}} = -sqrt{frac{1 + frac{4}{5}}{2}} = -sqrt{frac{9}{10}} = -frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}.So, the final answer is boxed{-frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}}."},{"problem":"Problem 6.7.

Define the problem and variables:   - We have 8 singers: ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ).   - We need to find the minimum number of concerts ( m ) such that each pair of singers performs together the same number of times.   - Let ( S_{A,B} ) be the number of times singers ( A ) and ( B ) perform together.   - Let ( S ) be the total number of times all pairs of singers perform together. There are ( binom{8}{2} = 28 ) pairs of singers.2. Establish the relationship between ( S ) and ( S_{A,B} ):   - Since every pair of singers performs together the same number of times, we have ( S = 28S_{A,B} ).3. Relate ( S ) to the number of concerts ( m ):   - In each concert, 4 singers perform, which forms ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ) pairs.   - Therefore, in ( m ) concerts, the total number of pairs performing together is ( 6m ).   - Hence, ( S = 6m ).4. Equate the two expressions for ( S ):   [   28S_{A,B} = 6m   ]   [   14S_{A,B} = 3m   ]   [   m = frac{14S_{A,B}}{3}   ]5. Determine the minimum value of ( m ):   - Since ( m ) must be an integer, ( frac{14S_{A,B}}{3} ) must be an integer.   - The smallest integer value for ( S_{A,B} ) that makes ( frac{14S_{A,B}}{3} ) an integer is ( S_{A,B} = 3 ).   - Substituting ( S_{A,B} = 3 ) into the equation:     [     m = frac{14 times 3}{3} = 14     ]6. Verify the solution with a possible schedule:   - We need to check if 14 concerts can be arranged such that each pair of singers performs together exactly 3 times.   - A possible schedule is:     [     (A,B,C,D), (A,B,E,F), (A,B,G,H), (C,D,E,F), (C,D,G,H), (E,F,G,H), (A,C,E,G), (B,D,F,H), (A,C,F,H), (B,D,E,G), (A,D,E,H), (B,C,F,G), (A,D,F,G), (B,C,E,H)     ]   - This schedule ensures that each pair of singers performs together exactly 3 times.The final answer is ( boxed{ m = 14 } )."},{"problem":"Daniel had a string that formed the perimeter of a square with area 98.

Set up the perimeters of the two rectangles:   - Let the perimeter of the first rectangle be (10x) (since the width and length are in the ratio (2:3)).   - Let the perimeter of the second rectangle be (22y) (since the width and length are in the ratio (3:8)).   - The total length of the string is the sum of the perimeters of the two rectangles:     [     10x + 22y = 28sqrt{2}     ]3.

Understanding the Geometry:   - We have a regular hexagon ABCDEF with side length 8 and center K.   - Points W and U are chosen on overline{AB} and overline{CD} respectively such that overline{KW} = 7 and angle WKU = 120^circ.   - We need to find the area of pentagon WBCUK.2. Hexagon Properties:   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.   - The area of one equilateral triangle with side length s is given by frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2.   - Therefore, the area of the hexagon is 6 times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 8^2 = 6 times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 64 = 96sqrt{3}.3. Position of Points W and U:   - Since W and U are on overline{AB} and overline{CD} respectively, and overline{KW} = 7, we need to consider the geometry of the hexagon.   - The distance from the center K to any vertex of the hexagon is equal to the side length, which is 8.   - Given overline{KW} = 7, W is closer to K than A or B.4.

Place one coin from the pile where both are genuine on one pan of the balance, and one coin from the pile where the counterfeit is on the other pan. If the balance is in equilibrium, the counterfeit coin is the one that remains on the table; if not in equilibrium, we have placed it on the balance (in this case, we will even know whether it is lighter or heavier). If we have 9 coins, three weighings are required. Divide the coins into three piles of 3 coins each and place two of these piles on the two pans of the balance. If the balance is in equilibrium, the counterfeit coin is in the remaining pile, and in two weighings (as shown in the first part of the problem), we can determine the counterfeit coin. Thus, we need a total of three weighings. Now, let the balance not be in equilibrium, meaning one of the piles on the balance contains the counterfeit coin, while the pile that remained contains only genuine ones. Place this pile on the balance and any of the first two. This way, we will not only find the pile with the counterfeit coin but also immediately determine whether it is lighter or heavier than the genuine ones. We have performed two weighings, but now we can determine the counterfeit coin with just one more weighing (as shown in the first part of the problem 49). Thus, we need a total of three weighings.## Answer2 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4.Send a comment"},{"problem":"A solid iron cone with a base radius of 3 cm and a slant height of 5 cm is melted at high temperature and cast into a solid iron sphere (ignoring any loss).

This is an important point. If we could get 31-S, then we could take the cards not used and their digits would add to S. Simply stated, our inability to get S means that we would be unable to get 31-S.So we need to check which sums from 1 to 15 cannot be obtained, and then double this total number.

In addition, a club with {2m+1} students (m is a positive integer) is in exactly m societies.Find all possible values of k.[i]Proposed by Guihua Gong, Puerto Rico[/i]","solution":"1. Define the set (mathcal{A} = { (s, C, S_0) mid s in C, C in S_0, s text{ is a student}, C text{ is a club, and } S_0 text{ is a society} }). According to the problem, each student is in exactly one club of each society, so the size of (mathcal{A}) is (10001k).2. Let (C_i) be a particular club, and denote (|C_i|) as the number of students in it. Since each club has an odd number of students, let (|C_i| = 2m_i + 1) for some positive integer (m_i). According to the problem, a club with (2m_i + 1) students is in exactly (m_i) societies.3. The total number of elements in (mathcal{A}) can also be calculated by summing over all clubs. For each club (C_i), there are (|C_i|) students, and each student in (C_i) is in exactly one club of each society that (C_i) belongs to. Since (C_i) belongs to (m_i) societies, the contribution of (C_i) to (mathcal{A}) is (|C_i| cdot m_i).4. Therefore, we have:   [   |mathcal{A}| = sum_{i=1}^{n} |C_i| cdot m_i   ]   Given that (|C_i| = 2m_i + 1), we can rewrite (m_i) as (frac{|C_i| - 1}{2}).

The total number of pairs of students is (binom{10001}{2}). This must equal the sum of the number of pairs within each club:   [   binom{10001}{2} = sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{|C_i|}{2}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{10001 cdot 10000}{2} = sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{|C_i|(|C_i| - 1)}{2}   ]6. Combining the two expressions for (|mathcal{A}|), we have:   [   10001k = sum_{i=1}^{n} |C_i| cdot frac{|C_i| - 1}{2}   ]   and   [   frac{10001 cdot 10000}{2} = sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{|C_i|(|C_i| - 1)}{2}   ]7.

The answer is (A). Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC; then triangles AIB and X I Y are similar due to the parallelism between lines AB and XY. Let h be the height of trapezoid ABXY, which is also the height of triangle ABC relative to base AB; the height of triangle AIB relative to AB is the radius of the inscribed circle in ABC, whose length is S_{ABC} / p_{ABC} = S_{ABC} / 34. On the other hand, h = 2 S_{ABC} / 17. Thanks to the similarity mentioned above, X_{Y}: AB = XY: 17 = (2 S_{ABC} / 17 - S_{ABC} / 34): S_{ABC} / 34; hence XY = 3 cdot 17 = 51. The area of the trapezoid is therefore frac{1}{2}(17 + 51) h = 34 h.The height h can be calculated as frac{2}{AB} sqrt{p(p-AB)(p-BC)(p-AC)}, using Heron's formula, where p is the semiperimeter of ABC; substituting the lengths of the sides gives h = 24, and thus S_{ABXY} = 816. Alternatively, h can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: let x and y be the projections of the height onto AB, we know that x + y = 17, x^2 + h^2 = 25^2, and y^2 + h^2 = 26^2, from which y^2 - x^2 = (x + y)(y - x) = 17(x - y) = 51.

Thus, to find its successor, we will try to obtain a multiple of three that, when increased by one unit, equals 8^{2}=64. Subtracting one unit from 64, we get 63, which is indeed a multiple of 3.In other words, we have 63+1=64=8^{2}, so 63 is the next term in the sequence.Note: Note that the same reasoning does not work to find the term in the sequence that appears after the term 63. Indeed, if we calculate 9^{2}-1=81-1=80, we end up finding a number that is not a multiple of 3. The procedure developed in items b) and c) below shows us how to overcome this type of difficulty.b) We start by writing the first perfect squares in ascending order:2^{2}, 3^{2}, 4^{2}, 5^{2}, 6^{2}, 7^{2}, 8^{2}, 9^{2}, 10^{2}, 11^{2}, 12^{2}, 13^{2}, 14^{2}, 15^{2}, ldotswhich is equal to the sequence4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169,196,225, ldotsSubtracting one unit from each of the terms, we get the new sequence3,8,15,24,35,48,63,80,99,120,143,168,195,224, ldotsWe exclude from this list those numbers that are not multiples of 3, obtaining the list:3,15,24,48,63,99,120,168,195, ldotsThis is then an increasing list of multiples of 3 whose sum with 1 results in a perfect square. Note that its eighth term is equal to 168. Therefore, this is the number we are looking for.Note: We notice from the solution above that when we subtract one unit from the square of any number that is not a multiple of 3, we get a multiple of 3 as a result.For example, the number 4 is not a multiple of 3, yet 4^{2}-1=16-1=15 which is a multiple of 3. Also, 11 is not a multiple of 3, but 11^{2}-1=121-1=120 which is a multiple of 3.Note that the multiples of 3 are the numbers x of the form x=3n for some natural number n. The numbers that are not multiples of 3 are those that can be written in the form x=3n+1 or x=3n+2. These two types of numbers correspond respectively to those whose remainder when divided by 3 is equal to 1 or 2.Consider first a number x of the first type, i.e., of the form x=3n+1. Note that x^{2}=(3n+1)^{2}=9n^{2}+6n+1. Thus, x^{2}-1=9n^{2}+6n which is a multiple of 3.Similarly, for numbers of the second type x=3n+2, we have x^{2}=9n^{2}+12n+4, so x^{2}-1=9n^{2}+12n+3 which is also a multiple of 3.Finally, note that for a multiple of 3, x=3n, it holds that x^{2}-1=9n^{2}-1 which cannot be a multiple of 3, since 9n^{2} is a multiple of 3 by itself.c) We are interested in calculating the 2013^{text{th}} term of the list:3,15,24,48,63,99,120,168,195, ldotswhich appears in the previous item. Let the numbers of type 1 and type 2 be those whose division by 3 leaves a remainder equal to 2 and 1, respectively. From the observation above, we conclude that to generate this list, we can first form an increasing list by alternating numbers of type 1 and type 2. Then we must square each term and, finally, subtract one unit from each term.Since we are interested in finding the 2013^{text{th}} number, we can focus on finding the 1007^{text{th}} term of the sequence of numbers of type 1. The first term of this list is equal to 3 times 0+2=2, the second is equal to 3 times 1+2=5, the third is equal to 3 times 2+2=8, and so on. Therefore, the 1007^{text{th}} term is equal to 3 times 1006+2=3020. Thus, to generate the 2013^{text{th}} term of the list3,15,24,48,63,99,120,168,195, ldotswe need to square the number 3020 and subtract one unit, obtaining the number 9120399."},{"problem":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} where a_{1}=1 and the sum of the first 100 terms S_{100}=10000.(1) Find the general term formula for the sequence {a_{n}}.(2) If b_{n}=2^{a_{n}+1}, find the sum of the first n terms, denoted as S_{n}, for the sequence {b_{n}}.","solution":"(1) Since a_{1}=1 and S_{100}=10000, we have the following equation for the sum of an arithmetic series:S_{100} = frac{n}{2}(a_{1}+a_{n}) = frac{100}{2}(1+a_{100}) = 10000.Solving for a_{100}, we get a_{100}=199.

We are asked to find the correct equation that represents the situation with an average monthly revenue growth rate of x.1. Identify the revenue for each month:   - January's revenue is given as 90.   - February's revenue, with a growth rate of x, would be 90 times (1+x).   - March's revenue, growing again by the rate x from February, would be 90 times (1+x)^2.2. Sum up the revenues to match the total for the three months:   - The total revenue for the three months is the sum of the revenues for January, February, and March.   - This gives us the equation 90 + 90(1+x) + 90(1+x)^2 = 144.3. Simplify the equation:   - We notice that the equation already accounts for the revenue of January, February, and March.   - However, to directly match the options given, we observe that the total revenue of 144 includes January's revenue. To isolate the revenue growth equation for February and March, we subtract January's revenue (90) from the total, leading to 90(1+x) + 90(1+x)^2 = 144 - 90.4.

Notice that if y is a root of the quadratic polynomial a x^{2}+b x+c, then 1 / y is a root of the quadratic polynomial c x^{2}+b x+a. Therefore, in the problem, we need to find the smallest natural a for which the roots x_{1} and x_{2} of some quadratic polynomial c x^{2}+b x+a (with integer b and c) are greater than 1000. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are positive and x_{1} x_{2}=a / c (by Vieta's theorem), we have c>0.If c=1, then left|x_{1}-x_{2}right|=sqrt{b^{2}-4 a} geqslant 1. Since the smaller root is at least 1000, the larger root is at least 1001, and thus a=x_{1} x_{2} geqslant 1001 cdot 1000. If c geqslant 2, then a=c x_{1} x_{2} geqslant 2 x_{1} x_{2}>2000000. In both cases, the required estimate is proven.It remains to note that the quadratic polynomial x^{2}-(1000+1001) x+1001 cdot 1000 has roots 1000 and 1001, so a=1001000 works.Second solution. Let for brevity n=1000. Let x_{1} and x_{2} be two distinct roots of the quadratic polynomial f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c, where 0-frac{n b}{2}.Since the roots are distinct, the discriminant D=b^{2}-4 a c is positive. Therefore, b^{2}>4 a c>-2 n b c and, thus, -b>2 n c. Therefore, a>(-b) cdot frac{n}{2}>2 n c cdot frac{n}{2}=n^{2} c. Let a=n^{2} c+d, where d is a natural number.Suppose that a<n^{2}+n.

Consequently, -b leqslant 2 n and D=b^{2}-4 a c leqslant 4 n^{2}-4left(n^{2}+dright)=-4 d<0.

Initial Setup and Assumptions:   - We are given 2002 positive numbers.   - We need to maximize the final product by performing a series of operations.   - Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume the numbers are sorted in non-increasing order: ( a_1 geq a_2 geq ldots geq a_{2002} ).2. Claim 1: The numbers that are doubled are precisely the largest 1001 numbers in ({a_n}):   - Proof by Contradiction:     - Suppose the maximal product ( P ) has a doubled number ( a_i ) not in ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1001}}).     - In ( P ), there exist two factors ((2a_i + a_j)) and ((2a_k + a_l)).     - For maximality, ( a_j ) must be less than or equal to ( a_i ); otherwise, switching the two numbers would yield a larger product.     - By the pigeonhole principle, there exist numbers ( a_k, a_l ) where ( a_k, a_l in {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1001}} ).     - So, ( P = (2a_i + a_j)(2a_k + a_l)K = (4a_i a_k + 2a_i a_l + 2a_j a_k + a_j a_l)K ).     - Define ( Q = (2a_l + a_j)(2a_k + a_i)K = (4a_k a_l + 2a_i a_l + 2a_j a_k + a_i a_j)K ).     - It is clear that ( Q > P ), and ( P ) is not the largest product; contradiction.     - Thus, the largest product cannot have any doubled numbers that are not from the set ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1001}}), and the claim is proven.3. Claim 2: For the maximal product ( P = (2a_1 + b_1)(2a_2 + b_2) ldots (2a_{1001} + b_{1001}) ), we have ( b_1 leq b_2 leq ldots leq b_{1001} ):   - Proof by Contradiction:     - Suppose there exist two indices ( i, j ) such that ( a_i > a_j ) and ( b_i > b_j ).     - Rewrite ( P ) as ( (2a_i + b_i)(2a_j + b_j)K = (4a_i a_j + 2a_i b_j + 2a_j b_i + b_i b_j)K ).     - Define ( Q = (2a_i + b_j)(2a_j + b_i)K = (4a_i a_j + 2a_i b_i + 2a_j b_j + b_i b_j)K ).     - Clearly, similarly sorted sequences imply that ( Q > P ), so there is once again a contradiction.     - Therefore, the maximal product must not have ( b_i > b_j ) and ( i > j ) for any pairs ((i, j)).     - This forces ( b_1 leq b_2 leq ldots leq b_{1001} ).4. Conclusion:   - The largest possible product is achieved when the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1001} ) is paired with the sequence ( a_{2002}, a_{2001}, ldots, a_{1002} ) respectively.   - Therefore, the largest possible answer is ( P = (2a_1 + a_{2002})(2a_2 + a_{2001}) ldots (2a_{1001} + a_{1002}) ).The final answer is ( boxed{ P = (2a_1 + a_{2002})(2a_2 + a_{2001}) ldots (2a_{1001} + a_{1002}) } )."},{"problem":"## 203.

Extend the slanted side AD by the distance DC. Thus, AE=frac{d}{2}. Let EC intersect the line AB at F. Then, the opposite vertex of all trapezoids with the desired properties lies on the segment EF. Draw the midpoint G of the perpendicular side BC. All such midpoints lie on a line starting from F. Let this line intersect AE at H and the side CD of the trapezoid ABCD or its extension at K. By reflecting the triangle GCK over G, we see that the area of the trapezoid ABCD is smaller than the area of the triangle AFH by the area of the triangle DHK. Thus, the trapezoid with the largest area is obtained by drawing a line parallel to AF from H and then drawing a perpendicular from the intersection of this line with EF to AF.This procedure is valid regardless of whether alpha is an acute, right, or obtuse angle.Remark: Some solvers thought the construction was feasible by constructing the isosceles trapezoid with the maximum area and angle alpha in a circle of arbitrary radius and then constructing a smaller or larger similar trapezoid corresponding to the given d. Of course, this is incorrect, as it solves the problem for the case where the radius of the circle circumscribed around the trapezoid is constant along with alpha. In this case, however, changing the leg also changes d, whereas in the given problem, where d is constant, changing the leg changes the radius of the circle circumscribed around the trapezoid."},{"problem":"10.

Find the value of p.","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break it down into detailed steps:1. Identify the Parabola and Its Focus: We are given a parabola y^{2}=2pxleft(p > 0right) with its focus F. The focus of a parabola in this form is located at F(frac{p}{2}, 0).2. Equation of the Line Through the Focus: A line passing through the focus F and intersecting the parabola at points A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}) can be represented as x=my+frac{p}{2}, where m is the slope of the line, which is non-zero.3. Midpoint of AB and Its Coordinates: The midpoint of AB has a y-coordinate of y_{0}=sqrt{2}. The y-coordinates of A and B are y_{1} and y_{2} respectively, so the midpoint's y-coordinate is the average of y_{1} and y_{2}, which is given as sqrt{2}.4. Relation Between y_{1}, y_{2}, x_{1}, and x_{2}: From the parabola's equation, we have y_{1}^{2}=2px_{1} and y_{2}^{2}=2px_{2}. Subtracting these equations gives us (y_{1}-y_{2})(y_{1}+y_{2})=2p(x_{1}-x_{2}). Therefore, we can express the slope frac{1}{m} as frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}=frac{2p}{y_{1}+y_{2}}=frac{2p}{2sqrt{2}}=frac{p}{sqrt{2}}.5. Equation of Line l: With the slope found, the equation of line l becomes x=frac{sqrt{2}}{p}y+frac{p}{2}.6. Finding |AB|: The x-coordinate of the midpoint of AB is x_{0}=frac{sqrt{2}}{p}times sqrt{2}+frac{p}{2}=frac{4+p^{2}}{2p}. Since |AB|=5sqrt{2}, we use the distance formula to find that 2x_{0}+p=5sqrt{2}, which simplifies to 2times frac{4+p^{2}}{2p}+p=5sqrt{2}.7. Solving for p: This equation simplifies to 2p^{2}-5sqrt{2}p+4=0.

The number of different parking methods is:A: 14B: 20C: 24D: 48","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Understanding the Problem: We have 6 parking spaces and 3 cars. The rule is that no two cars can be parked next to each other. This means there must be at least one empty space between any two cars.2. Visualizing the Spaces: Imagine the 6 parking spaces in a row. To ensure no two cars are parked next to each other, we can think of the problem as placing cars in \\"slots\\" created by the spaces between parked cars and at the ends of the row. For 6 spaces, there are 5 \\"slots\\" between the cars and 2 \\"slots\\" at the ends, making it 7 \\"slots\\". However, since cars must have an empty space on at least one side, we effectively reduce our \\"usable\\" slots to the spaces between cars, which are initially 4 (one less than the number of cars, as the first and last slot are not considered due to the requirement of having an empty space on both sides of a car).3. Calculating the Combinations: To find the number of different ways to park the cars, we are essentially choosing 3 slots out of the 4 available to place our cars. This is a permutations problem because the order in which we place the cars matters (car A in slot 1 and car B in slot 2 is different from car B in slot 1 and car A in slot 2). The formula for permutations is P(n, r) = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items (slots in our case), and r is the number of items to choose (cars).4. Applying the Formula: In our case, n=4 (slots) and r=3 (cars). So, the number of different parking methods is calculated as P(4, 3) = frac{4!}{(4-3)!} = frac{4!}{1!} = frac{4 times 3 times 2 times 1}{1} = 24.Therefore, the number of different parking methods, following the given rules, is boxed{24}.Hence, the correct answer is: boxed{text{C}}."},{"problem":"In an isosceles triangle, the lengths of two sides are 3 and 4, then the perimeter is ____.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the two possible configurations of the isosceles triangle with sides of lengths 3 and 4.Case 1: When 3 is the base.- In this case, the two equal sides of the isosceles triangle must be the ones with length 4.- Therefore, the sides of the triangle are 3, 4, and 4.- To find the perimeter, we add up the lengths of all sides: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11.- So, the perimeter in this case is 11.Case 2: When 3 is one of the legs.- Here, the two equal sides are both 3.- This means the sides of the triangle are 3, 3, and 4.- The perimeter is found by adding the lengths of these sides: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10.- Thus, the perimeter in this case is 10.Given these two cases, the perimeter of the isosceles triangle can either be 10 or 11.

Given the differential equation ( f(x) = frac{d^3}{dx^3} f(x) ), we start by solving this equation.

Consequently, the number B is divisible by nine, as is C, and indeed the sum of the digits of C, D, is also divisible by nine.Since A has ten billion digits, the sum of its digits cannot be greater than the sum of ten billion nines: B leq 9 cdot 10^{10}. In other words, B is a number with at most 11 digits, which cannot consist of 11 nines, as that would be greater than 9 cdot 10^{10}. From this, however, we conclude that C is definitely less than 9 cdot 11, which is 99. Thus, D is the sum of two digits, at least one of which is less than 9; therefore, C leq 9+8=17. Since the only positive number less than 17 and divisible by 9 is 9, it follows that D=9.Note.

Suppose the counters are set to all powers of two from 1 to 1024 and some 17 other numbers. Since the order of moves does not matter, we can arrange them in descending order of the numbers being subtracted. We will show by induction that after the k-th move, there is a number on the board that is not less than 2^{10-k}. The base case - 0 moves - is obvious. Suppose after k moves, there is a number on the board that is not less than 2^{10-k}. If we subtract a number greater than 2^{10-k-1} on the k-th move, then this and the previous moves have not affected the number 2^{10-k-1}, and the proof is complete. Otherwise, after the subtraction, there will be a number not less than 2^{10-k-1}, which is not less than 2^{10-k}.

Coloring the Grid:   - Color the 202 times 202 grid in a chessboard pattern, where each cell is either black or white, and adjacent cells have different colors.   - A T-tetromino covers 3 cells of one color and 1 cell of the other color. Therefore, to tile the entire grid, we need an equal number of T-tetrominoes that cover 3 black and 1 white cells and those that cover 3 white and 1 black cells.2. Counting the Cells:   - The total number of cells in the 202 times 202 grid is 202 times 202 = 40804.   - Since each T-tetromino covers 4 cells, the number of T-tetrominoes needed to cover the grid is frac{40804}{4} = 10201.   - However, 10201 is an odd number, which means we cannot have an equal number of T-tetrominoes of each type (3 black, 1 white and 3 white, 1 black). Therefore, it is impossible to tile the entire 202 times 202 grid with T-tetrominoes without removing some cells.3. Removing Cells:   - To make the grid tileable by T-tetrominoes, we need to remove cells such that the remaining number of cells is divisible by 4.   - Since 40804 is already divisible by 4, we need to remove at least 4 cells to make the grid tileable.4. Choosing Cells to Remove:   - Number the columns and rows from 0 to 201.   - Remove the cells at positions (200,0), (0,200), (201,200), and (201,201).   - After removing these 4 cells, the grid is divided into a 200 times 200 grid and two strips of width 2 along the top and right edges, with some cells removed.5. Tiling the 200 times 200 Grid:   - A 200 times 200 grid can be tiled completely by T-tetrominoes because 200 times 200 = 40000, which is divisible by 4.6. Tiling the Strips:   - Define L_k as a structure obtained by deleting the upper rightmost cell and bottom leftmost cell from a 4k+1 times 2 board.   - The rightmost part of the grid can be covered by L_{50}, and the uppermost part can also be covered by L_{50}.   - It is easy to see that L_k structures can be covered by T-tetrominoes.Conclusion:By removing 4 specific cells, the 202 times 202 grid can be tiled using T-tetrominoes.The final answer is boxed{4}."},{"problem":"22nd ASU 1988 Problem 1 A book contains 30 stories.

Suppose the factor that appears twice in the factorization has the form 2^{alpha} cdot 5^{beta} (i.e., the factorization has the form 10^{6}=left(2^{chi} cdot 5^{beta}right) cdotleft(2^{alpha} cdot 5^{beta}right)left(2^{6-2 alpha} cdot 5^{6-2 beta}right); then alpha can be 0,1,2 or 3, beta can also be 0,1,2 or 3. Since any alpha can be combined with any beta, the total number of possibilities is 4 cdot 4=16. We need to exclude one possibility alpha=2, beta=2, since in this case we get the factorization10^{6}=left(2^{2} cdot 5^{2}right) cdotleft(2^{2} cdot 5^{2}right) cdotleft(2^{2} cdot 5^{2}right)highlighted earlier. Thus, 15 factorizations are counted three times.3) The remaining factorizations are counted six times.

We can rewrite this equation as x^{3}+x-4=0 to make it easier to analyze. Let's define a function f(x) based on this equation:[f(x) = x^{3} + x - 4]Next, we need to determine the behavior of this function to understand where its roots might lie. To do this, we calculate the derivative of f(x):[f'(x) = 3x^{2} + 1]Since 3x^{2} + 1 > 0 for all real numbers x, this tells us that the derivative f'(x) is always positive. This implies that the function f(x) is monotonically increasing throughout its domain. In other words, as x increases, f(x) also increases. This is crucial because it means that if f(x) has a root (a value of x for which f(x) = 0), there can only be one such root. The function cannot decrease after increasing, so it cannot cross the x-axis more than once.To find the interval within which this root lies, we evaluate f(x) at specific points. We start by checking the value of f(x) at x=1:[f(1) = 1^{3} + 1 - 4 = -2]This calculation shows that f(1)  0. Since f(x) is monotonically increasing and we have found that f(1)  0, the function must cross the x-axis (i.e., f(x) = 0) somewhere in the interval (1, frac{3}{2}). This means that the root of the equation x^{3} + x - 4 = 0 lies in this interval.Given that the interval is (1, frac{3}{2}) and we are looking for a value of k that is a multiple of frac{1}{2} and satisfies the condition that the root lies in the interval (k, k+frac{1}{2}), we can conclude that k=1.Therefore, the value of the real number k is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"2.

We obtain quadrilateral OADB, in which OA=AD=6, BD=3, OB=9, angle OAD=90^{circ} (see diagram). We can reason in several ways from here.First method. Consider a coordinate system where point O has coordinates (0,0), point A has coordinates (6,0), and point D has coordinates (6,-6).

CE and DE are the medians of the isosceles triangles ABC and ABD, and thus are also the angle bisectors and altitudes. Therefore, AB perp CE, AB perp DE. This means that segment AB is perpendicular to the plane CDE, hence AB perp CD. Thus, AB lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder (denote this plane as alpha). The intersection of the cylinder with this plane is a circle, and AB is a chord of this circle. The radius of the cylinder is minimized if AB is the diameter. Note that this is possible because segments DE and CE are longer than frac{1}{2} AB = 2.

After rearranging, we get na_{n+1}=(n+1)a_n-1…(1).   Therefore, (n+1)a_{n+2}=(n+2)a_{n+1}-1…(2).   Subtracting (1) from (2), we get (n+1)a_{n+2}-na_{n+1}=(n+2)a_{n+1}-(n+1)a_n,   which implies 2(n+1)a_{n+1}=(n+1)(a_{n+2}+a_n).   Therefore, 2a_{n+1}=a_{n+2}+a_n,   which means the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence.2. From 1, we know that na_{n+1}=(n+1)a_n-1, we get a_2=2a_1-1=5.   Since a_1=3, we have a_2-a_1=2, which means the common difference is 2,   a_n=3+(n-1)times 2=2n+1.3. Since frac{1}{a_na_{n+1}}= frac{1}{(2n+1)(2n+3)}= frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{2n+1}- frac{1}{2n+3}right),   we have T_n= frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{3}- frac{1}{5}+ frac{1}{5}- frac{1}{7}+ldots+ frac{1}{2n+1}- frac{1}{2n+3}right)   = frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{3}- frac{1}{2n+3}right).   When n in mathbb{N}^*, T_n < frac{1}{6}.   To ensure T_n leq M holds for all positive integers n, it is sufficient to have M geq frac{1}{6}.

Remember that this is a sample, so we should technically be using n-1 in the denominator. The original solution incorrectly uses n=5 instead of n-1=4. However, the given solution appears to be based on the simplified calculation that could be used for understanding, not necessarily precise statistical rigor. The correct formula for the variance of a sample is:s^2 = frac{1}{n-1}sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - bar{x})^2,where x_i represents each measurement and bar{x} is the average we've calculated.

The factorization of the number 56700000 is 56700000=2^{5} cdot 3^{4} cdot 5^{5} cdot 7; thus, the problem reduces to determining how many numbers less than 56700000 are not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.Let's list all numbers from 1 to 56700000. We will strike out all numbers divisible by 2 (their number is frac{1}{2} cdot 56700000=28350000); all numbers divisible by 3 (their number is left.frac{1}{3} cdot 56700000=18900000right); all numbers divisible by 5 (their number is frac{1}{5} cdot 56700000=11340000); all numbers divisible by 7 (their number is frac{1}{7} cdot 56700000=8100000).

Therefore, all numbers divisible by any three of the four factors 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not counted at all in our difference, and we must add to the difference the total number of all such numbers.

They are obviously counted four times in the first term 66690000 (as divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7); six times in the second term 27270000 (as divisible by 2 and 3; 2 and 5; 2 and 7; 3 and 5; 3 and 7; 5 and 7); and four times in the last term (as divisible by 2, 3, and 5; 2, 3, and 7; 2, 5, and 7; 3, 5, and 7). Therefore, these numbers are counted in our expression 4-6+4=2 times, and their number, equal to frac{1}{2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7} cdot 56700000=270000, must be subtracted:66690000-27270000+4590000-270000=43740000.Thus, from 1 to 56700000, there are 43740000 numbers divisible by at least one of the factors 2, 3, 5, or 7. Therefore, the number of numbers not divisible by any of these factors (coprime with the number 56700000) is56700000-43740000=12960000Note.

According to the student's observation,[begin{aligned}& frac{5}{c_{1}}+frac{5}{c_{2}}=15 & frac{5}{c_{2}}+frac{5}{c_{3}}=11end{aligned}]The distance BC = x is covered by the passenger train in frac{x}{c_{1}} minutes, and during this time, the freight train is on the way from B to A for frac{10}{c_{2}} minutes, and then the express train is on the way from A to C for frac{10+x}{c_{3}} minutes, so[frac{x}{c_{1}}=frac{10}{c_{2}}+frac{10+x}{c_{3}}]Thus, we have 3 equations with 4 unknowns, which means the unknowns cannot be fully determined, but in this case, x can be determined, while c_{1}, c_{2}, and c_{3} remain undetermined.Subtracting (2) from (1),[frac{5}{c_{1}}-frac{5}{c_{3}}=4, text { from which } frac{1}{c_{1}}-frac{1}{c_{3}}=frac{4}{5}]From (2),[frac{1}{c_{2}}+frac{1}{c_{3}}=frac{11}{5}]From (3),[frac{x}{c_{1}}-frac{x}{c_{3}}=frac{10}{c_{2}}+frac{10}{c_{3}}]or[xleft(frac{1}{c_{1}}-frac{1}{c_{3}}right)=10left(frac{1}{c_{2}}+frac{1}{c_{3}}right)]Considering (4) and (5),[frac{4}{5} x=10 cdot frac{11}{5}]from which[x=frac{110}{4}=27.5 mathrm{~km}]II. Solution: According to the student's observation, the passenger train and the freight train cover 5-5 km in succession in a total of 15 minutes, while the freight train and the express train cover 5-5 km in succession in a total of 11 minutes. This implies that the express train covers 5 km in 4 minutes less time than the passenger train. The express train passes the midpoint F of the AB distance 15+11=26 minutes after the passenger train. Since 5 km brings 4 minutes of time advantage, 26 minutes of time advantage is brought after 6.5 cdot 5 mathrm{~km}=32.5 mathrm{~km}. Therefore, FC=32.5 mathrm{~km} and thus BC=FC-FB=32.5-5=27.5 mathrm{~km}.III. Solution: Let's graphically represent the movement of the trains. First, let's plot the kilometers covered by the train departing from A at 0 minutes as a function of t minutes, with an arbitrary speed, i.e., draw the line AP at an arbitrary angle (1st figure).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_ad9daece9b1239b12c20g-1.jpg?height=558&width=702&top_left_y=2155&top_left_x=695)After covering 10 km, the freight train departs from B back to A at an arbitrary speed. The freight train reaches the 5 km point 15 minutes after the passenger train, so on our diagram, PQ=15 minutes, which implies that the freight train arrives in A 30 minutes after the passenger's departure (which occurred at 0 minutes). (This can be geometrically read from our diagram. Since the speed of the express train must be positive and bounded from above, the speed of the freight train is not entirely arbitrary. If we take 150 km/h as the upper limit for the express train's speed, then the express train needs at least 2 minutes to cover 5 km, and the passenger train needs at least 2+4=6 minutes, so the distance 5P geq 6 minutes. This implies that the distance PQ=15 minutes is at most 2.5 times the distance 5P.)The express train departs at the 30th minute, but its speed is already determined by the two arbitrarily chosen speeds, as it must reach the 5 km point 11 minutes after the freight train. Thus, QR=11 minutes, and the point R is determined, and thus the line representing the movement of the express train is also determined. The intersection point M(x, y) of this line with the line representing the movement of the passenger train. The y-coordinate of M, which represents kilometers, can be read from our diagram, but it can also be precisely calculated from our diagram:[y:(y-5)=MA:MP=30:26]from which[begin{gathered}26 y=30 y-150 y=37.5 text { and thus } BC=y-10=27.5 mathrm{~km}end{gathered}]Essentially, this is how András Ádám (Hajdúszoboszló, Irinyi János g. IV. o. t.) solved the problem."},{"problem":"Let M be a finite subset of the plane such that for any two different points A,Bin M there is a point Cin M such that ABC is equilateral. What is the maximal number of points in M?","solution":"1. Claim: The maximum number of points in ( M ) is 3. We will show that any set ( M ) with more than 3 points cannot satisfy the given conditions.2. Base Case: Consider an equilateral triangle with vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ). Clearly, ( |M| geq 3 ) since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) form an equilateral triangle, and for any two points among ( A, B, ) and ( C ), the third point completes the equilateral triangle.3. Assumption for Contradiction: Assume there exists a finite set ( M ) with more than 3 elements satisfying the conditions. Choose two points ( A, B in M ) such that the distance ( |AB| ) is maximal. Without loss of generality, let ( |AB| = 1 ).4. Existence of Point ( C ): By the problem's condition, there exists a point ( C in M ) such that ( triangle ABC ) is equilateral. Assume ( A, B, C ) are ordered counterclockwise around the perimeter of ( triangle ABC ).5. Reflections and Disks: Reflect points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) with respect to the sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) to get points ( A', B', ) and ( C' ) respectively. Denote the disk with radius 1 centered at a point ( P ) as ( Gamma_P ).6. Additional Point ( D ): Let ( D ) be a point in ( M ) different from ( A, B, ) and ( C ). All points of ( M ) must lie within the intersection of the disks ( Gamma_A cap Gamma_B cap Gamma_C ).7. Equilateral Triangle with ( D ): There must be a point ( E in M ) such that ( triangle ADE ) is equilateral. Consider the two cases for the angle ( angle DAE ):   - If ( angle DAE = 60^circ ), then ( D ) lies in ( Gamma_{C'} ) since ( E ) lies in ( Gamma_B ).   - If ( angle EAD = 60^circ ), then ( D ) lies in ( Gamma_{B'} ) since ( E ) lies in ( Gamma_C ).8. Location of ( D ): Thus, ( D ) must lie in either ( Gamma_{B'} ) or ( Gamma_{C'} ). Similarly, by considering other equilateral triangles involving ( D ), we find that ( D ) must also lie in ( Gamma_{C'} ) or ( Gamma_{A'} ) and ( Gamma_{A'} ) or ( Gamma_{B'} ).9. Intersection of Disks: Therefore, ( D ) must lie in the intersection of two of the disks ( Gamma_{A'}, Gamma_{B'}, Gamma_{C'} ). Without loss of generality, assume ( D ) lies in ( Gamma_{B'} ) and ( Gamma_{C'} ). However, the intersection ( Gamma_{B'} cap Gamma_{C'} = {A} ), which contradicts ( D neq A ).10.

Prove that there is no algorithm which enables us to do so in less than 2016 questions. (Proposed by Konstantin Knop)","solution":"To prove that there is no algorithm which enables us to determine whether it is possible to travel from any town to any other by a sequence of roads in fewer than (2016) questions, we will use concepts from graph theory and combinatorics.1. Definitions and Setup:   - Let (V) be the set of (64) towns.   - Let (K) be the set of pairs of towns for which we have inquired about the existence of a road.   - Let (E) be the subset of (K) where the inquiries have been answered affirmatively (i.e., there is a road).   - Define a pargraph (mathcal{H} = (V, K, E)).2. Tree-Pluripotent Pargraph:   - A pargraph (mathcal{H} = (V, K, E)) is tree-pluripotent if for any (u in binom{V}{2} setminus K), (mathcal{H}) is consistent with a total pargraph whose underlying graph is a tree containing (u) as an edge.   - Consistency means that the pargraph (mathcal{H}) can be extended to a total pargraph (where (K = binom{V}{2})) that is a tree.3. Proposition 1:   - Given a tree-pluripotent pargraph (mathcal{H} = (V, K, E)) with (K subsetneq binom{V}{2}), the minimal realization of (mathcal{H}) is disconnected.   - Proof:     - By hypothesis, there exists (u in binom{V}{2} setminus K).     - There exists a total pargraph (widetilde{mathcal{H}} = (V, binom{V}{2}, widetilde{E})) consistent with (mathcal{H}) whose underlying graph is a tree containing (u) as an edge.     - The minimal realization of (mathcal{H}) is a subgraph of this tree that lacks at least one edge (namely (u)), and is therefore disconnected. (blacksquare)4. Proposition 2:   - Given a tree-pluripotent pargraph (mathcal{H} = (V, K, E)) and (u_0 in binom{V}{2} setminus K), there exists a tree-pluripotent pargraph (widetilde{mathcal{H}} = (V, K cup {u_0}, widetilde{E})) consistent with (mathcal{H}).   - Proof:     - If every total pargraph consistent with (mathcal{H}) whose underlying graph is a tree contains the edge (u_0), then (widetilde{mathcal{H}} = (V, K cup {u_0}, widetilde{E} cup {u_0})) is the desired tree-pluripotent pargraph.     - If there exists a total pargraph (mathcal{H}' = (V, binom{V}{2}, E')) consistent with (mathcal{H}) whose underlying graph is a tree not containing the edge (u_0), then:       - For any (u in binom{V}{2} setminus (K cup {u_0})), the tree-pluripotency of (mathcal{H}) implies the existence of a total pargraph (mathcal{H}'' = (V, binom{V}{2}, E'')) consistent with (mathcal{H}) whose underlying graph is a tree containing the edge (u).       - If the edge (u) fails to occur in the underlying graph of (mathcal{H}'), consider the unique path connecting its endpoints, delete an edge in this path not in (K cup {u_0}), and adjoin (u) to (E') to obtain a total pargraph consistent with (widetilde{mathcal{H}}) whose underlying graph is a tree containing the edge (u).       - Thus, (widetilde{mathcal{H}}) is tree-pluripotent.

Therefore, we set:   [   b^2 - 2019 = 1 implies b^2 = 2020   ]   However, 2020 is not a perfect square, so we need to find the closest integer values for (b) that minimize (b^2 - 2019).5. The closest perfect squares to 2019 are (44^2 = 1936) and (45^2 = 2025).

This effectively reduces our volunteers to 5 entities (BC, A, D, E, F). These 5 entities can be arranged in 5! ways. However, within the BC entity, B and C can also switch places, adding another layer of arrangement possibilities.

Let's denote A_i as the event of drawing a first-class product on the i-th draw, where i=1,2,3.The probability of not drawing a first-class product on the first draw (overline{A_1}) is the probability of drawing a second-class product, which is frac{2}{5}, since there are 2 second-class products out of 5 total products.Given that a second-class product was drawn first, the probability of not drawing a first-class product on the second draw (overline{A_2}|overline{A_1}) is frac{1}{4}, because now there is 1 less second-class product and 1 less total product, leaving 1 second-class product out of 4 remaining products.Finally, given that no first-class product was drawn in the first two draws, the probability of drawing a first-class product on the third draw (A_3|overline{A_1}overline{A_2}) is frac{3}{3}=1, as all remaining products are first-class.Therefore, the probability of obtaining a first-class product only on the third draw is:[P(overline{A_1}overline{A_2}A_3) = P(overline{A_1}) times P(overline{A_2}|overline{A_1}) times P(A_3|overline{A_1}overline{A_2}) = frac{2}{5} times frac{1}{4} times frac{3}{3} = frac{1}{10}] Part 2: Average Number of First-Class Products Obtained with ReplacementWhen products are replaced after being drawn, and a total of 10 draws are made, let X denote the number of times a first-class product is drawn.

Since the circle goes through the origin, the distance from the center (a, a) to the origin (0, 0) is the radius of the circle. This distance, by the Pythagorean theorem, is sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{2a^2}, so the radius r of the circle is r = sqrt{2}a.Now, consider the chord that the circle cuts on the x-axis. The length of the chord, which is 2, is horizontal, so its endpoints are on the x-axis and equidistant from the y-axis (since the chord is centered on the y-axis). Let P(x, 0) and Q(x-2, 0) be the endpoints of the chord. Then the midpoint of PQ lies on the x-axis, and it is at equal distances from P and Q, which means this midpoint is (x-1, 0). This midpoint is also the point on the x-axis directly below the center of the circle, so the distance from the center (a, a) to the midpoint (x-1, 0) is a. Using the fact that the radius of the circle is equal to asqrt{2}, and that this midpoint is on the circle, the Pythagorean theorem sets up the equation:(a - (x-1))^2 + a^2 = (asqrt{2})^2Expanding this and simplifying:a^2 - 2a(x-1) + (x-1)^2 + a^2 = 2a^2a^2 - 2ax + 2a + x^2 - 2x + 1 + a^2 = 2a^2x^2 - (2a + 2)x + (2a + 1) = 0Since this quadratic equation represents all x-coordinates of points on the circle that lie on the x-axis, and we know the two roots correspond to the endpoints of the chord (x and x-2), we can use the quadratic sum of roots and product of roots to find a.Sum of roots: x + (x-2) = 2x-2 and the sum given by the quadratic is (2a+2), so 2x-2=2a+2 which simplifies to x-1=a+1 or a=x-2.Since the center of the circle is (a, a), and a could either be positive or negative, it could be either (x-2, x-2) or (2-x, 2-x).Thus, there are two possible circles and their equations will be:1. For the center (x-2, x-2), the equation of the circle is (x - (x - 2))^2 + (y - (x - 2))^2 = (asqrt{2})^2, which simplifies to (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 2.2. For the center (2 - x, 2 - x), the equation of the circle is (x - (2 - x))^2 + (y - (2 - x))^2 = (asqrt{2})^2, which simplifies to (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2.Hence, the equation of the circle could either be (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2 or (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 2, and the correct answer is: boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2 text{ or } (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 2} "},{"problem":"Example 13 Given that x_{1}, x_{2} are the two real roots of the equation x^{2}-(k-2) x + (k^{2}+3 k+5)=0 (where k is a real number).

A \\"no marmalade\\" permutation is one where no element maps to itself and no two elements map to each other.2. Reformulating the Problem:   We need to find the probability that a random permutation of ( n ) elements has no cycles of length less than 3. This means that all cycles in the permutation must have a length of at least 3.3. Recurrence Relation:   Let's denote ( f(n) ) as the number of \\"no marmalade\\" permutations of ( n ) elements. We can derive a recurrence relation for ( f(n) ).   - Consider a permutation ( sigma ) of ( n ) elements where ( sigma(1) = i ) and ( sigma(i) = j ) with ( i neq j ) and ( i, j neq 1 ).   - There are two cases:     1. ( sigma(j) = 1 ): This forms a cycle of length 3, and the remaining ( n-3 ) elements must form a \\"no marmalade\\" permutation.     2. ( sigma(j) neq 1 ): This forms a cycle of length at least 4. We can map this to a cycle of length at least 3 in the remaining ( n-1 ) elements.   Therefore, the recurrence relation is:   [   f(n) = (n-1)(n-2)f(n-3) + (n-1)f(n-1)   ]4. Probability Expression:   Let ( p_n = frac{f(n)}{n!} ).

From the given conditions, we can derive the equation: tan 60^{circ}-tan 60^{circ}cdottan 17^{circ}cdottan 43^{circ}=tan 17^{circ}+tan 43^{circ}.Now let's break it down step by step:1. Recall that tan 60^{circ}=tan (17^{circ}+43^{circ}). According to the tangent sum formula, we have:   tan (A+B)=frac{tan A+tan B}{1-tan Acdottan B}   Substituting A=17^{circ} and B=43^{circ}, we get:   tan 60^{circ}=frac{tan 17^{circ}+tan 43^{circ}}{1-tan 17^{circ}cdottan 43^{circ}}2.

The formation cannot consist of only liars (in such a case, the 3-7th person would be telling the truth). Consider the tallest knight, let's call him P.

This liar cannot say the second phrase, so he must say the first phrase and stand no later than the 7th place, but not earlier than the 4th place. Therefore, from the 8th to the 20th place, only knights stand. The 3rd place cannot be occupied by a liar, as there is a liar L who is shorter than him. Therefore, the 3rd place is occupied by P.

Express ( a + c ) in terms of ( b ):   Since ( a + b + c = 1 ), we have:   [   a + c = 1 - b   ]2.

Use the AM-GM inequality to bound ( 2ac ):   By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we have:   [   a + c geq 2sqrt{ac}   ]   Since ( a + c = 1 - b ), it follows that:   [   1 - b geq 2sqrt{ac}   ]   Squaring both sides, we get:   [   (1 - b)^2 geq 4ac   ]   Therefore:   [   ac leq frac{(1 - b)^2}{4}   ]4.

If a systematic sampling method is used to draw a sample of size 4, and it is known that employees numbered 6, 32, and 45 are in the sample, then the number of the remaining employee in the sample is _________.","solution":"To use a systematic sampling method to select a sample size of 4 from 52, we divide the total number of employees by the sample size to determine the sampling interval k: k = frac{52}{4} = 13. So the sampling interval is 13, meaning every 13th individual is chosen after selecting a random starting point between 1 and 13 (inclusive).Given that employees numbered 6, 32, and 45 are in the sample, we notice that the difference between 32 and 6 is 32 - 6 = 26 and the difference between 45 and 32 is 45 - 32 = 13. The latter difference matches our interval k = 13, but the former suggests that the number 6 was not the first number chosen, as it doesn't fit the consistent interval of 13.Therefore, let's work backwards from employee number 6 to find the first number. Since we are working with a constant interval of 13, we can subtract this interval from 6 to find the first sampled number. So, the number of the first employee is: 6 - 13 = -7. However, negative numbering doesn't make sense in this context, so we add the total number of employees (52) to get the actual first position in the system sampling: -7 + 52 = 45. Now, we know employee number 45 is the first in the sample set, employee number 6 is the second, and employee number 32 is the third. To find the fourth employee's number we add the interval k to the last known employee number in the sample set, employee number 32: 32 + 13 = 45. But this number has already appeared as the first number in our sample set, so we must have made an error. The error lies in the fact that we assumed employee number 6 was the second in the sequence when in fact it could very well be the last one. To fix this we find the actual first number by subtracting the sampling interval from 6: 6 - 13 = -7. As previously discussed, since negative numbers are not valid, we cycle back through the list by adding the total number of employees: -7 + 52 = 45. This confirms that employee number 45 is the first in our sequence, so we have:1st employee: 45,2nd employee: 45 + 13 = 58 - 52 = 6 (as the maximum number is 52, we cycle back after reaching it),3rd employee: 6 + 13 = 19,4th employee: 19 + 13 = 32.As we can see, the numbers 45, 6, 19, 32 fit the pattern with the interval of 13.

Expression Simplification:   We start with the given function ( F_k(a,b) = (a+b)^k - a^k - b^k ). We need to evaluate (frac{F_5(a,b)}{F_3(a,b)}).   [   frac{F_5(a,b)}{F_3(a,b)} = frac{(a+b)^5 - a^5 - b^5}{(a+b)^3 - a^3 - b^3}   ]2.

There are two scenarios in which player B can take the second shot:1. Player A takes the first shot and misses.2. Player B takes the first shot and makes it.Given player A's shooting accuracy is 0.6, the probability of missing is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Since the player for the first shot is determined by drawing lots, each player has a probability of 0.5 to take the first shot.
