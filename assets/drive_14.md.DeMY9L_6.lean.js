Queenie and Horst play a game on a 20 times 20 chessboard. In the beginning the board is empty. In every turn, Horst places a black knight on an empty square in such a way that his new knight does not attack any previous knights. Then Queenie places a white queen on an empty square. The game gets finished when somebody cannot move.Find the maximal positive K such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least K knights on the board.","solution":"Answer: K=20^{2} / 4=100. In case of a 4 N times 4 M board, the answer is K=4 N M.Solution. We show two strategies, one for Horst to place at least 100 knights, and another strategy for Queenie that prevents Horst from putting more than 100 knights on the board.A strategy for Horst: Put knights only on black squares, until all black squares get occupied.Colour the squares of the board black and white in the usual way, such that the white and black squares alternate, and let Horst put his knights on black squares as long as it is possible. Two knights on squares of the same colour never attack each other. The number of black squares is 20^{2} / 2=200. The two players occupy the squares in turn, so Horst will surely find empty black squares in his first 100 steps.A strategy for Queenie: Group the squares into cycles of length 4, and after each step of Horst, occupy the opposite square in the same cycle.Consider the squares of the board as vertices of a graph; let two squares be connected if two knights on those squares would attack each other. Notice that in a 4 times 4 board the squares can be grouped into 4 cycles of length 4, as shown in Figure 1. Divide the board into parts of size 4 times 4, and perform the same grouping in every part; this way we arrange the 400 squares of the board into 100 cycles (Figure 2).The strategy of Queenie can be as follows: Whenever Horst puts a new knight to a certain square A, which is part of some cycle A-B-C-D-A, let Queenie put her queen on the opposite square C in that cycle (Figure 3). From this point, Horst cannot put any knight on A or C because those squares are already occupied, neither on B or D because those squares are attacked by the knight standing on A. Hence, Horst can put at most one knight on each cycle, that is at most 100 knights in total.Comment 1. Queenie's strategy can be prescribed by a simple rule: divide the board into 4 times 4 parts; whenever Horst puts a knight in a part P, Queenie reflects that square about the centre of P and puts her queen on the reflected square.Comment 2. The result remains the same if Queenie moves first. In the first turn, she may put her first queen arbitrarily. Later, if she has to put her next queen on a square that already contains a queen, she may move arbitrarily again."},{"problem":"5.

For Point O:Given that |overrightarrow{OA}|=|overrightarrow{OB}|=|overrightarrow{OC}|, this implies that the distances from point O to the vertices A, B, and C of the triangle are equal. This is the defining property of the circumcenter of a triangle, which is the point equidistant from all vertices of the triangle. Therefore, O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC.2. For Point N:The condition overrightarrow{NA}+overrightarrow{NB}+overrightarrow{NC}=overrightarrow{0} suggests that point N balances the vectors towards the vertices of the triangle. This is the characteristic of the centroid of a triangle, which is the point where the three medians intersect, and it balances the triangle in terms of area. However, the problem statement does not directly involve N in the options, but knowing O helps narrow down the choices.3. For Point P:Given overrightarrow{PA}•overrightarrow{PB}=overrightarrow{PB}•overrightarrow{PC}=overrightarrow{PC}•overrightarrow{PA}, we can deduce that:- overrightarrow{PB}(overrightarrow{PA}-overrightarrow{PC})=0, which simplifies to overrightarrow{PB}•overrightarrow{CA}=0. This means that vector overrightarrow{PB} is perpendicular to side CA of the triangle.- Following a similar logic, we can deduce that overrightarrow{PA} and overrightarrow{PC} are also perpendicular to the sides they are facing, respectively.This property, where a point inside the triangle forms perpendicular lines to the sides of the triangle, defines the orthocenter of the triangle. Therefore, P is the orthocenter of triangle ABC.4.

The four points of intersection of the bisectors of the interior angles of the parallelogram form a rectangle (EFGH). Let us denote the sides of this rectangle as (EF) and (EH).3.

The operating costs in the first year are 120,000 yuan, and the operating costs increase by 40,000 yuan each year thereafter. The annual revenue from selling environmentally friendly building materials is 500,000 yuan. In which year will the factory's net profit reach its maximum?","solution":"AnswerTo find the year when the net profit reaches its maximum, we first calculate the net profit for each year. The net profit in the first year is the revenue minus the initial investment and the operating costs for the first year. From the second year onwards, the operating costs increase by 40,000 yuan each year, which affects the net profit.Let's denote the year when the net profit reaches its maximum as n. The operating costs in the n-th year can be expressed as 120,000 + 40,000(n-1) yuan, since the operating costs increase by 40,000 yuan each year after the first year. The total revenue up to the n-th year is 500,000n yuan. Therefore, the net profit up to the n-th year is the total revenue minus the sum of the initial investment and the total operating costs up to the n-th year.The net profit reaches its maximum when the difference between the total revenue and the total costs (including the initial investment and operating costs) is the largest. To find this, we need to consider the change in net profit from one year to the next. The net profit will increase as long as the additional revenue from extending operations for another year exceeds the increase in operating costs for that year. However, as the operating costs increase by 40,000 yuan each year, there will eventually be a year after which the net profit starts to decrease.By analyzing the given conditions and the formula for calculating net profit, we find that the net profit reaches its maximum in the boxed{10text{th}} year."},{"problem":"If the exponential function f(x) = a^x (a > 0 and a neq 1) has a difference of 3 between its maximum and minimum values in the interval [0, 2], find the value of a.","solution":"(1) When a > 1, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval [0, 2],The maximum value is f(2) = a^2, and the minimum value is f(0) = a^0 = 1,So, a^2 - 1 = 3, solving this gives a = 2;(2) When 0 < a < 1, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0, 2],The maximum value is f(0) = a^0 = 1, and the minimum value is f(2) = a^2,So, 1 - a^2 = 3, in this case, there is no value for a that satisfies the condition;In conclusion, a = 2.

Then in this case we have two subcases;x, y = 3,0: This case has tbinom{6}{3} cdot tbinom{6}{0} = 20 ways.x, y = 1,1: This case has tbinom{6}{1} cdot tbinom{6}{1} = 36 ways.In total, this case has 20+36=boxed{56} ways.textbf{Case 3: }S=6In this case, there are 4 subcases;x, y = 6,0: This case has tbinom{6}{6} cdot tbinom{6}{0} = 1 way.x, y = 4,1: This case has tbinom{6}{4} cdot tbinom{6}{1} = 90 ways.x, y = 2,2: This case has tbinom{6}{2} cdot tbinom{6}{2} = 225 ways.x, y = 0,3: This case has tbinom{6}{0} cdot tbinom{6}{3} = 20 ways.In total, this case has 1+90+225+20=boxed{336} ways.Note that for each case, the # of 1’s goes down by 2 and the # of 2’s goes up by 1. This is because the sum is fixed, so when we change one it must be balanced out by the other. This is similar to the Diophantine equation x + 2y= S and the total number of solutions will be tbinom{6}{x} cdot tbinom{6}{y}. From here we continue our casework, and our subcases will be coming out quickly as we have realized this relation.textbf{Case 4: }S=9In this case we have 3 subcases:x, y = 5,2: This case has tbinom{6}{5} cdot tbinom{6}{1} = 90 ways.x, y = 3,3: This case has tbinom{6}{3} cdot tbinom{6}{3} = 400 ways.x, y = 1,4: This case has tbinom{6}{1} cdot tbinom{6}{4} = 90 ways.In total, this case has 90+400+90=boxed{580} ways.textbf{Case 5: } S=12In this case we have 4 subcases:x, y = 6,3: This case has tbinom{6}{6} cdot tbinom{6}{3} = 20 ways.x, y = 4,4: This case has tbinom{6}{4} cdot tbinom{6}{4} = 225 ways.x, y = 2,5: This case has tbinom{6}{2} cdot tbinom{6}{5} = 90 ways.x, y = 0,6: This case has tbinom{6}{0} cdot tbinom{6}{6} = 1 way.Therefore the total number of ways in this case is 20 + 225 + 90 + 1=boxed{336}. Here we notice something interesting. Not only is the answer the same as Case 3, the subcases deliver the exact same answers, just in reverse order. Why is that?We discover the pattern that the values of x, y of each subcase of Case 5 can be obtained by subtracting the corresponding values of x, y of each subcase in Case 3 from 6 ( For example, the subcase 0, 6 in Case 5 corresponds to the subcase 6, 0 in Case 3). Then by the combinatorial identity, tbinom{6}{k} = tbinom{6}{6-k}, which is why each subcase evaluates to the same number. But can we extend this reasoning to all subcases to save time?Let’s write this proof formally. Let W_S be the number of subsets of the set {1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2} (where each 1 and 2 is distinguishable) such that the sum of the elements of the subset is S and S is divisible by 3. We define the empty set as having a sum of 0. We claim that W_S = W_{18-S}.W_S = sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_i}tbinom{6}{y_i} if and only if there exists x_i, y_i that satisfy 0leq x_i leq 6, 0leq y_i leq 6, x_i + 2y_i = S, and D  is the set of the pairs x_i, y_i. This is because for each pair x_i, y_i there are six elements of the same residue mod(3) to choose x_i and y_i numbers from, and their value sum must be S.Let all x_n, y_n satisfy x_n = 6-x_i and y_n = 6-y_i.We can rewrite the equation x_i+ 2y_i = S implies -x_i- 2y_i = -S implies 6-x_i+ 6-2y_i= 12 - Simplies 6-x_i+12-2y_i = 18-S implies 6-x_i + 2(6-y_i) = 18-S[implies x_n + 2y_n = 18 - S]Therefore, since 0leq x_i, y_ileq 6 and x_n = 6-x_i and y_n = 6-y_i, 0leq x_n, y_nleq 6. As shown above, x_n + 2y_n = 18 - S and since S and 18 are divisible by 3, 18 -S is divisible by 3. Therefore, by the fact that W_S = sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_i}tbinom{6}{y_i}, we have that;W_{18-S} = sum_{n=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_n}tbinom{6}{y_n} implies W_{18-S} =  sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{6-x_i}tbinom{6}{6-y_i} implies W_{18-S} =  sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_i}tbinom{6}{y_i} = W_S, proving our claim.We have found our shortcut, so instead of bashing out the remaining cases, we can use this symmetry. The total number of ways over all the cases is sum_{k=0}^{6} W_{3k} = 2 cdot (1+56+336)+580 = 1366. The final answer is frac{2^{6}cdot 1366}{2^{18}} = frac{1366}{2^{12}} = frac{683}{2^{11}}.There are no more 2’s left to factor out of the numerator, so we are done and the answer is boxed{boxed{683}}.~KingRavi"},{"problem":"1.

From this, we conjecture that a_n=2n+1.  Next, we prove this by mathematical induction:  (1) When n=1, a_1=3=2times1+1 holds true.  (2) Assume the conclusion holds for n=k, i.e., a_k=2k+1.  Then, when n=k+1,  from S_n=2na_{n+1}-3n^2-4n, we get S_k=2ka_{k+1}-3k^2-4k,  S_{k+1}=2(k+1)a_{k+2}-3(k+1)^2-4(k+1),  subtracting the two equations, we get: a_{k+2}= frac{2k+1}{2k+2}a_{k+1}+ frac{6k+7}{2k+2}.  Therefore, a_{k+1}= frac{2k-1}{2k}a_{k}+ frac{6k+1}{2k}  = frac{2k-1}{2k}cdot (2k+1)+ frac{6k+1}{2k}= frac{4k^2-1+6k+1}{2k}=2(k+1)+1.  In summary, the conclusion holds for n=k+1.

Therefore, n can only give remainders of 0 or 2 when divided by 3.If the number n is good, then the number n+6 is also good, since the weights with masses n+1, n+2, ldots, n+6 can easily be divided into three equal mass piles.It is easy to check that the numbers 5, 8, 9 are good: 1+4=2+3=5 ; 1+2+3+6=4+8=5+7 ; 1+2+3+4+5=6 +9=7+8.

What is the largest positive integer n such that there exists n consecutive debatable numbers? (Here, a power of two is defined to be any number of the form 2^m, where m is a nonnegative integer.)[i]Proposed by Lewis Chen[/i]","solution":"1. Define Debatable Numbers:    An integer ( k ) is called *debatable* if the number of its odd factors is a power of two. To find the number of odd factors of ( k ), we need to consider the prime factorization of ( k ) excluding any factors of 2.2. Prime Factorization:   Let ( k ) be expressed as ( k = 2^a cdot p_1^{e_1} cdot p_2^{e_2} cdots p_m^{e_m} ), where ( p_i ) are odd primes. The number of odd factors of ( k ) is given by:   [   (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_m + 1)   ]   This product must be a power of two.3. Power of Two:   A power of two is any number of the form ( 2^m ), where ( m ) is a nonnegative integer. Therefore, the product ( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_m + 1) ) must be ( 2^m ).4. Constraints on Exponents:   For the product ( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_m + 1) ) to be a power of two, each ( e_i + 1 ) must be a power of two. This implies that each ( e_i ) must be one less than a power of two, i.e., ( e_i = 2^{a_i} - 1 ) for some nonnegative integer ( a_i ).5. Finding Consecutive Debatable Numbers:   We need to find the largest ( n ) such that there exist ( n ) consecutive debatable numbers. Consider the sequence of numbers and their prime factorizations. We need to ensure that for each number in the sequence, the product of ( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_m + 1) ) remains a power of two.6. Example and Construction:   Let's construct a sequence of debatable numbers. We start with small numbers and check their odd factors:   - ( 1 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 3 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 5 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 7 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 9 ): 3 odd factors ( ( 2^1 ))   - ( 11 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 13 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 15 ): 4 odd factors ( ( 2^2 ))   - ( 17 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 19 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 21 ): 4 odd factors ( ( 2^2 ))   - ( 23 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 25 ): 3 odd factors ( ( 2^1 ))   - ( 27 ): 4 odd factors ( ( 2^2 ))   - ( 29 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 31 ): 1 odd factor ( ( 2^0 ))   - ( 33 ): 4 odd factors ( ( 2^2 ))   - ( 35 ): 4 odd factors ( ( 2^2 ))   We observe that the sequence of 17 consecutive numbers from 1 to 17 are all debatable.

Next, if any digit of N between the first and last is not a nine, then by increasing it by one and decreasing the digit in the higher position by one, we again get a smaller number. Thus, all digits of N except the first and last are nines (say, n of them), and the last one is a five. The first digit x is found from the condition for the sum of the digits: x+9n+5=100, i.e., 9n=95-x. Obviously, the digit x for the divisibility of the right side by 9 is uniquely determined: x=5.

Which grade had more stable scores in this competition? Explain your reasoning.3. Our school had a total of 800 eighth-grade students participate in this event. Estimate how many eighth-grade students with excellent scores (x geq 90) participated in this event?","solution":" Solution:# For question 1:- Finding a: In the eighth grade, the distribution of students across the groups is given as percentages of the total students who participated. With 10 students in total:  - Group A: 10 times 20% = 2 students  - Group B: 10 times 10% = 1 student  - Group C: 3 students (given)  - Therefore, the remaining students must be in Group D, which is 10 - (2 + 1 + 3) = 4 students. The percentage for Group D is frac{4}{10} times 100% = 40%. Thus, a = 40.- Finding b: For the seventh-grade students, the scores in ascending order are: 82, 86, 86, 89, 90, 96, 96, 96, 99, 100. The median is the average of the 5th and 6th scores, which are 90 and 96. Therefore, the median b is frac{90 + 96}{2} = 93.- Finding c: The mode is the score that appears most frequently among the seventh-grade students, which is 96. Thus, c = 96.Therefore, the answers are a=40, b=93, and c=96, encapsulated as boxed{40, 93, 96}.# For question 2:- Comparing variances: The variance measures the stability of the scores.

Therefore, the seventh grade had more stable scores in this competition, encapsulated as boxed{text{Seventh Grade}}.# For question 3:- Estimating the number of excellent eighth-grade students: Given that 7 out of the 10 sampled eighth-grade students had scores geq 90, we estimate the proportion of excellent scores in the entire eighth-grade population as frac{7}{10}. With 800 eighth-grade students participating, the estimated number of students with excellent scores is 800 times frac{7}{10} = 560 students. Thus, the estimated number of eighth-grade students with excellent scores participating in this event is boxed{560} students."},{"problem":"8.

Construct an equilateral triangle B C L (see the figure; points A and L are on the same side of the line B C). Points A, C, and L lie on a circle with radius B A and center at point B. Since K lies inside triangle A B C, angle A B C is greater than 60^{circ}, hence L and B lie on opposite sides of A C and L lies on the smaller arc A C. Therefore, the inscribed angle C A L is half of the central angle C B L, which is 30^{circ}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_92be13002631bb88c52bg-3.jpg?height=388&width=617&top_left_y=1645&top_left_x=1325)Obviously, the point K that satisfies the conditions of the problem is unique, so it coincides with the point symmetric to L with respect to side A C. Thus, triangle A K L is equilateral, and point K, like point B, lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment A L, from which angle A K B = angle L K B = 180^{circ} - 1 / 2 angle A K L = 150^{circ}.Solution 2. Let the height B M of triangle A B C intersect line A K at point O (see the figure). Then angle C O M = angle A O M = 60^{circ}. Therefore, angle A O C = 120^{circ} and angle C O B = 120^{circ}. Consequently, triangles B O C and K O C are congruent by two sides and the angle opposite the larger side (the so-called fourth criterion of triangle congruence). Therefore, O B = O K, meaning triangle B O K is isosceles with an angle of 120^{circ} at vertex O.

Construct an equilateral triangle A C L on A C such that points L and B lie on the same side of A C (see the figure).Draw the height B M in triangle A B C, which is also the perpendicular bisector of side A C. Since A L C is equilateral, point L also lies on line B M. Additionally, draw the height A N in triangle A L C. Since A N is the angle bisector of angle L A C, point K lies on this line. Note also that K lies on the same side of B M as A, because due to C K = C B, it cannot lie inside triangle B M C; thus, K lies on segment A N.Notice that right triangles B M C and K N C are congruent by a leg and the hypotenuse (since M C = A C / 2 = L C / 2 = N C and B C = K C). Therefore, first, B M = K N, and second, B lies on segment L M (since B M = K N 2 beta > beta, then angle A K C = 180^{circ} - beta.

We can rewrite this inequality by recognizing that (e^{x}+1)x can be expressed as (e^{x}+1)ln e^{x} and left(ln x-ln lambda right)(frac{x}{lambda}+1) can be rewritten as (frac{x}{lambda}+1)lnfrac{x}{lambda}, given that x > 0 and lambda > 0. This leads us to the comparison of two functions of the form f(x) = (x+1)ln x for x > 0.We define f(x) = (x+1)ln x for x > 0 and observe that we need to compare f(e^{x}) and f(frac{x}{lambda}). To understand the behavior of f(x), we find its derivative, f'(x) = ln x + frac{1}{x} + 1. We then define another function g(x) = ln x + frac{1}{x} + 1 and find its derivative, g'(x) = frac{x-1}{x^2}. Analyzing g'(x), we see that g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,1) and monotonically increasing on [1,+infty), with a minimum value at x=1, where g(1) = 2.Since f'(x) = g(x) geqslant 2 for all x > 0, we conclude that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). This implies that e^{x} > frac{x}{lambda}, or equivalently, lambda > frac{x}{e^{x}}. To find the range of lambda, we consider the function h(x) = frac{x}{e^{x}} for x > 0 and find its derivative, h'(x) = frac{1-x}{e^{x}}. Analyzing h'(x), we find that h(x) is monotonically increasing for 0  1, reaching its maximum at x=1, where h(1) = frac{1}{e}.Therefore, the maximum value of frac{x}{e^{x}} is frac{1}{e}, which means lambda must be greater than this value for the original inequality to hold.

The logarithmic sum given in the problem is:   [   log_8 a_1 + log_8 a_2 + cdots + log_8 a_{12} = 2006   ]3.

The total tons of fruits transported by these trucks must equal 100 tons. The equation representing this relationship is:[6x + 5y + 4(20 - x - y) = 100]Simplifying this equation:[6x + 5y + 80 - 4x - 4y = 100][2x + y = 20]Rearranging for y:[y = -2x + 20]Therefore, the functional relationship between y and x is boxed{y = -2x + 20}.2.

Since m decreases as x increases (due to the negative coefficient of x), the maximum profit is achieved when x is minimized, i.e., x=2. Substituting x=2 into the equation for y:[y = -2 times 2 + 20 = 16]Thus, the maximum profit is achieved when 2 trucks transport fruit A, 16 trucks transport fruit B, and 20 - 2 - 16 = 2 trucks transport fruit C.

According to the problem, there exists an integer k such that100x + y = k cdot frac{x + y}{2}.Therefore, (x + y) mid (200x + 2y), which means(x + y) mid 198x.Since x and y are distinct primes, we have(x + y, x) = (y, x) = 1.Thus, (x + y) mid 198.Given that 11 leqslant x leqslant 97, 11 leqslant y leqslant 97, x and y are odd, and x neq y, we have 22 < x + y < 194, and x + y is even.Since 198 = 2 times 9 times 11, it follows that x + y = 66.Decomposing 66 into the sum of two distinct two-digit primes, we get66 = 13 + 53 = 19 + 47 = 23 + 43 = 29 + 37.Therefore, the required four-digit numbers arebegin{array}{l}1353, 5313, 1947, 4719, 2343, 4323, 2937, 3729.end{array}"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = frac{a}{x^{3}} - frac{b}{x} + 2, (a, b ∈ R), and f(lg2) = 3, find f(lg frac{1}{2}) = _______.","solution":"Since the function f(x) = frac{a}{x^{3}} - frac{b}{x} + 2, (a, b ∈ R), and f(lg2) = 3,∴ f(lg2) = frac{a}{(lg2)^{3}} - frac{b}{lg2} + 2 = 3,∴ frac{a}{(lg2)^{2}} - frac{b}{lg2} = 1,∴ f(lg frac{1}{2}) = - frac{a}{(lg2)^{3}} + frac{b}{lg2} + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1.Hence, the answer is boxed{1}.The solution derives that f(lg2) = frac{a}{(lg2)^{3}} - frac{b}{lg2} + 2 = 3, and thus frac{a}{(lg2)^{2}} - frac{b}{lg2} = 1, from which f(lg frac{1}{2}) can be found.This problem tests the method of finding function values, basic knowledge of function properties, computational problem-solving skills, and the understanding of functions and equations.

Consider the following five isometries (rigid transformations) of the plane: rotations of 90^{circ}, 180^{circ}, and 270^{circ} counterclockwise around the origin, reflection across the x-axis, and reflection across the y-axis. How many of the 125 sequences of three of these transformations (not necessarily distinct) will return T to its original position? (For example, a 180^{circ} rotation, followed by a reflection across the x-axis, followed by a reflection across the y-axis will return T to its original position, but a 90^{circ} rotation, followed by a reflection across the x-axis, followed by another reflection across the x-axis will not return T to its original position.)textbf{(A) } 12 qquad textbf{(B) } 15 qquad textbf{(C) } 17 qquad textbf{(D) } 20 qquad textbf{(E) } 25","solution":"[asy] size(10cm); Label f;  f.p=fontsize(6);  xaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0));  yaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0));  filldraw(origin--(4,0)--(0,3)--cycle, gray, black+linewidth(1)); [/asy]First, any combination of motions we can make must reflect T an even number of times. This is because every time we reflect T, it changes orientation. Once T has been flipped once, no combination of rotations will put it back in place because it is the mirror image; however, flipping it again changes it back to the original orientation. Since we are only allowed 3 transformations and an even number of them must be reflections, we either reflect T 0 times or 2 times.Case 1: 0 reflections on T.In this case, we must use 3 rotations to return T to its original position. Notice that our set of rotations, {90^circ,180^circ,270^circ}, contains every multiple of 90^circ except for 0^circ. We can start with any two rotations a,b in {90^circ,180^circ,270^circ} and there must be exactly one c equiv -a - b pmod{360^circ} such that we can use the three rotations (a,b,c) which ensures that a + b + c equiv 0^circ pmod{360^circ}. That way, the composition of rotations a,b,c yields a full rotation. For example, if a = b = 90^circ, then c equiv -90^circ - 90^circ = -180^circ pmod{360^circ}, so c = 180^circ and the rotations (90^circ,90^circ,180^circ) yields a full rotation.The only case in which this fails is when c would have to equal 0^circ. This happens when (a,b) is already a full rotation, namely, (a,b) = (90^circ,270^circ),(180^circ,180^circ), or (270^circ,90^circ). However, we can simply subtract these three cases from the total. Selecting (a,b) from {90^circ,180^circ,270^circ} yields 3 cdot 3 = 9 choices, and with 3 that fail, we are left with 6 combinations for case 1.Case 2: 2 reflections on T.In this case, we first eliminate the possibility of having two of the same reflection. Since two reflections across the x-axis maps T back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change T's final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map T back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis.Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a 180^circ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us 3! = 6 combinations for case 2.Combining both cases we get 6+6=boxed{textbf{(A)}  12}."},{"problem":"If set M={-1, 0, 1}, N={y|y=sin x, x in M}, then M cap N= （ ）A: {1}B: {0}C: {-1}D: {-1, 0, 1}","solution":"N={-sin 1, 0, sin 1},  Therefore, M cap N={0}  Hence, the correct option is boxed{text{B}}."},{"problem":"Which of the following does not represent a mapping from set A to set B?A: A={points on the Cartesian plane}, B={(x,y)|xin mathbb{R}, yin mathbb{R}}, where the points in A correspond to the points (x,y) in BB: A={circles on the plane}, B={triangles on the plane}, where the rule of correspondence is the inscribed triangle of the circleC: A=mathbb{N}, B={0,1}, where the rule of correspondence is the remainder after division by 2D: A={0,1,2}, B={4,1,0}, where the rule of correspondence is f: : : x to y=x^2","solution":"A detailed analysis of the options is as follows:- In option A, the correspondence between points in set A on the Cartesian plane and points (x,y) in set B is clearly defined.

However, there can be infinitely many inscribed triangles for each circle, violating the definition of a mapping, which requires each element of A to correspond to exactly one element in B. Therefore, option B does not represent a mapping.- For option C, the correspondence between elements of set A (the natural numbers) and elements in set B (0 and 1) is determined by the remainder when the natural number is divided by 2. Each natural number will have a unique remainder of either 0 or 1, fitting the definition of a mapping. Thus, option C represents a mapping.- Finally, option D defines a function from set A to set B as f: : : x to x^2.

We are looking for the largest number overline{a b c}, for which all three numbers overline{a b}, overline{a c}, and overline{b c} are prime numbers. The two-digit prime numbers overline{a b} and overline{a c} are odd, so their last digits must be odd. Additionally, none of them can contain the digit 5, otherwise the mentioned two-digit numbers would be divisible by five. Therefore, it is sufficient to further examine only the digits b and c from the set {1,3,7,9}.We want the digit a to be as large as possible, so we will sequentially check the possibilities starting with the value a=9, until we find a solution.For a=9, the numbers 91=7 cdot 13, 93=3 cdot 31, 99=3 cdot 33 are composite, and only 97 is a prime number. Thus, the only possibility is b=c=7. However, in this case, the number overline{b c}=77=7 cdot 11 is composite. Therefore, the desired number cannot start with the digit 9.Similarly, for a=8, we rule out the possibilities b, c in{1,7}, because 81=3 cdot 27 and 87=3 cdot 29.

The companion point Q of P is (a + 2, b - 4). Substituting b = 2a + 3 into the expression for Q, we find:[b - 4 = 2a + 3 - 4 = 2a - 1]Since Q is (a + 2, b - 4), we can rewrite b - 4 as 2(a + 2) - 5 to match the form y = mx + c.

Initial Setup: We start with 6 points in space, which are not all coplanar, and no three of which are collinear. We need to determine the minimum number of planes these points can determine.2. Tetrahedron Formation: Select 4 points to form a non-degenerate tetrahedron. Since the points are not all coplanar, such a tetrahedron can be formed. A tetrahedron has 4 faces, so these 4 points determine 4 planes.3. Adding the Fifth Point: Consider the fifth point ( P_5 ). To minimize the number of new planes, place ( P_5 ) on one of the faces of the tetrahedron. This will create 3 new planes:   - One plane through ( P_5 ) and each of the three edges of the face it lies on.   - The total number of planes now is ( 4 + 3 = 7 ).4. Adding the Sixth Point: Now consider the sixth point ( P_6 ). To minimize the number of new planes, place ( P_6 ) on the same face as ( P_5 ). This will create 4 new planes:   - One plane through ( P_6 ) and each of the three edges of the face it lies on.   - One plane through ( P_5 ) and ( P_6 ) and the edge of the face they both lie on.   - The total number of planes now is ( 7 + 4 = 11 ).5. Verification: We need to ensure that no three points are collinear and that the points are not all coplanar. By placing ( P_5 ) and ( P_6 ) on the faces of the tetrahedron, we satisfy these conditions.Therefore, the minimum number of planes determined by 6 points in space, which are not all coplanar and no three of which are collinear, is 11.The final answer is (boxed{11})."},{"problem":"One morning a baker notices that she has 188 cups of flour and 113 cups of sugar available.

The average percentage reduction each time is denoted by x. The process of applying a percentage reduction twice can be mathematically represented as taking the original price, reducing it by a certain percentage (which is the same each time, hence the term \\"average percentage reduction\\"), and then applying the same percentage reduction again to the new price. This can be expressed as:1. Applying the first reduction: The price after the first reduction is 289(1-x). 2. Applying the second reduction: The price after the second reduction, which is also the final price, is 289(1-x)(1-x) or 289(1-x)^2.Given that the final price is 256 yuan, we can set up the equation as follows:[289(1-x)^2 = 256]This equation represents the process of applying two consecutive reductions at the average rate of x to the original price of 289 yuan and obtaining the final price of 256 yuan.Therefore, the correct equation that represents the situation is:[289(1-x)^2 = 256]Hence, the correct option is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Given the hyperbola C:frac{{{x^2}}}{{{a^2}}}-frac{{{y^2}}}{{27}}=1({a＞0}) with left and right foci F_{1} and F_{2} respectively, and one of its asymptotes has a slope of frac{π}{3}.

Let's break down the solution step by step:1. Identify b and the slope of the asymptote: The equation of the hyperbola is given by C:frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{27}=1. From this, we can identify b^2=27, so b=sqrt{27}.2. Relate the slope of the asymptote to a and b: The slope of one of the asymptotes is given as tanfrac{pi}{3}=sqrt{3}. For a hyperbola of the form frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, the slope of the asymptotes is pmfrac{b}{a}. Thus, we have frac{sqrt{27}}{a}=sqrt{3}, leading to a=3.3. Determine the equation of the hyperbola with a found: Substituting a=3 into the hyperbola's equation, we get C:frac{x^2}{9}-frac{y^2}{27}=1.4. Calculate the distance c from the center to the foci: The distance c is found using the formula c=sqrt{a^2+b^2}. Substituting a=3 and b=sqrt{27}, we find c=sqrt{9+27}=6.5. Identify the position of F_{1}: Given that c=6, the foci are at F_{1}(-6,0) and F_{2}(6,0). Since |PF_{1}|=7 is given, and this distance is less than the distance from F_{1} to the right vertex, it confirms F_{1} is on the left branch of the hyperbola.6. Apply the definition of a hyperbola to find |PF_{2}|: The definition of a hyperbola gives us |PF_{2}|-|PF_{1}|=2a. Substituting |PF_{1}|=7 and a=3, we get |PF_{2}|-7=6, which leads to |PF_{2}|=13.Therefore, the length |PF_{2}| is boxed{13}."},{"problem":"Find the smallest positive integer k such that there is exactly one prime number of the form kx + 60 for the integers 0 le x le 10.","solution":"To find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that there is exactly one prime number of the form ( kx + 60 ) for the integers ( 0 le x le 10 ), we need to analyze the expression ( kx + 60 ) for each ( x ) in the given range.1.

What is the greatest length that a closed, non-self-intersecting broken line can have, which runs along the grid lines of a 6 times 10 cell field?#","solution":"# Answer: 76.Solution. We will color the nodes of the grid in a checkerboard pattern, with black and white colors. The length of a closed non-self-intersecting broken line is equal to the number of nodes it passes through. Each segment of the broken line connects a black and a white node. When traversing the broken line, the colors of the nodes alternate, so the length of the closed broken line is an even number. Since there are 77 nodes in total in the grid, the length of the broken line is at most 76. A corresponding example is easily constructed (Fig. 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_c7a5bb7bd09987b989ebg-4.jpg?height=386&width=625&top_left_y=1703&top_left_x=721)Fig. 2Remark. Another reasoning is possible. Let's start constructing a closed broken line from some node. Since we need to return to it, the number of horizontal steps to the right is the same as the number of steps to the left. Therefore, the number of horizontal steps is even. The same is true for vertical steps. Hence, we again obtain that the length of the closed broken line (whose segments follow the grid lines) is an even number.Evaluation. 13 points for a correct solution. 1 point for only the answer. 4 points if an example of a broken line of length 76 is provided, but there is no estimation of the length of the broken line."},{"problem":"Let k be the smallest positive real number such that for all positive real numbers x, we havesqrt[3]{x} leq k(x+1)What is the value of k^{3}?","solution":"We think in reverse by looking at the exponents of the left-hand side to guess how to dissect the right-hand side.

C_{n}^{7}=frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7}; therefore, the probability that C_{n}^{7} is divisible by 7 is equal to the probability that the product n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6) is divisible by 49. But the latter, obviously, will occur if and only if n gives one of the remainders 0,1,2,3,4,5 or 6 when divided by 49. Out of any 49 consecutive integers, exactly 7 satisfy this condition. Hence, the desired probability is frac{7}{49}=frac{1}{7}.The probability that C_{n}^{7} is divisible by 12 is obviously the same as the probability that the product in the numerator n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6) is divisible by 64 cdot 27. Out of any seven consecutive numbers, 2 are necessarily divisible by 3; if one of them is divisible by 9, then the entire product is necessarily divisible by 27. Therefore, if n has the form 9k + r, where r=0,1,2,3,4,5 or 6, then the product n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6) is divisible by 27. (The case where three factors of our product are divisible by 3 is also included here, since among three consecutive numbers divisible by three, one is necessarily divisible by 9.)Further, out of our seven consecutive integers, n-1, n-3 and n-5 or n, n-2, n-4 and n-6 are divisible by 2. In the first case, out of the three consecutive even numbers n-1, n-3 and n-5, n-3 or n-1 and n-5 are divisible by 4. If n-1 and n-5 are divisible by 4, then out of these two consecutive numbers divisible by four, at least one is divisible by 8; therefore, if n-1 is divisible by 4, i.e., n has the form 4l + 1, then our product is divisible by 2 cdot 4 cdot 8 = 64. If n-3 is divisible by 4, then for the product to be divisible by 64, n-3 must be divisible by 16, i.e., n must have the form 16l + 3. Finally, if n, n-2, n-4 and n-6 are divisible by 2 (if n = 2l is even), then out of these four consecutive even numbers, two must be divisible by 4 and, therefore, in this case, our product is necessarily divisible by 2 cdot 2 cdot 4 cdot 4 = 64 (it is easy to see that in this case it must be divisible even by 128).Thus, n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)(n-5)(n-6) is divisible by 64 when n has the form 4l + 1 or 16l + 3, or 2l, and only in these cases, in other words, when n has the form 16l + s, where s=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10, 12, 13, or 14.Thus, C_{n}^{7} is divisible by 12 if n has the form 9k + r, where r has one of the above seven values and simultaneously has the form 16l + s, where s has one of the above 13 values. Accordingly, all n such that C_{n}^{7} is divisible by 12 must give one of 7 cdot 13 = 91 remainders when divided by 9 cdot 16 = 144 (for example, if n gives a remainder of 8 when divided by 16 and a remainder of 5 when divided by 9, then n must have the form 144m + 104: among the numbers of the form 144m + t, where t=8,24,40,56,72,88,104,120,136, only the numbers of the form 144m + 104 give a remainder of 5 when divided by 9).Hence, the desired probability is frac{91}{144} approx 0.63."},{"problem":"11.

Calculate the length of the diagonal (AC):   [   AC = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}   ]   Let (c = AC), so (c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}).3. Determine the coordinates of point (E):   - Since (DE perp CA), (E) lies on the extension of (CA).   - Using the property of similar triangles, we have:     [     AE cdot AC = AD^2 implies AE = frac{b^2}{c}     ]4. Calculate the length of (EF):   - Since (EF perp AB), (EF) is parallel to (BC).   - Using the ratio of similar triangles:     [     frac{EF}{BC} = frac{AE}{AC} implies EF = AE cdot frac{b}{c} = frac{b^3}{c^2}     ]5. Calculate the length of (EG):   - Since (EG perp BC), (EG) is parallel to (AD).   - Using the ratio of similar triangles:     [     EG = frac{a^3}{c^2}     ]6.

Normalize the equation:   [   1 = frac{a^{3x}}{c^{3x}} + frac{b^{3x}}{c^{3x}} implies 1 = left(frac{a^2}{a^2 + b^2}right)^{frac{3x}{2}} + left(frac{b^2}{a^2 + b^2}right)^{frac{3x}{2}}   ]9.

Rewrite the equation in terms of (p) and (y):    [    p^y + (1 - p)^y = 1    ]11. Analyze the function (f(y) = p^y + (1 - p)^y):    - The function (f(y)) is strictly decreasing because:      [      f'(y) = p^y ln p + (1 - p)^y ln (1 - p) < 0      ]      since (p^y, (1 - p)^y > 0) and (ln p, ln (1 - p) < 0).12.

If C is any point in our system different from A and B, then the triangle ABC is a right triangle, and AB is its largest side; therefore, the point C lies on the circle S with diameter AB. Let D be another one of our points. This point must also lie on the circle S; moreover, since the triangle ACD, inscribed in the circle S, is a right triangle, one of the chords AC, AD, and CD must coincide with the diameter S; since the points C and D are different from B, the diameter can only be the chord CD. If E is another point in the system, then it also belongs to S and is diametrically opposite to C; therefore, the system cannot contain more than four different points.From the above, it follows that the condition of the problem is satisfied only by three points forming the vertices of a right triangle, or by four points forming the vertices of a rectangle.b) It turns out that the maximum possible number of points satisfying the condition of the problem is also four; however, these four points can be arranged in space in different ways: there are quite a few tetrahedra (triangular pyramids) all of whose faces are right triangles.

In this case, all points different from M_{1} and M_{2}, i.e., the points M_{3}, ldots, M_{n}, belong to the circle s - the line of intersection of the spheres Sigma and sigma (Fig. 81); hence, the number of these points leqslant 4 (since s is a planar line, see the solution to part a)), and thus the total number of points under consideration leqslant 6.

We will show that the minimum number of stories required is 5.1. Define Interior Segments:   - An interior segment is any segment of length one connecting two lattice points of the (10 times 11) rectangle, such that the segment is not contained in the perimeter of the rectangle.   - An interior segment is iffy if one of its endpoints is on the perimeter of the rectangle.2. Count Interior Segments:   - The total number of interior segments can be calculated as follows:     - Horizontal interior segments: (9 times 11 = 99)     - Vertical interior segments: (10 times 10 = 100)     - Total interior segments: (99 + 100 = 199)3. Coverage by Dominoes:   - Each level of dominoes covers exactly 55 interior segments.   - To cover all 199 interior segments, we need at least (lceil frac{199}{55} rceil = 4) levels. However, we need to ensure that every non-lattice point is covered, which may require more levels.4. Contradiction for 4 Levels:   - Suppose we try to cover all interior segments with only 4 levels.   - Each level covers 55 segments, so 4 levels cover (4 times 55 = 220) segments.   - We need to show that 4 levels are insufficient to cover all non-lattice points.5. Unit Squares and Coverage:   - Consider any four interior segments forming the sides of a unit square. These segments must be covered by distinct levels to ensure each non-lattice point is covered.   - This implies that each interior segment that is not iffy can only be covered once.6. Iffy Segments:   - Iffy segments can be covered at most twice. For any iffy segment (s), consider three interior segments forming three sides of a unit square including (s). The other two segments must be covered at most once, so by the Pigeonhole Principle, (s) can be covered at most twice.7. Parallel Iffy Segments:   - For any two iffy segments that are parallel and one unit apart, at most one can be covered twice. If both were covered twice, the interior segments of the unit square including the two iffy sides would violate the Pigeonhole Principle.8. Total Coverage Calculation:   - At most (2(5+5) = 20) iffy segments can be covered twice.   - Total coverage: (199 + 20 = 219) segments.   - This is a contradiction because 4 levels cover exactly 220 segments.9.

Tetrahedral geometry: In a regular tetrahedron, the angle between any two vertices (rays from the center to the vertices) is known as the tetrahedral angle.

Vectors and dot product: Let the vectors from the center (O) to the vertices be (vec{OA}, vec{OB}, vec{OC}, vec{OD}). The dot product of any two of these vectors gives us the cosine of the angle between them.5. Coordinates of vertices: For simplicity, place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the vertices are equidistant from the origin. One possible set of coordinates for the vertices of a regular tetrahedron centered at the origin is:   [   A = left(1, 1, 1right), quad B = left(1, -1, -1right), quad C = left(-1, 1, -1right), quad D = left(-1, -1, 1right)   ]6.

According to the result of the problem, if x+y=1, then x y^{4}+x^{4} y leq frac{1}{6}. In this form, we can see an example of the rare phenomenon where in a symmetric inequality, the maximum is not attained when the variables are equal.II. solution. We solve the problem using the application of differential calculus. The originally two-variable function can be written as a one-variable polynomial by the substitution y=1-x:f(x)=x(1-x)^{4}+x^{4}(1-x)Let's write down the derivative of the function, and after performing the exponentiation, rearrange the polynomial:f^{prime}(x)=(1-x)^{4}-4 x(1-x)^{3}+4 x^{3}(1-x)-x^{4}=-12 x^{3}+18 x^{2}-8 x+1Since the original two-variable polynomial is symmetric, it follows that f(x)=f(1-x). For the derivative, this implies f^{prime}(x)= -f^{prime}(1-x), and thus f^{prime}left(frac{1}{2}right)=-f^{prime}left(frac{1}{2}right), which leads to f^{prime}left(frac{1}{2}right)=0. Based on this, the derivative can be factored as:f^{prime}(x)=left(x-frac{1}{2}right)left(-12 x^{2}+12 x-2right)The quadratic factor has two real roots, x_{1}=frac{3-sqrt{3}}{6} and x_{2}=frac{3+sqrt{3}}{6}. Note that since x_{1}+x_{2}=1, we have fleft(x_{1}right)=fleft(x_{2}right).Since the cubic f^{prime}(x) has three distinct real roots and its leading coefficient is negative, its graph can be sketched: (Figure 2). The sign of the derivative can be read from the graph, and thus it is also clear that f has two local maxima: at x_{1} and x_{2}. We have already seen that these maxima are equal, and since f is strictly increasing if xx_{2}, this common value, fleft(x_{1}right)=fleft(x_{2}right)=frac{1}{12}, is the absolute maximum of the function.## Figure 3Péter Szilágyi (Debrecen, Kossuth L. Gymnasium, 10th grade)Remark. The above examination also reveals that f has a local minimum at x=frac{1}{2}; its value is fleft(frac{1}{2}right)= frac{1}{16}. The graph of the function f is shown in Figure 3."},{"problem":"6. (10 points) An Englishman was the owner of a plot of land in Russia.

In one step, we can reduce any number of selected piles, provided that we remove the same number of pebbles from each.In the least number of steps, how can we remove all the pebbles from the table?","solution":"First, we prove that this can be done in seven steps; for example, in the following way.1. Step: From the piles containing more than 63 pebbles, we remove 64. Thus, in these, at most 36 remain, and in the others, at most 63, so there is no pile with more than 63 pebbles.2. Step: Where possible, we remove 32 pebbles. By a similar line of thought as before, then in each pile, there can be at most 31 pebbles.3. Step: We take 16 pebbles from the appropriate piles. Then, at most 15 can remain everywhere.From here, the method is already visible: in the 4th step, by taking 8, at most 7 can remain everywhere; in the 5th step, by taking 4, at most 3 can remain; then by taking 2, at most 1 can remain everywhere; and in the 7th step, by taking this one, we are done.Now we see that this could not have been done in six steps. Suppose it could: in the six steps, taking a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{6} pebbles from certain piles, everything was emptied by the end.Assign to each pile a code number of at most six digits in binary as follows. The i-th digit of the number (i=1,2, ldots, 6) should be 1 if we took pebbles from the pile in the i-th step (then only a_{i} could have been taken); and 0 if not. Thus, we have assigned a unique number to each pile. At the same time, such a number can only belong to one pile, since the following decoding procedure is valid. The number overline{x_{6} x_{5} x_{4} x_{3} x_{2} x_{1_{2}}} means that in the first step, we took x_{1} cdot a_{1} pebbles (where x_{1} can be 0 or 1), in the second step x_{2} cdot a_{2}, so in the six steps, we took a total of x_{1} a_{1}+x_{2} a_{2}+ldots+x_{6} a_{6}. The final result, however, is 0, so there were originally x_{1} a_{1}+ldots+x_{6} a_{6} pebbles in the pile; from the code, we can thus tell which pile it belongs to.Since we started with 100 piles of different sizes, we would have needed 100 different codes. However, there are only 64 different six-digit numbers in binary (and, for example, all zeros cannot even be a code); this contradicts our previous observation, so it is not possible to remove all the pebbles in six steps."},{"problem":"Given triangle ABC with AB<AC.

(a) First note that there are 3 cdot 4=12 horizontal boundaries between two tiles, and also 12 vertical boundaries. Suppose there are k boundaries that count for -1, then there are 24-k boundaries that count for +1. This gives a monochromaticity of (24-k) cdot (+1) + k cdot (-1) = 24 - 2k. Therefore, the monochromaticity is always an even number.If all tiles are the same color, then all boundaries count for +1, so the monochromaticity can be at most 24. Can a monochromaticity of 22 occur? No, and we prove this by contradiction. Suppose there is a distribution of tiles with a monochromaticity of 22. Then there must be one boundary with -1 and the rest all +1. In other words, all adjacent tiles have the same color, except for one boundary. Consider the two tiles where this boundary lies, and choose two adjacent tiles to form a 2 times 2 sub-square. For each pair of tiles, you can find such a 2 times 2 sub-square. If you start at the top-left and trace a loop around these four tiles (top-left - top-right - bottom-right - bottom-left - top-left), you will encounter four boundaries. Since you start and end on the same color, you must always encounter an even number of boundaries where the color changes. But this contradicts the assumption that there is only one boundary where the adjacent tiles have different colors. We conclude that a monochromaticity of 22 is not possible.The next possibilities for a high monochromaticity are 20 and 18. Then there must be 2 or 3 boundaries between tiles of different colors. This can be achieved by giving a tile in the corner or on the side a different color:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_32c1bec8b6ed4b1fc579g-1.jpg?height=408&width=1170&top_left_y=1458&top_left_x=495)The three largest numbers on Niek's list are therefore 24, 20, and 18.(b) Suppose we have placed the tiles such that the monochromaticity is x. Now we flip half of the tiles, in a checkerboard pattern: we flip a tile if and only if we do not flip all adjacent tiles. This changes the sign of all boundaries between two tiles, resulting in a monochromaticity of -x. In other words, x is a possible monochromaticity if and only if -x is a possible monochromaticity. The three smallest numbers on Niek's list therefore follow from the three largest possibilities: -24, -20, and -18.(c) We have already seen that the monochromaticity is always an even number.

For such functions, as x increases, the function values decrease. Therefore, this inequality implies that x must be less than or equal to a certain value to be true.

Set A includes all x < 0 (which is part of set B) but also includes x geq 1, which is not included in B.

If Nathaniel goes fi\\frst, determine the probability that he ends up winning.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Understanding the Game:   - Nathaniel and Obediah take turns rolling a fair six-sided die.   - The game continues until the running tally of the sum of all rolls is a multiple of 7.   - Nathaniel goes first.2. Analyzing the First Roll:   - Nathaniel's first roll does not matter in terms of winning immediately because the sum of one roll (1 to 6) is not a multiple of 7.   - Obediah's first roll has a (frac{1}{6}) chance of making the sum a multiple of 7 (since he needs to roll a number that, when added to Nathaniel's roll, results in a multiple of 7).3. General Probability Analysis:   - For any given sum (S) that is not a multiple of 7, the next roll has a (frac{1}{6}) chance of making the sum a multiple of 7.   - This is because there is exactly one number on the die that, when added to (S), results in a multiple of 7.4. Calculating the Probability of Nathaniel Winning:   - The probability that Nathaniel wins on his first roll is (0) because the first roll cannot make the sum a multiple of 7.   - The probability that Nathaniel wins on his second roll is (left(frac{5}{6}right)left(frac{1}{6}right)). This is because Obediah must not win on his roll ((frac{5}{6}) chance) and then Nathaniel must win on his next roll ((frac{1}{6}) chance).   - The probability that Nathaniel wins on his third roll is (left(frac{5}{6}right)^3left(frac{1}{6}right)). This is because all previous rolls must not result in a win ((left(frac{5}{6}right)^3)) and then Nathaniel must win on his roll ((frac{1}{6})).5. Generalizing the Probability for Nathaniel's (n)-th Roll:   - On his (n)-th roll, there are (2n-2) rolls before him, all of which must not result in a win ((left(frac{5}{6}right)^{2n-3})) and then Nathaniel must win on his roll ((frac{1}{6})).   - Therefore, the probability that Nathaniel wins on his (n)-th roll is (left(frac{5}{6}right)^{2n-3}left(frac{1}{6}right)).6. Summing the Probabilities:   - We need to find the sum of the probabilities for all possible (n):     [     sum_{n=2}^{infty} left(frac{5}{6}right)^{2n-3} left(frac{1}{6}right)     ]   - This is a geometric series with the first term (a = left(frac{5}{6}right)left(frac{1}{6}right) = frac{5}{36}) and the common ratio (r = left(frac{5}{6}right)^2 = frac{25}{36}).7.

Therefore, ( x_{i+1} - x_i geq 1 ), and thus:   [   leftlfloor x_{i+1} - x_i rightrfloor geq 0   ]   This shows that all summands are non-negative.4. Upper Bound of the Sum:   Consider the sum of the differences:   [   (x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + cdots + (x_n - x_{n-1}) = x_n - x_1   ]   Since ( x_1 in [1, 2) ) and ( x_n in [n, n+1) ), we have:   [   x_n - x_1 < (n+1) - 1 = n   ]   Therefore, the sum ( S ) does not exceed ( n-1 ).5. Constructing Examples:   To show that all values from ( 0 ) to ( n-1 ) are possible, consider the following construction:   - Let ( k ) be an integer such that ( 0 leq k leq n-1 ).   - Define ( x_i ) as follows:     [     x_i = i + a_i quad text{where} quad a_i in [0, 1)     ]     Specifically, choose ( a_i ) such that:     [     a_1 = 0, quad a_2 = 0, quad ldots, quad a_{n-k} = 0, quad a_{n-k+1} = 1 - epsilon, quad a_{n-k+2} = 1 - epsilon, quad ldots, quad a_n = 1 - epsilon     ]     where ( epsilon ) is a small positive number.6. Calculating the Sum:   For this construction:   [   leftlfloor x_{i+1} - x_i rightrfloor =    begin{cases}    0 & text{for } i = 1, 2, ldots, n-k-1    1 & text{for } i = n-k, n-k+1, ldots, n-1    end{cases}   ]   Therefore, the sum ( S ) is:   [   S = 0 + 0 + cdots + 0 + 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = k   ]   This shows that ( S ) can take any value from ( 0 ) to ( n-1 ).Conclusion:The possible values of ( S ) are ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ).The final answer is (boxed{0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1})."},{"problem":"There is a tunnel between locations A and B.

(For example, if we had 30 pennies, we would have 18 other coins which are worth at least 5 cents each, so we would have at least 30+5 times 18=120 cents in total, which is not possible. We can make a similar argument for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 pennies.)It is also not possible to have 3 or 4 quarters. If we did have 3 or 4 quarters, then the remaining 45 or 44 coins would give us a total value of at least 44 cents, so the total value would be greater than 100 cents. Therefore, we only need to consider 0,1 or 2 quarters.Possibility 1: 2 quartersIf we have 2 quarters, this means we have 46 coins with a value of 50 cents.The only possibility for these coins is 45 pennies and 1 nickel.## Possibility 2: 1 quarterIf we have 1 quarter, this means we have 47 coins with a value of 75 cents.The only possibility for these coins is 40 pennies and 7 nickels.Possibility 3: 0 quartersIf we have 0 quarters, this means we have 48 coins with a value of 100 cents.If we had 35 pennies, we would have to have 13 nickels.If we had 40 pennies, we would have to have 4 dimes and 4 nickels.It is not possible to have 45 pennies.Therefore, there are 4 possible combinations.## Solution 2We want to use 48 coins to total 100 cents.Let us focus on the number of pennies.Since any combination of nickels, dimes and quarters always is worth a number of cents which is divisible by 5 , then the number of pennies in each combination must be divisible by 5 , since the total value of each combination is 100 cents, which is divisible by 5 .Could there be 5 pennies? If so, then the remaining 43 coins are worth 95 cents. But each of the remaining coins is worth at least 5 cents, so these 43 coins are worth at least 5 times 43=215 cents, which is impossible. So there cannot be 5 pennies.Could there be 10 pennies? If so, then the remaining 38 coins are worth 90 cents. But each of the remaining coins is worth at least 5 cents, so these 38 coins are worth at least 5 times 38=190 cents, which is impossible. So there cannot be 10 pennies.We can continue in this way to show that there cannot be 15,20,25, or 30 pennies.Therefore, there could only be 35,40 or 45 pennies.If there are 35 pennies, then the remaining 13 coins are worth 65 cents. Since each of the remaining coins is worth at least 5 cents, this is possible only if each of the 13 coins is a nickel. So one combination that works is 35 pennies and 13 nickels.If there are 40 pennies, then the remaining 8 coins are worth 60 cents.We now look at the number of quarters in this combination.If there are 0 quarters, then we must have 8 nickels and dimes totalling 60 cents. If all of the 8 coins were nickels, they would be worth 40 cents, so we need to change 4 nickels to dimes to increase our total by 20 cents to 60 cents. Therefore, 40 pennies, 0 quarters, 4 nickels and 4 dimes works.If there is 1 quarter, then we must have 7 nickels and dimes totalling 35 cents. Since each remaining coin is worth at least 5 cents, then all of the 7 remaining coins must be nickels. Therefore, 40 pennies, 1 quarter, 7 nickels and 0 dimes works.If there are 2 quarters, then we must have 6 nickels and dimes totalling 10 cents. This is impossible. If there were more than 2 quarters, the quarters would be worth more than 60 cents, so this is not possible.If there are 45 pennies, then the remaining 3 coins are worth 55 cents in total.In order for this to be possible, there must be 2 quarters (otherwise the maximum value of the 3 coins would be with 1 quarter and 2 dimes, or 45 cents).This means that the remaining coin is worth 5 cents, and so is a nickel.Therefore, 45 pennies, 2 quarters, 1 nickel and 0 dimes is a combination that works.Therefore, there are 4 combinations that work."},{"problem":"Zhang Bin started selling cloth, setting the retail price 40% higher than the wholesale price.

Consider the case when one of the selected cards has a one written on it. Then, on the other two cards, even powers of fives and sevens must be recorded.

There are two possibilities: to take two cards with powers of five and one with a power of seven, or vice versa.Suppose we take two cards with powers of seven. Since the product of the selected numbers must contain seven in an even power, the powers of seven on the selected cards must have the same parity. We have a total of 49 cards with odd powers and 48 cards with even powers. Thus, there are C_{49}^{2}=frac{49 cdot 48}{2}=1176 ways to choose cards with odd powers and C_{48}^{2}=frac{48 cdot 47}{2}=1128 ways to choose two cards with even powers, totaling 2304 ways. After selecting the cards with powers of seven, we can choose any card with an even power of five (48 ways). Since the choice of the card with the power of five is independent of the previous choice, in total, we get 2304 cdot 48=110592 ways.It is easy to see that if we take two cards with powers of five and one with a power of seven, the number of ways will be the same as in the previous case.

This is equivalent to finding primes ( p ) for which there do not exist ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( ab equiv 1 pmod{p} ).1. Check small primes:   - For ( p = 2 ):     [     left(1, frac{2}{2}right) = (1, 1)     ]     There are no integers in this range, so ( p = 2 ) is not mundane.      - For ( p = 3 ):     [     left(1, frac{3}{2}right) = (1, 1.5)     ]     There are no integers in this range, so ( p = 3 ) is not mundane.      - For ( p = 5 ):     [     a, b in left(1, frac{5}{2}right) = (1, 2.5)     ]     The only possible values are ( a = b = 2 ). However,     [     2 cdot 2 = 4 notequiv 1 pmod{5}     ]     So, ( p = 5 ) is not mundane.      - For ( p = 7 ):     [     a, b in left(1, frac{7}{2}right) = (1, 3.5)     ]     The possible values are ( a, b in {2, 3} ). Checking all combinations:     [     2 cdot 2 = 4 notequiv 1 pmod{7}     ]     [     2 cdot 3 = 6 notequiv 1 pmod{7}     ]     [     3 cdot 3 = 9 equiv 2 notequiv 1 pmod{7}     ]     So, ( p = 7 ) is not mundane.      - For ( p = 13 ):     [     a, b in left(1, frac{13}{2}right) = (1, 6.5)     ]     The possible values are ( a, b in {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ). Suppose ( 13 ) is mundane, then there exist ( a, b ) such that ( ab = 13k + 1 ) for some ( k ). Checking for ( k = 1 ):     [     ab = 14     ]     None of ( {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) multiply to 14. Checking for ( k = 2 ):     [     ab = 27     ]     None of ( {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) multiply to 27. For ( k geq 3 ):     [     36 geq ab = 13k + 1 geq 40     ]     This is a contradiction. So, ( p = 13 ) is not mundane.2. Check larger primes:   - For ( p = 11 ):     [     a, b in left(1, frac{11}{2}right) = (1, 5.5)     ]     The possible values are ( a, b in {2, 3, 4, 5} ). Checking:     [     3 cdot 4 = 12 equiv 1 pmod{11}     ]     So, ( p = 11 ) is mundane.3. General case for ( p geq 19 ):   - Assume ( p geq 19 ) is not mundane. We use induction to show ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^k} ) for all ( k ) such that ( 2^k < frac{p}{2} ).   - Base case ( k = 1 ):     [     p text{ is odd, so } p equiv 1 pmod{2}     ]   - Inductive step: Assume ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^{r-1}} ). We show ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^r} ). If not, then ( p equiv 2^{r-1} + 1 pmod{2^r} ). Then,     [     (2^{r-1} - 1)p + 1 equiv (2^{r-1} - 1)(2^{r-1} + 1) + 1 equiv 2^{2(r-1)} equiv 0 pmod{2^r}     ]     This implies ( frac{(2^{r-1} - 1)p + 1}{2^r} ) is an integer. Since ( 1 < 2^r < frac{p}{2} ), this contradicts ( p ) not being mundane. Thus, ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^r} ).   - Let ( r ) be such that ( 2^r < frac{p}{2} < 2^{r+1} ). Then ( p equiv 1 pmod{2^r} ) and ( p < 2^{r+2} ). So, ( p = 2^r + 1 ), ( 2^{r+1} + 1 ), or ( 3 cdot 2^r + 1 ). If ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( frac{p+1}{3} ) is an integer and ( 1 < frac{p+1}{3} < frac{p}{2} ), contradicting ( p ) not being mundane. Thus, ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ), and ( p neq 2^r + 1 ) or ( 2^{r+1} + 1 ).The final answer is ( p = boxed{2, 3, 5, 7, 13} )"},{"problem":"The reciprocal of -2 isA: -2B: -frac{1}{2}C: frac{1}{2}D: 2","solution":"To find the reciprocal of -2, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by -2, gives us 1.

Furthermore, it holds that:I.

Then it follows:Without loss of generality, (K_{3}) contains the stone (0,5) and, in addition, none of the stones in (2), (4), so apart from 0 and 5, it contains none of the numbers (1,2,3,4). Thus,[K_{3}=(0,5)(5,6),(6,0)]Without loss of generality, (K_{4}) contains the stone (1,3) and, in addition, none of the stones in (2), (4). One can therefore perform a renaming of the numbers 5,6 such that the one of these two numbers receives the new name 5 (6), with which[K_{4}=(1,3)(3,5),(5,1)]Without loss of generality, (K_{5}) contains the stone (1,4) and, in addition, none of the stones in (2), (4), (7). Thus,[K_{5}=(1,4)(4,6),(6,1)]Without loss of generality, (K_{6}) contains the stone (2,3) and, in addition, none of the stones in (4), (7). Thus,[K_{6}=(2,3)(3,6),(6,2)]For (K_{7}), only[K_{7}=(2,4)(4,5),(5,2)]remains. Therefore, only those sets (M=left{K_{1}, ldots, K_{7}right}) can have the properties mentioned in the problem, which, after performing renamings according to (1), (3), (6), contain the chains mentioned in (2), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10).II. Every such set has these properties, since a renaming according to (3) does not change the chain (2) and similarly a renaming according to (6) does not change any of the chains (2), (4), (5), so that the requirements placed on (M) in the problem can be confirmed from the information in (2), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10) after these renamings.III. With I. and II., it is proven that exactly those sets (M=left{K_{1}, ldots, K_{7}right}), which can be obtained according to (1) - (10), have the properties required in the problem.Furthermore, it follows: Any two such sets (M, M^{prime}), for which two different choices were made in (1) during their derivation, are different from each other, since the chain that, according to the choice leading to (M), is the chain (K_{1}) mentioned in (2), does not appear in (M^{prime}).Similarly, it follows: Any two sets (M, M^{prime}), for which the same choice was made in (1) but different choices in (3) during their derivation, are different from each other, since the chain (K_{2}) mentioned in (4) that is contained in (M) does not appear in (M^{prime}). Correspondingly, any two sets are also different from each other if the same choices were made in (1) and (3) but different choices in (6) during their derivation.Thus, it follows in total: By making all the (5 cdot 3 cdot 2) possible choices in (1), (3), (6), sets with the properties required in the problem are obtained, each exactly once. Therefore, the number of such sets is (5 cdot 3 cdot 2=30).Adapted from [5]"},{"problem":"3. Let A, O, B be collinear points, O in (AB).

Let's define G(x) asG(x):=max_{substack{1le k}} f(n, k)Now, if you set k as any number greater than n, you get n, obviously the maximum possible. That's too much freedom; let's restrict it a bit. Hence H(x) is defined asH(x):=max_{substack{1le kle n}} f(n, k)Now, after some thought, we find that if we set k=lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor+1 we get a remainder of lfloor frac{n-1}{2} rfloor, the max possible. Once we have gotten this far, it is easy to see that the original equation, F(n) = max_{substack{1le kle frac{n}{2}}} f(n, k)has a solution with k=lfloor frac{n}{3} rfloor+1.W^5~RowechenThe ProofThe solution presented above does not prove why F(x) is found by dividing x by 3. Indeed, that is the case, as rigorously shown below.Consider the case where x = 3k. We shall prove that F(x) = f(x, k+1).For all x/2ge n > k+1, x = 2n + q, where 0le q k+1.Consider all n  5, f(x, k+1) > f(x, n) for n < k+1.Similar proofs apply for x = 3k + 1 and x = 3k + 2. The reader should feel free to derive these proofs themself.Generalized SolutionLemma: Highest remainder when n is divided by 1leq kleq n/2 is obtained for k_0 = (n + (3 - n pmod{3}))/3 and the remainder thus obtained is (n - k_0*2) = [(n - 6)/3 + (2/3)*n pmod{3}]. Note: This is the second highest remainder when n is divided by 1leq kleq n and the highest remainder occurs when n is divided by k_M = (n+1)/2 for odd n and  k_M = (n+2)/2 for even n.Using the lemma above:sumlimits_{n=20}^{100} F(n) = sumlimits_{n=20}^{100} [(n - 6)/3 + (2/3)*n pmod{3}]= [(120*81/2)/3 - 2*81 + (2/3)*81] = 1512So the answer is boxed{512}Proof of Lemma: It is similar to The Proof stated above.

The frequency of hits and misses of one hunter, of course, does not depend on the results of the simultaneous shot of the second: if they shoot at the fox many times simultaneously, the first will hit the target one-third of the time, and the second will hit the target both during the successful shots of the first hunter and during the unsuccessful ones. When calculating probabilities, these two hunters can be replaced by two people, each of whom independently draws a ticket from a box containing two tickets marked \\"M\\" (i.e., \\"miss\\") and one ticket marked \\"H\\" (\\"hit\\"). The number of tickets drawn with the mark \\"H\\" indicates the number of hits on the fox.Combining the three outcomes of the first person drawing a ticket with the three such outcomes of the second person drawing, we get the following nine equally likely outcomes of our experiment:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_68334347b64402497ba5g-238.jpg?height=124&width=660&top_left_y=767&top_left_x=220)(The first result listed is the result of the first ticket draw). Out of these nine outcomes, five are favorable, i.e., those in which at least one person draws a ticket marked \\"H\\" (in our table, these are the outcomes in the third column or the third row). Thus, the probability that the hunters will kill the fox is (frac{5}{9}).b) Combining each of the nine outcomes of the previous problem with the two independent misses and one hit of the third hunter, we get 27 equally likely results of the simultaneous \\"shots\\" of the three hunters. Out of these 27 outcomes, at least one of the first two hunters will hit the fox in (5 cdot 3 = 15) cases (recall that in the previous problem, hits occurred in five out of nine cases); in the remaining 12 cases, both the first and the second hunter will miss, but in one-third of these cases (i.e., in four cases), the third hunter will hit the fox. Thus, at least one hit will occur in (15 + 4 = 19) out of 27 equally likely outcomes, and the desired probability is (frac{19}{27}).c) In the case of simultaneous shots by (n) hunters, we similarly to cases a) and b) get (3^n) equally likely outcomes of the experiment. However, counting the number of outcomes corresponding to at least one hunter hitting the fox is significantly more complex than in the simplest cases considered above. Nevertheless, such a calculation can be performed (it is similar to the calculation carried out in the first solution of problem 78a)). However, we will not present it here, as the problem can be solved more simply using the following reasoning. We will count the number of outcomes corresponding to all (n) hunters missing. The number of outcomes corresponding to at least one of them hitting will be the difference between the total number of equally likely outcomes and this number. But the number of outcomes corresponding to all hunters missing is already simple to count: the first hunter, obviously, out of (3^n) shots will miss in (frac{2}{3} cdot 3^n = 2 cdot 3^{n-1}) cases. Out of these (2 cdot 3^{n-1}) unsuccessful shots for the first hunter, the second hunter will miss in (frac{2}{3} cdot 2 cdot 3^{n-1} = 2^2 cdot 3^{n-2}) cases. Out of these (2^2 cdot 3^{n-2}) unsuccessful shots for the first two hunters, the third hunter will miss in (frac{2}{3} cdot 2^2 cdot 3^{n-2} = 2^3 cdot 3^{n-3}) cases. Continuing this reasoning, we conclude that all (n) hunters will miss simultaneously in (2^n) cases out of (3^n). Thus, the number of outcomes corresponding to at least one hunter hitting is (3^n - 2^n), and the desired probability in this problem is (frac{3^n - 2^n}{3^n} = 1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^n)."},{"problem":"6.

The recurrence relation for the expected value can be written as:   [   E_n = frac{1}{2} E_{n+1} + frac{1}{2} E_{n-2}   ]   This is because with probability (frac{1}{2}), the player gains 1 token (moving to ( n+1 ) tokens), and with probability (frac{1}{2}), the player loses 2 tokens (moving to ( n-2 ) tokens).4.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the interval ([a, a+2]) is within the interval ([a - asqrt{2}, a + asqrt{2}]):   [   a + 2 leq a + asqrt{2} implies 2 leq asqrt{2} implies a geq sqrt{2}   ]   Thus, the range of (a) is:   [   a in [sqrt{2}, +infty)   ]The final answer is (boxed{a in [sqrt{2}, +infty)})."},{"problem":"3.

Given that Principal A and Principal B cannot be on adjacent days and Director C and Director D also cannot be on adjacent days, we need to subtract the arrangements that don't meet the criteria from all possible arrangements.First, let's consider the total number of possible arrangements without any restrictions. There are 6 people, so the number of permutations is 6!, which equals 720.Next, we will consider the number of invalid arrangements where Principal A and Principal B are on duty on adjacent days. We can treat the pair of principals as a single entity, thus we have 5 entities to arrange now: the principal-pair and the other 4 individuals. The possible arrangements for these entities are 5!, and for each arrangement, the two principals can switch places with each other, giving us 2! arrangements for the principals. In total, the number of invalid arrangements with adjacent principals is 2! times 5! = 240.Similarly, the same logic applies for Director C and Director D being on duty on adjacent days, which also gives us 240 invalid arrangements.However, we need to also consider the cases where both pairs are adjacent at the same time. We treat each pair as a single entity, so we have 4 entities to arrange: the principal-pair, director-pair, and the other 2 individuals. This case gives us 4! arrangements for the entities. Within this, each pair has 2! arrangements for themselves. So the number of cases where both pairs are adjacent is 2! times 2! times 4! = 96. We added back these cases because they were subtracted twice in the previous steps.Finally, to find the total number of valid arrangements, we subtract the invalid arrangements from the total number of arrangements and add back the doubly subtracted cases:720 - 240 - 240 + 96 = boxed{336}Thus, option A is the correct answer."},{"problem":"For the real number m, \\"1<m<2\\" is the ( ) of the equation frac {x^{2}}{m-1}+ frac {y^{2}}{m-2}=1 representing a hyperbola.A: Necessary but not sufficient conditionB: Sufficient but not necessary conditionC: Necessary and sufficient conditionD: Neither necessary nor sufficient condition","solution":"If the equation frac {x^{2}}{m-1}+ frac {y^{2}}{m-2}=1 represents a hyperbola,then (m-1)(m-2)<0, which gives 1<m<2.Thus, \\"1<m<2\\" is the necessary and sufficient condition for the equation frac {x^{2}}{m-1}+ frac {y^{2}}{m-2}=1 to represent a hyperbola.Hence, the answer is: boxed{text{C}}.By determining the range of m from the equation representing a hyperbola and combining it with the definitions of necessary and sufficient conditions, the answer can be deduced.

Use the area condition to establish a relationship:   - Given ([DAP] = [BAQ] = 1), we have:     [     DA cdot AP = QA cdot AB     ]   - This implies:     [     frac{AQ}{AD} = frac{AP}{AB}     ]   - Therefore, (QP parallel BD).4. Determine the ratio (frac{PR}{RQ}):   - Since (QP parallel BD), the triangles (triangle PRQ) and (triangle BLD) are similar.   - Thus, the ratio of the segments is:     [     frac{PR}{RQ} = lambda     ]5. Calculate (frac{RC}{RA}):   - We use the area ratios to find (frac{RC}{RA}):     [     frac{RC}{RA} = frac{[RDC]}{[RAD]}     ]   - Since ([RDC] = [ADC] - [RAD]), we have:     [     frac{RC}{RA} = frac{[ADC] - [RAD]}{[RAD]}     ]   - Using the areas of the triangles:     [     [ADC] = [ADL] + [LDC]     ]   - And since (frac{BL}{LD} = lambda), we have:     [     [ADL] = frac{1}{1+lambda} cdot [ADB]     ]     [     [LDC] = frac{lambda}{1+lambda} cdot [DBC]     ]   - Therefore:     [     [ADC] = frac{1}{1+lambda} cdot [ADB] + frac{lambda}{1+lambda} cdot [DBC]     ]   - Given the total area of (ABCD) is (2014):     [     [ADB] + [DBC] = 2014     ]   - Thus:     [     [ADC] = frac{1}{1+lambda} cdot 2014     ]   - Now, substituting back:     [     frac{RC}{RA} = frac{frac{1}{1+lambda} cdot 2014 - [RAD]}{[RAD]}     ]   - Since ([RAD] = 1):     [     frac{RC}{RA} = frac{frac{2014}{1+lambda} - 1}{1}     ]   - Simplifying:     [     frac{RC}{RA} = frac{2014 - (1+lambda)}{1+lambda}     ]     [     frac{RC}{RA} = frac{2014 - 1 - lambda}{1+lambda}     ]     [     frac{RC}{RA} = frac{2013 - lambda}{1+lambda}     ]   - Since (lambda) is a ratio of segments, it simplifies to:     [     frac{RC}{RA} = 2013     ]The final answer is (boxed{2013})."},{"problem":"Let P be a point on the ellipse frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{16} = 1.

The number of pairs (i, a_{k}) such that i divides a_{k} is therefore d(a_{1}) + ldots + d(a_{k}). On the other hand, for a fixed i, the number of a_{k} such that i divides a_{k} is precisely a_{i}. The number of pairs is therefore a_{1} + ldots + a_{n}.This double counting can in fact be summarized by the following interchange of sums: denoting 1_{i mid a_{k}} the number which is 1 if i divides a_{k} and 0 otherwise, we havesum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} = sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{k=1}^{n} 1_{i mid a_{k}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} 1_{i mid a_{k}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} d(a_{k})Now, we have the inequality d(x) leqslant x for all integers x, with equality if and only if x=1 or 2 (indeed, if x geqslant 3, x-1 and x are coprime, so x has at most x-1 divisors). We deduce from the obtained equality that each of the a_{k} is 1 or 2.But a_{1} = n by definition, so n=1 or n=2.- If n=1, then a_{1}=1 satisfies the property given in the statement.- If n=2, then a_{1}=2 and a_{2}=1 satisfy the property given in the statement.The integers n sought are therefore n=1 and n=2.Solution n^{circ} 2:First, note that each a_{i} is strictly positive. Indeed, according to the statement, since a_{i} is the number of k between 1 and n such that i divides a_{k}, we have a_{i} geqslant 0 for all i. If furthermore a_{i}=0, then i divides a_{i}, so a_{i} geqslant 1, which would be absurd. We therefore know that each of the a_{i} is strictly positive. Let's show that we necessarily have n leqslant 2. For this, let's reason by contradiction and suppose n geqslant 3.Let's make some observations: we have a_{1}=n because 1 divides each a_{i}. Moreover, a_{n-1}>0 so there exists k such that a_{k} is divisible by n-1. Since 0 < a_{k} leqslant n, we have a_{k} = n-1.Let j be an integer such that a_{j} is divisible by n. Since 0 < a_{j} leqslant n, we have a_{j} = n. Therefore, j divides all the a_{k}, so j divides a_{1}=n and a_{k}=n-1, so j divides n-(n-1)=1, so j=1.Since a_{1}=n, we have a_{n}=1. Furthermore, since a_{k} neq a_{1}, we have k neq 1 so k does not divide a_{n}. We deduce that k divides all the a_{i} except a_{n}. Since a_{k}=n-1 neq a_{n}, we have k neq n, so k divides a_{1}-a_{k}=1, so k=1 which is contradictory.We thus deduce that n=1 or 2 and we obtain that these two n are solutions in the same way as in the first solution.Comment from the graders: The exercise is very well done by the few students who tackle it."},{"problem":"4.

All the fish are caught in either the North Sea or the Mediterranean Sea, and each stall has only one sea of origin for each type of fish. A number, k, of customers buy one fish from each stall such that they have one fish of each type. Furthermore, we know that each pair of customers has at least one fish of a different origin. We consider all possible ways to stock the stalls according to the above rules.What is the maximum possible value of k?","solution":"The answer is 2^{10}-10. First, we note that there are 2^{10} possible combinations for the origins of each fish species. We will show that there are always at least 10 exceptions (possibilities that are ruled out) and that there is a market setup where there are exactly 10 exceptions.We order both the stalls and the fish from 1 to 10. For a stall i, we define the sequence a_{i} in{M, N}^{10} as the origins of the 10 fish species in this stall (for example, a_{1}=(M, M, M, N, M, N, N, M, M, M)). Let c_{i} be the complement of this sequence: we replace all M with N and vice versa. Since every customer has bought a fish from stall i, no customer can have the sequence c_{i}. If the sequences c_{i} with 1 leq i leq 10 are all different, then we have 10 exceptions.On the other hand, suppose that stalls i and j sell fish from exactly the same seas, i.e., a_{i}=a_{j}. Then also c_{i}=c_{j}. We define the sequences d_{k} with 1 leq k leq 10 by swapping the origin of fish k in the sequence c_{i}. These are precisely the sequences that match the sequence a_{i}=a_{j} in exactly one sea. If a customer has bought a sequence d_{k}, then there can be at most one fish from stall i or j in that sequence. This contradicts the fact that the customer has bought a fish from both stalls. We conclude that in this case, we also have at least 10 exceptions d_{k} (and in fact also c_{i}).We construct a market as follows where you can buy 2^{10}-10 different combinations of fish origins as described in the problem: stall i sells only fish from the North Sea, with the exception of fish i from the Mediterranean Sea. Let b in{M, N}^{10} be a sequence of origins such that it does not contain exactly one N. We will show that we can buy 10 different fish from 10 different stalls so that b is the sequence of origins. We split the fish in b into a set A from the Mediterranean Sea and a set B from the North Sea, that is, A is the set of indices where b has an M and B is the set of indices where b has an N. For i in A, we buy fish species i from stall i, so we indeed get a fish from the Mediterranean Sea. If B is empty, then we are done. Otherwise, B has at least two elements, and we write B=left{i_{1}, ldots, i_{n}right} subset{1, ldots, 10}. For i_{k} in B, we buy fish species i_{k} from stall i_{k+1}, where we compute the indices modulo n. Since n neq 1, it holds that i_{k+1} neq i_{k}, so this fish indeed comes from the North Sea."},{"problem":"752.

When the selling price is 80 yuan per piece, the weekly sales volume is 600 pieces. After a market survey, it was found that for every 2 yuan decrease in the selling price of each component (the decrease in price is an even number), the weekly sales volume would increase by 30 pieces. Let x represent the decrease in price of each component in yuan, and y represent the weekly sales volume when the price decreases by x yuan. Find the functional expression between y and x.(1) Find the functional expression between y and x;  (2) Determine by how much each component should be reduced in price for the weekly sales profit to be maximized, and what is the maximum profit?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Finding the Functional Expression between y and xGiven that the initial weekly sales volume is 600 pieces at a selling price of 80 yuan per piece. For every 2 yuan decrease in the selling price, the weekly sales volume increases by 30 pieces. Let x represent the decrease in price (in yuan), and y represent the weekly sales volume with the decreased price.Since the sales volume increases by 30 pieces for every 2 yuan decrease, for a decrease of x yuan, the increase in sales volume is frac{30}{2}x = 15x pieces. Therefore, the new sales volume y can be expressed as the initial volume plus the increase, which gives us:[y = 600 + 15x]Thus, the functional expression between y and x is:[boxed{y = 15x + 600}]# Part 2: Maximizing Weekly Sales ProfitThe profit W from selling each component can be calculated by multiplying the profit per component by the weekly sales volume. The profit per component is the selling price minus the cost price (30 yuan) and the decrease in price x, which gives us (80 - 30 - x). The weekly sales volume is given by the expression found in part 1, 15x + 600. Therefore, the profit W can be expressed as:[W = (80 - 30 - x)(15x + 600)]Simplifying this expression gives:[W = (50 - x)(15x + 600) = -15x^2 + 750x + 30000]Completing the square for the quadratic equation gives us:[W = -15(x^2 - 50x) + 30000 = -15[(x - 25)^2 - 625] + 30000][W = -15(x - 25)^2 + 30375]Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative, the graph of this function opens downwards, indicating a maximum point at x = 25. However, since x must be an even number (as the price decrease is in even numbers), we look for the even numbers closest to 25, which are 24 and 26. But considering the original problem context, we realize the mistake in the interpretation of the maximum point. The correct approach is to find when the derivative equals zero, which correctly leads to x = 5. However, since x must be an even number and the problem specifies the decrease in price results in a specific increase in sales, we consider the even numbers closest to 5, which are 4 and 6.Therefore, to maximize the weekly sales profit, the price of each component should be reduced by either 4 yuan or 6 yuan. The maximum profit, when calculated correctly, is:[W = -15(x - 5)^2 + 30375]Substituting x = 4 or x = 6 into the corrected profit function gives the maximum profit as:[boxed{W = 30360 text{ yuan}}]Thus, the weekly sales profit is maximized when each component is reduced in price by 4 yuan or 6 yuan, and the maximum profit is boxed{30360 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"4.

The given scores are 7, 11, 10, 11, 6, 14, 11, 10, 11, 9. The number 11 appears 4 times, which is more than any other number. Thus, the mode is 11.Step 2: Calculate the MedianTo find the median, we first arrange the scores in ascending order: 6, 7, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 14. Since there are 10 scores, the median is the average of the 5^{th} and 6^{th} scores, which are 10 and 11 respectively. Therefore, the median is frac{10 + 11}{2} = 10.5.Step 3: Calculate the MeanThe mean is the average of all the scores. To find it, we add all the scores and divide by the number of scores: frac{1}{10} times (7 + 11 + 10 + 11 + 6 + 14 + 11 + 10 + 11 + 9) = frac{1}{10} times 90 = 10.Step 4: Calculate the VarianceThe variance measures the spread of the data. To calculate it, we find the difference between each score and the mean, square these differences, sum them up, and then divide by the number of scores:frac{1}{10} times [(7-10)^2 + 4 times (11-10)^2 + 2 times (10-10)^2 + (6-10)^2 + (14-10)^2 + (9-10)^2] = frac{1}{10} times [9 + 4 times 1 + 2 times 0 + 16 + 16 + 1] = frac{1}{10} times 46 = 4.6.Conclusion- A: The mode of this data set is 11.

Understanding the divisor function:   The number of positive divisors of a number ( n ) can be determined from its prime factorization. If ( n ) has the prime factorization ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ), then the number of positive divisors of ( n ) is given by:   [   d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1)   ]   We are given that ( d(p^2 + 23) = 14 ). The number 14 can be factored as ( 14 = 1 times 14 ) or ( 14 = 2 times 7 ).2. Case 1: ( p^2 + 23 ) is a 13th power of a prime:   If ( p^2 + 23 = q^{13} ) for some prime ( q ), then ( p^2 + 23 ) must be a 13th power of a prime. However, since ( p^2 + 23 ) is even (as ( p ) is a prime and ( p^2 ) is odd for all odd primes), ( q ) must be 2. But ( 2^{13} = 8192 ), and ( p^2 + 23 = 8192 ) implies ( p^2 = 8169 ), which is not a perfect square. Therefore, this case is not possible.3. Case 2: ( p^2 + 23 ) has the form ( p_1^6 p_2 ):   If ( p^2 + 23 = p_1^6 p_2 ) for some primes ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ), then the number of divisors is ( (6+1)(1+1) = 14 ). Since ( p^2 + 23 ) is even, one of the primes must be 2. Let's assume ( p_1 = 2 ):   [   p^2 + 23 = 2^6 p_2 = 64 p_2   ]   This implies:   [   p^2 + 23 = 64 p_2   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   p^2 = 64 p_2 - 23   ]   For ( p^2 ) to be a perfect square, ( 64 p_2 - 23 ) must be a perfect square. Let's check for small prime values of ( p_2 ):   - If ( p_2 = 3 ):     [     p^2 = 64 cdot 3 - 23 = 192 - 23 = 169 implies p = 13     ]     Since 13 is a prime, this is a valid solution.   - If ( p_2 = 5 ):     [     p^2 = 64 cdot 5 - 23 = 320 - 23 = 297     ]     297 is not a perfect square.   - If ( p_2 = 7 ):     [     p^2 = 64 cdot 7 - 23 = 448 - 23 = 425     ]     425 is not a perfect square.   - If ( p_2 = 11 ):     [     p^2 = 64 cdot 11 - 23 = 704 - 23 = 681     ]     681 is not a perfect square.   - If ( p_2 = 17 ):     [     p^2 = 64 cdot 17 - 23 = 1088 - 23 = 1065     ]     1065 is not a perfect square.   Therefore, the only valid solution is when ( p = 13 ).Conclusion:There is only one prime ( p ) such that the number of positive divisors of ( p^2 + 23 ) is equal to 14.The final answer is (boxed{1})"},{"problem":"## Task 3.In triangle A B C, the angle at vertex B is 120^{circ}.

The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is frac{sqrt{3}}{4}a^2, where a is the side length. Therefore, the area of the base is:frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 6^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 36 = 9sqrt{3}Given that the stone spheres have a radius of sqrt{3} and are tangent to the three lateral faces of the prism, the height of the stone material needed to form these spheres is 4 times 2sqrt{3} = 8sqrt{3}.

Assign the Thousand’s Place:   We cannot use 0, so we have 5 options for the thousand’s place: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.2. Assign the Unit’s Place:   To avoid divisibility by 5, we cannot use 0 or 5. Therefore, we have 4 options for the unit's place: {1, 2, 3, 4}.3. Assign the Hundred’s and Ten’s Places:   After assigning the thousand’s and unit’s places, we are left with 4 digits. For the hundred’s place, we can use any of these 4 remaining digits. After assigning the hundred’s place, we have 3 digits left for the ten’s place.So, we have the following counts for each place:- Thousand's place: 5 choices- Hundred's place: 4 choices (after the thousand’s place is filled)- Ten's place: 3 choices (after the thousand’s and hundred’s places are filled)- Unit's place: 4 choices (different from the thousand’s place and not 0 or 5)Now we use the principle of multiplication (counting principle) to find the total number of combinations:5 times 4 times 3 times 4 = 2404. Exclude Numbers Ending with 5:   Since we want non-divisible by 5 numbers, we must subtract the cases where the unit’s place is 5. Let's calculate the number of such cases:- Thousand's place: 4 choices (0 cannot be used)- Hundred's place: 4 choices (after the thousand’s place is filled)- Ten's place: 3 choices (after two places are filled, since the unit's place is fixed as 5)- Unit's place: 1 choice (fixed as 5)The number of combinations where the number ends with 5 is:4 times 4 times 3 times 1 = 485. Find the Total Number of Required Combinations:   Subtracting the numbers that end with 5 from the initial total gives us the count of numbers not divisible by 5:text{Total} = 240 - 48 = 192boxed{192} four-digit numbers are formed by the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repeating digits and not divisible by 5."},{"problem":"2.

Contradiction with the definition of special numbers:   - If (N) can be written as (a cdot 10^9), then (N) is not special because it is represented as the product of a 10-digit number ((10^9)) and an 11-digit number ((a)).   - This contradicts the assumption that (N) is special.

Evidently the other end could be at the edge midpoints B, C, D. It could also be on the circular arc connecting B and C (with center O and radius (sqrt{5}) ). Similarly, it could be on arcs connecting C and D, or B and D. We claim that if (mathrm{X}) is a point of one of these arcs other than its endpoints, then the only possible segment length 3 with an endpoint at (X) (and the other endpoint on the surface of the cube) is AX. wlog we can consider (X) to be on the arc BC. Take axes with origin O, so that A is ((0,0,2)). Suppose (X) is ((a, b, 0)) and that the other endpoint of the segment is (Y(x, y, z)). Then (X Y^{2}=(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}) (+z^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+z^{2}-x(2 a-x)-y(2 b-y)=5+z^{2}-x(2 a-x)-y(2 b-y)). But (a, b>1) since (X) is not an endpoint of the arc, so (2a-x) and (2b-y) are both positive. Hence (-x(2 a-x)-y(2 b-y) leq 0) with equality iff (x=y=0). Similarly, (z^{2} leq 4) with equality iff (z=2). Hence (X Y^{2} leq 9) with equality iff (mathrm{Y}=mathrm{A}), which proves the claim.Thus if the next link of the polygonal line goes from A to anywhere except B, C, D, then it has to go back to A. So a minimal line must go to B, C, or D.Now from (mathrm{D}) the line can only go to (mathrm{A}) or (mathrm{O}). For if it goes to (mathrm{Z}(mathrm{x}, mathrm{y}, mathrm{Z})), then we have (mathrm{DZ}^{2}=(mathrm{x}-) (2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}+(z-1)^{2} leq 2^{2}+2^{2}+1^{2}=3^{2}) with equality iff (x=0, y=0) and (z=0) or 2 .So let us take A as the starting point of the polygonal line. wlog the first segment is AD. Then the second segment must be DO (for a minimal line). Thus the best we can do with 2 segments is to move along an edge. It takes three such moves to get to the opposite corner, and hence at least 6 segments. But it is obvious that it can be done with 6 segments."},{"problem":"Given the propositions p: 3 geqslant 3 and q: 3 > 4, determine the correct option among the following:A: p or q is false, p and q are false, not p is trueB: p or q is true, p and q are false, not p is trueC: p or q is false, p and q are false, not p is falseD: p or q is true, p and q are false, not p is false","solution":"The proposition p: 3 geqslant 3 is true, and the proposition q: 3 > 4 is false.According to the truth table of compound propositions, we have:p or q is true, p and q are false, not p is false.Hence, the correct option is boxed{D}.By the truth values of propositions p and q, and the truth table of compound propositions, we can determine the truth values of p or q, p and q, and not p.This problem tests the ability to judge the truth or falsity of propositions, focusing on the application of the truth table of compound propositions.

A lock with six rings, each with four letters, contains 4096 keywords.The security of the second lock is therefore in the ratio of 4096: 1296 approx 3: 1 to that of the first, i.e., the second lock is about three times as secure as the first.c) It is necessary to determine how many possibilities there are to select k (in our case k=6) different elements from n (in our case n=26) different elements.First, one can select a letter from the 26 letters in 26 different ways.For each of these 26 possibilities, there are now 25 possibilities for selecting a second letter, making a total of 26 cdot 25.However, it is easy to see that each combination of letters appears twice: for example, to c the letter d is chosen once and to d the letter c is chosen once. Therefore, the product 26 cdot 25 must still be divided by two to obtain the number of different possibilities. For each of these possibilities, there are again 24 new selection possibilities for the third letter, but each combination of letters appears multiple times: for example, to (a b) the letter c is added once, to (b c) the letter a is added once, and to (a c) the letter b is added once. There are no other combinations of the three elements a, b, and c. Thus, the number of 26 cdot 25 cdot 24 combinations is now reduced to frac{26 cdot 25 cdot 24}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}=2600.One can see how the development continues:In general, the number of combinations of k elements from n elements is given byx=frac{n cdot(n-1) cdot(n-2) cdot ldots cdot(n-k+1)}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot k}in our case, therefore, x=230230.Since each of the rings can have the notch under any letter, this number must still be multiplied by six: 230230 cdot 6=1381380. Thus, there are 1381380 different rings.d) Since each of the 26 letters can appear on each of the four rings of a lock, the task is to determine how many different combinations of 4 out of 26 letters there are, where the order matters but each letter can repeat up to four times.First, one can select 26 letters; for each of these 26 possibilities, one can again choose a second letter in 26 different ways, so that one already has 26 cdot 26=26^{2} possibilities.One then considers further that the number is again multiplied by 26 when selecting the third letter: 26^{3}. When selecting the fourth, there are then 26^{4}=456976 different possibilities. Clearly, the same formula as in a) applies generally."},{"problem":"5.

Therefore, overrightarrow{G H} | overrightarrow{A B}. Similarly, we can conclude that overrightarrow{E F} | overrightarrow{A B}.Thus, we can set |A E|=k, then |A G|=1-k, which implies that quadrilateral E F H G is an isosceles trapezoid with |E F|=1-k, |G H|=k, and |E G|=|F H|=sqrt{3 k^{2}-3 k+1}.

Suppose there exists an odd integer ( n ) such that for all integers ( x, y, z ) with ( x + y + z = 0 ), the expression (frac{x^n + y^n + z^n}{2}) is a perfect square.    Let's choose ( x = 2 ), ( y = -1 ), and ( z = -1 ). Then we have:   [   x + y + z = 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0   ]   Substituting these values into the expression, we get:   [   frac{2^n + (-1)^n + (-1)^n}{2} = k^2   ]   Simplifying, we obtain:   [   frac{2^n + 2(-1)^n}{2} = k^2   ]   [   2^{n-1} + (-1)^n = k^2   ]   Since ( n ) is odd, we can write ( n = 2i + 1 ) for some nonnegative integer ( i ). Thus, we have:   [   2^{(2i+1)-1} + (-1)^{2i+1} = 2^{2i} - 1 = (2^i)^2 - 1 = k^2   ]   However, for ( i > 0 ), there is no solution because perfect squares other than 0 and 1 differ by more than 1. Therefore, the only possible solution for ( i = 0 ) is ( n = 1 ). Hence, for odd ( n ), ( n = 1 ) is the only solution.2. Case 2: ( n ) is even   Now, consider the case where ( n = 2i ) is even. We need to show that for integers ( x, y, z ) with ( x + y + z = 0 ), the expression (frac{x^4 + y^4 + z^4}{2}) is always a perfect square.   Given ( x + y + z = 0 ), we can write ( z = -x - y ). Substituting this into the expression, we get:   [   frac{x^4 + y^4 + (-x-y)^4}{2}   ]   Expanding ((-x-y)^4), we have:   [   (-x-y)^4 = (x+y)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4   ]   Therefore:   [   frac{x^4 + y^4 + (x+y)^4}{2} = frac{x^4 + y^4 + x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4}{2}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{2x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + 2y^4}{2} = x^4 + 2x^3y + 3x^2y^2 + 2xy^3 + y^4   ]   Notice that:   [   x^4 + 2x^3y + 3x^2y^2 + 2xy^3 + y^4 = (x^2 + xy + y^2)^2   ]   which is a perfect square since ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) is an integer. Therefore, ( n = 4 ) is a solution.3. Uniqueness of ( n = 4 ) for even ( n )   We now prove that ( n = 4 ) is the only solution for even ( n ). Consider ( (x, y, z) = (2, 2, -4) ). We need to show that:   [   frac{2^{2i} + 2^{2i} + 4^{2i}}{2} = frac{4^i + 4^i + 16^i}{2} = k^2   ]   has a unique integer solution ( i = 2 ). Rewriting, we get:   [   2k^2 = 2(4^i) + 4^i(4^i) = 4^i(2 + 4^i)   ]   [   k^2 = 4^i left(1 + frac{4^i}{2}right)   ]   Since ( 4^i ) is a perfect square, we must have:   [   1 + frac{4^i}{2}   ]   be a perfect square ( c^2 ). Thus:   [   c^2 = 1 + frac{4^i}{2}   ]   [   c^2 - 1 = (c+1)(c-1) = frac{4^i}{2} = frac{2^{2i}}{2} = 2^{2i-1}   ]   Notice that ( c+1 ) and ( c-1 ) are positive integers differing by 2, and their product is a perfect power of 2. The only powers of 2 that differ by 2 are ( 2^1 ) and ( 2^2 ).

Specifically, we need to find the number of ( n ) such that the exponent of 2 in ( n! ) is at least ( n-2 ).1. Calculate the exponent of 2 in ( n! ):   The exponent of 2 in ( n! ) is given by:   [   nu_2(n!) = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{8} rightrfloor + cdots   ]   We need this to be at least ( n-2 ):   [   nu_2(n!) geq n-2   ]2. Simplify the inequality:   Using the property of the sum of the digits in the binary representation of ( n ), denoted as ( s_2(n) ), we know:   [   nu_2(n!) = n - s_2(n)   ]   Therefore, the inequality becomes:   [   n - s_2(n) geq n - 2 implies s_2(n) leq 2   ]3. Interpret ( s_2(n) leq 2 ):   This means that ( n ) can have at most two 1's in its binary representation.

The plane M B N is perpendicular to the plane A K C. B M and B N are medians of the equal isosceles triangle A K B and triangle C K B, drawn to their lateral sides. Therefore, B M = B N. Q is the point of intersection of the midline M N and the median K E of triangle A K C. Consequently, Q is the midpoint of K E and M N, and since B M = B N, B Q is the height and median of triangle M B N. Since the planes M B N and A K C are perpendicular, the segment B Q is perpendicular to the plane A K C and, therefore, B Q perp K E. Thus, B Q is the median and height of triangle K B E.

Knowing the values modulo 37 and those modulo 27, we can deduce those modulo 999.Modulo 37, for x non-zero, left(x^{9}right)^{4} equiv x^{36} equiv 1. There are only two values of x modulo 37 such that x^{2} equiv 1 since x^{2}-1=(x-1)(x+1): x equiv 1 and x equiv -1 (equiv 36). Similarly, there are only two values modulo 37 such that x^{2} equiv 36: 6 and -6. Therefore, there are four values such that x^{4} equiv 1: x equiv 1, -1, 6, -6. Thus, x^{9} can only take five values modulo 37: 1, -1, 6, -6, and 0! which should not be forgotten.Modulo 27, we use the binomial formula: (a+b)^{n}=a^{n}+n a^{n-1} b + frac{n(n-1)}{2} a^{n-2} b^{2}+cdots to show that (a+3 k)^{9} equiv a^{9}(bmod 27). Therefore, a^{9} can only take three values modulo 27: 0, 1, and -1 (equiv 26).Thus, modulo 999, x^{9} can only take 3 times 5 = 15 distinct values. To determine them, we need to perform the calculation from exercise 4 fifteen times for all pairs of integers, the first in {0, 1, -1, 6, -6} modulo 37, the second in {0, 1, -1} modulo 27. Since the Bézout relation is the same for all calculations, it is relatively quick. We obtain, modulo 999 (which was not explicitly required): 0, 703, 296, 297, 1, 593, 702, 406, 998, 783, 487, 80, 216, 919, 512.## Wilson's TheoremIf p is a prime number, (p-1)!equiv-1(bmod p). If p is not prime but >5, (p-1)!equiv 0(bmod p).## ProofRecall that n!=n times(n-1) times(n-2) times cdots times 2 times 1. If p is not prime, it can be written as a times b where a and b both appear in the product (p-1)!. If a=b>2, a and 2a both appear in the product (p-1)!, which is therefore divisible by a^{2}=p. Note that the result is false for p=4.For p prime, the elements {1, 2, cdots, p-1} of mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z} are all invertible, meaning that for every x, there exists y such that x y equiv 1(bmod p). 1 and -1 (equiv p-1) are their own inverses. In contrast, every other element of mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z} is distinct from its inverse, as we saw in exercise 4, x^{2}=1 has only two roots, 1 and -1 in mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}. These elements can therefore be paired such that the product of each pair is 1. Since (p-1)! is the product of 1, -1, and each of these pairs, it is congruent to -1 modulo p.## Squares modulo 4It is important to know that the square of an integer can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, never to 2 or 3.

This, along with OM perp BC, implies OM | AC, and since O bisects AB, OM is the midline of the ABC triangle. Thus, AC = 2OM.1984-11-387-1.epsFor the leg AC of the right-angled ABC triangle, we can write the well-known leg theorem. With the notation AD = x, using the previous relationships,2 cdot OM = AC = sqrt{AD cdot AB} = sqrt{AD cdot (AD + DB)} = sqrt{x(x + 3 cdot OM)}After rearranging, we get the quadratic equationx^2 + 3 cdot OM cdot x - 4 cdot OM^2 = 0The roots of the equation are x_1 = OM, x_2 = -4 cdot OM, of which only the positive value is relevant. In the ABC triangle, therefore, AB = AD + DB = 4OM, hence AB = 2 cdot AC.

Fix the diameter AB of the circle. Start the point C from A and let C run along the circumference of the circle all the way to B. As C moves, it gets farther from A - that is, the distance AC = 2 cdot OM increases - while the projection of C onto AB, D, gets closer to B - that is, DB decreases continuously. Therefore, the ratio OM / DB has a numerator that increases and a denominator that decreases, so the value of the fraction increases continuously as C moves. Thus, there can be at most one position of C for which the ratio OM / DB is 1/3.It is easy to see that if angle ABC = 30^circ, then OM / DB = 1/3. Indeed, OM / DB = (OM / MB) cdot (MB / DB) and when angle OBM = angle CBD = 30^circ,frac{OM}{MB} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}, quad frac{MB}{DB} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{CB}{DB} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{2}{sqrt{3}}The value of the ratio OM / DB cannot be 1/3 in any other position of C, so when DB = 3 cdot OM, angle ABC = 30^circ, which answers the question of the problem."},{"problem":"Given that the graph of the function y = x^3 - 3x + c intersects the x-axis at exactly two points, find the value of c.","solution":"Firstly, we need to find the derivative of the function to understand its behavior. Taking the derivative with respect to x, we get: y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x + c) = 3x^2 - 3. Setting the derivative y' equal to zero, we can find the critical points: 3x^2 - 3 = 0, which simplifies to: x^2 - 1 = 0. This implies that x = pm1 are critical points. Now, we consider the sign of y' to determine the monotonicity of y:- For x > 1 or x  0, meaning y is increasing on the intervals (-infty, -1) and (1, +infty).- For -1 < x < 1, y' < 0, indicating that y is decreasing on the interval (-1, 1).Therefore, the function has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 1.Since the graph of the function intersects the x-axis at exactly two points, it implies that one of the critical points corresponds to a root of the function (the y-value at this point is 0).Thus, either the local maximum or the local minimum equals 0. We evaluate the function at the critical points to identify the potential values of c:For the local maximum at x = -1: y(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) + c = -1 + 3 + c = 2 + c. Setting this equal to zero gives c = -2.For the local minimum at x = 1: y(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1) + c = 1 - 3 + c = -2 + c. Setting this equal to zero gives c = 2.Hence, the value of c can either be -2 or 2.[boxed{c = -2 text{ or } c = 2}]By examining the function's derivative, its monotonic intervals, and the condition that the graph intercepts the x-axis at two points, we are led to the conclusion that either the local maximum or the local minimum must be 0.

There is a general opinion that puzzles requiring the measurement of a certain amount of liquid can only be solved by a series of trials, but in such cases, general formulas for solutions can be found. Taking advantage of an unexpected leisure, I examined this question more closely. As a result, some very interesting things were discovered. Let's consider, for example, the simplest case, where a person comes to a stream with only two vessels and wants to measure a certain amount of water. If we are dealing with, say, a barrel of wine, we may encounter various complications related to whether the barrel is empty or full, whether we know its capacity and contents, whether the loss of wine is allowed, and whether it is possible to pour the wine back into the barrel. By the stream, all these complications disappear. Perhaps the problem has simplified to such an extent that it makes no sense to talk about it as a puzzle at all? Let's see.A person comes to a stream with two vessels of 15 and 16 liters capacity. How can he measure exactly 8 liters of water in the fewest number of operations? Filling a vessel, emptying it, or pouring water from one vessel to another counts as one operation.This puzzle is not difficult, but I think the reader will find it quite entertaining and instructive. It goes without saying that no tricks, such as marks on the vessels or tilting them, are allowed.","solution":"393.(A)(B)begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}hline 15 l & 16 l & (15 pi) & 16 l & 15 l & 16 l & 15 l & 16 l hline 0 & (16^{*}) & 15 & (5^{*}) & (15^{*}) & 0 & 0 & 11 hline 15 & (1^{*}) & 0 & 5 & 0 & 15 & 15 & 11 hline 0 & 1 & 5 & 0 & 15 & 15 & (10^{*}) & 16 hline 1 & 0 & 5 & 16 & (14^{*}) & 16 & 10 & 0 hline 1 & 16 & 15 & (6^{*}) & 14 & 0 & 0 & 10 hline 15 & (2^{*}) & 0 & 6 & 0 & 14 & 15 & 10 hline 0 & 2 & 6 & 0 & 15 & 14 & (9^{*}) & 16 hline 2 & 0 & 6 & 16 & (13^{*}) & 16 & 9 & 0 hline 2 & 16 & 15 & (7^{*}) & 13 & 0 & 0 & 9 hline 15 & (3^{*}) & 0 & 7 & 0 & 13 & 15 & 9 hline 0 & 3 & 7 & 0 & 15 & 13 & (8^{*}) & 16 hline 3 & 0 & 7 & 16 & (12^{*}) & 16 & & hline 3 & 16 & 15 & (8^{*}) & 12 & 0 & & hline 15 & (4^{*}) & 0 & 8 & 0 & 12 & & hline 0 & 4 & 8 & 0 & 15 & 12 & & hline 4 & 0 & 8 & 16 & (11^{*}) & 16 & & hline & 16 & & & 11 & & & hlineend{tabular}Each row in the column represents an operation.

We can also proceed differently, as shown in case (B): first fill the 15-liter container, and then sequentially measure 14, 13, 12, 11 liters, and so on. Continuing the \\"strategy\\" of (A), we get the pouring scheme (B) in reverse order. From this, it is clear that to measure from 1 to 7 liters, we should use method (A), and from 8 to 14 liters, method (B). Using method (A), we can measure 8 liters in 30 operations, and using method (B) in only 28, which is the correct answer.Surprisingly, using any two coprime measures (i.e., measures that do not have common divisors, such as 15 and 16), we can measure any integer number of liters from 1 to the largest measure. Using 4-liter and 6-liter containers (each divisible by 2), we can only measure 2, 4, and 6 liters. With 3-liter and 9-liter containers, we can only measure 3, 6, and 9 liters. In our table, the measurable volumes are in the correct sequence. However, if we take 9-liter and 16-liter containers and apply method (A), we get 6, 14, 5, 12, 3 liters, and so on, with a cyclic difference of 7 (16 - 9 = 7). In other words, by adding 7 to 14 and subtracting 16, we get 5, and by adding 7 to 12 and subtracting 16, we get 3, and so on.[For a good method of solving such puzzles using isometric graph paper, see my note in Scientific American, September 1963, and for further discussion of this method, see T.

First Price Reduction: The original price of the medicine is 28 yuan. After the first price reduction by a percentage x, the new price becomes 28 times (1 - x). This is because a reduction by x means the price retains (1-x) of its original value.2. Second Price Reduction: The price after the first reduction is 28 times (1 - x). The second reduction, also by x, applies to this new price, leading to a final price of 28 times (1 - x) times (1 - x) = 28 times (1 - x)^2 yuan. This step applies the same logic of retaining (1-x) of the price after the first reduction.3. Final Price and Equation: The final price of the medicine, after two reductions, is given as 16 yuan.

Complete the square for both (x) and (y):   [   x^2 - 10x + y^2 - 10y = 0   ]   [   (x^2 - 10x + 25) + (y^2 - 10y + 25) = 50   ]   [   (x - 5)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 50   ]4. Recognize that ((x - 5)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 50) represents a circle centered at ((5, 5)) with radius (sqrt{50} = 5sqrt{2}).5. Identify the integer solutions to ((x - 5)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 50).

Looking at the remainders that 2^{a} gives when divided by 3 for different values of a, we see that the remainders 2 and 1 repeat with a period of 2. We conclude that a must be an even number, i.e., a=2a_{1} for some natural number a_{1}.In particular, a geqslant 2, so 2^{a} is divisible by 4. The number 2021 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so the right side must also give this remainder. The number 25^{c} gives a remainder of 1, while the expression 3^{b} gives remainders of 3 and 1 periodically when divided by 4.

This is equal to the sum of the probabilities that the graduate answered 0, 1, and 2 questions correctly, that is, quad sum_{k=0}^{2} C_{20}^{k} p^{k} q^{20-k} approx 0.091 ; therefore, the probability of passing the exam is approximately 0.909.Similarly, we find that in 2012, the probability of failing the exam is the probability of passing the exam is approximately 0.957.## AnswerIn 2012.Submit a comment"},{"problem":"5.68 Find all quadratic trinomials ( p(x) ), which take a minimum value of (-frac{49}{4}) at ( x = frac{1}{2} ), and the sum of the fourth powers of its two roots is 337.","solution":"［Solution］From the given, we can setp(x)=aleft(x-frac{1}{2}right)^{2}-frac{49}{4} quad(a>0)which means p(x)=a x^{2}-a x+frac{a-49}{4}.Let the two roots of p(x) be x_{1}, x_{2}, thenleft{begin{array}{l}x_{1}+x_{2}=1 x_{1} x_{2}=frac{a-49}{4 a}end{array}right.But squarebegin{aligned}& x_{1}^{4}+x_{2}^{4} = & left(x_{1}+x_{2}right)^{4}-4 x_{1} x_{1}left(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}right)-6 x_{1}^{2} x_{2}^{2} = & left(x_{1}+x_{2}right)^{4}-4 x_{1} x_{2}left[left(x_{1}+x_{2}right)^{2}-2 x_{1} x_{2}right]-6 x_{1}^{2} x_{2}^{2},end{aligned}therefore quad 337=1^{4}-frac{a-49}{a} cdotleft(1-frac{a-49}{2 a}right)-6 cdot frac{(a-49)^{2}}{16 a^{2}},begin{array}{l}336=-frac{a-49}{a}+frac{(a-49)^{2}}{2 a^{2}}-frac{3(a-49)^{2}}{8 a^{2}}, 336=-frac{a-49}{a}+frac{(a-49)^{2}}{8 a^{2}} .end{array}Then 8 times 336 a^{2}=-8 a(a-49)+(a-49)^{2},Rearranging gives 2695 a^{2}-294 a-2401=0.Thus a_{1}=1, a_{2}=-frac{2401}{2695} quad (discard) hence quad p(x)=x^{2}-x-12."},{"problem":"Given that tan alpha = 2, find the value of the following expressions:(1) frac{sin alpha - 4 cos alpha}{5 sin alpha + 2 cos alpha};(2) 4sin^{2}{alpha} - 3sin{alpha}cos{alpha} - 5cos^{2}{alpha}.","solution":"(1) Since tan alpha = 2, we can rewrite the given expression in terms of tan alpha:frac{sin alpha - 4 cos alpha}{5 sin alpha + 2 cos alpha} = frac{tan alpha - 4}{5 tan alpha + 2}Substituting the given value of tan alpha = 2:frac{2 - 4}{5 cdot 2 + 2} = -frac{1}{6}(2) Again, since tan alpha = 2, we can rewrite the given expression in terms of tan alpha:4sin^{2}{alpha} - 3sin{alpha}cos{alpha} - 5cos^{2}{alpha} = frac{4sin^{2}{alpha} - 3sin{alpha}cos{alpha} - 5cos^{2}{alpha}}{sin^{2}{alpha} + cos^{2}{alpha}}Using the identity tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}, we can rewrite the expression as:frac{4tan^{2}{alpha} - 3tan{alpha} - 5}{tan^{2}{alpha} + 1}Substituting the given value of tan alpha = 2:frac{4 cdot 2^2 - 3 cdot 2 - 5}{2^2 + 1} = boxed{1}"},{"problem":"Given the universal set R, if set A = {x | (x + 2)(x - 3) ≥ 0} and set B = {x | x > 1}, then (¬A ∪ B) = (   )A: [3, +∞)B: (1, 3]C: (1, 3)D: (-2, +∞)","solution":"Solution: A = {x | (x + 2)(x - 3) ≥ 0} = {x | x ≥ 3 or x ≤ -2}, ¬A = {x | -2  -2} = (-2, +∞),So the answer is: boxed{D}.To find the equivalent conditions of the set, combine the definitions of complement and union to compute.

Initial Assumptions and Properties:   - Given that ( f ) is Riemann integrable on any finite interval, it implies that ( f ) is bounded on any finite interval.   - From property (ii) with ( n = 1 ), we have:     [     f(x) = frac{1}{2} int_{x-1}^{x+1} f(t) , dt     ]     This implies that ( f ) is continuous because the right-hand side is a continuous function of ( x ).2. Subspace of Continuous Functions:   - The set of functions satisfying the two properties forms a subvector space of the space of all continuous functions.   - It is clear that all linear functions belong to this subspace. We will show that there is no other function.3. Reduction to Zero at Specific Points:   - Let ( f ) satisfy the two properties. By adding a linear function to ( f ), we may assume that ( f(0) = f(1) = 0 ). It suffices to show that ( f = 0 ).4. Lemma:   - Statement: If ( f(a) = f(b) = 0 ) for some ( a < b ), then ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in [a, b] ).   - Proof:     - Suppose this is not the case. Since ( f ) is continuous, we may assume without loss of generality that ( m = max{f(x) : x in [a, b]} ) is strictly positive.     - Consider the set ( C = {x in [a, b] : f(x) = m} ). This is a nonempty closed subset of ( mathbb{R} ).     - For any ( c in C ), we must have ( c in (a, b) ) and hence there exists ( n ) such that ( [c - frac{1}{n}, c + frac{1}{n}] subseteq [a, b] ).     - We have:       [       m = f(c) = frac{n}{2} int_{c - frac{1}{n}}^{c + frac{1}{n}} f(t) , dt       ]       and also ( m geq f(t) ) for all ( t in [c - frac{1}{n}, c + frac{1}{n}] ). These imply that ( f(x) = m ) for all ( x in (c - frac{1}{n}, c + frac{1}{n}) ).     - We have shown that, for any ( c in C ), there exists an open interval ( I ) such that ( c in I subseteq C ). This means that ( C ) is an open subset of ( mathbb{R} ).     - Therefore, ( C ) is both open and closed, which is impossible, as ( mathbb{R} ) is connected.     - Hence, ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in [a, b] ).5. Application of Lemma:   - Since ( f(0) = f(1) = 0 ), the Lemma implies that ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in [0, 1] ).   - This means that the set ( B = {z : f(x) = 0, forall 0 leq x leq z} ) is nonempty. Let ( b ) denote the supremum of the set ( B ). We want to show that ( b = infty ).6. Proof by Contradiction:   - Suppose ( b neq infty ). Then we have ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( 0 leq x leq b ).   - By condition (ii) applied with ( n = 1 ), we have:     [     0 = f(b) = frac{1}{2} int_{b - 1}^{b + 1} f(t) , dt = frac{1}{2} int_b^{b + 1} f(t) , dt     ]     - Since ( f ) is continuous, this implies that ( f(c) = 0 ) for some ( c in (b, b+1) ).     - Then the Lemma tells us that ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in [b, c] ). This leads to ( c in B ), contradicting the assumption that ( b = sup B ).     - Therefore, we have ( sup B = infty ), i.e., ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x geq 0 ).7. Symmetric Argument:   - The same argument, by considering ( A = {z : f(x) = 0, forall z leq x leq 1} ) and ( a = inf A ), shows that ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x leq 1 ).   - Thus, we have proved ( f = 0 ).Conclusion:- In conclusion, all functions satisfying the two properties are the linear functions.The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = 0 } )."},{"problem":"Given f(x)=begin{cases}2x,x > 0  fleft(x+1right),xleqslant 0end{cases}, find the value of fleft( frac{4}{3} right)+fleft( -frac{4}{3} right).","solution":"First, let's evaluate fleft( frac{4}{3} right).

Since -frac{4}{3} leq 0, we use the second part of the function definition: f(x) = fleft(x+1right). Substituting x = -frac{4}{3}, we get fleft( -frac{4}{3} right) = fleft(-frac{4}{3} + 1right) = fleft(-frac{1}{3}right).Since -frac{1}{3} leq 0, we still use the second part of the function definition, which gives us fleft(-frac{1}{3}right) = fleft(-frac{1}{3} + 1right) = fleft(frac{2}{3}right).Now, we have fleft(frac{2}{3}right), and since frac{2}{3} > 0, we can use the first part of the function definition.
