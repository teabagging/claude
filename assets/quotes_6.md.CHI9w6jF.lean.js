Squaring both sides and simplifying gives us x^2 + 2^{2x} = y^2 + b^2.   - Substituting equation ① into this equation yields x^2 + 2^{2x} = y^2 + left(-frac{y}{x} cdot 2^xright)^2 = frac{y^2}{x^2}(x^2 + 2^{2x}).   - Since x^2 geqslant 0 and 2^{2x} > 0, we conclude that x^2 + 2^{2x} > 0.

Assumption for Contradiction: Assume the opposite of what we want to prove. In this case, we assume angle B geqslant 90^{circ}.2. Analysis of the Assumption: Given that AB=AC, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle. The angles opposite equal sides are equal, so angle B = angle C.3. Contradiction: If angle B geqslant 90^{circ}, then angle C would also have to be geqslant 90^{circ} because angle B = angle C. However, in a triangle, the sum of the angles must be exactly 180^{circ}. Having two angles geqslant 90^{circ} would make the sum of the angles in triangle ABC greater than 180^{circ}, which is impossible.4. Conclusion: Since assuming angle B geqslant 90^{circ} leads to a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

Therefore, the maximum value of sin A + sin C occurs when sin A = frac{1}{4}, giving us a maximum value of frac{9}{8}.

Assume the contrary: Suppose there exists a set of ( n = 13 ) points such that any triangle formed by these points is colored with exactly two colors.

Consider a point ( B_1 ) in this subset: Without loss of generality, assume that the color most commonly used in lines connected to ( B_1 ) within this subset is yellow.

In its journey, it cannot take a step immediately back in the direction it came from. - What is the minimum number of steps required for it to return to where it started?","solution":"I. solution. Let's denote the abstract animal by A, its starting point by P, the center of the sphere by O, the endpoint of its next step by Q, R, and S. Since the length of one step is less than the diameter of the sphere, A always has somewhere to step. According to our assumption, R cannot be the same as P, and we will show that S cannot be the same either. Otherwise, the sides of the triangle PQR would all be 1.99, which is greater than the side of the largest equilateral triangle that can be inscribed in a unit sphere, sqrt{3}. Therefore, A must take at least four steps, and as we will see, if it is a little careful, it can return to P in four steps.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_27386365082d3c90a723g-1.jpg?height=612&width=1152&top_left_y=434&top_left_x=473)If A wants to return to P in four steps, its first step can still be arbitrary. In its second step, it only needs to ensure that R is not in the plane OPQ. For example, rotate P by 90^{circ} around the axis OQ, then the resulting point R will have QR = QP, and the planes OQP and OQR will be perpendicular, into which A can step from R. Then reflect A across the plane OPR to Q, and let S be the resulting reflection. Since Q is not in the plane OPR (since R is not in the plane OPQ), S will be different from each of the points P, Q, and R, and because RS = RQ, A can step from R to S, and because SP = QP, it can return to P from there. This proves that the shortest path of A consists of four steps.II. solution. In the first step, A can step onto the circle k_1, whose points are 1.99 units away from P, and which is cut out of the sphere by a plane perpendicular to the diameter of the sphere passing through P. If A wants to return to P in four steps, then in the third step, it must step onto a point of this circle again.In the first step, A can step into any point Q of k_1. The points reachable in the second step are the points of the circle k_2, which is congruent to k_1 and passes through P, and whose plane is perpendicular to the diameter of the sphere passing through Q.Similarly, from a point R on k_2 that is different from P, A can step onto a circle k_3 that is congruent to k_1 but different from it, and which passes through Q. The point S must lie on both k_1 and k_3 and must be different from Q. Such a point does not exist only if k_1 and k_3 are tangent at Q; this, however, follows if R is the antipodal point of P on k_2.We have thus found that if A steps in the second step onto a point R of the circle k_2 that is different from P and its antipodal point, then there is always a uniquely determined point S on the sphere, i.e., the intersection point of k_1 and k_3 different from Q, onto which it can step in the third step, and from which it can return to P in the fourth step."},{"problem":"Let ABC be a triangle.

Find |OM|cdot |ON|.","solution":"Given that the equation of the parabola C is y^{2}=8x, we can immediately identify its focus. For a parabola of the form y^2 = 4ax, the focus is at (a,0). Therefore, for our equation, 4a = 8, which implies a = 2. Thus, the focus F is at (2,0).Let's denote the equation of line l that passes through the focus F and intersects the parabola at points P and Q as x=my+2. The coordinates of points P and Q on the parabola can be represented as (frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{8}, y_{1}) and (frac{{y}_{2}^{2}}{8}, y_{2}), respectively, where y_1 and y_2 are the y-coordinates of P and Q.Substituting the equation of line l into the parabola's equation gives us a quadratic equation in terms of y: y^{2}-8my-16=0. From this, we can infer that the sum of the roots, y_1 + y_2, is equal to -(-8m)/1 = 8m, but it is mistakenly given as y_{1}+y_{2}=-16. Let's correct this approach by focusing on the relationship between y_1 and y_2 through their geometric properties rather than directly from the quadratic equation.The slope of line AP can be calculated using the coordinates of A(2,4) and P(frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{8}, y_{1}). Thus, k_{AP}=frac{{y}_{1}-4}{frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{8}-2}. Simplifying this, we find k_{AP}=frac{8}{{y}_{1}+4}. The equation of line AP can then be written as y-4=frac{8}{{y}_{1}+4}(x-2). Setting y=0 to find where AP intersects the x-axis, we solve for x and find the coordinates of point M to be (-frac{{y}_{1}}{2}, 0). Following a similar process for AQ, we find the coordinates of point N to be (-frac{{y}_{2}}{2}, 0).To find |OM|cdot |ON|, we calculate |-frac{{y}_{1}}{2}|cdot|-frac{{y}_{2}}{2}|.

Denote by a and h the side of the base ABCD and the height of the pyramid, respectively, and draw a section through points P, A, and C (Fig.2). Since point O belongs to the plane of the section, we obtain an isosceles triangle with base a sqrt{2}, inscribed in a circle of radius R. Let the extension of the radius PO intersect the segment AC at point M, and the circle at point K. Then M is the midpoint of AC, and CM is the height of the right triangle PCK, drawn from the vertex of the right angle.

Consider only those that belong to the interval (0; 2R).V'(h) = frac{2}{3}(h^2(2R - h))' = frac{2}{3}(2Rh^2 - h^3)' = frac{2}{3}(4Rh - 3h^2) = frac{2}{3}h(4R - 3h) = 0The interval (0; 2R) contains only one root of this equation, h = frac{4}{3}R. As we pass through the point h = frac{4}{3}R, the derivative changes sign from positive to negative. Therefore, on the interval left(0; frac{4}{3}Rright), the function V(h) is increasing, and on the interval left(frac{4}{3}R; 2Rright), it is decreasing. Thus, at h = frac{4}{3}R, the volume of the pyramid ABCD is the greatest. In this case,Vleft(frac{4}{3}Rright) = frac{2}{3} cdot left(frac{4}{3}Rright)^2 cdot left(2R - frac{4}{3}Rright) = frac{64}{31}R^3.## Second Method.Applying the Cauchy inequality to three numbers, we get thatbegin{aligned}& V(h) = frac{2}{3} h^2(2R - h) = frac{2}{3} pi cdot 4 cdot frac{1}{2}h cdot frac{1}{2}h(2R - h) geqslant & geqslant frac{frac{8}{3}}{3} pi cdot left(frac{frac{1}{2}h + frac{1}{2}h + (2R - h)}{3}right)^3 = frac{frac{8}{3}}{3} pi cdot frac{frac{5}{27}}{27} = frac{64}{81} pi,end{aligned}with equality achieved if frac{1}{2}h = 2R - h, i.e., at h = frac{4}{3}R.

Consider the permutation where ( a_i = 2i ) for ( i leq 1011 ). This means:   [   a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_i = 2(1 + 2 + ldots + i) = 2 cdot frac{i(i+1)}{2} = i(i+1)   ]   [   1 + 2 + ldots + i = frac{i(i+1)}{2}   ]   Therefore,   [   b_i = frac{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_i}{1 + 2 + ldots + i} = frac{i(i+1)}{frac{i(i+1)}{2}} = 2   ]   for ( i leq 1011 ). Thus, ( b_i = 2 ) for ( i leq 1011 ), which is an integer greater than 1. Upper Bound for ( k )4. We need to show that at most one ( i geq 1011 ) can have ( b_i ) as an integer larger than 1.5. For ( i geq 1011 ), consider the maximum possible value of ( b_i ):   [   b_i leq frac{2022 + 2021 + ldots + (2022 - i + 1)}{1 + 2 + ldots + i} = frac{2022 + (2022 - 1) + ldots + (2022 - i + 1)}{frac{i(i+1)}{2}}   ]   The numerator is the sum of the first ( i ) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from 2022 and decreasing by 1 each term:   [   text{Sum} = frac{i}{2} (2 cdot 2022 - (i - 1)) = frac{i}{2} (4044 - i + 1) = frac{i (4045 - i)}{2}   ]   Therefore,   [   b_i leq frac{frac{i (4045 - i)}{2}}{frac{i(i+1)}{2}} = frac{4045 - i}{i + 1}   ]   For ( i = 1011 ),   [   b_{1011} leq frac{4045 - 1011}{1011 + 1} = frac{3034}{1012} < 3   ]   Thus, ( b_i ) can only be 2 for ( i geq 1011 ).6. If ( b_i = 2 ) for some ( i geq 1011 ), then:   [   b_{i+1} = frac{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_i + a_{i+1}}{1 + 2 + ldots + i + (i+1)} = frac{2 cdot frac{i(i+1)}{2} + a_{i+1}}{frac{i(i+1)}{2} + (i+1)}   ]   Since ( a_{i+1} leq 2022 ),   [   frac{a_{i+1}}{i+1} leq frac{2022}{i+1} leq frac{2022}{1012} < 2   ]   As ( b_{i+1} ) is the mediant of ( b_i ) and ( frac{a_{i+1}}{i+1} ), it implies ( b_{i+1} < 2 ). Therefore, if ( b_i = 2 ) for any ( i geq 1011 ), all further ( b_j ) for ( j > i ) will be less than 2 and cannot be integers.7. Thus, the maximum number of ( b_i ) that are integers larger than 1 is the first 1010 and at most 1 from the remaining terms. Therefore, ( k leq 1011 ).The final answer is ( boxed{1011} )"},{"problem":"If a>b and c>d, then among the following inequalities, the one that does not necessarily hold is (    )A: a-b>d-cB: a+d>b+cC: a-c>b-cD: a-c<a-d","solution":"Analysis of the problem: Given a>b and c>d, we can derive a+c>b+d.

That is, FC^2 = BC cdot MC. Therefore, it is easy to know that triangle FMC sim triangle BFC.

Combining angle AFB = angle FMB, it is easy to know that triangle BMN sim triangle BFA, i.e., triangle BAN sim triangle BFM, hence frac{AB}{AN} = frac{FB}{FM}.From angle BAF = angle BNM, we know that B, A, N, F are concyclic, thus angle ANB = angle AFB = angle NMB = angle NBM.

Find the biggest integer d, for which holds, that from any set S consisting of n integers, we can find three different (but not necesarilly disjoint) nonempty subsets, such that sum of elements of each of them is divisible by d.","solution":"1. Model and Initial Observation:   Consider the set ( S = {n+1, 2n+1, ldots, n^2+1} ). For this set, the only non-empty subset whose sum of elements is divisible by ( n ) is ( S ) itself. This implies that ( d < n ).2. Claim:   We claim that ( d = n-1 ). To support this claim, we will use two well-known results (lemmas).3. Lemma 1:   Given a set of (at least) ( N ) distinct integers, there exists a non-empty subset having its sum of elements divisible by ( N ). This is an old result by Erdős.4. Lemma 2:   The only sets of ( N-1 ) distinct integers, with no non-empty subset having its sum of elements divisible by ( N ), are those where all integers are congruent to the same residue modulo ( N ), and this residue is coprime with ( N ).5. Application of Lemma 1:   By Lemma 1, there exists a subset ( emptyset neq A subseteq S ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ). Take an arbitrary ( a in A ).6. Finding Second Subset:   Again by Lemma 1, there exists a subset ( emptyset neq B subseteq S setminus {a} ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ), and clearly ( B neq A ). Take an arbitrary ( b in B ), thus ( b neq a ).7. Finding Third Subset:   If there exists a subset ( emptyset neq C subseteq S setminus {a, b} ) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ), we are done. Otherwise, by Lemma 2, there exists some ( r ) coprime with ( n-1 ) such that ( x equiv r pmod{n-1} ) for all ( x in S setminus {a, b} ).8. Special Cases:   If ( a equiv 0 pmod{n-1} ) or ( b equiv 0 pmod{n-1} ), we can easily fulfill the requirements. So, assume otherwise. This remark also solves the case ( n = 3 ), so we may assume ( n > 3 ).9. Interchangeability of Elements:   The subset ( B ) is therefore made of ( b ) and some number of elements from ( S setminus {a, b} ). As these are interchangeable, if not all of them are used, then we can easily find another subset ( B' ) (different from ( B ) and ( A )) having its sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ).10. Final Case:    We are left with the case ( B = S setminus {a} ), which forces ( b equiv r pmod{n-1} ). The subset ( A ) is therefore made of ( a ) and some number of the other ( n-1 ) elements, congruent with ( r ) modulo ( n-1 ). As these are interchangeable, and not all of them could have been used, then we can easily find other subsets ( A' ) and ( A'' ) (different from ( A )) having their sum of elements divisible by ( n-1 ).Thus, we have shown that for any set ( S ) of ( n ) integers, we can always find three different non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements of each subset is divisible by ( n-1 ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n-1 } )."},{"problem":"15.

For x geq 0, f(x) = f(x+2).2. For x < 0, f(x) = h(x).We're also given that f(5) = 1. Since the graph is symmetric with respect to the origin, this implies f(x) is an odd function, which means f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain of f.Step 1: Understanding the properties of an odd function, we can deduce that f(0) = 0, because for an odd function, the point (0,0) always lies on the graph.Step 2: To find h(-2022)+h(-2023)+h(-2024), we translate it into the function f due to the symmetry and the definition of f for negative values:h(-2022)+h(-2023)+h(-2024) = f(-2022)+f(-2023)+f(-2024).Step 3: Utilizing the property of the function being odd, we convert the negative arguments to positive and change the sign:f(-2022)+f(-2023)+f(-2024) = -[f(2022)+f(2023)+f(2024)].Step 4: Evaluate f(2022), f(2023), and f(2024) using the periodic property of f(x) for x geq 0 and the given value f(5) = 1.

Condition for ( O_1O_2O_3 ) to be equilateral:   For the triangle ( O_1O_2O_3 ) to be equilateral, the sum of the complex numbers representing the vertices, rotated by ( omega ) (the third root of unity), must be zero:   [   O_1 + O_2 omega + O_3 omega^2 = 0   ]4. Substitute the expressions for ( O_1, O_2, O_3 ):   Using the given relations, we substitute ( O_1, O_2, O_3 ) into the equilateral condition:   [   frac{O_1 - a}{O_1 - b} = alpha implies O_1 = frac{a alpha - b}{alpha - 1}   ]   [   frac{O_2 - b}{O_2 - c} = alpha implies O_2 = frac{b alpha - c}{alpha - 1}   ]   [   frac{O_3 - c}{O_3 - a} = alpha implies O_3 = frac{c alpha - a}{alpha - 1}   ]5.

Thus, every number in question can be uniquely associated with a sequence of natural numbers of length n, where the sum of the elements is 8.We need to determine how many ways there are to decompose 8 into the sum of n non-negative integers, considering different decompositions even if they only differ in the order of the terms.Let's actually try to create such a decomposition: if an 8-unit long rod is divided into n parts by n-1 cuts that pass through all the integer points, then the elements of the sequence are obtained as the lengths of the consecutive segments. Multiple cuts can pass through the same division point, which represents 0-valued elements at the corresponding positions in the sequence.Since 0 can also appear at the beginning and end of the sequence, cuts passing through the 0 and 8-unit points are also allowed. The task is thus to determine how many ways there are to choose (n-1) points from 9 division points, where the same division point can be chosen multiple times.As is known, these selections are precisely the 9-element (n-1)-class combinations with repetition, and their number is binom{9+n-2}{n-1}=binom{n+7}{n-1}. This means that there are binom{n+7}{n-1} n-digit numbers where the sum of the digits is 9n-8.Tóth 370 Ágnes (Hajdúszoboszló, Hógyes E. Gymn., 11th grade)Remarks. 1. The number of n-length sequences with a sum of 8 can also be determined by other clever reasoning. Paulin Dániel (Fazekas M. Gymn., 9th grade) performed the total 8-unit reduction one by one, specifically by position. According to his reasoning, out of the n positions, one must be chosen 8 times, and the same position can naturally be chosen multiple times. The possibilities are now the 8-class combinations with repetition of n elements, and their number is binom{n+8-1}{8}=binom{n+7}{8}, which is naturally the same as before.2. Deák Péter (Fazekas M. Gymn., 9th grade) also counted these selections directly, essentially proving the formula for the number of combinations with repetition. He reasoned as follows: at every position except the last, two actions can be taken: reduce the number at that position by 1, or move to the next position. (When reaching the last position, there is no choice.) Thus, we have a total of (n-1)+8=n+7 decision points, and we need to choose 8 of them where we reduce. This can clearly be done in binom{n+7}{8} ways. (Or, equivalently, binom{n+7}{n-1} ways to choose the (n-1) moves forward.)"},{"problem":"78.

Angle C D B is a central angle of the arc subtended by chord B C, and angle C A B is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc.

Given the equation ((f(x))^3 - f(x) = 0), we can factor it as follows:   [   (f(x))^3 - f(x) = f(x) cdot (f(x)^2 - 1) = f(x) cdot (f(x) - 1) cdot (f(x) + 1) = 0   ]   This implies that (f(x) = 0), (f(x) - 1 = 0), or (f(x) + 1 = 0).2. Therefore, the roots of the equation are:   [   f(x) = 0, quad f(x) = 1, quad f(x) = -1   ]   Since the problem states that there are three real roots, one of these factors must have a double root. This means that one of the roots must be repeated.3. To determine which root is repeated, we need to consider the nature of the polynomial (f(x)). Since (f(x)) is a trinomial (a polynomial of degree 2), it can be written in the form:   [   f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c   ]4.

This means the polynomial can be written as:   [   f(x) = a(x - r)^2   ]   where (r) is the root with multiplicity 2.5. Since (f(x) = 0) has a double root, the other roots (f(x) = 1) and (f(x) = -1) must be single roots. This implies that the polynomial (f(x)) must be symmetric about the y-axis, and the vertex of the parabola (f(x)) must be at (y = 0).6.

Therefore, y=-|x|+1 is monotonically decreasing on (0,1), not increasing.- Function B: y=1-x^{2}  - Evenness: For y=1-x^{2}, replacing x with -x gives y=1-(-x)^{2}=1-x^{2}, which is the same as the original function. Hence, y=1-x^{2} is an even function.    - Monotonicity on (0,1): As x increases from 0 to 1, x^{2} increases, which means that -x^{2} decreases, and thus 1-x^{2} decreases. Therefore, y=1-x^{2} is monotonically decreasing on (0,1), not increasing.- Function C: y=-frac{1}{x}  - Evenness/Oddness: A function f(x) is odd if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the function's domain. For y=-frac{1}{x}, replacing x with -x gives y=-frac{1}{-x}=frac{1}{x}, which is the negation of the original function. Therefore, y=-frac{1}{x} is an odd function.    - Monotonicity on (0,1): Not applicable since it doesn't meet the evenness requirement.- Function D: y=2x^{2}+4  - Evenness: For y=2x^{2}+4, replacing x with -x gives y=2(-x)^{2}+4=2x^{2}+4, which is the same as the original function. Hence, y=2x^{2}+4 is an even function.    - Monotonicity on (0,1): As x increases from 0 to 1, x^{2} increases, and since it is multiplied by a positive coefficient (2), the function 2x^{2}+4 increases. Therefore, y=2x^{2}+4 is monotonically increasing on (0,1).Given the analysis above, the only function that meets both requirements (being an even function and monotonically increasing on the interval left(0,1right)) is Function D: y=2x^{2}+4.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"18.

If k = 4, then the total number of apples is at least 4 times 4 + 6 = 22, which is more than 20. If k = 3, then the total number of apples is at least 4 times 3 + 6 = 18, which is less than 20.

We can factor out a square from 12 as follows:[sqrt{12a} = sqrt{4 cdot 3a} = 2sqrt{3a}.]For sqrt{12a} to simplify to a positive integer, 2sqrt{3a} must also be an integer. This implies that sqrt{3a} must be an integer, and therefore, 3a must be a perfect square.The smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 3 is 3 itself (since 1 is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, we set 3a = 3 to find the smallest value of a that satisfies the condition. Solving for a, we get:[3a = 3 implies a = frac{3}{3} = 1.]However, there seems to be a mistake in the initial solution provided. The smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 3 and ensures sqrt{3a} is an integer is actually 9 (since 3 times 3 = 9), not 3. This means 3a = 9, and solving for a gives us:[3a = 9 implies a = frac{9}{3} = 3.]Therefore, the smallest value of the integer a for which sqrt{12a} simplifies to a positive integer is indeed 3.

Moreover, the difference between the squares of their ages is a square of an integer. How old are Josh and Fred?","solution":"1. Let Josh's age be represented as (10a + b), where (a) and (b) are the digits of his age. Similarly, let Fred's age be represented as (10b + a).2. The difference between the squares of their ages is given by:   [   (10a + b)^2 - (10b + a)^2   ]3. Expanding both squares, we get:   [   (10a + b)^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2   ]   [   (10b + a)^2 = 100b^2 + 20ab + a^2   ]4. Subtracting these two expressions, we have:   [   (100a^2 + 20ab + b^2) - (100b^2 + 20ab + a^2) = 100a^2 + b^2 - 100b^2 - a^2   ]   [   = 99a^2 - 99b^2   ]   [   = 99(a^2 - b^2)   ]5. We are given that the difference between the squares of their ages is a square of an integer. Let this integer be (k). Therefore:   [   99(a^2 - b^2) = k^2   ]6. Since (99 = 3^2 times 11), we can write:   [   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)   ]   [   99(a^2 - b^2) = 99(a - b)(a + b) = k^2   ]7. For (99(a - b)(a + b)) to be a perfect square, ((a - b)(a + b)) must be of the form (11m^2) where (m) is an integer. Given (0 leq a, b leq 9), we have (a + b leq 18).8.

Prepare n^{2}(n=8) cards, the front side of which are numbered 1,2, cdots, n^{2}, and the back side corresponds to the position of the number in the password (counting from the left). Of course, the operator does not know the numbers on the back side in advance.First, divide the n^{2} cards into n groups (each group has n cards). In the first n operations, input the card numbers of each group once, so you can know the size order of the numbers on the back of each group (also recorded as the size order of the cards).Arrange the cards in each group in ascending order and place them on the table, forming an n times n matrix left(a_{i j}right), where a_{i j} is the card number of the i-th card in the j-th group, and the corresponding number on the back is b_{i j}.Second, input two more times, which areleft{a_{1 j} mid j=1,2, cdots, nright},left{a_{n j} mid j=1,2, cdots, nright}.These 2 n cards are called “original cards” (the former is “original small card”, the latter is “original large card”).

Then, you can know the card numbers of the smallest and largest cards on the table. Remove these two cards and move the card below (or above) the front (or back) one to its position (called new small (or large) card).Operation B: When the number of new small (or large) cards is frac{n}{2}, input the card numbers of all cards in the 1st (or nth) row (i.e., frac{n}{2} original small (or large) cards and frac{n}{2} new small (or large) cards, which are all renamed as original cards).

Understanding the Problem:   We need to color all positive real numbers such that any two numbers whose ratio is 4 or 8 have different colors. This means if ( a ) and ( b ) are two numbers such that ( frac{a}{b} = 4 ) or ( frac{a}{b} = 8 ), then ( a ) and ( b ) must have different colors.2. Observing the Ratios:   Note that ( 4^3 = 8^2 ). This implies that the powers of 4 and 8 are related in a way that can be exploited to find a coloring scheme.3. Defining the Function:   Define a function ( f(a) = lfloor log_2 a rfloor ). This function maps a positive real number ( a ) to the greatest integer less than or equal to ( log_2 a ).4. Coloring Scheme:   We will use the function ( f(a) ) to determine the color of ( a ). Specifically, we will use the value of ( f(a) mod 5 ) to assign colors:   - If ( f(a) equiv 0 pmod{5} ) or ( f(a) equiv 1 pmod{5} ), color ( a ) Red.   - If ( f(a) equiv 2 pmod{5} ) or ( f(a) equiv 3 pmod{5} ), color ( a ) Green.   - If ( f(a) equiv 4 pmod{5} ), color ( a ) Blue.5. Verification:   - Consider two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( frac{a}{b} = 4 ). Then ( log_2 a = log_2 b + 2 ). Hence, ( f(a) = lfloor log_2 b + 2 rfloor ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 0 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 2 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 1 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 3 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 2 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 4 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 3 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 0 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 4 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 1 pmod{5} ).   - Consider two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( frac{a}{b} = 8 ). Then ( log_2 a = log_2 b + 3 ). Hence, ( f(a) = lfloor log_2 b + 3 rfloor ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 0 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 3 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 1 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 4 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 2 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 0 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 3 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 1 pmod{5} ).     - If ( f(b) equiv 4 pmod{5} ), then ( f(a) equiv 2 pmod{5} ).   In both cases, ( a ) and ( b ) will have different colors according to our coloring scheme.Conclusion:The minimum number of colors required to color all positive real numbers such that any two numbers whose ratio is 4 or 8 have different colors is 3.The final answer is (boxed{3})."},{"problem":"663.

For candidate A to always be ahead, there certainly cannot be any ties. Any count in which the first vote was for candidate B will have a tie, because we know that in the end the number of votes for A is greater and if we do not have a tie at any point, candidate B will win. For any sequence that starts with A and reaches a tie, associate another sequence by swapping the letters A's and B's up to the position of the first tie. For example, in the sequenceA A A B B A B B A B.We have ties at the eighth and tenth counts. The position of the first tie is the eighth, and we will swap the previous sequence toB B B A A B A A A BWith this operation, note that the quantities of letters A's and B's do not change and now the sequence starts with the letter B. With this operation, for every sequence that starts with B, which we already know has ties, we can uniquely associate another sequence starting with A with ties, and vice versa. Thus, the number of sequences with ties starting with A is equal to the number of sequences starting with B. With even more reason, we can conclude that the probability of a sequence starting with A and having ties is equal to the probability of a sequence starting with B. Since there are q letters B in a universe of p+q letters, the probability of a sequence starting with B is frac{q}{p+q}. Thus, as every sequence with ties starts with A or B, the probability of choosing, among the possible sequences of p letters A and q letters B, one with ties is frac{q}{p+q}+frac{q}{p+q}=frac{2 q}{p+q}.

Each committee member has exactly three enemies. It is also known that for each committee member, an enemy of his friend is automatically his own enemy. Find all possible value(s) of n","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a committee with ( n ) members.   - Each pair of members are either friends or enemies.   - Each member has exactly three enemies.   - An enemy of a friend is also an enemy of the member.2. Initial Observations:   - Each member has exactly three enemies, so the sum of the degrees of the vertices in the graph is ( 3n ).   - Each edge in the graph contributes 2 to the sum of the degrees, so the total number of edges is ( frac{3n}{2} ). This implies ( n ) must be even.3. Case Analysis:   - Case ( n = 4 ):     - If ( n = 4 ), each member has exactly 3 enemies. This means every member is an enemy to every other member. This forms a complete graph ( K_4 ) where every member is an enemy to every other member.     - This satisfies the condition that each member has exactly 3 enemies.   - Case ( n = 6 ):     - If ( n = 6 ), we need to check if we can partition the members into groups such that each member has exactly 3 enemies.     - One possible partition is to split the 6 members into two groups of 3, where each member in one group is an enemy to every member in the other group. This forms two complete subgraphs ( K_3 ) and ( K_3 ).     - Each member in one ( K_3 ) has exactly 3 enemies in the other ( K_3 ), satisfying the condition.4. Proof for Larger ( n ):   - Assume ( n > 6 ). Each member has ( n-4 ) friends and 3 enemies.   - If ( n > 6 ), then each member must be part of a complete subgraph ( K_{n-3} ).   - Since ( n-3 ) is greater than half of ( n ), each member must be part of a complete graph that consists of more than half the members.   - However, we can only form at most one ( K_{n-3} ), so only ( n-3 ) members can be in a ( K_{n-3} ). This leads to a contradiction because we cannot satisfy the condition for all members.5. Conclusion:   - The only possible values for ( n ) that satisfy the given conditions are ( n = 4 ) and ( n = 6 ).The final answer is ( boxed{n = 4, 6} )."},{"problem":"Given the sequence {a_n} satisfying (a_1=8,a_{n+1}-a_n=n), find the minimum value of frac{a_n}{n}.","solution":"AnalysisThis problem involves the properties of sequence functions.

What is the volume of the cylinder?","solution":"It is known that a regular tetrahedron can be inscribed in a cube such that two vertices of the tetrahedron are on opposite faces of the cube, and the edges of the tetrahedron form the diagonals of the cube's faces (Figure 1). From this, it is evident that the opposite edges of a regular tetrahedron are perpendicular to each other, and if the edge length of the tetrahedron is (a), then the length of the segment connecting the midpoints of two opposite edges is (frac{a sqrt{2}}{2}), and this segment is perpendicular to the planes that are parallel to both edges.Using these properties, we can easily determine the dimensions of the cylinder. Let the vertices (A) and (B) of the tetrahedron be on the base of the cylinder, and the vertices (C) and (D) be on the top face. The perpendicular projection of the edge (CD) onto the base is (C' D') (Figure 2). Since the cylinder is right, (C') and (D') are on the circumference of the base, and (C' D' = CD = AB). In the tetrahedron, (AB) and (CD) are opposite edges, so the segment connecting the midpoints of (AB) and (CD), (E) and (F), is perpendicular to the planes that are parallel to both (AB) and (CD); hence, it is perpendicular to the base and the top face of the cylinder. This means that (EF = frac{2 sqrt{2}}{2} = sqrt{2}) is the height of the cylinder, and the perpendicular projection of (F) onto the base, (F'), coincides with (E). Since the perpendicular projection of the midpoint of a segment is the midpoint of the perpendicular projection of the segment, (E) also bisects (C' D'). Therefore, the points (A, B, C'), and (D') on the circumference of the base circle (k) are such that (AB = C' D'), (AB perp C' D'), and the midpoints of (AB) and (C' D') (i.e., (E) and (F')) coincide (not as shown in Figure 2). Since the midpoint of a chord of a circle lies on the perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord, (AB) and (CD) must be diameters of the base and top circles, respectively.Thus, the radius of the base circle of the cylinder is (r = frac{AB}{2} = 1) unit, and the height of the cylinder is (m = sqrt{2}) units, so the volume of the cylinder is (V = r^2 pi m = sqrt{2} pi approx 4.44) cubic units.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_0e4dbd2f7c2f3151ec7cg-1.jpg?height=950&width=412&top_left_y=1018&top_left_x=867)"},{"problem":"Find the distance between two parallel lines l1: 3x + 4y - 4 = 0 and l2: 3x + 4y + 1 = 0.","solution":"The distance between two parallel lines l1: 3x + 4y - 4 = 0 and l2: 3x + 4y + 1 = 0 can be found using the formula:d = frac{|C_1 - C_2|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}},where Ax + By + C_1 = 0 and Ax + By + C_2 = 0 are the equations of the given lines.In this case, A = 3, B = 4, C1 = -4, and C2 = -1.

Interpret the problem in terms of graph theory:   - We are given 2014 points in the plane, no three of which are collinear.   - We need to find the minimum number of line segments (edges) such that adding any additional line segment will always form a triangle (a K_3 subgraph).2. Graph Theory Translation:   - Consider the points as vertices of a graph.   - We need to ensure that every pair of vertices has a common neighbor, which implies that adding any new edge will create a triangle.3. Constructing the Graph:   - To achieve the condition where adding any new edge forms a triangle, we can use a star graph configuration.   - In a star graph, one central vertex is connected to all other vertices. This ensures that every pair of vertices has a common neighbor (the central vertex).4. Counting the Edges:   - In a star graph with 2014 vertices, the central vertex is connected to the remaining 2013 vertices.   - Therefore, the number of edges in this configuration is 2013.5. Verification:   - If there are fewer than 2013 edges, the graph is not connected, meaning there exist at least two vertices with no path between them.   - Adding an edge between any two such vertices would not necessarily form a triangle, contradicting the problem's requirement.6.

A naoish number (n) is defined as:   - (n geq 90)   - The second-to-last digit of (n) is (9)2. Modulo Analysis:   Every naoish number (n) can be written in the form (n = 90 + 10a + b) where (a) is a non-negative integer and (b) is a digit from (0) to (9). This means that modulo (100), a naoish number is congruent to one of ({-10, -20, -30, ldots, -90}).3. Target Modulo:   We need to express (2020) as a sum of naoish numbers. First, we find the modulo (100) of (2020):   [   2020 equiv -80 pmod{100}   ]4. Greedy Algorithm:   To achieve (-80) modulo (100) using the fewest naoish numbers, we start by using the largest possible naoish number modulo (100), which is (-10). We need to sum up to (-80):   [   -10 times 8 = -80   ]   This means we need at least 8 naoish numbers to achieve (-80) modulo (100).5. Constructing the Sum:   We need to ensure that the sum of these naoish numbers equals (2020). We can use seven (90)s and one (1390):   [   90 times 7 + 1390 = 630 + 1390 = 2020   ]   Here, (90) is a naoish number and (1390) is also a naoish number because its second-to-last digit is (9).6. Verification:   - (90) is naoish.   - (1390) is naoish.   - The sum (90 times 7 + 1390 = 2020).Thus, the smallest positive number (k) for which Nino can express (2020) as a sum of naoish numbers is (8).The final answer is (boxed{8})"},{"problem":"Given that 0 < x < frac{1}{2}, find the minimum value of the function f(x)=frac{1}{x}+frac{4}{1{-}2x}.","solution":"Step 1: AnalysisThis problem involves using basic inequalities to find the minimum value of a function.

By adding 25 to both sides, we obtain the equivalent relation x y+5(x+y)+25=2030 from which, by factoring the first member, we get (x+5)(y+5)=2030=2 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 29. Since x is an integer, then x+5 is also an integer, and the same applies to y. Therefore, it is sufficient to distribute the prime numbers of the factorization of 2030 between the two factors x+5 and y+5, in all possible ways.Since x must be positive, then x+5 must be at least 6, as must y+5. In particular, both factors must be positive. Furthermore, the equation is symmetric in x and y, so we can assume that the only factor 2 divides x+5. For x+5, there are then 5 possibilities: 2 cdot 5, 2 cdot 7, 2 cdot 29, 2 cdot 5 cdot 7, 2 cdot 5 cdot 29. The other cases are x+5=2, which is to be excluded, x+5=2 cdot 7 cdot 29 and x+5=2 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 29, which are to be excluded because they imply y+5=5 and y+5=1 respectively. The cases where 2 divides y+5 are just as many, and are all distinct from the previous ones because there is only one factor 2 in 2030. Therefore, the answer is 5 cdot 2=10."},{"problem":"Find the sum of all the real values of x satisfying \\u0012(x+frac{1}{x}-17)^2 = x + frac{1}{x} + 17.","solution":"1. Let ( x + frac{1}{x} = y ).

Thus, 9 and 8 should be the leading digits of the two numbers, respectively.Now, select one digit from the remaining digits to add to 9 and 8 to form two two-digit numbers, and make their product as large as possible. Clearly, 7 and 6 should be chosen.Since 96 cdot 87 > 97 cdot 86, among the two-digit numbers formed by two digits, the product of 96 and 87 is the largest.From this, we consider the general case:Let A and B be natural numbers, with A > B. Now, add the digits c and d (c > d) to A and B to form new numbers. There are only two possible groups:First group: quad overline{A_{c}} = 10A + c, quad overline{B d} = 10B + d.Second group: quad overline{A d} = 10A + d, quad overline{B c} = 10B + c.Now, compare the products of these two groups of new numbers:begin{aligned}& overline{A c} cdot overline{B d} - overline{A d} cdot overline{B c} = & (10A + c)(10B + d) - (10A + d)(10B + c) = & 10(A d + B c - A c - B d) = & 10(A - B)(d - c) < 0 .end{aligned}Therefore,overline{A c} cdot overline{B d} < overline{A d} cdot overline{B c}.From this, we know that when dividing the four digits 9, 8, 7, and 6 into two groups to form two two-digit numbers, the first group should take 9, then the second group should take 8, and the first group should take the smaller of 7 and 6, which is 6, and the second group should take 7. This way, the product of the two two-digit numbers 96 cdot 87 is the largest.Similarly, for the six digits 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4, divide them into two groups to form two three-digit numbers. After the first group takes 96 and the second group takes 87, the first group should take the smaller of 5 and 4, which is 4, and the second group should take 5. This way, the product of the two three-digit numbers 964 cdot 875 is the largest.Finally, there is one digit 3 left. We can add another digit 0, and add 3 and 0 to 964 and 875, respectively. According to the above conclusion, the two numbers with the largest product should be 9640 cdot 8753. Removing the last digit 0, forming a three-digit number and a four-digit number, their product is the largest, which is 964 and 8753.Therefore, dividing the seven digits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 into two groups to form a three-digit number 964 and a four-digit number 8753, the product 964 cdot 8753 is the largest."},{"problem":"2.

Then 2 x-6 z-5 y-1=0, 5 y+4 x-3 z+1=0 and 1-2 x-10 y-3 z=0, which is impossible, as adding the second equation to the third and subtracting the first, we get 3=0. Therefore, at least one of the numbers a, b, c is zero. Consider the possible cases:1) All three numbers a, b, c are zero. The triplet a=b=c=0 clearly satisfies the conditions of the problem (it is sufficient to take x=y=z=0).2) Only two of the numbers a, b, c are zero. This is impossible: if two numbers are zero, then, according to (1), the third is also zero.3) Only one of the numbers a, b, c is zero:- a=0. Then x=-frac{5 y}{2}.

Sum of Arithmetic Series: The sum of the arithmetic series from ( m ) to ( n ) is given by:   [   S = m + (m+1) + (m+2) + cdots + n   ]   The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:   [   S = frac{(n - m + 1)(m + n)}{2}   ]   We are given that this sum is equal to the product ( mn ):   [   frac{(n - m + 1)(m + n)}{2} = mn   ]2.

When the large sphere is melted down to form 64 small spheres, the total volume remains constant, but the surface area increases.Given that the surface area of a sphere is 4pi r^2, and the volume of a sphere is frac{4}{3}pi r^3, the surface area is proportional to the square of the radius, while the volume is proportional to the cube of the radius.If the radius of the large sphere is R and the radius of each small sphere is r, then the volume of the large sphere is equal to the total volume of the 64 small spheres. Therefore, we have:[ frac{4}{3}pi R^3 = 64 times frac{4}{3}pi r^3 ]Simplifying, we find:[ R^3 = 64r^3 ][ R = 4r ]This means the radius of the large sphere is 4 times the radius of each small sphere. Since the surface area is proportional to the square of the radius, the total surface area of the 64 small spheres is:[ 64 times 4pi r^2 = 64 times (4^2) pi r^2 = 256 pi r^2 ]This is 4 times the surface area of the large sphere, which is 4pi R^2. Since it takes 2.4 kg of paint to cover the large sphere, it will take 4 times as much paint to cover the 64 small spheres:[ 2.4 times 4 = 9.6 ]Therefore, the amount of paint needed to coat the surfaces of these small spheres is boxed{9.6 text{ kg}}."},{"problem":"1.

There are a total of 381 lights. How many lights are there at the top of the tower?\\" This means: a tower with 7 floors has a total of 381 lights, and the number of lights on the next lower floor in each adjacent pair of floors is twice that of the upper floor. What is the number of lights at the top of the tower?A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that the number of lights on each floor of the tower forms a geometric sequence. This is because the number of lights on the next lower floor in each adjacent pair of floors is twice that of the upper floor. Let's denote the number of lights at the top floor (the first term of the geometric sequence) as a_{1}. The common ratio of this geometric sequence is 2, since the number of lights doubles on each descending floor.Given that the tower has 7 floors and the total number of lights across all floors is 381, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence to find a_{1}. The formula for the sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is:[S_n = frac{a_{1}(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}]where a_{1} is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, n=7, r=2, and S_7=381. Plugging these values into the formula gives:[381 = frac{a_{1}(1 - 2^7)}{1 - 2}]Simplifying the denominator and the numerator inside the fraction:[381 = frac{a_{1}(1 - 128)}{-1}][381 = frac{a_{1}(-127)}{-1}][381 = 127a_{1}]Dividing both sides by 127 to solve for a_{1}:[a_{1} = frac{381}{127}][a_{1} = 3]Therefore, the number of lights at the top of the tower is 3.

If the price is reduced by a dollars, then the increase in sales would be 2a items. Therefore, the new average daily sales can be expressed as:- Initial sales = 20 items- Increase in sales due to price reduction = 2a itemsHence, the average daily sales after the price reduction will be:[ text{Average daily sales} = 20 + 2a ]So, the algebraic expression for the average daily sales after a price reduction of a dollars is:[ boxed{2a + 20} ]# Part 2: Calculating the Price Reduction for a Daily Profit of 1200Let x be the amount by which the price of each item is reduced.

To achieve a daily profit of 1200, we set up the equation:[ (40 - x)(20 + 2x) = 1200 ]Expanding and solving this equation for x, we find two possible values for x, which are x_1 = 10 and x_2 = 20.To ensure the profit per item is not less than 25, we check both solutions:- For x_1 = 10: The new profit per item is 40 - 10 = 30 dollars, which is greater than 25. This satisfies the condition.- For x_2 = 20: The new profit per item is 40 - 20 = 20 dollars, which is less than 25.

Identify coordinates of the foci:Given the focal length 2c = 4, we have c = 2. Since the foci are on the x-axis due to the hyperbola's standard form and are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, their coordinates are F_1(-c, 0) and F_2(c, 0).

Otherwise, we say that n is composite.## Remark 2.2.13.The integer 1 is therefore not prime!From the definition of prime numbers, the following crucial results quickly follow.## Theorem 2.2.14.Let n be an integer and p a prime number. Either p divides n, or p is coprime with n, these two cases being mutually exclusive.Proof. First, if p divides n, then p is a common divisor of p and n, so p wedge n neq 1, which shows that p and n are not coprime. Now suppose that p does not divide n, and let d = p wedge n. Since d divides p, we know that d = 1 or d = p. Since d divides n, it follows that d neq p, and therefore d = 1.## Theorem 2.2.15.Let n be an integer such that n geqslant 2, and let p be the smallest divisor of n such that p geqslant 2. Then the integer p is a prime number.Proof. Since p geqslant 2, we already know that 1 and p are two distinct divisors of p. Now let d be a divisor of p. According to Theorem 2.2.3, and since p divides n, we know that d also divides n. By the minimality of p, we deduce that d = 1 or d = p, which means that p is prime.It is therefore very important to be able to detect whether an integer n is prime or not. Achieving this efficiently is a difficult question, which will be the subject of the course on \\"primality tests\\" given to group D. However, there is already an ancient and relatively efficient method when n is small: it is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which allows identifying the set of prime numbers less than or equal to n.Like the Euclidean algorithm, it is important to show that the Sieve of Eratosthenes returns the correct list of prime numbers p leqslant n.## Theorem 2.2.16.The list of integers returned by the Sieve of Eratosthenes is indeed the list of prime numbers p leqslant n.\`\`\`Algorithm 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes    Argument(s): (n quad triangleright) We want to identify the prime numbers (p leqslant n)    write all integers from 2 to (n)    as we go, we will either cross them out or circle them    while there is an integer (p leqslant sqrt{n}) that is neither crossed out nor circled:        choose the smallest such integer (p) and circle it        cross out all multiples of (p) between (p^{2}) and (n) that were not already crossed out    return the list of integers that were not crossed out (even those that are not circled)\`\`\`Proof. Our proof will proceed by induction on n. First, if n = 1, the result is obvious. We therefore assume that n geqslant 2 and that, if we run the Sieve of Eratosthenes with n-1 as the argument, it returns the correct list of prime numbers p leqslant n-1. Let's then see how it behaves when we give it n as the argument.Already, it is clear that the integers k leqslant n-1 that we will cross out are the same, whether the argument of the algorithm is n-1 or n. It remains to show that we will cross out n if it is composite, but not if it is prime.If n is prime, we will clearly never cross it out. We therefore treat the case where n is composite. Let p then be its smallest divisor such that p geqslant 2. Theorem 2.2.15 shows that p is prime. Moreover, since n = p times (n / p) and p < n, we know that n / p is a divisor of n greater than or equal to 2, so n / p geqslant p. This shows that p leqslant sqrt{n}.Since p is prime, we will never cross it out, so we will eventually circle it. By doing so, and since n geqslant p^{2}, we will necessarily cross out n. This concludes the proof of the theorem.","solution":"It suffices to list the positive divisors of each integer between 1 and 5: each integer n in{1,2,3,5} is only divisible by 1 and itself, whereas 4 is divisible by 1, 2, and 4.

Vertices Coordinates: The upper vertex is at (0,b), and the left and right vertices are at (-a,0) and (a,0), respectively.   2. Slopes Product: The slope from the upper vertex to the left vertex is frac{b-0}{0-(-a)}=frac{b}{a}, and to the right vertex is frac{b-0}{0-a}=-frac{b}{a}. The product of these slopes is given as -frac{1}{4}, so we have:   [   frac{b}{a} cdot left(-frac{b}{a}right) = -frac{1}{4}   ]   Simplifying, we find:   [   frac{b^2}{a^2} = frac{1}{4} implies a^2 = 4b^2   ]   Therefore, we conclude that a = 2b.3. Eccentricity Calculation: The eccentricity e of an ellipse is defined as e = frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center to a focus. Since a^2 = b^2 + c^2, substituting a = 2b gives:   [   (2b)^2 = b^2 + c^2 implies 4b^2 = b^2 + c^2   ]   Solving for c, we find c = sqrt{3b^2}, thus c = sqrt{3}b. The eccentricity e is then:   [   e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}b}{2b} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}   ]   Therefore, the eccentricity of the ellipse is boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.# Part 2: Finding the Standard Equation of the Ellipse CGiven that the line y=frac{1}{2}(x+1) intersects the ellipse at points A and B with |AB|=frac{sqrt{35}}{2}, we find the standard equation of the ellipse.1. System of Equations: Substituting y = frac{1}{2}(x+1) into the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{4b^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 gives:   [   frac{x^2}{4b^2} + frac{(frac{1}{2}(x+1))^2}{b^2} = 1   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2x^2 + 2x + 1 - 4b^2 = 0   ]2. Solving for x_1 and x_2: The discriminant Delta = 32b^2 - 4 must be greater than 0 for real intersections. The sum and product of roots formula give x_1 + x_2 = -1 and x_1x_2 = frac{1-4b^2}{2}.3. Chord Length |AB|: Using the distance formula for |AB|, we have:   [   |AB| = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}sqrt{8b^2 - 1} = frac{sqrt{35}}{2}   ]   Solving sqrt{8b^2 - 1} = sqrt{7}, we find b^2 = 1.4.

Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse C is:   [   frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1   ]   Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse C is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}."},{"problem":"Let a, b in mathbb{R}, and the set {0, b, frac{b}{a}} = {1, a, a+b}.

For proposition ③: If plane α intersects plane β at line m, and line n is parallel to line m, and line n is not contained within plane α or plane β, then by the criterion for determining parallel lines and planes, line n must be parallel to both plane α and plane β. Therefore, proposition ③ is correct.  For proposition ④: If line m is parallel to plane α and plane α is perpendicular to plane β, line m could intersect plane β, be parallel to plane β, or be contained within plane β. Proposition ④ does not consider these possibilities and assumes only perpendicularity, which is not necessarily true. Hence, proposition ④ is false.

Let the lengths of the 3 movements of the musical piece be a, b, c such that a < b < c; according to a + b + c = 60, we have c = 60 - a - b.

The possible pairs of a, b values are the coordinates of the points falling into the intersection of the relevant regions (the marked triangle), so by calculating the coordinates of the X, Y, Z points, we can obtain the limits of the shortest movement's length.

Ship K_{1} needs help and therefore wants to draw the attention of ship K_{2}, which, however, does not notice K_{1} and continues on the same course. How close can ship K_{1} get to ship K_{2} ifa) the speed of K_{2} is also v and the captain of ship K_{1} at each moment in time directs it straight towards K_{1} K_{2} (which, of course, changes continuously during the movement of both ships);b) the speed of ship K_{1} is u < v, and the captain of K_{1} immediately assumes that the direction of movement of ship K_{2} will not change, and chooses the course of his ship accordingly?","solution":"39. a) Let's denote by alpha the angle between the course of ship K_{1} and (constant) course of ship K_{2} at some moment in time t; it is clear that the angle alpha will change over time. At the moment t, ship K_{1} is approaching K_{2} at a speed v; as for ship K_{2}, it is moving away from K_{1} in the direction K_{1} K_{2} at a speed v cos alpha (this is the projection of the speed overline{K_{2} T_{2}} of ship K_{2} onto the direction K_{1} K_{2}; see Fig. 101); thus, the approach of the ships at the moment t occurs at a speed v - v cos alpha = v(1 - cos alpha), and as time goes on, as the angle alpha decreases, the speed of approach of the ships becomes smaller. Note now that the projection P of ship K_{1} onto the path i of ship K_{2} \\"chases\\" ship K_{2} at a speed v cos alpha (this is the projection of the speed overline{K_{1} T_{1}} of ship K_{1} onto the direction of the line l); ship K_{2}, on the other hand, moves away from point P at a speed K_{2} T_{2} = nu. Thus, the segment P K_{2} increases at the same speed v - v cos alpha = v(1 - cos alpha) at which the distance between the ships decreases, from which it follows that the sum K_{1} K_{2} + P K_{2} remains constant at all times - it is equal to d, since d is equal to this sum at the initial moment (Fig. 8). The closer ship K_{1} approaches the line l, the closer in magnitude the segments K_{1} K_{2} and P K_{2} become (with K_{1} K_{2} always being greater than P K_{2}). Thus, the distance K_{1} K_{2} always remains greater than d/2; however, with the increase of t, it approaches d/2 indefinitely.b) Let K_{1}^{prime} and K_{2}^{prime} be the positions of the ships at the moment when the distance between them reaches the smallest possible value (Fig. 102, a). It is clear that ship K_{1} has arrived at point K_{1}^{prime} along a straight path K_{1} K_{1}^{prime}: otherwise, it could have shortened the travel time by moving along the segment K_{1} K_{1}^{prime}. Moreover, it is natural to assume that ship K_{1} arrives at point K_{1}^{prime} along the line K_{1}^{prime} K_{2}^{prime}, since if this were not the case, the captain of ship K_{1} could have, by choosing the route K_{1} K_{2}^{prime} from the beginning, approached K_{2}^{prime} closer than it actually happened (see Fig. 102, sigma, where K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{prime prime} = K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{prime},![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-128.jpg?height=396&width=441&top_left_y=922&top_left_x=604)Fig. 101. and point K_{1}^{prime prime} is closer to K_{2}^{prime} than point K_{1}^{prime}).Let the angle between the lines K_{1} K_{1}^{prime} and K_{2} K_{2}^{prime} = l be denoted by alpha; if the angle between the lines K_{1} K_{2} and l is alpha^{prime}, where K_{1} and K_{2} are the positions of the ships at some moment in time t, then the speed u cos (alpha^{prime} - alpha), at which ship K_{1} approaches the second ship at the moment t, must be greater than the speed v cos alpha^{prime}, at which K_{2} moves away from K_{1} at the same moment, and this must be true at any moment in time before the moment t_{0} when the ships arrive at points K_{1}^{prime} and K_{2}^{prime} (the ships are approaching); it must be equal to the speed v cos alpha^{prime} at the moment t_{0}, when alpha^{prime} = alpha (the ships stop approaching); finally, the speed u cos (alpha - alpha^{prime}) must be less than the speed v cos alpha^{prime} at the moment t following t_{0} (the ships start moving away from each other).From this we obtain (Fig. 102, a):u = v cos alpha, quad text{i.e.} quad cos alpha = frac{u}{v}which determines the course that the captain of ship K_{1} should choose.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-129.jpg?height=44&width=990&top_left_y=271&top_left_x=211)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-129.jpg?height=360&width=456&top_left_y=329&top_left_x=223)a)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-129.jpg?height=373&width=486&top_left_y=330&top_left_x=700)b)Fig. 102.If the ships K_{1} and K_{2} have traveled the same amount of time, thenfrac{K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{prime}}{u} = frac{K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{prime}}{v}, text{ i.e. } K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{prime} = K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{prime} cdot frac{u}{v} = K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{prime} cos alphaAnd since, obviously, K_{1}^{0} K_{2}^{prime} = frac{d}{sin alpha} and K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{prime} = d operatorname{ctg} alpha, we finally obtainbegin{aligned}& K_{1}^{prime} K_{2}^{prime} = K_{1}^{0} K_{2}^{prime} - K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{prime} = frac{d}{sin alpha} - d operatorname{ctg} alpha cdot cos alpha = frac{d}{sin alpha} (1 - cos^2 alpha) = & = d sin alpha = d sqrt{1 - cos^2 alpha} = d sqrt{1 - left(frac{u}{v}right)^2} = frac{d sqrt{v^2 - u^2}}{v}end{aligned}"},{"problem":"Example 4 consists of forming n-digit numbers using the digits 1,2,3, and in this n-digit number, each of 1,2,3 must appear at least once.

The two cylinders are identical, and in their raised position, their bottom faces are in the same horizontal plane. In 1 day, both cylinders sink 2 meters. The sinking of the first cylinder is proportional to the time elapsed since the winding, while the second one is proportional to the number of strikes performed. The striking mechanism strikes the number of hours at each full hour - counting the hours from noon to midnight from 1 to 12 - and once at each half hour, with the last strike in the series indicating the hour.We want to achieve that the two cylinders reach each other as many times as possible during the day (alternating their deeper hanging role). Determine the winding times that ensure the maximum number of encounters. 1 Winding can only be performed at half-minute marks (between 20 and 30 seconds) after a full minute, during which there is never a strike.The length of the cylinders is 20 mathrm{~cm}. Is it possible for the cover of one of them to be deeper than the base of the other?[^0][^0]:    { }^{1}[1] We can rely on the time-distance graph of the movements.","solution":"The number of overtakes is as many times as the graphs of the daily movements of the N_{1} and N_{2} weights, drawn in the same coordinate system, intersect (have a common point). For now, we only consider the movement of the bottom ends of the cylinders, the decrease in height. We also consider an overtake if the two bottom ends reach the same horizontal level, and from there, the bottom end that previously arrived there again goes deeper earlier. The initial level alignment is naturally not an overtake.After 24 hours, an overtake is certainly established, as by then N_{1} and N_{2} have sunk the same amount. In fact, an overtake is already established after 12 hours, since the mechanism's operation repeats every 12 hours. For this reason, the graph of N_{2}, whenever a pull occurs, completely contains the stepped curve labeled ddot{u} in Figure 1, which is the image of the movement from 0^{mathrm{h}} to 12^{mathrm{h}}. The complete graph of N_{2} would be obtained by cutting ddot{u} (its copy) at the point F corresponding to the time of the pull, and attaching the lower end V of ddot{u} to the starting point K of ddot{u}, and the upper part to V. (The seemingly vertical line segments of the ddot{u} curve are actually very steep, since the clock strikes 12 in less than half a minute, and during this time N_{2} sinks more than 13 mathrm{~cm}.) Then the uniform sinking of N_{1}, which operates the mechanism, is represented by the straight line connecting the two new positions of F. Since this line is clearly parallel to K V, it is sufficient to focus on the part of ddot{u} drawn on the diagram, draw a parallel to K V through F, and take twice the number of intersection points found.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_648de63c84b114f717c2g-1.jpg?height=1012&width=1612&top_left_y=779&top_left_x=254)The search for the desired pull times now consists of parallelly translating the line K V and counting the number of intersection points with ddot{u} in each position. However, it is more convenient to perform the search on the 2nd diagram, which shows the advantage of N_{1} over N_{2} at a pull at 0^{mathrm{h}} (although the problem does not allow this), i.e., how much deeper N_{1} is. This graph can be used for any pull time F by drawing a line f parallel to the time axis through the point with abscissa F (e.g., F=2^{mathrm{h}} 20^{mathrm{m}}), and taking the advantage as positive downward and negative upward from this point. Thus, we need to find the positions of f where it intersects the curve e the most. These are the positions between the lines m_{1} and m_{2} on the diagram, where the number of intersection points is 18. The corresponding pull time intervals in minutes are[begin{array}{ll}3^{mathrm{h}} 50^{mathrm{m}}-3^{mathrm{h}} 57^{mathrm{m}}, & 6^{mathrm{h}} 6^{mathrm{m}}-6^{mathrm{h}} 13^{mathrm{m}} 4^{mathrm{h}} 22^{mathrm{m}}-4^{mathrm{h}} 37^{mathrm{m}}, & 7^{mathrm{h}} 10^{mathrm{m}}-7^{mathrm{h}} 17^{mathrm{m}} 4^{mathrm{h}} 10^{mathrm{m}}-5^{mathrm{h}} 17^{mathrm{m}}, & 8^{mathrm{h}} 22^{mathrm{m}}-8^{mathrm{h}} 37^{mathrm{m}} & 9^{mathrm{h}} 50^{mathrm{m}}-9^{mathrm{h}} 57^{mathrm{m}}end{array}]and the pull should always be performed between the 20th and 30th seconds of the minute. Thus, in 5% of the possible pull times, we get the maximum number of overtakes, 36 per day.The 2nd diagram also shows that the cover of each cylinder can be deeper than the bottom of the other, even the cover starting 20 cm behind can gain an advantage over the other bottom, because the curve has points with ordinates differing by more than 20 cm. For example, in the case of a pull at 0^{mathrm{h}} 0^{mathrm{m}} 20^{mathrm{s}}, from about 3^{mathrm{h}} 45^{mathrm{m}} to 10^{mathrm{h}}, with minor omissions, N_{1} is deeper than N_{2} throughout its length (the line n_{1} on the diagram), but in the case of a pull at 6^{mathrm{h}} 59^{mathrm{m}} 20^{mathrm{s}}, the situation is reversed between 12^{mathrm{h}} and 13^{mathrm{h}} (the line n_{2}). - These can also be read from the 1st diagram, of course."},{"problem":"How many quadratic residues are there modulo p?","solution":"X^{p-1}-1=left(X^{(p-1) / 2}-1right)left(X^{(p-1) / 2}+1right) so X^{(p-1) / 2}-1 has (p-1) / 2 roots.

The probability of selection for any individual is indeed frac{n}{N}, showing that each individual has the same likelihood of being in the sample.In systematic sampling, although the starting point is usually chosen randomly, every k-th individual is selected (where k is typically N/n).

Samples are drawn from each stratum, often proportional to stratum size. If the sampling within strata is random and proportional to the strata's sizes, every individual will still have an equal probability of being selected.Hence, regardless of the sampling method used — simple random sampling, systematic sampling, or stratified sampling — the probability of an individual being selected is equal across all methods.

These phenomena all share a similar curve shape. In fact, these curves are often referred to as catenary curves in mathematics. The theory related to catenary curves has a wide range of applications in engineering, navigation, optics, and other fields. Below, we will study a class of functions related to catenary curves, expressed as f(x)=ae^{x}+be^{-x} where a, b are non-zero constants, and the irrational number e=2.71828….1.

When a=1, f(x)=e^{x}+be^{-x},Since f(x) is an even function, we have f(-x)=f(x),which means e^{-x}+be^{x}=e^{x}+be^{-x},thus, b=1.So, for the first part, b=boxed{1}.2. When a=1, b=-1, f(x)=e^{x}-e^{-x} is an increasing function.For the second part, a set of values that meet the condition is a=1, b=-1, so boxed{a=1, b=-1}.3. When ableqslant 0, f(x) is a monotonic function, and in this case, the function does not have a minimum value.If f(x) has a minimum value of 2, then it must be that a > 0, b > 0,At this time, f(x)=ae^{x}+be^{-x}geqslant 2sqrt{ae^{x}cdot be^{-x}}=2sqrt{ab}=2,which means sqrt{ab}=1, hence ab=1,then a+bgeqslant 2sqrt{ab}=2,so the minimum value of a+b is 2.Therefore, the answer for the third part is boxed{2}.In summary:1. When a=1, by combining the function's evenness and using the definition of an even function, we can solve it.2. The solution can be found by considering the monotonicity of the exponential function.3.

All six cells of any 2times 3 (or 3 times 2) rectangle have different colors. Find the smallest possible value of n.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to color an infinite table such that any (2 times 3) or (3 times 2) rectangle has all six cells colored differently. We aim to find the smallest number (n) of colors required to achieve this.2. Initial Consideration:   Let's consider the constraints. For any (2 times 3) or (3 times 2) rectangle, all six cells must have different colors. This implies that we need at least 6 colors to start with, but we need to check if 6 colors are sufficient or if more are needed.3. Construction with 8 Colors:   We propose a construction using 8 colors. We can divide the infinite table into strips of width 2, alternating between two sets of colors. For example, we can use the following pattern:   - Strip 1: Colors (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4)   - Strip 2: Colors (C_5, C_6, C_7, C_8)   This pattern ensures that no (2 times 3) or (3 times 2) rectangle will have repeated colors because each strip will have a unique set of colors, and the alternating pattern ensures that adjacent strips do not repeat colors within the required rectangle dimensions.4. Verification:   To verify, consider any (2 times 3) rectangle. It will span across two strips, and since each strip has a unique set of 4 colors, the rectangle will have 6 different colors. The same logic applies to any (3 times 2) rectangle.5. Proof by Contradiction:   Suppose (n < 8). If we use fewer than 8 colors, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must repeat within any (2 times 3) or (3 times 2) rectangle, violating the problem's condition. Therefore, (n = 8) is the smallest number of colors required.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 8 } )."},{"problem":"## Task A-3.3.In triangle A B C, |A B|=|A C|.

This inequality is not true for all x in mathbb{R}.For the case when a neq 0, the given condition implies that  begin{cases} a > 0  2^{2}-4a  1.Thus, the range of a for which ax^{2}+2x+1 > 0 always holds true for all x in mathbb{R} is a > 1.In other words, if p(x) is true for all x in mathbb{R}, then the range of values for the real number a is a > 1.Therefore, the answer is boxed{a > 1}.The approach here involves first converting the proposition p(x) into an inequality that holds true for all real numbers. The inequality is then analyzed for the two cases: a=0 and a neq 0. The case a = 0 leads to a linear inequality, while a neq 0 results in a quadratic inequality. The quadratic inequality is always true when its corresponding graph opens upwards and doesn't intersect the x-axis. Finally, solve the resulting inequality to obtain the range of a.This solution employs the important mathematical concept of case analysis, which is especially useful when solving problems involving propositions that must hold true for all values of an unknown variable."},{"problem":"Suppose 28 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances.

Consider each person as a point. Without loss of generality, let the point where Wang is located be denoted as A. Since handshakes occur in pairs, the number of people on either side of Wang and the person he shakes hands with must be 0 or even.If there are 2 people, there is only one way to shake hands, so N_{1}=1.If there are 4 people, Wang can shake hands with his adjacent person (such as B or D in Figure 5-21), but not with the opposite person C, as this would cause a crossing. Therefore, N_{2}=2.If there are 6 people, Wang can shake hands with his adjacent person (such as B or F in Figure 5-22), and the remaining 4 people have N_{2} ways to shake hands. Wang can also shake hands with the opposite person D, with 2 people on each side of AD, and BC and FE each have N_{1} ways to shake hands. Therefore, N_{3}=2 N_{2}+N_{1}^{2}=5.Using this method, we can gradually find N_{6}.When there are 8 people, Wang can shake hands with his adjacent person (such as B or H in Figure 5-23). The remaining 6 people on one side have N_{3} ways to shake hands. Wang can also shake hands with D or F, with 2 people on one side having N_{1} ways to shake hands and 4 people on the other side having N_{2} ways to shake hands.

For the end points to coincide with the solution set {x|1leqslant xleqslant 2}, the following must hold:- When x=frac{a-1}{2}, we should have x=1, which gives us the equation frac{a-1}{2}=1 and a=3.- When x=frac{a+1}{2}, we should have x=2, which gives us the equation frac{a+1}{2}=2 and a=3.By solving these equations, we conclude that a=3, thus the value of a is boxed{a=3}."},{"problem":"Task B-2.5.

Suppose the degree of the polynomial P is not less than 4, then its leading coefficient is not less than 1. Since all other coefficients of P(x) are non-negative, then P(5) geqslant 5^{4}=625, which contradicts the condition P(5)=152.Therefore, the degree of the polynomial P is not more than 3, and P(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d for some non-negative integers a, b, c, d.

Given that angle B = 120^circ in triangle ABC, we need to find angle A'B'C', where A', B', and C' are the points where the angle bisectors of angle A, angle B, and angle C intersect the opposite sides, respectively.2. Recall that the angle bisectors of a triangle intersect at the incenter, which is the center of the circle inscribed in the triangle. The incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.3. Since angle B = 120^circ, the remaining angles angle A and angle C must sum to 60^circ because the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ. Therefore, we can write:   [   angle A + angle C = 60^circ   ]4. The angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the angle into two equal parts. Therefore, the angle bisector of angle B will divide it into two angles of 60^circ each:   [   angle AB'B = angle CB'B = 60^circ   ]5. Now, consider the triangle formed by the incenter I and the points A', B', and C'. Since I is the incenter, angle A'IB', angle B'IC', and angle C'IA' are the angles formed by the angle bisectors.6. The angle bisectors of angle A and angle C will divide these angles into:   [   angle A'IA = frac{angle A}{2}, quad angle C'IC = frac{angle C}{2}   ]7. Since angle A + angle C = 60^circ, we have:   [   frac{angle A}{2} + frac{angle C}{2} = frac{60^circ}{2} = 30^circ   ]8. Therefore, the angle at the incenter I between the angle bisectors of angle A and angle C is:   [   angle A'IC' = 180^circ - left( frac{angle A}{2} + frac{angle C}{2} right) = 180^circ - 30^circ = 150^circ   ]9. Since angle B = 120^circ, the angle bisector of angle B divides it into two 60^circ angles. Therefore, the angle at B' is:   [   angle A'B'C' = 180^circ - angle A'IC' = 180^circ - 150^circ = 30^circ   ]10. However, this contradicts the initial solution provided.

They can be verified to work through inspection, using the well known fact that the Fermat prime F_{i}=2^{2^{i}}+1 is indeed prime for i=0,1, ldots, 4 (but not prime when i=5 ).We turn to the proof that these are the only valid values of n. In both solutions that follow, d(n) is the divisor counting function.『 First approach (from author). Let d be the divisor count function. Now suppose n works, and write n=2^{k} m with m odd. Observe that2^{n}-1=left(2^{m}-1right)left(2^{m}+1right)left(2^{2 m}+1right) cdotsleft(2^{2^{k-1} m}+1right),and all k+1 factors on the RHS are pairwise coprime. In particular,dleft(2^{m}-1right) dleft(2^{m}+1right) dleft(2^{2 m}+1right) cdots dleft(2^{2^{k-1} m}+1right)=2^{k} m .Recall the following fact, which follows from Mihǎilescu's theorem.Lemma2^{r}-1 is a square if and only if r=1, and 2^{r}+1 is a square if and only if r=3.Now, if m geq 5, then all k+1 factors on the LHS are even, a contradiction. Thus m leq 3. We deal with both cases.If m=1, then the inequalitiesbegin{array}{c}dleft(2^{2^{0}}-1right)=1 dleft(2^{2^{0}}+1right) geq 2 dleft(2^{2^{1}}+1right) geq 2 vdots dleft(2^{2^{k-1}}+1right) geq 2end{array}mean that it is necessary and sufficient for all of 2^{2^{0}}+1,2^{2^{1}}+1, ldots, 2^{2^{k-1}}+1 to be prime. As mentioned at the start of the problem, this happens if and only if k leq 5, giving the answers n in{1,2,4,8,16,32}.If m=3, then the inequalitiesbegin{array}{c}dleft(2^{3 cdot 2^{0}}-1right)=2 dleft(2^{3 cdot 2^{0}}+1right)=3 dleft(2^{3 cdot 2^{1}}+1right) geq 4 vdots dleft(2^{3 cdot 2^{k-1}}+1right) geq 4end{array}mean that k geq 2 does not lead to a solution. Thus k leq 1, and the only valid possibility turns out to be n=6.Consolidating both cases, we obtain the claimed answer n in{1,2,4,6,8,16,32}.₪ Second approach using Zsigmondy (suggested by reviewers). There are several variations of this Zsigmondy solution; we present the approach found by Nikolai Beluhov. Assume n geq 7, and let n=prod_{1}^{m} p_{i}^{e_{i}} be the prime factorization with e_{i}>0 for each i. Define the numbersbegin{aligned}T_{1} & =2^{p_{1}^{c_{1}}}-1 T_{2} & =2^{p_{2}^{c_{2}}}-1 & vdots T_{m} & =2^{p_{m}^{c_{m}}}-1 .end{aligned}We are going to use two facts about T_{i}.Claim - The T_{i} are pairwise relatively prime andprod_{i=1}^{m} T_{1} mid 2^{n}-1 .Proof. Each T_{i} divides 2^{n}-1, and the relatively prime part follows from the identity operatorname{gcd}left(2^{x}-1,2^{y}-1right)=2^{operatorname{gcd}(x, y)}-1.Claim - The number T_{i} has at least e_{i} distinct prime factors.Proof. This follows from Zsigmondy's theorem: each successive quotient left(2^{p^{k+1}}-1right) /left(2^{p^{k}}-right. 1) has a new prime factor.Claim (Main claim) - Assume n satisfies the problem conditions. Then both the previous claims are sharp in the following sense: each T_{i} has exactly e_{i} distinct prime divisors, andleft{text { primes dividing } prod_{i=1}^{m} T_{i}right}=left{text { primes dividing } 2^{n}-1right} .Proof. Rather than try to give a size contradiction directly from here, the idea is to define an ancillary functions(x)=sum_{p text { prime }} nu_{p}(x)which computes the sum of the exponents in the prime factorization. For examples(n)=e_{1}+e_{2}+cdots+e_{m} .On the other hand, using the earlier claim, we getsleft(dleft(2^{n}-1right)right) geq sleft(dleft(prod T_{i}right)right) geq e_{1}+e_{2}+cdots+e_{m}=s(n) .But we were told that dleft(2^{n}-1right)=n; hence equality holds in all our estimates, as needed.At this point, we may conclude directly that m=1 in any solution; indeed if m geq 2 and n geq 7, Zsigmondy's theorem promises a primitive prime divisor of 2^{n}-1 not dividing any of the T_{i}.Now suppose n=p^{e}, and dleft(2^{p^{e}}-1right)=n=p^{e}. Since 2^{p^{e}}-1 has exactly e distinct prime divisors, this can only happen if in fact2^{p^{e}}-1=q_{1}^{p-1} q_{2}^{p-1} ldots q_{e}^{p-1}for some distinct primes q_{1}, q_{2}, ldots, q_{e}. This is impossible modulo 4 unless p=2. So we are left with just the case n=2^{e}, and need to prove e leq 5. The proof consists of simply remarking that 2^{2^{5}}+1 is known to not be prime, and hence for e geq 6 the number 2^{2^{e}}-1 always has at least e+1 distinct prime factors."},{"problem":"G2.4 In the figure, vertices of equilateral triangle A B C are connected to D in straight line segments with A B=A D.

This means that equivalent placements correspond to isomorphic graphs, and non-equivalent placements correspond to non-isomorphic graphs. Thus, the number of non-equivalent placements of marked cells is equal to the number of non-isomorphic graphs corresponding to some placements. Let's see what graphs correspond to some placements of marked cells. First, each part of this graph must have 11 vertices (the part of rows and the part of columns). Second, the degree of each vertex is 2, which means the graph decomposes into cycles. Since the graph is bipartite, the lengths of these cycles are even.

Initially, there are no pieces except in an m x n rectangle (m, n > 1) which has a piece on each square. What is the smallest number of pieces that can be left after a series of moves?","solution":"2 if mn is a multiple of 3, 1 otherwise Solution Obviously 1 x 2 and 2 x 2 can be reduced to 1. Obviously 3 x 2 can be reduced to 2. Note that pieces on the four X squares can be reduced to a single X provided that the square Y is empty (call this the L move): . . Y . . X . . X . . . X X X X X . . . X . . . . . X . . . . . . . . X Now given 4 x 2 we can reduce it to 1 x 2: . . . . X . . . X X . . . . X . then the L move X X X X . X X X . . X X . . X X X X X X . X X X . . X X . . X X Thus given m x 2 with m > 3 we can reduce it to (m-3) x 2 and hence to one of 1 x 2, 2 x 2, 3 x 2. Note also that we are removing 3 pieces at each stage so we end up with 1 piece unless m is a multiple of 3. Given m x 3 with m > 1 we can use the L move to reduce it to (m-1) x 3. Hence by a series of L moves we get to 3 x 1 and hence to 2 pieces. Now given m x n with m ≥ 4 and n ≥ 3, we can treat it as a 3 x n rectangle adjacent to an (m-3) x n rectangle. We can now reduce the 3 x n to 3 x 3 using L moves (with the L upright). We can then eliminate the 3 x 3 using L moves (with the L horizontal). Note that we have not changed mn mod 3. This deals with all cases, except that we do not reduce 4 x 4 to 1 x 4. Instead we use L moves as follows: X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X . X X . . X . . . X X X X . X X X . X X X . X X . .

So we have shown that if mn is not a multiple of 3 we can always reduce to a single piece. Clearly we cannot do better than that. We have also shown how to reduce to two pieces if mn is a multiple of 3. It remains to show that we cannot do better. Color the board with 3 colors in the usual way: ... ...1 2 3 1 2 3 ... ...2 3 1 2 3 1 ... ...3 1 2 3 1 2 ... ... Then any move changes the parity of the number of pieces on each color. If mn is a multiple of three, then these three numbers start off equal and hence with equal parity. But a single piece has one number odd and the other two even.

Therefore, angle B G F is the plane angle of the dihedral angle B-A C-E.In the right triangle B C E, E C=sqrt{B C^{2}+B E^{2}}=sqrt{6}, B F=frac{B C cdot B E}{E C}=frac{2 times sqrt{2}}{sqrt{6}}=frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3},Therefore, in the right triangle B F G, sin angle B G F=frac{B F}{B G}=frac{frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3}}{sqrt{2}}=frac{sqrt{6}}{3}.Therefore, the dihedral angle B-A C-E equals arcsin frac{sqrt{6}}{3}.(2) Draw E O perp A B at point O, E O=1.Since the dihedral angle D-A B-E is a right dihedral angle, so E O perp plane A B C D.Let the distance from D to plane A C E be h,Since V_{D-A C E}=V_{E-A C D}, so frac{1}{3} S_{triangle A C E} cdot h=frac{1}{3} S_{triangle A C D} cdot E O.Since A E perp plane B C E, so A E perp E C.Therefore, h=frac{frac{1}{2} A D cdot D C cdot E O}{frac{1}{2} A E cdot E C}=frac{frac{1}{2} times 2 times 2 times 1}{frac{1}{2} times sqrt{2} times sqrt{6}}=frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3}.Therefore, the distance from point D to plane A C E is frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3}.Solution 2 (1) As shown in the figure, take the midpoint of line segment A B as the origin O, O E as the x-axis, A B as the y-axis, and establish a spatial rectangular coordinate system O-x y z.Similarly to solution 1, A E perp plane B C E, B E subset plane B C E, so A E perp B E,In the right triangle A E B, A B=2, O is the midpoint of A B, so O E=1,Therefore, A(0,-1,0), E(1,0,0), C(0,1,2).overrightarrow{A E}=(1,1,0), overrightarrow{A C}=(0,2,2) text {. }Let a normal vector of plane A E C be boldsymbol{n}=(x, y, z),Then left{begin{array}{l}overrightarrow{A E} cdot n=0,  overrightarrow{A C} cdot n=0,end{array}right. which is left{begin{array}{l}x+y=0,  2 y+2 z=0 .end{array}right.Let x=1, we get n=(1,-1,1) is a normal vector of plane A E C.Also, a normal vector of plane B A C is boldsymbol{m}=(1,0,0),Therefore, cos langleboldsymbol{m}, boldsymbol{n}rangle=frac{boldsymbol{m} cdot boldsymbol{n}}{|boldsymbol{m}| cdot|boldsymbol{n}|}=frac{1}{sqrt{3}}=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}.Therefore, the size of the dihedral angle B-A C-E is arccos frac{sqrt{3}}{3}.(2) Since A D / / z-axis, A D=2, so overrightarrow{A D}=(0,0,2),Therefore, the distance from point D to plane A C E is d=|overrightarrow{A D}| cdot|cos langleoverrightarrow{A D}, boldsymbol{n}rangle|=frac{|overrightarrow{A D} cdot n|}{|n|}=frac{2}{sqrt{3}}=frac{2}{3} sqrt{3}.10.

The main monument of rabbinical writing is the \\"Talmud\\" (i.e., teaching, explanation), which was created between 300 BC and 500 AD. This is a kind of huge encyclopedia, where a number of treatises contain a lot of information on astronomy, mathematics, and metrology.

Let S be the center of the parallelogram B P T Q, and let B^{prime} neq B be the point on the ray B M such that B M=M B^{prime} (see Figure 1). It follows that A B C B^{prime} is a parallelogram. Then, angle A B B^{prime}=angle P Q M and angle B B^{prime} A=angle B^{prime} B C=angle M P Q, and so the triangles A B B^{prime} and M Q P are similar. It follows that A M and M S are corresponding medians in these triangles. Hence,angle S M P=angle B^{prime} A M=angle B C A=angle B T A .Since angle A C T=angle P B T and angle T A C=angle T B C=angle B T P, the triangles T C A and P B T are similar. Again, as T M and P S are corresponding medians in these triangles, we haveangle M T A=angle T P S=angle B Q P=angle B M P text {. }Now we deal separately with two cases.Case 1. S does not lie on B M. Since the configuration is symmetric between A and C, we may assume that S and A lie on the same side with respect to the line B M.Applying (1) and (2), we getangle B M S=angle B M P-angle S M P=angle M T A-angle B T A=angle M T B,and so the triangles B S M and B M T are similar. We now have B M^{2}-B S cdot B T=B T^{2} / 2, so B T=sqrt{2} B M.Case 2. S lies on B M. It follows from (2) that angle B C A=angle M T A=angle B Q P=angle B M P (see Figure 2). Thus, P Q | A C and P M | A T. Hence, B S / B M-B P / B A-B M / B T, so B T^{2}=2 B M^{2} and B T=sqrt{2} B M.Comment 1. Here is another way to show that the triangles BSM and B M T are similar. Denote by Omega the circumcircle of the triangle A B C. Let R be the second point of intersection of omega and Omega, and let tau be the spiral similarity centered at R mapping omega to Omega. Then, one may show that tau maps each point X on omega to a point Y on Omega such that B, X, and Y are collinear (see Figure 3). If we let K and L be the second points of intersection of B M with Omega and of B T with omega, respectively, then it follows that the triangle M K T is the image of S M L under tau. We now obtain angle B S M=angle T M B, which implies the desired result.Solution 2. Again, we denote by Omega the circumcircle of the triangle A B C.Choose the points X and Y on the rays B A and B C respectively, so that angle M X B=angle M B C and angle B Y M-angle A B M (see Figure 4). Then the triangles B M X and Y M B are similar. Since triangle X P M-angle B Q M, the points P and Q correspond to each other in these triangles. So, if overrightarrow{B P}=mu cdot overrightarrow{B X}, then overrightarrow{B Q}-(1-mu) cdot overrightarrow{B Y}. Thusoverrightarrow{B T}-overrightarrow{B P}+overrightarrow{B Q}-overrightarrow{B Y}+mu cdot(overrightarrow{B X}-overrightarrow{B Y})-overrightarrow{B Y}+mu cdot overrightarrow{Y X},which means that T lies on the line X Y.Let B^{prime} neq B be the point on the ray B M such that B M=M B^{prime}. Then angle M B^{prime} A= angle M B C=angle M X B and angle C B^{prime} M-angle A B M=angle B Y M. This means that the triangles B M X, B A B^{prime}, Y M B, and B^{prime} C B are all similar; hence B A cdot B X-B M cdot B B^{prime}-B C cdot B Y. Thus there exists an inversion centered at B which swaps A with X, M with B^{prime}, and C with Y. This inversion then swaps Omega with the line X Y, and hence it preserves T. Therefore, we have B T^{2}-B M cdot B B^{prime}=2 B M^{2}, and B T=sqrt{2} B M.Solution 3. We begin with the following lemma.Lemma. Let A B C T be a cyclic quadrilateral. Let P and Q be points on the sides B A and B C respectively, such that B P T Q is a parallelogram. Then B P cdot B A+B Q cdot B C=B T^{2}.Proof. Let the circumcircle of the triangle Q T C meet the line B T again at J (see Figure 5). The power of B with respect to this circle yieldsB Q cdot B C-B J cdot B T text {. }We also have angle T J Q=180^{circ}-angle Q C T=angle T A B and angle Q T J=angle A B T, and so the triangles T J Q and B A T are similar. We now have T J / T Q-B A / B T. Therefore,T J cdot B T=T Q cdot B A-B P cdot B A text {. }Combining (3) and (4) now yields the desired result.Let X and Y be the midpoints of B A and B C respectively (see Figure 6). Applying the lemma to the cyclic quadrilaterals P B Q M and A B C T, we obtainB X cdot B P+B Y cdot B Q-B M^{2}andB P cdot B A+B Q cdot B C=B T^{2} text {. }Since B A-2 B X and B C=2 B Y, we have B T^{2}-2 B M^{2}, and so B T=sqrt{2} B M.Comment 2. Here we give another proof of the lemma using Ptolemy's theorem. We readily haveT C cdot B A+T A cdot B C=A C cdot B T text {. }The lemma now follows fromfrac{B P}{T C}=frac{B Q}{T A}=frac{B T}{A C}=frac{sin angle B C T}{sin angle A B C} ."},{"problem":"Given two non-collinear vectors overrightarrow {e_{1}} and overrightarrow {e_{2}} in a plane, overrightarrow {a} = 2overrightarrow {e_{1}} - 3overrightarrow {e_{2}} and overrightarrow {b} = lambda overrightarrow {e_{1}} + 6 overrightarrow {e_{2}}.

Let the numbers at the vertices be denoted as x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{2019}. Since the sum of any nine consecutive numbers is the same, the numbers that are 8 apart are equal. Therefore, x_{1}=x_{10}=x_{19}=ldots=x_{1+9 k}=ldots. Since 2019 is not divisible by 9 but is divisible by 3, continuing this sequence in a cycle will include all numbers of the form x_{3 k+1}. Similar sequences can be constructed starting from the numbers x_{2} and x_{3}. Thus, the numbers at the vertices that have the same remainder when divided by 3 are equal.Since each set of nine consecutive numbers contains three sets of vertices with different remainders when divided by 3, the sum of the numbers in each such set is 100. Note that 19 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 20 gives a remainder of 2, and 2019 gives a remainder of 0, so the number written at vertex 2019 is 100 - 19 - 20 = 61.## CriteriaThe largest suitable criterion is used:7 points.

We need to find points (D) on side (AC) and (E) on side (AB) such that the area of triangle (ADE) equals the area of quadrilateral (DEBC), and the segment (DE) has the minimum possible length.2. Area Relationship:    - The area of triangle (ABC) is given by:     [     text{Area}(ABC) = frac{1}{2} AB cdot AC cdot sin A     ]   - The area of triangle (ADE) is given by:     [     text{Area}(ADE) = frac{1}{2} AD cdot AE cdot sin A     ]   - Since the area of triangle (ADE) equals the area of quadrilateral (DEBC), we have:     [     text{Area}(ADE) = frac{1}{2} text{Area}(ABC)     ]   - Therefore:     [     frac{1}{2} AD cdot AE cdot sin A = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{2} AB cdot AC cdot sin A right)     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     AD cdot AE cdot sin A = frac{1}{2} AB cdot AC cdot sin A     ]   - Dividing both sides by (sin A), we obtain:     [     AD cdot AE = frac{1}{2} AB cdot AC     ]3.

Apply then Turán's theorem (no ( p+1 ) cliques) on each of the ( k ) connected components to get that the total number of edges in the connected components, and consequently the total number of edges in ( G_1 ), does not exceed (frac{p-1}{2p}sum x_i^2).   We now have lower and upper bounds for the number of edges in ( G_1 ):   [   frac{n^2(p-1)}{2} le frac{p-1}{2p}sum x_i^2   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   sum x_i^2 ge pn^2   ]   But Karamata's inequality applied to the strictly convex function ( x^2 ) and the ( k )-tuplets ((n,n,ldots,n,0,0,ldots,0)) and ((x_1,x_2,ldots,x_k)) implies exactly the opposite inequality, leading to a contradiction.2. There exists a graph for which the largest connected component is of size exactly ( n ).   For this, we group all ( n ) vertices on a shore in ( p ) equisized groups. Now take group ( i ) from shore ( k ) and group ( j ) from shore ( l ). We color the edges between the two groups in the color which is equal to ( 1 + (j-i)(l-k)^{-1} ) in ( mathbb{Z}_p ). It is readily checkable that each color graph ( G_i ) contains exactly ( p ) size-( n ) connected components of the form ( K_{d,d,ldots,d} ), where ( d = frac{n}{p} ), so the example is correct, and we are done.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n } )."},{"problem":"One day when Wendy is riding her horse Vanessa, they get to a field where some tourists are following Martin (the tour guide) on some horses.

However, the problem's condition implies they are parallel but point in opposite directions, which means their components must be proportional with opposite signs. First, let's find the value of lambda that satisfies the condition of being in opposite directions. Since they are parallel, we can equate their components after setting a proportionality constant that is negative because they point in opposite directions. However, the problem directly jumps to solving lambda(lambda +1)-3 times 4=0, which seems to stem from misunderstanding the parallel condition. The correct approach for finding lambda when vectors are in opposite directions is to look for when their components are proportional but have opposite signs, which is not directly solved by the given equation. However, following the solution's steps for consistency:1. Solving lambda(lambda +1)-3 times 4=0 gives us lambda^2 + lambda - 12 = 0.2.

Apply the Rational Root Theorem:   According to the Rational Root Theorem, if (frac{a}{b}) is a rational root of the polynomial (3x^2 - px + q = 0), then (a) must be a divisor of the constant term (q) and (b) must be a divisor of the leading coefficient (3). Therefore, the possible values for (a) are (pm 1, pm q) and for (b) are (pm 1, pm 3).2. List all possible rational roots:   The possible rational roots are:   [   pm 1, pm q, pm frac{1}{3}, pm frac{q}{3}   ]3. Consider the distinct roots condition:   Since the roots must be distinct and rational, we need to consider the combinations of these roots. We also need to ensure that the polynomial remains a quadratic with integer coefficients.4. Analyze the combinations:   - If both roots have (b = 3), the leading coefficient would be (9), which is not possible since the leading coefficient is (3).   - If both roots have (b = 1), the leading coefficient remains (3), but this would imply that (p) and (q) are not primes unless the polynomial is (3(x^2 - x + 1)), which does not work.5. Consider one root with (b = 3) and the other with (b = 1):   - Let one root be (frac{a}{3}) and the other be (b), where (a) is a divisor of (q) and (b) is a divisor of (3).6. Form the polynomial with these roots:   - Suppose the roots are (frac{1}{3}) and (q). Then the polynomial can be written as:     [     3 left( x - frac{1}{3} right) left( x - q right) = 3 left( x^2 - left( q + frac{1}{3} right) x + frac{q}{3} right)     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     3x^2 - left( 3q + 1 right) x + q = 0     ]     This implies (p = 3q + 1).   - Suppose the roots are (frac{q}{3}) and (1). Then the polynomial can be written as:     [     3 left( x - frac{q}{3} right) left( x - 1 right) = 3 left( x^2 - left( 1 + frac{q}{3} right) x + frac{q}{3} right)     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     3x^2 - left( q + 3 right) x + q = 0     ]     This implies (p = q + 3).7.

Introduce the harmonic sum and relevant inequalities:   We denote the harmonic sum ( H(k) = sum_{i=1}^k frac{1}{i} ). We recall the classical inequalities:   [   frac{x}{1+x} < ln(1+x) < x quad text{for any } x > 0,   ]   and its consequence:   [   ln(k+1) < H(k) < 1 + ln k quad text{for any positive integer } k.   ]3.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:   [   sum_{i=1}^k ln left(1 + frac{x_0}{i}right) = ln left(1 + frac{a}{k!}right).   ]5. Use the inequalities for the logarithm:   We know that:   [   sum_{i=1}^k ln left(1 + frac{x_0}{i}right) < sum_{i=1}^k frac{x_0}{i} = x_0 H(k) < x_0 (1 + ln k).   ]   Also,   [   ln left(1 + frac{a}{k!}right) > frac{frac{a}{k!}}{1 + frac{a}{k!}} = frac{a}{k! + a} = a x_0.   ]6. Combine the inequalities:   From the above, we get:   [   x_0 (1 + ln k) > a x_0.   ]   Dividing both sides by ( x_0 ) (which is positive), we obtain:   [   1 + ln k > a.   ]   Since ( k = 2020 ), we have:   [   ln 2020 approx 7.611.   ]   Therefore,   [   1 + ln 2020 approx 8.611.   ]   Hence,   [   a < 8.611.   ]7. Estimate ( a ) from below:   To find a lower bound for ( a ), we use the fact that:   [   sum_{i=1}^k ln left(1 + frac{x_0}{i}right) > sum_{i=1}^k frac{x_0}{i + x_0} > sum_{i=1}^k frac{x_0}{i + 1}.   ]   Since ( x_0 ) is very small, we approximate:   [   sum_{i=1}^k frac{x_0}{i + 1} approx x_0 H(k-1).   ]   Using the inequality:   [   ln left(1 + frac{a}{k!}right) < frac{a}{k!},   ]   we get:   [   x_0 H(k-1) < frac{a}{k!}.   ]   Therefore,   [   a > H(k-1) k! x_0.   ]   Since ( H(k-1) approx ln k ),   [   a > ln k.   ]   Thus,   [   a > 7.611.   ]8.

Among the 7 rays leading to the other vertices, 3 are edges of the cube: AB, AD, and AE, 3 are face diagonals: AC, AF, AH, and the seventh, AG, is a space diagonal. The mentioned 3 edges can be transformed into each other by 120^{circ} rotations around AG, and the same applies to the mentioned face diagonals, so it is sufficient to determine the magnitudes of the angles whose one side is AB or AC.AB forms a right angle with AD and AE, and similarly, the diagonal AH does as well. The diagonals AC and AF form a 45^{circ} angle, because, for example, ABF is an isosceles right triangle. Finally, in the right triangle ABG, if AB is taken as a unit, then BG = sqrt{2}, so the tangent of the angle BAG is sqrt{2}.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the sum of the number of ways to distribute ( k ) candies to 2006 children such that each child receives at most 2 candies, where ( k ) is congruent to 1 modulo 3. This can be represented as ( f(2006, 1) + f(2006, 4) + ldots + f(2006, 1000) + f(2006, 1003) + ldots + f(2006, 4012) ).2. Generating Function Approach:   The generating function for distributing candies where each child can receive 0, 1, or 2 candies is given by:   [   (1 + x + x^2)^{2006}   ]   We need to find the sum of the coefficients of ( x^k ) where ( k equiv 1 pmod{3} ).3. Using Roots of Unity Filter:   To isolate the coefficients where ( k equiv 1 pmod{3} ), we use the roots of unity filter. The sum of the coefficients of ( x^k ) where ( k equiv 1 pmod{3} ) in the expansion of ( (1 + x + x^2)^{2006} ) can be found using:   [   frac{1}{3} left[ (1 + x + x^2)^{2006} + (1 + omega + omega^2)^{2006} + (1 + omega^2 + omega^4)^{2006} right]   ]   where ( omega ) is a primitive 3rd root of unity, i.e., ( omega = e^{2pi i / 3} ).4. Evaluating the Expression:   - ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ) are roots of the equation ( omega^3 = 1 ) and satisfy ( 1 + omega + omega^2 = 0 ).   - Therefore, ( (1 + omega + omega^2)^{2006} = 0 ) and ( (1 + omega^2 + omega^4)^{2006} = 0 ).   Thus, the expression simplifies to:   [   frac{1}{3} left[ (1 + x + x^2)^{2006} + 0 + 0 right] = frac{1}{3} (1 + x + x^2)^{2006}   ]5.

We know that the distance from a point to a line is the length of the perpendicular segment from the point to the line. Draw perpendiculars from A and C to the common edge EB of the two triangles (Figure 3). From the congruence of triangles AEB and CEB, it follows that the two perpendiculars intersect the edge EB at the same point P. The distance AP can be determined from the similarity of triangles ETB and APB, both of which are right-angled and have the common angle EBA (Figure 4).

Define the Problem in Terms of Bilinear Forms:   We start by noting that the trace function text{trace}(AB) defines a symmetric bilinear form on the space of n times n real matrices, denoted as Mat_n(mathbb{R}). Specifically, for matrices A, B in Mat_n(mathbb{R}), we define the bilinear form (A, B) := text{trace}(AB).2. Properties of the Bilinear Form:   The bilinear form (A, B) := text{trace}(AB) is symmetric because text{trace}(AB) = text{trace}(BA) for any matrices A and B. This symmetry implies that the form is well-suited for analysis using tools from the theory of quadratic forms and orthogonal spaces.3. Decomposition Using Witt's Theorem:   According to Witt's theorem, any symmetric bilinear form on a vector space over a field can be decomposed into a direct sum of orthogonal subspaces. For the space Mat_n(mathbb{R}), this decomposition is:   [   Mat_n(mathbb{R}) = L_0 oplus L_{an} oplus L_h   ]   where:   - L_0 is the kernel of the bilinear form (matrices A such that text{trace}(AB) = 0 for all B),   - L_{an} is the anisotropic part (contains no isotropic vectors),   - L_h is the hyperbolic part (contains pairs of isotropic vectors).4. Analyzing the Kernel L_0:   We claim that L_0 = 0. To see why, consider any non-zero matrix A. We can always find a matrix B such that text{trace}(AB) neq 0. For example, if A has a non-zero entry a_{ij}, we can choose B to be a matrix with a 1 in the (j,i) position and zeros elsewhere. This choice ensures that text{trace}(AB) = a_{ij} neq 0. Hence, L_0 = 0.5. Dimension of L_{an}:   The anisotropic part L_{an} contains all diagonal matrices because no diagonal matrix can be isotropic (i.e., text{trace}(A^2) neq 0 for any non-zero diagonal matrix A). The dimension of the space of diagonal matrices is n, so dim L_{an} geq n.6. Dimension of L_h:   Since L_0 = 0, the remaining part of the space is L_{an} oplus L_h. The total dimension of Mat_n(mathbb{R}) is n^2, so:   [   dim L_{an} + dim L_h = n^2   ]   Given that dim L_{an} geq n, it follows that:   [   dim L_h leq n^2 - n = n(n-1)   ]7. Maximal Isotropic Subspace:   We seek the dimension of a maximal isotropic subspace V within Mat_n(mathbb{R}). A maximal isotropic subspace in L_h (since L_{an} contains no isotropic vectors) must have a hyperbolic counterpart. By a well-known lemma in the theory of quadratic forms, the dimension of any maximal isotropic subspace V satisfies:   [   2 dim V leq dim L_h leq n(n-1)   ]   Therefore:   [   dim V leq frac{n(n-1)}{2}   ]8. Example to Achieve the Bound:   The space of upper triangular matrices (excluding the diagonal) provides an example of a subspace where text{trace}(AB) = 0 for all A, B in the subspace. The dimension of this subspace is indeed frac{n(n-1)}{2}, showing that the bound is achievable.Conclusion:[boxed{frac{n(n-1)}{2}}]"},{"problem":"3.

Consider the inequality of the system and plot the set of its solutions on the coordinate plane. To remove the absolute values, find the sets of points where the expressions under the absolute values are zero. These are the lines x-3-y=0 and x-3+y=0. They divide the plane into 4 parts, and in each of these parts, the signs of the expressions under the absolute values are constant. To determine them, we can choose a point in each of the four parts and calculate the signs of the expressions at these points. Consider the region located below both lines. For example, the point (0 ; -10) lies in this region. By substitution, it is easy to verify that in this point, the expression x-3-y is positive, and x-3+y is negative. Thus, the inequality becomes (x-3-y)-(x-3+y) leqslant 6, from which y geqslant -3. Taking into account the considered constraints, the region lying above the line y=-3 and below the lines x-3-y=0, x-3+y=0 is suitable.

Determine the least number of divisors an atresvido number can have.","solution":"1. Let ( n ) be an atresvido number. By definition, the set of divisors of ( n ) can be split into three subsets with equal sums. This implies that the sum of all divisors of ( n ), denoted by ( sigma(n) ), must be at least ( 3n ) because ( n ) itself is one of the divisors and must be included in one of the subsets. Therefore, we have:   [   sigma(n) geq 3n   ]2. We use the known bound for the sum of divisors function:   [   frac{sigma(n)}{n} < prod_{p mid n} frac{p}{p-1}   ]   where the product runs over all distinct prime divisors of ( n ). This inequality is derived from the formula for ( sigma(n) ) for ( n = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_k^{alpha_k} ):   [   sigma(n) = left( frac{p_1^{alpha_1+1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} right) left( frac{p_2^{alpha_2+1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} right) cdots left( frac{p_k^{alpha_k+1} - 1}{p_k - 1} right)   ]   Dividing by ( n ), we get:   [   frac{sigma(n)}{n} = prod_{i=1}^k frac{p_i^{alpha_i+1} - 1}{p_i^{alpha_i}(p_i - 1)}   ]   Since ( frac{p_i^{alpha_i+1} - 1}{p_i^{alpha_i}} < frac{p_i}{p_i - 1} ), it follows that:   [   frac{sigma(n)}{n} < prod_{p mid n} frac{p}{p-1}   ]3. To satisfy ( sigma(n) geq 3n ), we need:   [   prod_{p mid n} frac{p}{p-1} geq 3   ]   If ( n ) has at most two distinct prime divisors, the product ( prod_{p mid n} frac{p}{p-1} ) would be at most:   [   frac{2}{1} cdot frac{3}{2} = 3   ]   This is the exact bound, not exceeding 3, so ( n ) must have at least three distinct prime divisors.4. Consider ( n ) with three distinct prime divisors.

The minimum number of divisors for such ( n ) is:   [   min{2^4, 4 cdot 2^2, 3^2 cdot 2} = 16   ]   For example, ( n = 120 = 2^3 cdot 3 cdot 5 ) has 16 divisors and is atresvido because:   [   sigma(120) = 360   ]   The divisors can be split into three subsets with equal sums:   [   120 = 60 + 40 + 20   ]   Therefore, the minimum number of divisors is ( boxed{16} )."},{"problem":"Given that the estimated slope of the regression line is 1.23, and the center of the sample points is (4,5), then the equation of the regression line is (    )A: hat{y}=1.23x+0.08B: hat{y}=1.23x+5C: hat{y}=1.23x+4D: hat{y}=0.08x+1.23","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the linear regression equation.

Start with the given equation:   z+zi=22. Factor out z:   z(1+i)=23. To find z, we divide both sides by (1+i):   z=frac{2}{1+i}4. To simplify the fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:   z=frac{2}{1+i} cdot frac{1-i}{1-i} = frac{2(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}5. Simplify the expression:   z=frac{2(1-i)}{1^2 - i^2} = frac{2(1-i)}{2} = 1-i6. To find overline{z}, we take the conjugate of z:   overline{z} = 1+i7. We are asked to find the modulus of overline{z}+i, so we add i to overline{z}:   overline{z}+i = 1+i+i = 1+2i8. The modulus of a complex number a+bi is given by sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, so we calculate:   |overline{z}+i| = |1+2i| = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{1+4} = sqrt{5}Therefore, the modulus of overline{z}+i is sqrt{5}.
