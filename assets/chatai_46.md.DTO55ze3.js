I was placed on a very low dose of a beta blocker (12.5mg Atenolol). I also have anxiety and depression and a little over a year ago, I was placed on buspirone 15mg once daily and clonazapam as needed (usually take .5mg-1mg). My question is, is it safe for me to smoke marijuana considering my heart ‘condition’ AND with the medicines I’m currently taking? I used to smoke every day, several times a day for a little over a year, but stopped due to a tachycardic episode about 5 weeks ago. However, I was put on the beta blocker AFTER I stopped smoking. Since I’m on the beta blocker now, is it safe for me to continue smoking marijuana since the beta blocker has significantly lowered my heart rate and blood pressure? If not consumable by smoking, is it safe perhaps to consume an edible? I’m asking because marijuana does help with my anxiety and is a much safer and less addictive alternative to any benzodiazepine.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

She has never liked to talk to anyone and at first, I thought she didn t like us. Over the years, we just figured that she must be shy. But, she really doesn t even communicate with her children, other than telling them to clean, clean, clean, because she does admit that she has OCD. During the past 5 or so years she has said that she has one disease after another and has been to many many doctors for her bad feet and bad stomach and bad back. It is always something and many doctors have told her that they can t find anything wrong, but she will go onto the internet and look up diseases and then seem to have those symptoms by a day or two later. When she was growing up in her own family, her parents never took her to a doctor when she was really sick and always told her that it was all in her head. They never allowed her to have friends over and her parents never had any other friends other than close family. My son is a very social person who works for a large company hardware store and he is their road manager. She doesn t like the fact that he is around a lot of people and she wants him to be with her. He is very much in love with his wife but he has told her for years that he would like to see her make friends with women her own age so she could have a friend to go shopping with or to a movie or out to dinner, like other women do. She says she doesn t know anyone. My son has taken her with him to meet other couples that he has met through his work and he said that they are really nice people who live good lives and have been really nice to her but she won t speak to them. She just sits at the table and watches everyone else having fun socializing. My heart goes out to her and my son is so frustrated, he doesn t know what to do. He sees these same things in the children ages, 10, 8, 7, and 5. They are becoming more introverted and don t like to talk to people. He tells the children that it is not polite to not speak to someone when they are speaking to you and with the boys, it seems, that they are trying to be friendlier but their only daughter is exactly like her mother. She just acts miserable all of the time. Also my son s wife has been pointing out things that she thinks the children have or is coming down with. She has convince the older child that he has migraines just like her and she was even saying that their daughter is getting rheumatoid arthritis. When I asked the child if she is having pain, she just looked at her mother and then shrugged as if she were afraid to say something wrong. I know that my daughter-in-law should seek professional help and I have seen the stress on my son and all 4 of the children but I don t know what to tell my son for advice as to how he should approach this matter. I am not even sure what this would be diagnosed as. My son called me last night and he was desperate to get her the help she needs but she doesn t really see that she has a problem. She said, she just doesn t like people. I have spent many hours at their home baby sitting and the children are such beautiful and intelligent children but they have mentioned that the only thing their mother cares about is being on the computer and looking up diseases. What they don t realize, is that much of her fears and anxieties have already rubbed off on them. They are just children. Everything has to have its PROPER place in the house or she has a fit. If a dirty tissue is thrown into the bathroom waste basket. It will not stay there more than a few minutes, because when she goes to the bathroom the next time, she will empty it even if it has one thing in it. When you take your shoes off in their house, the children will stand like they are on shoe patrol and will tell you how they have to be place on the floor. I like a clean house as much as the next person but I want to live and relax and be at home in my home. She runs the home like a army barracks. Like I said, They have been married for 17 years and my son loves his wife very much. And for the most part, he has always just looked the other way and said, Oh well, that s just the way she is. But it is not healthy and she is not happy. He wants to see her have a life with friends and to see her smile. Please if you can help give me some advice about this situation and how would be a good way to handle it so she can get the help she needs. She does know that it is not right because she is never happy but I think she just doesn t know what to do because she has always been this way and her mother is the same way. She sees it in her mother and it bothers her too. I hope this stays confidential Thank you Doctor","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

(Fortunately- this is the ONLY thing that runs in my family-- no cancer, no high blood pressure, no diabetes, serious illnesses, etc.)... Unfortunately, anxiety is NO SMALL THING. I have had the worst case of it in all of my immediate and extended family, and there are no adequate words to describe what it s like to deal this with disorder. It feels like MASSIVE amounts of adrenaline-- sometimes for long periods of time-- uncontrollably being produced by your body... and the worst part is that sometimes there are triggers that start these anxiety attacks or panic attacks-- but other times, both myself, 1/2 of my siblings --(a clue that this disorder has a genetic-base and biological root-- rather than an environmental trigger in our family or something to do with our upbringing or any dysfunction aspects of our family) -- have had absolutely TOTALLY random anxiety for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. It is a miserable condition. Now... 1 or my 2 daughters (who has always had some anxiety)... is dealing with college, assignments & homework, a few professors that are extremely difficult for students to deal with, a part time job, a boyfriend, and she is currently about to do a mid-year/ (2nd semester of her Junior college year) transfer to a different University (not large-- mid-size) beginning in January and is preparing for that. Is it any wonder that she s having panic attacks...? Of course not-- this is a very stressful age of life-- I remember it like it was yesterday; however, her family doctor and I do not seem to be able to get a handle on helping her regardless of medications tried, a counselor/ talk-therapist, lots of immediate family support and extended family support... and I guess I just need some advice about the medications that we are trying right now-- the mixture of them -- and the possible side effects that we might run into... (did I mention that my daughter s worrying about the possible side effects of these new medications is causing her even MORE anxiety....?) She has been on 20 mg of Prozac for the past approximately 8 years. We found that Prozac works extremely well with my family members... Zoloft works okay, Paxil is a disaster, (the missing doses hell and the huge amount of possible weight gain!!), and Wellbutrin-- which many of our friends all seem to swear by -- seems to help the depression aspects that my family experiences -- but it also seems to have a rare side effect in my family -- which is that Wellbutrin causes EVEN MORE ANXIETY and makes it completely unmanageable (something about the fact that it works on the other neurotransmitters which help Dopemine levels-- wheras our deficiency seems to almost ALWAYS be in the Seratonin deficiency area... I have a psychiatrist for myself-- (since I ve had anxiety attacks since the age of THREE... And yes, I do remember them well & exactly when they started...and there were no triggers). I ve tried many meds over the years to try to best treat my anxiety as well as my depression (and I ve got some OCD mixed in there too! : / )... so I know a lot about many of them. My psychiatrist and I presently, and have found that the best thing for my biology/ chemistry of my body is 1) 60 mg of Prozac 2) Temazepam for anxiety/ insomnia at bedtime 3) GABA (Neurontin) - small dose - but to keep building it up in my bloodstream to help with the anxiety, and 4th ) Valium - 3 times per day for some serious life issues that I am currently dealing with -- including the recent death of my Father 4 months ago, trying to help my Mother, being a single parent to 1 young adult (the daughter that I am writing about) as well as 1 sixteen-year old daughter, and having gone through a horrible divorce about 2 years ago after a seemingly solid and happy marriage for 28 years. (We plan to take the Valium down to 2 X per day soon... and then to 1X per day after that - in order to avoid the addictive effects). *I want my 20 year old daughter - with all of this college-age stress, (as well as after-effects of the divorce), to see my own psychiatrist-- since he understands the biology/ chemistry of my family-- however, he has a 6-month waiting list for Intakes/ New Patients ... We can t wait that long. As I said, this daughters is seeing a good counselor/ therapist-- and she is good and helpful, but the anxiety attacks are still serious & not manageable. So her family doctor/ personal physician has tried to prescribe appropriate medications for her. 1) He has upped her dose to 40 mg. 2) He has prescribed Ativan-- ONLY for when the panic attacks/ anxiety becomes EXTREME (he gives her a limited number, of course).... and now he just met with her, and wants to had Buspar(ine) ?? My question is: Does this sound like a good idea...? A good combination of medications-- given her current age, college status, life stressors (transferring colleges to 1 that is an hour away from home), part time work stress, massive amounts of homework, a boyfriend, and this horrible divorce that was just 2 years ago? Also, does this sound like a good combination of meds based on what I ve mentioned about my immediate family s predisposition for these disorders/ imbalances with serotonin and the way that the Family of Meds that include the Wellbutrin kind don t seem to be a good fit for us.....? (isn t Buspar(ine) in the same medication family as Wellbutrin? Thanks for your help, in advance! -Sherry YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a racing heart and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others. While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety medicines alone cannot cure anxiety disorders mainly because medicines do not alter behavior. Behavior change and Continuous practice of the changed behavior cure anxiety. I suggest anxiety education, progressive counseling and progressive psychotherapy. I assure you complete cure.

She is a retired school principal who, up until this, was active, organized and intelligent. She did, however, drink consistently for as long as I can remember. On most nights she would have 3-4 drinks. She started to have some lapses in short term memory and would often ask the same question several times. Her primary physician started to prescribe medication for this as well as for depression. (She had started having crying spells) She cut down significantly on drinking, but her cognition got worse. She was often unable to interpret her environment. This came on quickly. She was admitted to the hospital for a few days where no tests or real observations were done, but medications were added and she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. The medications started building up —- at this point she was on 16 different things including antidepressants, benzodiazepine, and Alzheimer’s medication. She is only seeing a primary physician and psychiatric nurse practitioner regularly. We did have an appointment with a neurologist who read her brain scan and said he only saw typical signs of aging— no shrinkage. While some meds have been discontinued, she is still on several, including the benzo. My step dad is taking care of her with some assistance from home health care. She often goes from being calm with some clarity to excessive crying and possible hallucinations throughout the day. She seems to get better, then regress. She is worse when she has a UTI, but even when clear, she is in somewhat of a state of delirium most of the time. I feel like no one is looking at the big picture with her.

He has been diagnosed in early childhood with ADHS, and later on with developmental disability (i.e. some type of learning disorder), also with paranoid schizophrenia, and he is also on the autism spectrum. He is now 37 years old, and has not received very much in the way of basic counseling, or strong encouragement to make the most of his abilities. He is currently living in a good AFC Home, but has very little motivation to make the most of his potential. He does have a court-appointed guardian, because my husband and I paid to get a guardian appointed legally for him. He is very stubborn, and manipulative, and REFUSES anything and everything that could help him. He even REFUSES to wear eyeglasses, even though he has worn them since the age of 6!! He REFUSES basic dental care, etc. etc. He last saw a dentist when he graduated from high school. He RESENTS me, his step mom, because I am a retired R.N., and I have spoken with his caretakers (many of them over the years), and with Community Mental Health, and with his guardian regarding his situation. He has now even strictly informed his AFC Home caretakers that they are not to speak with me about anything pertaining to him, (although I have been able to do this in a limited way without his knowledge), and he has recently even refused to speak with me on the phone, although he will beg for money or to be taken out on an outing with his father. He informed his sister, my stepdaughter, that he feels pressure from me, although when we are on a family get together, he will never directly tell me this. My question is: How am I going to be able to continue to advocate FOR him, which is all that I have been doing, (any my step daughter and her husband, and my husband have been in FULL agreement with me on these issues. My stepson continues to experience periodic hospitalizations, and he continues to experience the consequences of his own behavior and refusals. The AFC Home MUST administer his medications, provide meals for him, etc. etc. What also are my husband and I supposed to do about the fact that my stepson begs us for money at times, and continues to THROW AWAY anything and everything that has any value or meaning to it. I no longer even feel comfortable giving him 50 for his birthday, and at Christmas, because we know that he will misspend it (at least this has been his pattern, even with things and money given to him by other family members), or THROW IT AWAY. We are at our wit s end with him, and I think that that he has succeeded in pushing us away from him. I am leaving this all in God s capable hands, and I am comfortable with my husband setting limits with him, and at least rarely going on a social outing with him, etc. etc. I would like your recommendations, because I would have to pay out a lot of money to hire a special PATIENT ADVOCATE for me to resolve some of the communication barriers and walls that he has set up! HIPPA laws have not been very helpful, either, but I do respect that there does need to be SOME protections/privacy in place when it comes to patient confidentiality. However, having a very high STONE WALL in place is not healthy for any of us family members, who are trying to help him to lead a more responsible, dignified, and fulfilled life. He was able to hold down a job for 1-2 years as a bagger at D & W in the Cascade, Michigan area, but he has not worked in 20 or so years, and he is not allowed to drive. Thank You, Marcia K.

It feels as though it is biological or hormonal in origin. However, when I was a teen I was diagnosed by our family MD as panic attacks and prescribed Imipramine. The medication may have reduced occurrences but did not stop them. I had several attacks in one day which resulted in such fatigue that I needed to be assisted to walk. The attacks stopped independently after a few years in young adulthood. Since then I will get little precursors much like used to indicate an imminent attack before a major attack as a teen. I have read everything I can about panic attacks and while a few minor points sound similar, I do not believe that is what they are. They were like dreaming while fully awake and functional and I was able to communicate and listen during them although only did so at the encouragement of the doctor. I learned to dread the attacks because of how exhausted and yukky I felt afterward and believe the doctor used this information to diagnose panic disorder. Having mini attacks this morning and am left feeling dizzy and slightly confused and brain fuzzy in general. I am currently on Synthroid of 4 mg I think? And Zoloft 75 MG per day and a blood pressure med in the AM however I was not on any medication as a teen while experiencing the full attacks. Any ideas is greatly appreciated!

Please type your query here...My oldest boy is 17 (my nephew - he and his sister have lived with us for the past ten yrs, after their mom passed away). Recently, he told me that he had sex for the first time (twice in the last month) with his girlfriend, also 17. We are very close and he tells me (pretty much) everything. When I asked him if it was everything he had expected, he said \\"no\\". I explained to him that sex takes practice, like anything else, to get good at it and that the first few times it's awkward, nervousness, etc. so it  won't be all fireworks and whistles at first.  He agreed and said that he was sure that was it. I got the distinct impression from him that it didn't really go well at all. When I asked him why he didn't feel it went very well he said there are no problems getting an erection or anything like that. It must have just been nervousness, inexperience, etc.  He told me that he did not feel that he or his girlfriend were ready for that type of relationship and that they wouldn't be having sex for a while until they were both more mature and ready(his girlfriend has some issues she is seeing a pcychiatrist about and he doesn't feel that he or she is ready for this serious of a relationship). The boy does not lie as a rule so I trust him when he says that they will not have sex for now. The conversation turned to masturbation as an alternative to sex and I suggested he stick with masturbation to \\"get by\\" until he and she are more ready for it. He told me that he doesn't really feel any urge to masturbate very often and may only do it once a week, if that, sometimes as little as once every two weeks. On further discussion he also told me that he doesn't really get \\"horny\\" or \\"lustful\\" feelings even when he wakes up with an erection.   Now, it has been my experience that the average 17yr old does not stop having sex once they start (who does!) and that the average teenager masturbates A LOT more than this and generally has \\"lustful\\" or \\"horny\\" feelings much more often. I am asking if I should be concerned about his sexual health or if this is normal. Also, he has adhd and has been taking concerta for the past 7 years until recently when the pediatric pcychologist he has been seeing took him off the meds as he has been doing so well. He continues to do well without the meds. I am wondering if the meds may have had an effect or if I am worrying about nothing. I realize that people have different sex drives, etc. and that it is hard to categorize somebody in an \\"average\\" range. I am absolutely positive that the boy is not telling me everything and that he is holding something back, like maybe he IS concerned about it or something,however, I don't want to push him in to telling me before he is ready so I would like some advice on this before I talk to him again.","Doctor":"Hello, Some medicines used for the treatment do cause lethargy and sluggishness which in turn can cause low sexual response.

Several years ago when my father passed away I was put on Xanax and was up to 5mg a day for almost 5 years. Lost my health insurance and the health dept wouldn t prescribe me Xanax even to be gradually taken off of it, this led to me getting cut off cold turkey and I went through the worst withdrawals that I didn t know existed until afterwards when I looked up Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome and found out that them making me stop cold turkey could have killed me (and trust me, it felt like I was literally dying by day 3). Against my better judgement last year I started taking them again, this time 1mg twice a day. Then I ran out of my script before a holiday weekend and ended up in the hospital because by day two I already felt the withdrawal symptoms coming on and didn t want to go through that again. After that weekend I went back to the doctor and got my script. I ve been thinking about this long and hard and I don t want to be on Benzodiazepines at all anymore, they are way to dangerous in my opinion. So here s my question (2 actually)....1) what kind of taper off Xanax plan works the best without any of the withdrawal symptoms and 2) what medications could I be taking alternatively to help with my moderate anxiety, maybe one that can even address my mild to severe depression episodes (which I ve been dealing with both anxiety and depression since puberty).

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. There are certain other medication available to take care of your withdrawal symptoms. As methadone remains in your body for 10-14 days during this time medication like clonidine, antispasmodics, non opioid pain killers can take care of your withdrawal symptoms. For your neuropathic pain several anti epileptics or SNRI can be tried. SNRI will take care of your anxiety, panic attacks as well as pain. Discuss with your practitioner about the same.

I am now 69 and I feel that I fit the description but I had myself tested and she said I did not have it...neurologist. My daughter is always agitated by me and sending me unkind misrepresentations of why I do things that she does not like. I doubt she is on meds now but Adderal helped she and her brother and X so much that my son graduated from Harvard business and my daughter owns her own house, has a wonderful husband and the most incredible calm daughter. She is in daycare all day across from their workplace. I have been diagnosed GAD and my meds are fine but I have ataxia. I tried Ritalin years ago and wrote a paper that was 20 pages long and got an A on it which was unusual for this professor and she said it was the most confusing paper she has ever read. As you can see, I just go on and on and share to many details by voice. I just want to be less anxious so I do mindfulness medication and DBT which I feel really saved me from depression and isolation I was feeling. Now I see everything in a good lite, even my daughter. I m just trying to help her share her feelings instead of texting me with BIG LETTERS in a text and saying things about my emails and texts that are total misrepresentations. She has a good sense of humor and I do too but we are just triggered all the time. I don t want to tell her she needs meds but I have told her that I do not want large letters and drama like this. She is really smart and usually has clear thinking. I think she is overwhelmed and just needs meds. She is an amazing mother but she treats her husband like me, at least when I visit with them....they are long distance. Usually see her once a year. I have taken the course of not responding to her anger and just reinforce kind communication and by trying to listen to her better. Okay..that s it. My question? How do I let her know lovingly that she might want to consider Adderal again. Oh, she has a picking disorder. She picks her face and said she likes the pain. Sounds like BPD. In college (she s 34) she used to pick her leg till it bled and told me she wanted me to tell her to stop. My x abused me once physically which she saw and I took her to a friend s. I also called 911 twice for verbal and violent behavior to a lamp. Last summer she said her father had a terrific temper but I didn t ask why she said it...I just asked her if she could imagine living 26 years with that. I want to listen better.

I have Anxiety and has been treated with Alplazolan since 1990 which really keeps my ansiety under control. I went to a new Doctors since I moved from Miami to Asheville with my 100 Permanently disable husband. A few days ago I saw my doctor which is the same doctor taking care of my husband under a Pain Management Contyract. All of a sudden he told me he has to put me in a withdraw program to take meout of Alprazolan because they discovered that Alprazolan has a link with Alzheimer. He gave me Trazodone 50 mg as a replacement. I do research and under this new medicine one of th side effects is if I have in my family a history of heart attacks. YES On my father side 2 male die of it. On my mother side my granfather died of a heart attack and My son I guess if he dosent take care of himself is a candidate for a heart attack since his father and grand father ( his father ) both had massive heart attacks. If males in my family are having hearts attacks of course I must live a llife of good weight and accordingly even if I am a female and this applies only to males. Also another medicine that I was given for my knees pain I needed to tell my doctor that YES I have a rough line of suicides in my family. It is on both side. My grandmother hot herself when I was 15, my father cousing shot himself, my brothr after getting a live transplant in Mayo Clinic lost his business and hung himself from the thir floor of his business office. In that same year my mothers sister son shot his head because they choke with stress and blew his head leaving 3 girls and 1 boy. I do not drink. I do not smoke. I do not take chemical drugs prescribed by anyone. I only take my Alprazolan when I have too much anxiety because I have a flool plate with my husband degenerative bone decease. It is tough but I am a tough woman. I am aware of the inheritance of genes a lot. My granfather came out of John Hopkins but the dysfuctionally was horrible. I solve dysfunctionally because I was not going to be another incident in my family and took a plane and got away from all of them. I reached all my goals. Had a majjor important job for 25 years, I bank with the same bank for 25 years and I have been a volutary teacher for the USFedCourt Southern District since after separating from my job I became an OSHA Outreach Construction/ Roadwork and Maritime. I have an excellent amount of letter for being highly organized, etc. I goy married three years ago and I am happy here with my Vet husband helping him because they were really prescribing him things that did not apply and I took/recommended him to leave the VA and go private. This is how we both have the same Primary Physician. I have no intention of discontinuin the use of my Alprazolan regardless of the consequences. But using unfounded info that I can proove like a letter from a medical investigation last year that was not able to link between Alprazolan with Alzheiner is luducres since that study was done, it was never implemented. I was told by a friend of mine who is a Dr but I cannot bring him into the situation. He told me that they are doing this because my husband is under strong medication, his situation is serious but why this now.

I never really faced problems like this in high school because the classes I was taking, were in my opinion, very easy and I was able to manage without studying or doing homework outside of school. That has really changed in college because of the need to plan your own studying and because of the increase in difficulty and load of information given in each class. Now that I am taking adderall (i take 30mg in the morning rather than 2, 15mg throughout the day, found it works much better for me), it helps so much with reading, writing, and forgetting about small distractions going in class, it even helps with some social anxiety that i face. However I m still not 100% sure that I have adhd. When doing research, i found myself having a lot of similar symptoms to inattentive adhd. Some examples are difficulty with eye contact, constant doodling in class, moving from one uncompleted activity to another, fidgeting when seated (moving leg up and down, or repositioning myself in chair), having to reread passages many times, careless mistakes (such as forgetting to write a letter in a word), being forgetful about daily activities, and being easily distracted by things like trivial noises or events that are usually ignored by others. I also procrastinate a harmful amount. Nonetheless, I saw many symptoms that I don t face or am the complete opposite of. For example, I am very detail oriented, I don t talk much in class, I don t start conversations at inappropriate times. Furthermore, I once took ritalin (20mg, wansnt prescribed) as well, which made me talk a lot, would that effect mean i have Adhd and would the success of adderall also mean i have adhd? I was hoping that you could let me know if you truly think i have Adhd and if not, what else could be the cause of this? Mostly, i have doubts because I didnt notice this until I was 18. Thank You! Jose","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. According to the information provided by you, it might mostly be a normal variant. ADHD is a long way to go yet. Change of a routine life (like school to college ) initially created enormous pressure to almost all students which some can handle and some not. You are for sure among the one who is are not able to cope up. This definitely goes on in due course of time...and one more concern of you being they Adderall is making a difference in you...definitely Adderall makes difference in almost every one who takes it. I mean just for example: even if a person not having any physical body pains, when taken paracetamol tablet feels better because it reduces the pain which is minimally present (which is not effecting the person) but still person feels better and above all, your symptoms are not devastating, so that u can give a trail with off the medications. Go for a morning walk daily, exercise for 2 to 3 days per week, spend time with your friends, spend significant time in Library, listen to music. watch movies, try to go through the lessons before attending the class and cross check whether you remember everything you have studied which improves your concentration in class...and do try for combined studies with like minded friends.

My fiancé has a very different thinking than most of the women I met in my life before. I noticed this different view/thinking of her after we got engaged. I will start by saying that she is 26 years old and she grew up in an environment in which she never had a father figure. She grew up with only her mother and sister. When she was a teenage she never wanted to stay home and she always had fights with her mother because she wanted to go out with friends and live her life. She had this attitude for many years but calmed down a little bit after she attended college a few years ago. She also told me one that she watched porn since she was 8 years old and that when she was 3 years old, her female cousin kissed her. First of all, she suffers from a little of anxiety, little bipolarity and major depression. She mentioned that she aborted 3 times years ago before we met each other. She said that after she had her first 2 abortions she never felt anything emotionally, but the last abortion she had affected her so much and she sometimes feel very depressed. She still don’t know why this third abortion affected her so much. Second, she said that if we have children, she will never let me give my child my last name. She believes she should only give her last name to the child and she will only allow me to see the child from time to time. Also, she confessed me that when she was 16 years old, she always had the idea of heaving her child alone and to “disappear” the father. I asked her what she meant by disappear, and I received no answer from her. The only thing she said was that she still has that idea. I feel cold and in shock when she told me that. Third, she said that when she reach the age of 50, she will live alone by herself because she will want to take care only of herself when she gets old. Also, she said that from time to time she wants to be alone and don’t have any relationship with no one. She also doesn’t like to communicate too much. She said her life is about being alone without no one to interfere in the things she wants to do. One of the important things she said , was that she never knew what love is, and that she is not interested to know what love is about because she doesn’t care. She can be very impulsive. Before she had broken up with me 3 times. But, after every breakup, a few days later we end up being together again. I tried and give my best in understanding her way of thinking but I believe something is wrong with her mind. She doesn’t take any medications for her depression. In addition, she suffers from high blood pressure and involuntary movements of her legs or other extremities. I will like to help her, but I don’t know how.

I go to a new Dr. tomorrow in Round Rock because I had to change insurance this year and Lonestar Circle of Care will take new insurance. Thank you, Martha","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As per your concern regarding comparison of Lexapro, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Celexa. All the drugs almost have similar efficacy in their mechanism of action but there are differences in preference in patient point of view like. Lexapro is generally preferred when there are other issues like hypertension, Diabetes etc as this has minimal interactions with other drugs. Prozac is mostly preferred​ in adolescent depression as it is highly alerting drug among all, initial anxiety might be a concern with Prozac. Wellbutrin is little less efficacious than other drugs but it mainly increases the pleasure and has additional properties that it can be added to other drugs as augmenting agent, so of you are not feeling better with any other single drug, Wellbutrin can be added(under supervision of your Psychiatrist). Tablet Celexa is not preferable generally​ as it has effects related to cardiac system. And regarding fatigue person suffering from severe depression and/or depression generally has dull mood, lack of energy which makes a person feel easily fatigue. And additionally​ has low appetite and digestion capacity, absorption capacity, utilization of absorbed materials will also be very low which ultimately causes fatigue. So, adequate treatment of underlying conditions like depression, anxiety might make you reduce your fatigue. Hope I have answered your query.

He takes a combination of tablets including lithium and drinks 11 cans of Carling every night. He doesn’t particularly eat until the evening and drinks water up until he starts his nightly routine of drinking. He previously had blood tests to check his liver every 3 months but due to changing doctors who won’t do home visits because he’s “not elderly” despite the fact he’s not left the house in 3 years means these have not been done regularly. He’s had his first one in two years recently and his Gamma GT reading was 160. As it was a councillor who found this reading, she was unsure what it meant and he’s getting a bit frantic about it. He has also recently had a change in tablets for his mental health problems and is also suffering with a bad chest and heart palpitations. Please could you shed a bit of light around the GGT reading and what it means? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Gamma glutamyl transferase is an enzyme found in the body and is in high concentrations in the liver. Levels of GGT have to be corroborated with other investigations to give you an opinion.

I am extremely impressed with how well this supplement has worked for me. My husband and I are however interested in starting a family and hoping to start trying to conceive. I m very nervous about stopping the use of the supplement because it s worked so well for me. There s research on taking SRI s during pregnancy but I haven t been able to find any about 5 htp, probably just due to the fact that it s a less popular drug. I was under the impression that 5-htp would be better for you because for one it s an over the counter drug and doesn t even require a prescription, It is a supplement that gives your body what you need to create your own serotonin, it s natural etc. For SRI s the research and articles I m reading are saying that it s low risk for birth defects and overall fine to take during pregnancy, but there isn t the same research for 5 htp. Why would 5 htp be better for a non-pregnant person in terms of health, with everyone suggesting it s better than taking SRI s but for pregnant women, they would suggest taking SRI s instead? I m not understanding this. Why would SRI s be better for pregnant women than 5 htp, which is just a supplement with its conversion being an amino acid that s found in food?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Low levels of serotonin lead to depression and anxiety. 5-Htp is a precursor of serotonin and taking that helps in increasing the levels of serotonin. SSRIs are also medication which increase serotonin levels. No drug is said to be absolutely safe in pregnancy. It all depends upon the risk benefit ratio. Consult with a specialist so that you can be assessed and treated accordingly. Hope I have answered your query.

As you mentioned that you will stop paying attention to absolutely everything around you when you are occupied it means that you are able to fully concentrate on the work that you are doing. I think it's a very good sign that you are able to concentrate on the hope that you are doing so that results will be definitely better as per your concentration levels. And it's always tries to focus on a single task each time then to dilute your focus on multiple tasks. Unable to do more than one thing at the moment is really not a disease. If you are not able to focus on even one task then that should be evaluated further. As you are not suffering from a particular disease there is no need of any medications or investigations. Going for a morning walk daily, exercising for 2 to 3 days in a week, listening to music, spending time with your friends and family members definitely improve your concentration further.

I think my last psychosis was self-induced, I started believing in gods and belief that we are inside a computer not a bad hypothesis but got out of control.. I never took anything illegal. I was taken to hospital by family because i wasn t eating. I just didn t like their food and they didn t allow me to leave the house!","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I need a small clarification, whether you are on 300 mg of Aripiprazole or 30 MG of Aripiprazole. 300 mg of Aripiprazole is too much heavy dose that might be even toxic to the body, and even if it is 30 MG it might cause lot of side effects at higher doses. It is better you take low dose of Aripiprazole and add-on with low dose of antidepressant that is SSRI, under supervision of a psychiatrist which gives you motivation to work and be in happy mode. Consulting a psychiatrist, but before that you can go for a walk in the morning daily and exercise for 2 to 3 days per week, this will gives you little relaxation and you will feel enthusiastic and motivated to do work. As you have mentioned that you are not suffering from severe psychosis or schizophrenia so low doses of antipsychotics and low dose of antidepressants are preferable. Also focus on your diet which will makes you feel better, try to take foods rich in Omega 3 fatty acids. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Your daughter is taking of Lorazepam which is too much toxic dose, general Lorazepam should be taken at dose.

Vomiting can be prevented by taking anti emetics before breakfast, preferably the mouth-dissolving form. Accompanying your child to school for a couple of weeks might help relieve his anxiety. Requesting the teachers to take special care of your child, not to punish him. Asking the teachers to give him small tasks and rewarding his performance. Inviting his school friends over, in the evening time and spend some time with them helps him with relief from anxiety partially.

On a long term course for both anxiety and depression, same medications work so there is no hurry in deciding whether you are suffering from anxiety or depression. As you have said you are feeling better, maintenance dose (low dose) can be taken of antidepressants. Seroquel at low dose helps get relief from anxiety and makes you fall asleep. There is no compulsion in using tablet Seroquel if you are not comfortable with it. I am sorry, I'm not sure about the composition of tablet Klonopin 0.5mg.

Alprazolam or any other sedative can at times cause impulsivity, disinhibition and so on. Check whether there is a real need for Alprazolam.

I received many different medications over time, now I m on cibralex and Lamictal. Although I suffered alot from the mood swings and anxiety attacks, That s not my biggest problem, and both are already soothed down by medications . my problem/curse is; I have recurrent recalls, of negative memories, usually related to humiliation or embarrassement, associated with an intense anger/anxiety, that lead me to a sudden partially uncontrolled physical movement, like shouting, sudden jerk, teeth grinding, face muscle spasm (making faces). Let me give you an example, I m setting at work, having nonspecific thoughts running in the background of my brain (which is the case all the time) and then one of the thought remind me of a minor embarrassing incident that happened last month or 20 years ago (without exaggeration). I find a huge impulse of anger that will be automatically followed by a sudden physical activity, blowing, head movement...etc. And then it settles down in a matter of few seconds, leaving behind only shame and self pity. It happens like if I was electrically stunned. 70% this will happen to a relatively recent incident, within the last two years but 30% are related to old, or very old, very minor incidents. Sometimes, it can happen to an imagined situation!!. This lovely experience strike me at the very least 20 times a day, ranging from mild grimzing to full body jerk, depending on situation (home or work) and intensity of the impulse. During stressful periods, the frequency may increase to hundreds of times. High dose SSRI, lithium, Topamax, lamotrigine, combined didn t make a noticeable difference. My MRI showed asymmetrical third ventricles, but nothing else. My encephalogram was normal. One of my psychiatrists, although refused to say it directly, prescribed me three different antipsychotics!!. The other refused and insisted only on SSRI and lamotrigine. I didn t accept to take antipsychotics as I don t have any illusions or delusions. Just the forementioned problem. As well as for fear of the side effects.

Its not advisable to take this drug for long periods of time without supervision of a doctor. Development of tolerance of the drug is common side effect. If the drug is not working like it used to work in past then that is due to tolerance. If the anxiety is persisting then please talk to a psychiatrist for help. Addition of SSRI drugs like Paroxetine can be kept in options. The drug will help in making sleep better too and will help in anxiety.

I have been in a committed relationship for 2 years now and when my girlfriend and I engage in sex, I have only been able to cum twice. Is there anyway I can make myself ejaculate more during sex? I've tried different condoms and that doesn't work at all. I'm considering trying something new which brings me to my second question. 2) I want to try anal sex to see if I can cum. I always use condoms and me and my partner are STD free. My concern is will it be safe? My main concern is cleaning my penis afterwards. Do I have to do that immediately or can I do it within the hour? Can I use a wash rag with soap and water and then shower down there within the hour?","Doctor":"Hello, Sex is supposed to enjoyed with love and passion. If you do sex more than once at a given time, your body gets tired and you will not be able to enjoy the actual pleasure of sex. Therefore do not have ejaculation more than once at a given time.

I have noticed that for several years I have an excessive amount of energy and need to go out and do something when I wake up, but as the day continues, I lose total motivation. If I don’t do something right in that moment of energy, I will most likely end up doing nothing. I don’t know if this is related to my anxiety and depression (although I am not full on depressed, I am just as frequently hyped up as I am depressed) or something else. I have never been tested for any kind of attention disorder but I am wondering if this is possible. I also procrastinate on tasks, such as schoolwork, until the very last minute and get distracted easily from it. Other times I get really focused (usually because I am at the end of a deadline).

Sorry for my English, it is not my native language. Most of the time, I have normal sexual fantasies about having sex with persons from the opposite sex. Consider the fact that I am a liberal, I am not homophobic nor do I judge anyone, in fact I have many gay friends. But, I have a problem which consumes my mental health and well being. There are situations when I get in one apparent mood of mine, which I call, The sick state of mind . I am going to write all things which I consider relevant. When I was 11 years old, I was playing with my 14 years old cousin at his home. Sometimes, he used to make me watch porn with him and masturbate together, which I found very unpleasing at that time (I still find that unpleasing). Sometimes, he made me handjob him and if I refused, he blackmailed me. The time passed, but I always felt sick, when I remembered those times with my cousin. I don t know if this has anything to do with my apparent problem, but I think it is a relevant thing to be mentioned. When I was 14, there were bullies in my hood who verbally bullied me and some of them, from no apparent reason, called me gay. I have OCD and depressive episodes, so that made me overthing their words, even when my other friends didn t think I am feminine (I really am not feminine) and I had a few girlfriends who turned me on and whith who, I had great sex. But after some overthinking, there always was a depressive episode which triggered the sick mood . In this sick state of mind , I had some unwanted paraphiliac sexual fantasies which included fantasising how I have sex with my mother, my grandmother and other Forbidden stuff like masturbating in bus, in front of other people. After masturbating on those fantasies, I felt guilty and sick. There is something strange about these fantasies. They always come with the sick mood, they are not like my ordinary sexual fantasies, and they trigger instant orgasm even when I don t touch mu penis, I feel blood on my cheeks, genitals and all the body. I am hyperaroused and I feel really bad about myself. Once (when I was 17 years old), I was with my friends at a bar. There was a guy, my age, who had really pretty face. I started overthinking that I might like him (the fear that I am a gay), and the sick mood came again, I felt the blood on my chicks and my genitalia, felt hyperaroused and I got orgasm just by watching his face. After that, the depression came again. When I told myself that I don t care even if I am gay or bisexual, strangely, there was never a sick thought of being homosexual or arousal by any male (this was only one incident and never happened again). I am honest with my self, I even have watched gay videos, but no attraction, whatsoever. I must say that whenever I am in this paraphiliac mood I feel like a freak and monster. After a while, when I was 20 years old, I went to my barber, and his son shaved my beard since the barber was busy. The boy was like 12 years old. He looked like one girl I really liked so I started overthinking that I might start to get attracted to him and that I am a paedophile. Guess what... Overthinking - paraphiliac state of mind - instant orgasm just by watching that face. That seriously scared the hell out of me. I ve never had sexual fantasies towards children. I ve never masturbated fantasizing about children (I still haven t) and I don t find kids attractive. I started to drink SSRI (my psychiatrist told me to do it since he knows about my depression and obsessions) for my OCD, depression and low self esteem. I ve read a lot of studies about paraphiliacs including paedophiliacs, some of them indicate that paedophilia correlates with low IQ and other mental problems. That make me feel even worse, since I consider my self well educated (I am a pharmacist and a machine engineer) and I have pretty high IQ, but my self esteem gets low and I hate living with this burden on my back. Consider that except that incident with the kid and the things mentioned up, 99.99% of my time, I am not in this mood, I have friends, high self esteem, good job, girlfriends and a cool life. I don t feel any desire for masturbating in bus in front of people, having sex with children, grandmothers, my mother etc... But sometimes, when this paraphiliac mood kicks in, it comes with all these thoughts, depression, low self esteem and it always makes me feel like a retarded freak, I feel like I am in some strange psychodelic sick state of mind, hyperaroused and there is a lot of blood running to my face and genitalia with fast heart rate. Sorry for my long letter, I hope you read it and help me find some solution for this problem, or give me some advice. Thanks in advance: Harry","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

Since I was a child I have always done poorly in school except for the class that I was very interested in. I always had trouble focusing even when I would tell myself over and over to focus and retain the information. I have always had symptoms of ocd where I feel the need to touch things a certain amount of times, move things in specific positions, and many other little quirks. I always feel if I don t do these things then something bad will happen. I will have to walk sometimes around an object in a certain direction etc. I daydream aimlessly most of the time and if I have multiple things that I need to take care of I usually cannot prioritize and focus, so I usually get stressed and shut down basically and don t even do the things I needed to. I will put my priorities off until I feel like I have a clearer game plan or I can do things perfectly. My brain feels like its in a cloud most of the time. I can sit in my office and stare out the window or get up and walk around or basically anything else to distract me from the things which I need to do. Not necessarily just procrastination, but more just in a jumbled fog. I have never really though to much about any of this other than I m just a daydreamer. My coworker has ADD and has recently told me that I defiantly have it. So now I m wondering if this is the reason I have always felt this way, or am I just trying to label something that doesn t really need a label.

I m having sex with my partner and I m not lasting longer. It was like 1-2mins. every sex the longer that I can. And still my partner is not satisfied. I don t know what s wrong. Is this kind of health problem? What treatment that I need to do? Please reply ASAP. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, With regard to your question, the answer is that there is nothing wrong with you. If you last 1-2 minutes during penetrating sex then this is OK. There is no receipt on how long a male penetrating act has to last and this is hugely variable from a few seconds to many many minutes. It is true that today the pressure to \\"perform as long as possible\\" during penetrating sex is an obsession for men but this does not mean that this should be the norm. The norm is what nature has designated for each of us. We are often misled by sexual materials we are bombarded with on TV and internet but most time those videos are distorting the reality and many performers take pills or various substances in order to make penetrating sex last longer. Therefore, no man has to feel guilty if he can not last \\"as long as it should\\" during penetrating sex. I think that the more you engage with your partner, the longer your penetrating sex will last meaning that very likely you will last longer than 1-2 minutes. Also, you have to manage stress more efficiently, if it is possible. If you are not circumcised than this could be another factor shortening your penetrating sex period because it is believed that uncircumcised men have a more sensitive penis head. I think that you do not need to do anything, nor seeing a doctor or turning to certain substances in order to increase your penetrating sex time. If you have solid erections, if you have no problems in having erections, if you manage to perform penetrating sex with your partner, then everything is fine and normal.

It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time. Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation. Hope I have answered your query.

These include: Physical problems, such as injury to nerves or loss of blood supply to the penis. Other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression. Side effects of certain medicines. Stress. Drinking too much alcohol or smoking. The exam, lab tests, and sometimes mental health tests can help find out the cause of the problem. Treatment is based on cause and include avoiding tobacco and drugs and limiting alcohol. Also, talking about the issue with your partner, doing sensual exercises, and getting counseling may be beneficial. Finding and then stopping medicines that may be causing the problem. In some cases you can take a different medicine that doesn't cause erection problems. Taking prescription medicine that can help you get erections.

It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. In many cases premature ejaculation gets better on its own over time. Treatment may not be needed. Practicing relaxation techniques or using distraction methods may help you delay ejaculation. For some men, stopping or cutting down on the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs may improve how well they can control ejaculation. Hope I have answered your query.

Medication ought to be used continuously for 1-2 years, if it's 1st episode. Schizophrenia, is a chronic disease where patient's compliance is poor regarding continuous use of medications as they won't feel that they are suffering from a disease.

These disorders began when he was in his early teens. He always takes his medication. There are times when he does a lot, helps out a lot and times when he says he just can t. One of my brothers thinks he is lazy and that he should force himself esp when he hangs around all day smoking a cigar. He doesn t bathe often. How do I make him understand that he just can t do certain things at certain times? Thanks","Doctor":"hi MadamI have gone through your question and understand your concerns regarding your brother.As per the history provided by you, your brother is suffering from a disease which needs somuch of personal care.Schizophrenia is a chronic disease where medications should be used regularly. Mostly, this disease can't be cured completely.With medication, we only suppress the symptoms of the disease similar to diabetes or hypertension. So, when medication stopped suddenly or taken itregularly, disease revert back. So, my advise is to take medication regularly and in prescribed form as advised by the psychiatist.Regarding course of illness in schizophrenia, we commonly talk about  drift hypothesis. In schizophrenic patients, they gradually deteriorate in all fields involving social, emotional, occupational functioning. so, gradually they don't study, don't participate in family interactions, lack judgemental capacity, stop going to job, soon...so, my final advise: 1)never discontinue medications.2)gather information and understand disease process in schizophrenia3) please understand that he's not pretending4) always be emphatic and caring towards schizophrenic patients in any time and in any situation.5)be ready to accept the truth that he will have problems with judgemental capacity, contact with reality and insights regarding his disease."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Eat a healthy diet, stay away from caffeine, alcohol, spices, pickles, drink green tea, take apple, banana, dates, practice relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, and Pranayam 3.

Social anxiety disorder is a chronic mental health condition in which social interactions cause irrational anxiety. For people with social anxiety disorder, everyday social interactions cause irrational anxiety, fear, self-consciousness and embarrassment. Symptoms may include excessive fear of situations in which one may be judged, worry about embarrassment or humiliation or concern about offending someone. Talk therapy or psychotherapy and antidepressants can help increase confidence and improve ability to interact with others. I suggest online psychotherapy and counseling.

The most frustrating part about it is sometimes I will lose something almost as soon as I pick it up. For example, not once, but twice now (both this year - several months apart) I have come home in the morning and then shortIy after went to leave again and couldn’t find my keys and had absolutely no memory of what I may have done with them. I couldn’t even remember taking them out of the ignition. In both cases, I left my car door unlocked (which is extremely odd because I NEVER do that) and neither set of keys were ever seen again. I’ve even gone as far as to remove the entire seats frOm my car to look for them. I also used magnets in hard to reach areas where metal parts didn’t prevent me from doing so. One last brief example is what happened just before I decided to come in here and ask for something me insight and is a perfect example of the kinds of things that happen nearly every day! I picked up the saw and the multimeter to move out of the backyard and into the garage. Just a few steps into the garage, I put the saw on the work bench. Then, I walked the last couple of Steps over to where I needed to use the mutimeter, sat down, and realized it was gone! I remember picking it up. I remember settling the saw down. But, I have absolutely no memory of doing anything else with the multimeter after I picked it up! I still can’t find it! I literally only walked a few steps in total so there’s only so many places it could be. It’s not even like the garage is that messy! When I do find the multimeter, I’m hoping to psychoanalyze the heck out of the reason why I set it where I set it so that maybe it will give me some clues as to where my keys my be lol.

I am suffering from extreme anxiety and I want to live a normal life! I can t describe it, I ve never had a scare like this before. I think every strange thing is going on with my body is related to pregnancy! I think it s because I don t have enough sex information and don t know how pregnancy actually happen, so whenever I get negative search result from Google, I start to think bad thoughts , it will increase my anxiety and I feel panic again. you know, I am living in a culture where sex before marriage is frowned upon. I know nobody can diagnose whether I am pregnant over the internet but I just need to know how likely it could be that I might or might not be pregnant. So I would be very grateful if you could help me and let me know how I can be 100% sure if I am not pregnant. I will briefly mention to the points I guess you need to know. my 3 last period was on August 31. we had an unprotected foreplaying (No sex) , he ejaculated so we re afraid if my labia touched his sperm or not. I should mention that I am still virgin and had no sex before. I also took a shower immediately and used Plan B after 2-3 hours. as I was so stressful and afraid that the stress delays my period, I started to drink Saffron tea and Cinnamon tea, two weeks before my next period and I only drank 1 or maybe 2 cups a day. because I d heard these can make the period come. I got my period on time on October 1st with a normal flow as the same as before. I did the home pregnancy test a week after my period finished and It was negative. I started to drink those teas again 2 weeks before my next period. I m afraid if these teas can cause a fake period!! I got my period on November 1st. I feel the blood was changed to dark-color on 4-6th day of my period. I also should mention that I had a white or grayish jelly-like vaginal discharge with itching which was increased right after my period ended. I did hpt again on November 14 and it was negative. even it seems I have pretty much zero chance of being pregnant but I am still anxious. google search results said some women confuse the irregular bleeding during pregnancy for their period and the irregular bleeding can come even right around the time you are expecting for your normal period. or the other point was that some women had even 6 negative blood test before the finally had a positive cause some women do not carry enough hormones to detect till later. so I can not trust even on blood test!!! could you please let me know what I need to do right now and how I can be sure if I am not pregnant, before I miss the time for abortion!!! I I get my next period on time, can I still be pregnant after 3 normal and on time period?!!! I m looking forward your answer.Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello there I have read through your question and would like to tell you that you are not pregnant. Firstly you didn't have an intercourse and that itself makes it unlikely for you to be pregnant. Secondly you had a plan B and got your periods after that which completely erases all the chances of you being pregnant. You already had three cycles after that and irregular bleeding during pregnancy does not involve Frank bleeding. I would advise you to relax and stop stressing about this as you are not pregnant.

It started 2 years ago with a gradual onset of non-specific right side testicular pain. I received a physical exam and was told nothing was wrong. The pain persisted on and off for months until finally it was so bad I went to the ER and received an ultrasound. The doctor informed me I had an epididymal cyst which becomes inflames at times and could cause pain and told me to take Motrin. Well, since then it has gotten overall better with random bouts here and there, the medication seems to make no difference at all. I've visited another doctor and a urologist who have both told me extreme pain isn't common for the diagnosis. The other day I woke up with extreme extreme pain in my right testicle. It seemed to change upon moving positions but for the most part felt like someone was squeezing my spermatic cord every 15 or so seconds, very bad pain. I managed to sleep it off and felt fine the next day. Then today out of nowhere it began again in the middle of the day and got much worse. I have noticed no swelling or change physically when looking at my testicles. I was wondering if partial torsion is a possibility. Tonight I was in such pain I was debating going to the ER but talked myself down from it. I don't believe it to be epididymal pain as the pain is much higher up in the spermatic cord near the groin and I can emulate the pain by rubbing the cord high up much further than the epididymas. The pain is very intense, but from what I read not torsion intense as I can walk and am not on the floor crying or vomiting as I have heard is usually the case. I have no pain urinating and have had no pain ejaculating. Is it possible to have partial torsion that can come and go?

In the last year four family member passed away including my mother grandparents and uncle. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder but I think I have PTSD also as my mother died with her eyes open and me holding her hand. The reason I think I have PTSD is what triggered this episode was me picking up an earn that was made for my mothers ashes in preparation for her memorial service. Needless to say I'm suffering from all the related symptoms of both depression and ptsd . A month earlier I went to the doctor and was prescribed Zoloft but the effects were debilitating wrenching stomach pain and diarrhea I lost 12 pounds in  a month. I slowly reduced the dosage in preparation of a change in medication to Prozac and before I could change medication I began to have suicidal thoughts which led me to seek help. Now out of the hospital and with a little time to reflect on the situation I'm taking the new medication which is making me confused ,sleepy and full of anxiety. I was prescribed Xanax for anxiety and only take it sparingly when I begin to have chest pain ,stomach pain and sometimes shortness of breath. I have called the hospital and have been accepted into there outpatient program which consists of 3 hrs of therapy twice a week for five weeks which starts this next Monday. I'm hoping that with therapy some of these issues can be solved. Any advice would be greatly appreciated .  Thank you , Matt","Doctor":"Dear userWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Please understand, the given symptoms are common to anxiety and you dont have to worry about those.

I literally tried choking my brother twice, before realizing what I was doing(which is why I am now more careful around him). I have always had violent urges, and the older I get, the more aggressive, hostile, and violent I become, and the harder I have to work to hold back my urges. I also have weird urges to inflict pain on myself too, such as the urges to pull out my eyeballs, rip out my nails, rip it my hair, pull out my teeth, stab my eyes with something sharp, stab myself in the stomach, cut my eye lids, cut my cheeks, and much more. Both my violent fantasies, and my fantasies of inflicting pain on myself can be sexual at times, but usually are not. I am also noticing that my empathy levels have dropped, and that I have been way less social than I usually am. I find that I go through episodes of either feeling no emotions and desires to do anything, or I feel depressed/ angry. I also like seeing people in pain, but I have always been that way for some reason. I also have a fear of people, especially the government and strangers, listening to my thoughts and stalking me. There have been many times when I avoid doing or thinking of certain things to keep them from laughing at me, or from using that information to black mail me. I am also scared of there being a lunatic under my bed, ready to grab me, and of people in general trying to kill, stalk, or hurt me. I am a pretty paranoid person.

Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a racing heart and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others.  While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety medicines alone cannot cure anxiety disorders mainly because medicines do not alter behavior. Behavior change and Continuous practice of the changed behavior cure anxiety. I suggest anxiety education, progressive counseling and progressive psychotherapy. I assure you complete cure.

He lost his father and went through a horrific divorce while having issues at work with his manager and started with panic attacks which he was hospitalized for around 4 years ago. He is a retired veteran with 20 plus years serving in the Air Force. He only has Tricare insurance and has been unable to get into alcohol rehab. He has never been to rehab to date. Now he is on Claritin 10 mg qd for allergies, Propranolol ER 60 mg qd for HTN and Venlofaxine ER (Effexor SR) 150 mg and 75 mg each qd for major depression despite drinking vodka heavily. I observed him today and he was coherent and interacting appropriately without slurring of words. He stepped into another room to retrieve some paperwork for possible alcohol rehab and returned and I observed him rapidly decompensate in front of me within 10 minutes to the point he was unable to converse and became incoherent staggering and tearful and fearful loosing all rationality and on the verge of paranoia. Unable to be reasoned with and verbally hostile and blaming me his best friend for messing up his life. I suspected he gulped some vodka because I found empty vodka bottles in the room where he retrieved the papers from. I have never seen anyone go from sanity to beyond intoxicated that quickly. Could the Effexor be contributing to the potentiated effect? His PCP was informed of his alcohol consumption on more than one occasion by his son and told my friend s son who accompanied him to his PCP visits. The Nurse Practitioner (NP) said that the patient s alcohol consumption it was not an issue to be concerned about relating to the Effexor and any interactions. the patient was encouraged to decrease his consumption , but I believe the anxiety is worsening therefore he is increasing his self medication (vodka consumption) which is a depressant. The NP also said she had done some sort of special mail out blood test that indicated that Effexor was the proper medication for the patient. I believe this to be hogwash. He is now missing work and risks his livelihood because he has progressively become worse since starting on the Effexor which his PCP continues to increase. Can Effexor exacerbate alcohols depressive effect and increase anxiety and contribute to a near hallucinatory condition to the point he babbles, repeats himself, talks nonsensical and acts like he is going insane? No ability to process information or interact with another person, lashing out at those closest to him? I almost called 911 today, but instead after 2 hour got him called down to wear he fell asleep. I watched him until he awoke nearly an hour later and got up and then laid back down to sleep. I called his son s who one is staying with him and another who looks in on him daily.

Anxiety results in rapid heart rate, palpitations, tightness of shoulders, chocking sensation in throat, tremors etc symptoms.

He is always depressed wanting to hurt people. He believes that he should honor satan and should help him by destroying everything he has. He is always feeling guilty about something and looks for ways to go to jail. He is afraid of success, he is very bright and is a programmer, but he never finishes anything. He likes to program video games and writes beautiful music. My question is. Where can we find a psycho therapist who would be willing to help my son with his thinking disorder. He has been on medication for years and seems to be getting worse. Three days ago he was in real bad shape. He was depressed and wanting to go to jail. I took him out to dinner and driving back home he said, mom please take me to the police station or I ll hurt you right now. I believed him by his expression, so we stopped at the police station. The moment we went in, he grab me by the throat and started yelling, Get a policeman right now or I ll kill my mother. Long story short, he ended up in the hospital where he is right now. Not the first time, but maybe the 100th time. Do not know what else to do. I guess is just one more attempt to find help. I am a Christian, I pray first for guidance, then follow God s lead.

I have attempted to study brain scans of schizophrenics, etc, from sites on the internet but have not found any clear correlations. Perhaps because the brain activity may be different than previously thought and unique and new. For instance, I think that anxiety or panic attacks may be a form of microsleeps where a person goes to sleep instantly, is not aware of this, and then suddenly awakens seconds or microseconds later and is seized by panic attacks or the fear of losing control, as you do when u go into the REM state. Also sleep paralysis is common upon suddenly awakening from the dream state, thus the fear of not having control.Perhaps also related to narcolepsy. As for schizophrenia, I believe it MAY be caused by someone who never completely awakens and stays in what is known as the hypnopompic dream state. During this real scientific state of REM dreaming, a person often hears voices, imagines things that are not real and sees strange people and things. (It has been put forth as a reason why alien abductions almost always occur at night- this what seems like a long period of abduction may really only last minutes in the distorted dream state before awakening. Also a time of sleep paralysis, the feeling that you cannot move. Anyway, I believe that some if not all forms of schizophrenia may be traced to a person who NEVER quite awakens from the dream state, thus the illusions and voices, etc. While in a schizophrenic break, they may actually be sleeping and dreaming at the same time. Impossible, well then explain sleepwalking and talking and doing things like driving your car under influence of certain sleep meds, such as Ambien. Anyway, just food for thought!","Doctor":"HaiChange in sleep pattern is one of the commonest finding for any psychiatric disorder.As of now we cannot conclude that every psychiatric disorder is due to sleep pattern change.But any contribution is welcome in field of Psychiatry... if you could get a guidance from a Psychiatrist and try a systematic research in this areathank you"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with Parkinson Disease.

You can take the drug on SOS basis too apart from your regular prescribed doses. The drug will help you to calm and your anxiety will reduce in events of severe exacerbations. You can discuss with your doctor for that.Thanks and Take care"},{"Patient":"I am 71 years old and have memory problems and get irritated easily. My wife suspects that it is the onset of dementia.

Finally I am doing it. But now due to seperation from my kids, I am feeling very sad, my sadness reflected in my work, making me lag behind other my peers who are far younger than me like 7 to 10 years.I have a very low confidence level. for that, I consulted a psychiatrist, who put me on paroxetine and propranolol. But it wasn t helping me any good except the propranolol. So, I started taking fluoxetine and later escitalopram on my own, which did help me to a certain extent, but that too was inconsistent. I was feeling confident at one point while anxious and helpless with poor confidence at other point. And, the major issue( which has compelled me to write a post here) is that I have become extremely extremely shy of women around! Well, I am an introvert, and have never been so comfortable around females, but that wasn t as serious an issue as this is! It has grown up TREMENDOUSLY! I am extremely timid in front of females, I can t talk looking them in the eyes. If I look, I stare. So I better avoid eye contact. This behavior gives them the impression that I am flirting with them! No matter how good or bad looking the person may be. No matter how old is she from teen to granny. I am terrified by the fact that few of my female teachers above 50 years are in the delusion that I am in love with them! Shit! What s this! It is totally out of my hands. These antidepressants are just making my life miserable in this regard. Otherwise I am fine. Can manage almost anything but not this female thing. I am helpless here. I even tried modafinil for some time. But this also couldn t do any wonders. Mostly my gynophobia peaks in early morning, evening hours. I use to take escitalopram in the night or morning time. Modafinil in the morning or evening. But when I am being helped by escitalopram or modafinil, that time I can confidently face females. But those are very few times. Mostly I am having a disadvantage at female interaction. What should I do? I being a doctor, am expected to be free with female colleagues like my all other male friends are, except me.

Anxiety is not a mental disease. that is why it is usually called a disorder.

To cure anxiety disorder, along with medicines, you need to alter your cognition, change the life style, learn relaxation, undergo psychotherapy and over and above impart dietary restrictions.

You will be taking this drug till you are completely cured of anxiety and depression. This could take months.

A lot of patients with mild mitral valve prolapse show symptoms of anxiety. Tachycardia usually triggers the attacks and thus results in onset of severe restlessness and anxiety. This is the probable reason you had acute onset symptoms. Association of stress and onset of panic symptoms is proved. You were under stress and also broke up with your girlfriend and these incidents acted as aggravating factors. So in my opinion treatment of anxiety should treat your symptoms. Before diagnosing Neurovegetative dsytonia other causes like Panic attack and Anxiety disorder should be ruled out.You should get ECG, Echo done to prove the cardiac condition and then can take another opinion from a psychiatrist.

I tried my coming off Citalopram but nightmares came back with a rage. August 2016 Doc prescribed Ritalin again Seroquel at night.

September 2016 he prescribed Trazadone at night but it did not help at all with getting better sleep. By this time I had cut my Xanax at bedtime from 2mg to now 1/2 mg.

He has lost the interest in hobbies, he is getting irritable, sticking in past and his behaviour is changed. He was on Duloxetine which is an antidepressant drug. His symptoms along with lack of motivation, mood swings suggest some mood disturbance or Depressive disorder. If with Duloxetine his symptoms were persisting then this means that he needs fresh evaluation now. Other antidepressants like Venlafaxine or Desvenlafaxine can be tried. These too are SNRI drugs and should help to reduce his depressive symptoms.Talk with him and ask him to visit a psychiatrist again for treatment.Thanks and Take care"},{"Patient":"I m 69 years old.

My (new ) Doctor sent me for a psychological evaluation. It was an outpatient clinic that treats disability patients. My provider was an ARNP. While she peered over her computer screen, she asked a few random questions while she was typing. She told me there were too many health risks for a retired obese person . I m 5 4 and weigh 165. My recent lab work and EKG were perfectly normal, I ve never had a problem with my blood pressure and the only health problem I have is osteoarthritis. She didn t think a stimulant would be good for me. I ve been on adderall for 14 years without problems. My dose was lowered once.

I am a generally healthy 19 year old male with a height of 6 0 and a weight of 145. I have been a cross-country runner for over 5 years, and have remained physically active into my college years. My diet reflects that of typical American teenager; however, it may be slightly healthier considering the fact that the only beverage I drink is water and I generally try to be conscious of my diet (less processed foods, balanced, etc...) I am concerned about my blood pressure. Two years ago I had my blood pressure checked, on multiple occasions, at 142/90. Yesterday I had it checked at 143/88. And today, at my town s clinic I had it checked at 138/88, although I was exceptionally clam today because I am on vacation. This is highly concerning to me because I believe that my blood pressure would be even higher while in classes. In college, I often consume caffeine (about 100mg daily) and occasionally (1X/week) take stronger stimulants such as nicotine, provigil or methylphenidate, although I do not have a diagnosis of ADHD or narcolepsy. I do this to accommodate my work schedule as I am enrolled in a highly demanding elite university. I know that I have a family history of hypertension; however, none of my known family members have had hypertension at such an early age. In fact, I had my blood pressure checked alongside my 71 year old grandfather and his proved to be lower than mine (141/86). I love life and I cherish the experiences that I am able to have as an average American Joe. I am interested in prolonging my life for as long as possible, and I take this threat to my health very seriously. I haven t yet tried drastically lowering my salt intake, and I am reluctant to abate my stimulant usage, however I am certainly willing to to protect my health. I feel as though I already exercise enough, and it is quite difficult for me to permanently lower my cortisol levels. I also take my sleep habits very seriously and nearly always sleep 8-9 hours/day during the same relative time such that I maintain a stable circadian rhythm. This is why I am really at a loss as to what to do. My home clinician didn t seem to take this issue very seriously and he just told me that I shouldn t be worried and that he would check it again in a couple of months; however, I want to be taking actions to lower my blood pressure now! What do you recommend? Is this issue as serious as I am taking it? If so, what steps may I take? Is it inevitable that I will have to be prescribed a medication? Thank-you for your time! I look forward to hearing your valuable opinion.","Doctor":"hi, if your blood pressure is high on successive occasion then u will check your blood pressure three times in week on one day gap in between. if it is higher than normal than u have to first go for serum lipid profile with cortisol level. if it normal than start antihypertensive tablet for some time than measure your blood pressure again if controlled than gradually decrease dose of drug."},{"Patient":"I am 72, in good health, Diabetic under control and recently moved from Nashville to Vancouver., WAI left my four children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren......

He is suffering from depression and anxiety. He is showing rapid mood shifts and one day he remain normal while on the other day he remain depressed and can't finish the tasks.

You were on very high dose of drugs. Mscontin and Lortab both are opioid drugs you were on 300 mg Morphine and Hydrocodone. Xanax is benzodiazepine drug and you were taking 2 mg per day. Abrupt stoppage of these drugs will cause withdrawal symptoms and you have to get ready for that.If you have any access to GP then you can request for prescription of Tremadol which is also an opioid and will reduce the pain and withdrawal symptoms. Other option is to visit methadone clinic. Methadone or Buprenorphine can be used to improve the symptoms and will replace the opioid doses. Withdrawal from Xanax could also cause seizures.

My husband was in the military retired after 20 years with 100% disability. He does function very well physically . He s been retired a little over 10 years and his mental health is concerning me very much. He does go to V.A. for his physical care such as high blood pressure ect. The last few years I have noticed and also at a rapid rate he is no longer the same person as his mood is constantly changing for the worst. W have been married 16 years and I no longer know him or do I know what to expect. He is angry most of the time for no reason I am aware of , at times I see him outdoors standing around just staring as if he s in another world. He makes very bad choices about almost everything also about our finances and to the point of loosing our home. Before he got like this we made our decisions and discussed everything together as husband and wife should with no problem. He has become a habitual liar I m sorry but this is the best way I know how to refer to it. It s as if he doesn t remember so he makes stories up to justify his actions. but he is in denial about having a mental problem and will not tell his doctors! There are times he gets so angry over what reason I don t know I fear he will snap and kill someone or me. He was always in control and didn t get angry was understanding , compassionate , caring , loving and fun to be around. He no longer is sociable , doesn t want to be around me or anyone and no one wants to be around him because of his behavior and or attitude. It s so heart breaking and I have no idea or what I can do to help. I am considering calling his P.C. at V.A. but I am afraid of his reaction if he found out .He was always a controlling man in the past but wasn t a problem with myself .He is 65 years old .

First of all I'd like to tell you that a lot of individuals with chronic illness develop worsening of depressive symptoms. You have CHF and been diagnosed with OCD, PTSD and anxiety in past. Persistent depression could be the reason for your symptoms. But some nutritional deficiencies like vitamin D deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency could also cause similar symptoms so the levels of these vitamins should be checked. Get your Vitamin D and B12 levels done to rule out any deficiency and if these levels come normal then the persistent demotivation, reduced energy, fatigue are due to depression. Modafinil or Armodafinil can be utilised to improve the fatigue and tiredness. If depressive symptoms persist then talk to a psychiatrist for help.

You may call me Gabriel. I was diagnozed with Asperger as a child, and late, when i was around 16, under severe depression, i did a psychological test, and with my psychiatrist and psychologist, they claimed i had either a low level of Autism or F20.03.At the time, i was under Risperidone, and untill last year, i was using Haldol, but that's not really what i want to talk about.I have this friend, who says that she has something quite similar. She says she has 5 friends, 3 of them telling her \\"bad things\\", one of them telling \\"good things\\" and one of them being \\"alright\\".The thing is, today, she told me that one of them, who she named George, made her almost cut her finger off.So, back in 2016, i had a crisis. The thing is, i've been around 5 psychiatrist by now, always taking the history to them, and one of them was certain i was under the ICD.10 F20.3.Back in 2016, i was kinda mixing stuff. I would mix people words, and believe it was someone else who was talking to me, talking through codes and messages, that only i could see, and other stuff. The thing is, the way I DID to fix my problem, i  quit ALL social media, and basically started doing different stuff.About my friend, i don't know what should i do.I don't know i should comment about her friends, tell her to ignore them, or what.She was saying that she was feeling isolated, and i noticed that's a bad sign. She said two of her \\"friends\\" Vanessa and George were there (The ones who tell her to hurt herself) and i started to send her a few songs, and asked her to concentrate on the songs.I don't know what i should do about this.I know that some might say i might need to quit the relationship with her, because it might make my situation go \\"worse\\" as the more stressed i am, the worse i happend to be, but i really can't leave her like this, because if i do, i'll feel really bad about it.Another thing. I did ask a lot of people about her, to confirm if she was real, including people near me, like mom and brother.I just need to be sure i'm not making her treatment worse.And i do wonder myself why she's taking 5mg of haloperidol, and still see this kind of thing.I hope someone can awnser me, and give me a concrete advice.Thanks for your time.Gabriel","Doctor":"hi there, i have read your query in detail. At one point of time you have mentioned that you did ask lot of people if she means your friend is real?

Now if she is real and if she has all problems you have mentioned that she also need to consult a psychiatrist because those persons who are telling to harm her, I am not sure weather they are real or she is having hallucinations.

Other issues that  have developed along side being easily started are memory issues and imbalance.

I can explain you that these nightmares are mainly due to imbalance between REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM (Non Rapid Eye  movement) stages of sleep.In general , these two stages maintain sleep balance for its homeostasis, in your case ie in nightmares, the REM activity will be too much than normal, thus the balance is lost. As this is the phase in which the brain is very active, your heart rate will be more, bacause of all these you are experiencing that kind of restlessness.you can get rid of this problem by following strict sleep hygiene ie keeping a regular wake-sleep schedule is very important,which will help  to prevent the sleep deprivation that can bring on nightmares, engaging in regular exercise, which will help alleviate your nightmare if they are due to anxiety and stress,You may find yoga and meditation are also helpful. Be cautious about use of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine, which can remain in your system for more than 12 hours and often disrupt sleep patterns.Make your bedroom a relaxing place that is reserved for sleep and sex, so that you don't associate it with stressful activities.

I experience extreme lows in regards to my mood and often find myself crying over the least little thing. On the flip side of that coin, so to speak, it seems to take nothing to set off my temper. At the end of the day I cannot seem to be able to rest and sleep, and yet when I am in bed I want nothing more than to stay there. Sleep is a most elusive thing and I find myself tired quite often.

Depression is a syndrome that occurs mainly due to decrease in serotonin level in brain, which is a neurotransmitter. It results in decreased energy, increased fatigability, lack of interest, decrease urge for social interaction. The person finds no pleasure in any activities that he used to enjoy much previously. Sleep may increase/decrease, there is serious lack in self confidence, guilty feeling. Most of the time the person feels hopeless, helpless and worthless. Depression however is curable. There are numerous drugs available that balances the serotonin level. Alongside, therapy with an experienced psychologist always adds to the effect. I'll suggest you to immediately get in contact with a psychiatrist near you. Get well soon."},{"Patient":"Our son died from cancer 3 weeks ago.
