Muscle relaxants can help with your symptoms if used in appropriate dosage in combination with a potent analgesic.You can get the appropriate drugs prescribed from your Orthopedician after examination.Meanwhile you can follow these measures:- If the pain is severe, you need bed rest till the pain resolves. - Get some analgesics prescribed and apply analgesic spray or ointments.- While resting, keep a pillow under your knees if it doesn't bother you.- Avoid lifting heavy objects.-Cervical and Back strengthening exercises and stretching exercises daily as advised by a Physiotherapist.Hope this helps.

I am suspecting tendonitis or carpal tunnel syndrome.  Any solution for this? Would a nerve conduction test or MRI be required to get further diagnosis or is there an alternative?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.You can use wrist splint and corticosteroid injections to relive your symptoms. Wrist splint prevents the wrist from bending, which can place pressure on the median nerveand aggravate your symptoms. Physical therapy in form of ultrasound, stretching, and range-of-motion exercises will be helpful to relieve the symptoms.Hope this helps.

This only happens when I am sleeping on my back, I have tried to sleep with my legs elevated to see if that helps, but is does not seem to make a difference. Is this something I should be concerned about? Or is this just a minor inconvenience I have to deal with?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks  for  your query.The symptoms that you are having are likely to be due to a nerve root compression . You need to get an MRI scan of the area done and consult a neurophysician for proper diagnosis and treatment.Meanwhile you can follow these measures:- If the pain is severe, you need bed rest till the pain resolves. - Get some analgesics prescribed and apply analgesic spray or ointments.- While resting, keep a pillow under your knees if it doesn't bother you.- Avoid lifting heavy objects.- Back strengthening exercises and stretching exercises daily as advised by a Physiotherapist.Hope this helps.

Lately, I have been getting charly horses in the same thigh. What exercises, if any, can be done to relieve this constant tightness, tingling and uncomfortable feeling?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks  for  your query.After going through your suffering, it seems you have developed muscle spasm (cramp).The cramps are caused by hyper excitability of the nerves that stimulate the muscles.  Drugs given for asthma, anginaand Parkinsonism also lead to cramp. A simple way to prevent cramp is-1. Warm up and stretch your thigh muscles before running stretch your thigh muscle before going to field 3-4 times and each time holding for 10-15 seconds. 2. Talk to qualified trainer for proper running form and footwear.3. You may run in a heel-toe pattern and avoid letting the balls of your feet hit the ground first.4. Stay properly hydrated before, during and after you run and eat a balanced diet with adequate minerals, particularly potassium and magnesium. Taking a multivitamin can also helpHope this helps. Let me know if you have any more concern.Warm Regards."},{"Patient":"I did the salt and ice challenge using 4 pieces of ice and I don t know what to do . i know it was stupid. I did it on Sunday and I cant put my arm straight down without my hand getting swollen and on Sunday i felt dizziness, and weakness. I can ttouch or move it and it still feels numb. what should i do?","Doctor":"Here your main question is treatment for swollen and painful arm. Apart from this your explanation is not clear.For swollen and painful arm there could be multiple possibilities. It can be due to nerve injury at affected side or muscle injury or may be over use injury. It may also be related with cervical spine or shoulder problem.Here i need some more clarification on how it was started? As well is this first time you are having this pain along with swelling?So many things are not clear so I suggest visit orthopedic and doctor will do some physical tests he may ask you to go for scaning or x-ray also for some more detail examination. And as per the report if there is nothing major then ortho doctor will suggest for medication and physiotherapy treatment which will definitely help you. But if there is major damage at cervical spine or shoulder or for nerve or muscle then doctor will suggest for surgical correction and later again physiotherapy rehabilitation. At home you can also use cold pack and if it is minor pain and swelling can go away with this too.Follow all above steps and I am sure it will be useful for you.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a an inflammation in both ankles especially the left side which was diagnosed as retrocalcaneal bursitis, i m 45 years old and non athlete. I suffer severe pain when starting walking then it declines and also when awakening from sleep and start moving. The area behind the left calcaneus is a bit swollen and very very tender I had Diprofos injection for the last 6 months twice , relieving at first then recurring again What to do?","Doctor":"Here the retro calcaneal pain could be due to couple of resion. It can be due to inflammation at local area in bone or soft tissue, it can be due to calcaneal bone extra growth at painful level, it can be calcaneal bursitis.How ever the conformation can be done with ct scan or MRI scan to know the proper cause.Now if its just over use inflamation then with physio therapy and cold pack usage it can be improve well.If it is calcaneal bone growth or bursitis then initially can be treated with physio therapy along with alternate hot and cold water use. Along with this one should also use soft foot wear like micro cellular pollimer material. One can also use silicone sole for their foot wear for extra softness. Suppose if it is not yet over with all above steps then there is hydrocortisone injection can also be given at local painful heal level.Even if it is not becoming better with this means for calcaneal bone growth you need to under go for minor surgical correction like removal of extra growth. But this treatment will be decided by your orthopedic doctor due to failure of all other primary treatment and precautions.Here you have mention you have tried with medicine but have never tried with physio therapy treatment, soft foot wear use, silicon insole use, hot and cold water use by deeping feet in it and keeping it floating so water can touch all around. So you can try with all this primary treatment steps. Along with this take simple stretching exercises with physio for your feet and heal. This will give you very good relief when it is followed all together.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a calcium level of 52 in my urine test results and had pancreatic cancer with whipple surgery 5 years ago, why is my levels so low, I had a kidney stone in april and possible ones in my kidney now. I was prescribed calcium supplement but most thing do not digest and absorbe in my system due to the surgery","Doctor":"Calcium is one of the most difficult mineral to get absorb from digestive system. And for this you need to have enough of vitamine D also in your body. Vitamine D helps for absorption as well as for metabolism of calcium in body. I suggest to take a calcium from natural organic supplement source so that bio availability will be good comparing to allopethic calcium tablets.Also have a good vitamine D with either direct exposure to sun light early morning or as a supplement again.I also suggest to have enough of milk, egg, banana in your diet to have good calcium availability from your food.One most important thing is do not take much of allopathic calcium because you already have kidney stone issue also. In today's fast life we do not concentrate much on what we eat as well food quality is also not so well. Along with this we are not regularly expose to morning sun light. All this together will result in low calcium in body.I am sure this all information will be useful for you if you follow properly.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, recently tripped but didn t fall. I skid on the carpet wearing sandals and pitched forward. I had pain when I did this but it went away until the next day when I was getting up from the toilet to put my pants on. WHAM, my side of my knee hurts bad. It hurts bad when I stand and my only relief is to sit down and perhaps lean to the right. At night I can t lay on the opposite side as it hurts so I lay on the painful knee side and I fall asleep? What could this be?","Doctor":"Here  there are couple of possibilities it may be strain on soft tissue or it can be a damage in cartilage (in side ) of joint due to weight bearing along with twist movement, pain can also be due to ligament strain on lateral ligament strain or acl, pcl ligament starin.How ever the conformation can be done only by specialist examination. So I suggest to visit orthopedic or physiotherapist and they will do different physical test to check on your knee problem. Here doctor may ask to do MRI of knee for further conformation.Treatment will be planed as per the examination and report. Here if there is a major damage to knee ligament or cartilage then arthroscopy correction may needed. For any minor to average issues doctor will suggest to take physiotherapy treatnent along with few anti inflammatory and cartilage healing medication. You should also take proper knee strengthening exercise program to follow gradually on your own from physio.You can also use hot and cold pack frequently at home for some more relief as well can also use crep bandage on your knee for stability while walking in your daily activity.Follow all above suggestion  and you will be fine.Take care."},{"Patient":"Yesterday I was running with friends and rolled my ankle causing me to fall to the ground I heard a pop as my ankle rolled right after I couldn t put any weight on it and was in terrible pain I put ice on it and I took Norco for pain since I ve been able to limp on it but it still hurts bad to walk on it as well as my foot and ankle goes numb all the way to my knee weather I m sitting as well as walking on it also I think I sprained it badly but not sure","Doctor":"Here you need to take x-ray of your ankle and check on it for hairline fracture. If there is no hairline fracture then it can be due to soft tissue strain. It could be ligament sprain or muscular strain. How ever it can be conformed with only MRI scan.Here based on report you need to take treatment after consulting orthopedic doctor. If there is a hair line crack then need to keep plaster for 2-3 weeks. And if there is no crack in bone then can be treated with conservative management like physiotherapy treatment and use of cold pack and hot pack. You can also use crep bandage over the ankle in figure of eight way to stabilize the ankle and support the ankle muscles and ligaments.I am sure if you follow all above steps then will have good relief in pain.

Some of the more common options include changes in activity level, pain relievers such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, as well as physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections.hiAnother treatment option is a procedure called viscosupplementation. In this procedure, a gel-like fluid called hyaluronic acid is injected into the knee joint. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance found in the synovial (joint) fluid. It acts as a lubricant to enable bones to move smoothly over each other and as a shock absorber for joint loads.People with osteoarthritis (\\"wear-and-tear\\" arthritis) have a lower-than-normal concentration of hyaluronic acid in their joints.

In addition to medication, the following suggestion may help to reduce pain--1. Ice fomentation- If the pain is not severe, try cold packs or cold compresses on the joint to lessen the inflammation and help the pain. Ice the joint for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day.2. Rest the joint.-. Raise the joint if you can on a pillow or other soft object.3. Plenty of water -A lack of water in your body can makes your uric acid levels raise even higher than they already are. Drinking water will help your body stabilize uric acid to a normal level.4 Dietary advice- The Purines, which are chemicals found in some food, when they are taken in food are broken down into uric acid.

Dairy products may lower your risk.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"My wife stubbed your big toe.

How could the abnormal growth in the vertebrae be reduced?Thank you","Doctor":"Hi, you have been diagnosed as Lumbar Canal Stenosis, which is a common lumbar degenerative disorder.

My chiropractor suggested that I need to exercise my upper back muscles, but it honestly just feels better when I rarely figure out how to pop it. Lately the popping has been followed by a burning sensation. Is this unhealthy? Or is there some other method for my shoulder aches to go away?","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Understanding your concern.Painless clicking of the shoulder is common, normal and frequently bilateral.  The exact causes are not entirely known but it is thought to be related to altered sudden pressures within the joints or bursal cavities.  Painful clicking, however, is most likely pathological.Popping shoulders with burning sensation could be because of pinched nerve. The term pinched nerve designates a type of injury or damage to a nerve or set of nerves, most commonly resulting from compression, constriction, or stretching of the surrounding area. A pinched nerve may also result from arthritis.. The severity of this condition can range from minor and temporary to long lasting and serious. Pinched nerves often result from activity and movement in work and recreational settings.It could be because of rotator cuff tear means damage to one or more of the four tendons that cover the shoulder joint and connect the shoulder bone to the collarbone. A torn rotator cuff is usually caused by injury in which the tendon is overstretched or resulting from a direct blow. This condition can also occur as a result of repeated minor injury or overuse that weaken the tendon.The mainstays of treatment include rest, anti-inflammatory medication and treatment. Treatment for rotator cuff disorders should always consist of rotator cuff strengthening exercises. Perform the exercise with a light dumbbell. Lie on the side, holding the dumbbell in the hand of the upper arm. Position the elbow of the upper arm against the rib cage to avoid movement other than external rotation. Externally rotate the arm through full range of motion. This will increase blood circulation to that area and your problem will be solved.Hoping your concern has been solved. Get back to me if any further query is there.Regards,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi I have severe pain over my joints since the last few days and it s hurting me every morning.. I met the doctor and he advised me certain blood test. . And was found that I have a slight increase in Esr. My level was 25 while the normal was 15-20 what can I do to reduce this and please help me with the diet plan for it also.","Doctor":"Hi Dear, Understanding your concern.ESR, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, is a medical test that measures how much inflammation occurs throughout your body.It is worth bearing in mind that ESR does tend to rise with age, regardless of the presence of inflammation, and that it is beneficial to do a repeat test after about a month and see if the level has changed.Eating a diet too high in acidic foods (starches and meats) and not enough alkaline foods (fruits and vegetables) leads to blood acidity and this makes the body function poorly and not heal well. Eating a good balanced diet with fresh foods helps with your brain and keeps you feeling good. Gamma linoleic acid (GLA) is an essential fatty acid derivative which has been shown to work particularly well. The best sources of GLA are plant oils, such as evening primrose oil, blackcurrant seed oil, and borage oil (also known as starflower oil).Eliminate inflammatory foods from her diet — which means avoiding processed foods, fried foods, red meat, carbonated beverages, processed sugars, and in some cases where there is a specific intolerance to grains or dairy, these should also be ruled out.Fruit and vegetables and pure water should be consumed in abundance. At least 30 minutes of brisk cardio exercise a day is recommended.I m hoping that your concern has been resolved now.

To the point, if I hold a phone to my ear for more than 5 minutes balancing my elbow on the arm of the chair, my arm locks up. I have to use the other arm to bend it straight and the bicep burns. The right arm will sometimes do the same but not at such a low threshold. In my heart I believe I have some sort of autoimmune thing. There are other symptoms that I believe support what I think but I am in no way an expert. I went to one person a couple years ago, expensive yes but boasted he was an expert. Turned out he was a chiropractor and would you believe if I went to him twice a week he could help me. I don t want to go back to my GP as I feel it would be a waste of her time and my money. I just don t know where the closest place to Southern Indiana that one could go to see a true expert in Autoimmune stuff and such. Do you? I would normally bother anyone with questions but these last couple weeks are getting rougher.","Doctor":"Here in your major explanation you have told you have problem with your left shoulder and arm along with range restriction.Here your problem could be related to 4 things,1. It can be frozen shoulder.2. It can be soft tissue ( rotator cuff ) damage covering your shoulder joint.3. It can be some thing related to heart problem.4. Shoulder joint osteo arthritis.Now if you see you have pain while lifting hand up and resisting movement  and not allowing any movement. That means only with muscle contraction ( tightening ) if pain is present then it is soft tissue pain.If there is no pain while lifting hand up and resisting movement. But there is pain when movement is allowed. That means pain while moving the joint then it is frozen shoulder.If you feel pain in chest along with breathing difficulty while walking up hill or running or jogging then it can be due to heart weakness and heart related issues.Here whatever is your condition the conformation between frozen shoulder and soft tissue damage can be done by MRI of shoulder as well with ortho and physio specialist examination too.Now based on that there will be treatment given. For severe damage in shoulder joint there will be arthro scopy repair can be done. And if joint is deform due to osteo arthritis then shoulder replacement has to be done.And if there is mild to moderate problem then you will be fine with physiotherapy treatment and exercises. You can also use hot pack on your shoulder for some more pain relief.Now if there is problem with heart then your doctor will ask you to do ECG and tredmile test and based on that there will be treatment plan. It can be medical or surgical again.Here also in the end physio therapy will help for getting you back to normal life.Take care."},{"Patient":"My mother is 80 y/o and has been diagnosed with polymylasia.

Your doctor will monitor you closely for potential problems. He or she may adjust your dosage and prescribe treatments to manage these reactions to corticosteroid treatment. Side effects include:Weight gain. This is a common side effect of corticosteroid therapy.Osteoporosis, the loss of bone density and weakening of bones, which increases the risk of bone fractures.High blood pressure (hypertension), which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.High cholesterol, which also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.Diabetes, chronic high levels of blood sugar that can cause tissue damage in a number of body systems.Cataracts, a clouding of the lenses of your eyes that can cloud or dim your vision .So be under direct contact with your doctor."},{"Patient":"I recently had a double fusion at the C4-5/5-6. I was injured in a fall 4 years ago. I continue to have left arm pain into the forearm. The pain starts inbetween my shoulder blades as a deep burning sensation. It goes up my spine into my neck and across my left shoulder into my arm. It almost feels like at times that my left hand feels colder then my right. Its a very hard sensation/pain to describe. I have always stated I think my pain starts in my thorasic spine. I had a MRI that shows a high intensity 3mm annular tear at my T7-8 moderately flattening the left ventral cord and moderately encroaching the left T7 root axillary zone. I also have the same burning sensation in my left leg into my foot. My left foot also feels colder then my right foot. I have nerve pain in my thigh and the outside of my calf muscel. I had a disectomy on my L4-5 done in March with no success. My physical therapist recently told me that she had a lady she treated with the exact same symptoms as me that also had a herniated disc at her T7-8. She had surgery and was pain free within 5weeks. Would a T7-8 herniated disc cause all these pains in both my left arm and left leg? Im only 31 years old. I was a nurse and no longer am able to work at this time.

Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi, I can understand your concern, and I can see how painfull it has been for you throughout that too at such a young age. now let me explain you, the pain in the hand and leg are of different origin, and both will need different tackling. there is herneation in the thoracic disc and if it is so severe that you need regular drugs to cover it, and even disturbes your sleep, then surgical decompression of the roots is must, similarly leg pain will need this, my recommendation to you is to consult a good spine surgeon. moreover after surgery regular exercises and life style modification as advised by your surgeon will be must to follow if you want to prevent other discs getting painfull.All the best, hope you heal soon"},{"Patient":"I had 10 Laparotomy surgeries in my early 20 s to try and save my female organs.

For the moment, I can advise to:- take oral pain-killers- apply analgesic cream locally- take fish oil and multivitamin supplementation- try to put your knee at rest, avoid walking or standing up for long periods- apply warm compresses (some of my patients have found relief by applying warmed coarse salt wrapped with a clothing locally)- physiotherapy can also be of greater help.

Before June 2014 I enjoyed running, skiing, biking, and all sorts of physical activity. It helped keep my weight down as well as blood pressure. I experienced knee pain and swelling beginning June 2014. In August I was diagnosed with Femur Patella syndrome on my right knee from an x-ray. He also mentioned I have a high kneecap which may have aided in this. After two months of following all advice from the sports Orthopedic doctor and not seeing any diminish of pain or swelling I visited another doctor.

The spinal canal is guarded by the vertebrae which separated from one another by a cushion like intervertebral discs. With age, degenerative changes occur which leads to disc prolapseand spinal cord/nerve root compression.The herniated discs compresses spinal nerves or spinal cord. Symptoms are experienced along the area of distribution/path of that particular nerve. This has happened at level of C3-C7 in your case.Treatment includes 1. Use of cervical collar helps in immobilisation and brings relief. 2. Medical drugs like pain killers - acetaminophen/ibuprofen and muscle relaxants might be helpful.3. Methylcobalamin supplements are also recommended for nerve compression symptoms.4. Cervical isometric exercises are beneficial to maintain the strength of the neck muscles.

She has informed me surgery is unnecessary and has prescribed P.T. for 8 weeks and no physical activity, continuous use of the brace and anti-inflammatory meds. In reading Ortho Journal articles, I m seeing that Multiple Knee Ligament Injuries should be treated by a specialist and are considered serious. I worry about finding the right course of action because I ve read many difficulties can arise, such as loss of knee movement, further injury, etc. I am a 32 year old, very active female and need to be able to resume skiing, kick boxing, cycling, etc. I have Kaiser, therefore, a second opinion is sort of a sticky situation. Just curious if this would be other Dr. s courses of action as well or if it s suggested I see someone else.","Doctor":"Here as per your explanation I understand you have got injury for acl and pcl both ligamentsin your knee and along with that there is a swelling in your knee joint.Here I am agree with your orthopedic doctor opinion that there is surgery needed when there is a damage to both ligaments ( acl, pcl ) and more over if that is also complete damage. Now next thing what your doctor have suggested is also very true that you have to go for physiotherapy for few weeks. Because with certain physiotherapy treatment along with basic exercise will help you to reduce the inflammation. As you get over with inflammation and swelling from your knee my suggestion is before going for surgery do enough of weight training ( knee strengthening ) exercises. This will help you to recover faster  after your ligament reconstruction surgery. Here you do not need to worry by checking on line reviews but follow the right treatment program that is before operation physio treatment and exercises. And then plan for surgery and again post operative follow the physio rehabilitation program. For your main question bruises on the bone, this will go away as you follow physio treatment and use hot pack on your knee.

Here if there is no crack then also you need to immobilize your ankle and feet for some days to allow soft tissue healing. As well if there is fracture or hairline crack plastering and immobilizing your ankle is must. One more thing here you need to check is whether the bruises on your toe is reducing or it is as it is. If its not reducing then there may be problem with vascularity also which need to be checked properly.In the end my suggestion is do visit the hospital take x ray and visit orthopedic and take needed treatment. If there is nothing major in side ankle, foot, toe then ortho doctor may guide you for physio treatment for early soft tissue healing.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have numbing in my left arm off and on (ring and pinky fingers), like a pinched nerve.

Im a 19 year old female who has worked out and played sports my whole life so I m not over weight. This has been going on for the past 2 months. What is causing this and how do I fix it?","Doctor":"Here if you have pain only at your tail bone and there is no numbness or tingling pain in legs then we use to call it coccydynia. And the cause of this pain could be stress on the bone due to prolong sitting, fall on tail bone, or hair line crack followed by fall or too much stress on it.Treatment is very simple. As conservative management it has to be treated with physiotheray ultrasound treatment with postural advice as well advice to use coccydynia supportive ring. This is basically filled with air so when person sits on it more weight will ho to buttock then the tail bone.With severe pain due to coccydynia can be treated by giving steroid injection along with conservative management.You can also use hot pack and cold pack to relieve the pain. And one exercise that is sleep on your tommy and tight your buttocks for 5-10 seconds to hold and relax. For very severe pain one x ray and consultation with orthopedic also should be done.

Again you also have pain for your Lowe back means either it can be spinal muscle weakness or loss of curve at lumbar level. Along with this spinal pain if you have any thing like numbness or tingling sensation then it could be nerve compression at respected level with disc problem also. But if you have pain only at spinal level and there is no radiating pain to hand or leg then it can be related to bone weakness, muscle weakness or there is some thing called as ankylosing spondylitis. How ever the conformation can be done only with MRI and blood test for Ankylosing spondylitis. As per the report you can visit orthopedic and plan for your treatment. For severe cases here he will suggest for surgical option and for mild issues he will suggest for physiotherapy treatment with spinal exercises and few medications.How ever even after after surgery also physiotherapy advice for posture and spinal exercises advice is very important so go ahead and follow it.Along with this you can also use hot and cold pack at home for some more relief.Headache also can be related with spinal problem and should improve along with this treatment.Apart from this for your gastric issue it may or may not be related with this. In case if it is relates with your spinal health then that will also improve with spinal health. And if its not improving then I suggest to change your life style and diet habits tk healthy habits. And even after that if there is no result then you need to visit a specialist for this for proper evaluation and treatment.Take care."},{"Patient":"post knee surgery - fluid keeps building up in an area directly above my knee; the dr. says its due to bone rubbing on bone and therefore making its own fluid.

And this lymphatic chennals are present all over the body even in our fingers too. lymph node is an oval-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, distributed widely throughout the body including the armpit and stomach and linked by lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are major sites of B, T, and other immune cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not deal with toxicity, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys.If you feel there is a swelling in lymohnode which is increasing and getting tender day by day then I suggest do not wait and visit your gynec immediately along with a vascular surgeon to for having better idea on your issue. My aim is not to panic you but if there is any thing related to cancer  then early detection and treatment will help you to get cure easily. And neck pain can be possible with this.

Later still if neck pain continue you can visit ortho and physio for further advice and treatment.Take care."},{"Patient":"Banged my lower back (right side) just slightly above my glute.

However, I am on my feet quite a bit (walking, standing,etc./ I am a nurse), and the pain and swelling increased over the next month. The MD decided to do surgery. I had surgery on April 28th, where the MD found that I actually had two fractures present with bone fragments which he removed. About two weeks after the stitches were removed, the incision opened up. I was placed on antibiotics for two weeks. After the first two weeks, the incision was still not healing, so the MD decided to debride it in the office and place me on a second round of antibiotics. The incision appears to be healed now, however, it is very sensitive and I continue to have swelling, muscle spasms, and pain in the toe and side of my foot. I have had a bone scan which showed hot spots in the area of the fracture and the ankle, which the MD said were from surgery. I just had an EMG performed today, because the MD feels the pain in my foot is being caused from my back. I have also, been seeing a chiropractor, who feels the two are not connected.

It can also be related to diseases of the brain (infection or swelling) or heart disorders (arrhythmia- rhythm disturbances). Since you have a history of lumbar disc disease, there is always a chance of similar cervical disc disease (neck posture-related issues). Besides this, there are simpler causes like anemia (low hemoglobin), hypoglycemia (low sugar), prolonged fasting, low blood pressure, stress, anxiety, or lack of proper sleep. Hence, I feel, first of all, focus on lifestyle modifications. Have a well-balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and less tea and coffee. Maintain proper posture especially while working and sleeping and take good sleep for 7-8 hours. If still the symptoms persist then do go for some investigations like- complete blood count( especially important as you have a history of thrombocytosis), sugar levels, electrolytes, ECG, X-ray cervical spine and MRI brain. This will help us to make a proper diagnosis. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

For your persisting dizziness and lightheadedness, I think you need to concentrate on your posture especially your neck muscles. Make sure while working on computer or writing, you are in erect posture and while sleeping try to take a small pillow and lie in proper position. Try to do some neck muscles strengthening exercises, this should be helpful to you. Take adequate sleep for 7-8 hours.

I have digestive issues that mimic stomach ulcers along with severe diarrhea and vomiting that sometimes contains blood for which I take Protonix. H. Pylori negative. I have pretty severe joint aches, specifically in my feet, hands, elbows, ankles, and knees, severe fatigue, strange hair growth...lol...lichen something on my tongue, high blood pressure ONCE and then normal everytime after that and high triglycerides, I m sure weight related. So NOW I ve been noticing this very strange fizzing, crackling sound that I can also feel that starts right at the base of my skull and moves upward into my head that s been going on for a year (that I ve noticed). Sometimes it s accompanied by a really strange pain, not AWFUL pain, but mild pain that shoots up from that area into the back of my head that lasts for about 30 seconds to a minute. I ve been going to the doctor once a month trying to figure all of this out and I m getting very frustrated. All of this started, mostly with the hair growth on my chin, breasts, and legs, during my second pregnancy. I ve had three children. I currently have an IUD which has been in place for 2.5 years. Oh, I also have high white blood cell count and have for about a year to a year and a half, high sed rate, and a temperature of 101 F constantly. Can you help me? What could this fizzing sound be and is it related to ALL of this other nonsense I ve been dealing with?","Doctor":"Hi, I think there are several issues that need to be dealt with the weight gain, hair growth, joint pains, skin lesions can be all related to some endocrinology (hormonal issues). Sometimes, when the hormonal levels in our body are disturbed it can lead to such symptoms. Even the persisting high-grade fever and raised white blood count needs to be investigated. The sound which you are experiencing could be related to your fatigability, low hemoglobin or lack of proper sleep. Hence, I feel that the problems being multiple and of long duration must get relax and must get yourself fully investigated. Get hormones checked - thyroid (TSH , T3, T4), serum cortisol, sodium, potassium, fasting blood sugar. Once the reports are there, something further can be planned. Take care.

However if the symptoms do not go then you need to get some investigations done - like complete blood count, fasting sugar levels, vitamin B12, vitamin D levels, thyroid levels.

A neurologist misdiagnosed me as having petite mal epilepsy. He prescribed Dilantin. The spells continued. For 55 plus years doctors the doctors tried many other AEDs and the spells/seizures continued. My EEGs are always normal. I notice when I was in my early teens that overwhelming emotions (usually anger, stress, frustration) usually precluded a seizure. A new acquaintance who was a Shaklee distributor and vitamin fanatic suggested it sounded like hypoglycemia to her. To prove her wrong and shut her up I went on the low blood sugar diet. After 3 weeks on the diet the seizures stopped. Eight weeks into the diet a friend talked me into having a piece of chocolate cake. 10 minutes after eating the cake I had a seizure. I had gone to doctors, read books, etc. and decided it was only the power of suggestion that caused the seizure and went off the diet. By this time ( I was 30) I had been told it was hysteria, neurosis, dissociation, and PTSD. I withdrew from all AEDs and the seizures continued on every 2 weeks as usual. While researching recently I ran across the word neuroglycopenia that perfectly describes my symptoms. I m back on the LBS diet since January this year and have been seizure free. My blood sugar is normal and I m on a blood thinner, so I m cautious about having a spinal tap; however I would be willing with the doctor who is familiar with neuroglycopenia.

The good thing is that she can tell when shes going to have one and can lay down before she actually faints. i guess my question is, is it normal to have fainting spells this frequently? because my i want to believe that shes having fainting spells but some times it just feels like shes just skipping out on work.","Doctor":"Hi,Neurocardiogenic syncope, is also known as vasovagal syncope, is a fainting spell that happens when the body overreacts to certain triggers. Triggers could be emotions, extreme heat, dehydration, pain, long standing. To reduce the change of the spills I suggest good hydration (1-2 liters of water per day), avoid heat (Shower with warm to cold water rather than hot water), eat healthy and regular meals, and finally find ways to cope with stress.If your mother is dealing with stress at work she might have more spells. However, if the spells are increasing in frequency it is important to visit your family doctor.

Good news is that dizziness rarely poses a life-threatening condition. It is important to get emergency care if the you have severe dizziness or vertigo along with one or more of the following symptoms: Severe headache, chest pain, difficulty breathing, numbness or paralysis of extremities, vomiting, speech problems, seizures.Dizziness could be due to:1. Inner ear problems causing vertigo2. Circulatory problems: Drop in blood pressure, heart arrhythmia, anemia, hypoglycemia3. Neurological problems: anxiety disorders, certain neurological medications, dehydrationBased no the history you provided specially fainting when standing I think the underlying cause is circulatory in origin. To tackle this, If I were your doctor I would first do a thorough physical exam then ask for ECG to rule out arrhythmia, measure your blood pressure sitting, and standing, ask for blood count test to rule out anemia. If resources are available and if a full diagnostic workup can be performed  I would also ask for a brain MRI scan and EEG as a neurological baseline.Another common problem that can lead to squeezing brain feeling and is easy to treat is eye problems. I would also ask you to get a visual acuity test, and eye glasses if needed. Based on the diagnosis treatment varies.

I m an 18 year old male. I recently went to the doc just for a check up. They ran what they called an broad range of tests, including blood. Everything came back completly normal, including my Vit D, which is kinda rare they said. I have been lifting wights lately, and have noticed that I twitch some in my legs and arms. I made the mistake of going online and asking Dr. Google why I was twitching, and of course the first thing I got was ALS. Now, I realize this is really dumb, but GOSH, it really frighted me. I have become very depressed, and though I know I don t have it, and probably never will have it, whenever I get the slightest twitch or pain, I think I won t see my 30th bday.

I know I must sound dumb, but I m really in a funk. Somehow, accepting my good health, which is a blessing, is hard for me. I have a few Q s. One, how do I get over this fear. 2.

I m fairly competitive in these events and usually place in the top 5% or better. Two years ago, I was taking gabapentin for nerve injury from a car wreck. My muscles had extreme fatigue from exercise, my knees hurt, my eyes occasionally had blurry vision, and I had leg cramps. I stopped the medicine and my symptoms improved, but did not all completely go away. It seemed that I tired more easily and did not recover as quickly. I had a few races where 2/3 of the way through the race, it felt like I had hit the wall in a marathon -- I was out of energy. A year ago, I had some pitting edema and pain in my foot/toes. The edema got somewhat better, but I don t believe that it ever went away. My current condition is that I fatigue more quickly in exercise, and I ve noticed it more in races and/or hilly routes. And my knees are sore, which is especially noticeable when on the stairs. I noticed that the pitting edema is back (or perhaps never really went away completely). I m not sure if this is related to my problems or not, but I also had what seems to have been plantar fascitis in August. It had bothered me only in the morning for a while, but got so bad that it hurt walking on it. A cortisone shot seemed to help, but it took about 3 weeks before I noticed improvement. I noticed earlier this year that my arch doesn t seem as high as it used to be -- mostly it s just the sensation of being able to feel it touching the floor when I m standing barefoot. I never used to feel that -- perhaps it s some swelling. I don t know. Recent blood test showed TSH of 5.41. The doctor says that is in the normal range of 0.5 to 6.0.

One important thing to rule out is cardiac reasons. Another important aspect is central nervous system reasons. It is great that you already tested for both that and the results came back normal.

The peripheral nerves sending feedback about balance are the first to be affected with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, or vit B12 deficiencies.

I have been on 10mg of Oxycodone and 5mg of Valium for 7 months now. It has seemed to fade as far as how much relief it gives me, my PCP is recommending switching my Valium to Soma. I am also on Ambien and have been for about 3 years to sleep at night (insomnia is a symptom I ve had for over 10 years and Ambien is the first medicine to help me sleep and not feel drowsy in the morning). And lastly, I am on 30mg of extended release Adderall twice/day to give me energy in the throughout the day. It seemed to work more before my surgery - now it just gets me moving, but I don t get the abundance of energy, but at least I can make it through 4-6 hours before feeling like I need a nap. I was not able to drive for 8 weeks after my surgery, but then gained movement back in my neck through stretching exercises pretty quickly and was evaluated and approved to drive again in November 2013. I have been driving to physical therapy, my doctors appts and short errands. My whole spinal cord hurts and I get shooting pain up through my cervical spine/neck/back of head when I am up and walking/sitting for a majority of the day. So to my situation/questions: I was driving to physical therapy and slipped on black ice in February and hit a snowbank (to avoid other cars when my car went out of control). My car then flipped over on my drivers side. The police/ambulance were called - I was able to crawl out the back of my car and had a ton of neck pain from the airbag hitting the seatbelt into my neck. They transported me to the hospital and the cop showed up and demanded a blood test. My prescription for Valium had fallen out of my purse during the accident. I wasn t concerned about it, as I take my medicine as prescribed - and even less when I can. I don t feel impaired when I take the Oxy/Valium and I typically wait an hour to an hour and a half to drive just in case (from having worked for the police and having a brother-in-law that was a heroin addict, I am very against drugs and impaired driving). The cop just now filed a suit against me for Driving Under the Influence of Prescription Drugs. It did not say that I was over the limit, just that I appeared impaired (as he was trying to get his DUI number). I even told him about my brain surgery and that I was allowed to drive and that I took as prescribed. Even after the accident, when I got even worse - which is why I have another appt with my neurosurgeon on April 18, my doctor switched me to Soma and Oxy, as I felt a tolerance to the Valium and was/am having so many muscle spasms. I asked my PCP again if I could drive on these medicines and from observing me (I see him every 3 weeks since my surgery) and he said yes, he saw no signs of impairment or addiction with me. He knows my goal was to get off all medication (including the ambient and adderall) with a successful surgery (which still remains to be seen). So I guess my question is, is there a medical way to show that I could have built up a tolerance and that I wasn t impaired when driving? That day I was in so much pain already and so mad that the medicine wasn t working for my pain at all. I did not even get a drowsy side effect from it after the first month of my surgery. And do you know how it metabolizes? How fast/long it stays in the body? I am obviously calling an attorney to fight the whole thing, as there are so many errors in his report and I remember everything. I was shaking after the accident because it scared me and I told him that - he disregarded all of it and didn t even right in his report that I indicated I had brain surgery and I was just scared I messed something up. I just won t be able to talk to an attorney till Monday and was wondering if the MGs I was given are looked at as abuse?? I guess I wanted a second doctors opinion on all the medicines they have me on as well. I absolutely cannot stand taking pain medicine and feel it is leading to a depression state, in which my doctor wanted me to start Cymbalta. He indicated that would help me with this short term depression while I go through my healing process, dealing with my car accident and whether or not I need another surgery and just feeling locked in the house the majority of the time, as well as indicating Cymbalta can help with pain (but that it will take about a month to notice a difference). I just don t want to keep adding medicine after medicine. I appreciate any insight while I wait to talk to my attorney about the medicine/accident and get the legal side, as well as my neurosurgeon appointment next friday. Thank you SO very much for taking the time to read this. (first time I ve ever used an online site like this to ask a question).

First of all I will congratulate u for treating the autistic child of 15 years by transplanting the stem cell. It is a historic research in the disability field particularly in the case of autism. For the last so many years there was no treatment of autism. Stem cell transplantation will prove a sparking future in the life of disabled persons having a Mental Retardation, Autism, Cerebral palsy and Down syndrome problem etc. I am residing in small town of Shimla H.P. My son is having Autism and he is 23 years old. As u R aware that the Autism is a brain disorder that often makes it hard to communicate with and relate to others. With autism, the different areas of the brain fail to work together. Most people with autism will always have some trouble relating to speech. But early diagnosis and treatment have helped more and more people with autism to reach their full potential. But in my case my son has been diagnosed by 300 Doctors but with no improvement in his speech / memory/IQ level. He don t have allergy with any food. He can’t speak, some time he become an aggressive mood. He will have to support by the parents to his day to day routine work. Physically he is all right. In the light of above please suggest me can my son be treated by stem cell transplantation therapy? . Early response will be appreciated please. With warm regards. Sincerely yours C.L.TEGTA, MOBILE 0000 AND 0000.","Doctor":"Hi, First of all, the stem cells therapy has been used successfully in the treatment of spinal cord injury. In the other neurological disorders, the stem cells therapy are under trial. Second, the treatment of autism is divided into three parts: the medical treatment, psychological treatment and diet control. The psychological treatment helps the patient learn more social skills. The diet rich in tryptophan such as Turkey breast,a banana with milk,dates with milk and honey with milk can help control aggressive behavior. Moreover, folic acid and omega 3 supplement once per day before meals every other day can help the patient. Too much saturated fat, artificial additives, salt in food can make the symptoms worse. Tomatoes, spinach and canned food can also make the symptoms worse. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It starts in my hand then travels up to my face, and in my foot traveling up my leg. It is almost like they have fallen asleep but it lasts for hours -days. My foot has actually been like this non-stop since late december. The first time it happened I was admitted to the hospital on suspection of a demyelination disorder. After several tests (mri,ct,blood) I was sent home. Nothing was determined and after a month everything returned to normal, other than my foot. I had several follow up appointments with a neurologist to find nothing and i have basically been dismissed. The tingling is starting again and i do not want to go through the whole process again. I do suffer from migraines, but they are fairly well controlled wih 50mg of amitriptyline daily before bed (also used to help with sleeping) and sumatriptan for when a migraine does occur. I have not had a migraine for two months, which is much better than the weekly migraine I was victim to and the week long migraine during menstruation. So, i do not think it is aura from the migraines. I still have full control of all areas other than I feel a like I am drunk/tipsy. Its like my depth perception is off so my limbs crash into things, like a clumsy drunk person. Other neurologic history includes a siezure after a sledding accident a year ago. No previous seziures or any following. Surgical history includes a left knee scope and right shoulder scope. Family history: pternal grandfather with type 2 diabetes, paternal grandmother has had a myocardial infarction, maternal grandfather had double bypass.

I am also a second year pharmacy student at ndsu, so i know what i am experiencing is not normal.","Doctor":"Hi, If the tingling is episodic lasting for seconds to minutes, then, the most likely cause is sensory seizures. If the tingling is constant lasting for more than 24 hours, then they are suggestive of a pathology in brain. At this age, demyelinating disorder is the most common. If you are so troubled, ignore and live. However, if they are bothering you, it is better to undergo MRI brain and spine with contrast and lumbar puncture. Hope I have answered your question.

He was treated only for muscular/skeletal symptoms. His condition prevented him from his regular exercise and became weaker and less mobile. about six weeks ago, a infectious disease physician diagnosed my friend with staphylococcus lugdenensis. He was placed on antibiotics. after four weeks of infusion treatments, he was not demonstrating sufficient improvement. His antibiotic was changed and it was recommended that he have spinal surgery as the MRI indicated he deposit. two weeks ago surgery was initiated to drain, deride and fuse two vertebrae. About one hour into the surgery, the patient suffered a V-Fib, was resuscitated and the operation ended. He was treated with hypothermal therapy, certain medicines, placed on a ventilator. Two days later, he was able to breath on his own, but for the first day was unresponsive. Two days after that, he was conscious and conversing with his brother, albeit weakly when he suddenly stopped and apparently passed out. The hospital staff resuscitated him, he was taken to a surgical unit and had a balloon angioplasty, He was the taken to the CCU and placed him on a ventilator, administered medications, oxygen, etc. He had a CT scan of his brain which was negative. This occurred five days ago. He has been on and off the ventilator and is able to breath on his own for short periods. Apparently, his heart output is ~25% of normal. The doctors have told the family they are not overly concerned about the low output and are treating him as necessary for fluid build ups. He has good color, but remains unconscious and unresponsive. He has underlying diabetes under control with medications and A-fib treated with cumin, which may explain why the surgeons could not place a stent into the heart. He continues to receive the antibiotics medication for his infection. He had no previous history of any cardiac events. I don t have contact with his medical team and his wife, my contact, does not have specific medical information. Since he has been my best friend since high school, I am very worried. Is it normal for this unresponsive, unconscious state to follow this confluence of events? Is the CT scan a reliable test for brain damage or bleeding? I don t understand why the heart, if it is not damaged, is underperforming so greatly. And, if the brain is not damaged, i don t understand the unresponsive state. Would you opinion include the possibility that he might sill regain consciousness? Any other comments will be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi, CT scan is conclusive for bleeding but not conclusive of brain damage. To confirm about the severity of brain damage, an MRI is required.

I am female, moderately active, and was medically discharged from the USAF in 2009 for pain in my hips and knees and flat feet. Flat feet, which ultimately ended up being the reason the Air Force discharged me, a problem I have dealt with since I was very young. When I was a child, I remember my mother taking me to a few different doctors and them all saying the same thing. “She needs to wear her supports, and running will probably always be difficult, even impossible, for her.” As a child, I didn’t pay the doctor much mind, and hated my supports with a passion. I was still able to run, but pain became a common factor in my life. Joint pain. Almost all of my joints hurt on a daily basis, from my toes to my fingers. Sometimes it gets so bad, it takes me double or even triple the time it would take me to complete a task on a good day. Fatigue. Most days, I can get through just fine, keeping myself occupied and ignoring how tired I am, but when my guard is down, the fatigue sneaks up on me. Classes are hard, as well as driving long distances alone without some one to keep me awake, as I often find myself drifting off. Sometimes it’s so intense that I feel like I could burst into tears, as though I have been sleep deprived for days when, in reality I sleep a perfectly substantial amount. Loose joints. I have dislocated my right elbow three times in my life before the age of five. Since then I have not re-dislocated it, though moving it in certain ways, or straining it puts a pressure and feel on it that I can only assume is it sliding in the joint. It is not pleasant, to say the least. Growing up, I remember running after my friends in the school field, but eventually having to stop after twisting one or both ankles, at times even when I was just walking. My knees have definitely been at least partially moved out of the joint, feeling like my knee-caps have been replaced by rocks. Those days, each step feels like my whole leg is a hollow tube that has a bomb right in the middle, ticking and waiting to go off. I don’t know how else to describe it. My jaw clicks and snaps when I talk, and most times, I can only open my mouth half way, then I have to wait a moment, and open it the rest of the way, or it makes the most awful cracking noise. In addition to having loose joints, some of my joints (like one of my thumbs, which I can dislocate by myself whenever I chose, and snap back into place easily) are double-jointed. When I first discovered I could snap my thumb into a different joint, I thought I must have had some kind of super power. It wasn’t until I realized that the joint sometimes snapped without my permission that it dawned on me that it was a problem. Often times, I felt compelled to snap my thumb out of and into its joint almost all day, while at other times, I could go months without thinking of my thumb. The dislocations and pain soon began to drive me crazy. It should also be noted that my fingers are extremely hypermobile. I can bend both thumbs down far enough that they touch my arm, and can pull my fingers back almost far enough that I can touch the top of my arm. Osteoarthritis. Self explanatory. Arthritis of the weight-bearing joints. Mine is in my spine, L-5, and while it isnt that uncommon to have, I feel like at 20 years old, I got the short end of a stick. Bad immune system. For most of my life I have lived with the knowledge that if anyone is sick near me, I will soon catch whatever that person had, usually to a more extreme degree. Strep throat, mono, influenza, swine flu, you name it, I’ve had it. Muscle formation. When I first when to bootcamp in 2009, I thought my inability to do a sit-up was due to not being physically prepared, but looking back and remembering how hard it was, how much strain it put on me, and how long it took me to be able to do just one sit up, I think that it might have been due to other reasons. As a 17 year old, doing a sit up shouldnt have been that hard. Carrying weights, my satchel, going up and down stairs, all things that involved muscles, I did badly in for a long while. It was very hard for me to gain muscle, even though I was working out every day. Skin problems. It’s no secret that my skin has been one of, if not the worst things about myself, for years. Until I hit puberty, my skin was smooth, porclien, clear, and basically perfect. However, scars seems to love me. A surgery on my foot that was very minimal when I was in ninth grade left a scar that hasnt faded one bit in the almost six years that it has been, and a wound I recieved on my wrist (one that didnt even bleed) has stayed with me since fourth grade, despite immediate application of neosporin. It was nothing more than a papercut, yet it remains, and inch and a half or so long, and just as vivid as when it first appeared. Scoliosis has suddenly struck, discovered just recently when I went in for x-rays on my back due to severe pain. I’m not sure if the scoliosis is what has been causing my back pain, or if it was a coincidental finding. I’m pending more tests and xrays to determine the cause of the back pain that has been gradually getting worse over the last few months. Stomach problems. As long as I can remember, eating early in the morning has been a recipe for an upset stomach. Within the last few years, my stomach has started to reject foods like coffee, certain cereals, and many other foods. At first my doctor though I had Irritable Bowel Syndrome, but ordered testing for coeliac disease anyway. Luckily the test doesnt show any sign of Coeliac Disease (a condition in which the body sees certain foods that contain gluten, wheat, barley, etc, as an invader and rejects it, causing inflamation of the stomach lining, and other complications), but further testing and a visit to a GI are in my future. I’d really like to be able to drink coffee again but I don’t know when that will happen…Just between you and me, I still drink it when I don’t have anywhere to be, and suffer through the pain. This girl loves coffee. Neuropathy. My right foot…boy would I like to feel my right foot! A few weeks into bootcamp, I noticed I was losing feeling in my foot. I was assured by military doctors that the feeling would return, but it hasnt.","Doctor":"Hi, They need to see your MRI scan whether you are having compression of the nerves or not.

Your father had hemorrhagic stroke. It can be caused by hypertension or aneurysm (outpouching of blood vessels) and trauma.Location of bleeding some times give the cause, in your case its probably from an aneurysm. At present, it is important to stabilize the patient's condition, control the bleeding by controlling hypertension. TH also mentioned hydrocephalus and herniation which is worrisome for that he might be requiring surgical intervention such as external ventricular drainage or decompressive craniectomy. But you should be aware that this will only take care of hydrocephalus and herniation but not he internal bleeding. The purpose of ventricular drainage and decompressive craniotomy is to save a life. Damage that happens due to bleeding will not alter. Next thing is to find out the cause for the same it will require DSA / angiography. If aneurysm presents it will require clipping or coiling to stop rebleeding.The outcome depends on the premorbid health status of the patient, risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and age of the patient. I will suggest taking a consultation with neurologist, neurosurgery, interventionist, intensive care specialist. It needs a collective discussion and management.Hope I have answered your question.

Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can both cause fatigue. This seems to be what you are most concerned about.  Your doctor may have brushed this possibility off because of your young age. However, thyroid disorders are more common in women than men and can occur at your age. I would ask your doctor to check a TSH and Free T4.

Looking around rapidly causes a mild dull ache to eminate from it. This ache eventually starts to give me tension headache pain behind my temples (both sides) above my left ear, as well as on top on my head on the left side. Also sometimes causes a feeling of pressure in my ears, more the left ear than the right, like I need to equalize. The most difficult thing to explain is the actual feeling in said left eye muscle. When not straining my eye on purpose, theres no real pain, and it doesnt feel exactly like pressure.. it kind of feels like something is in the eye without any scratching pain and my eye doesnt tear up. My eyes also appear perfectly normal. Lastly, maybe twice in the week, I have felt mildly dizzy for approx 5 -10 seconds - feels as if I am slightly losing my balance. I do have what was confirmed by my neurologist to be a pineal cyst, diagnosed via MRI 3 months ago but besides that no other clinical problems with my head or eyes. Neurologist confirmed it is asymptomatic as it is not applying pressure to any surrounding structures. I also have left maxillary sinusitis, which seems pretty dormant in the MRI, and I have never had any congestion or blocked nose etc because of it. Could this be some form of ptosis? Maybe it IS the sinusitis acting up?? Or is it just a strained eye muscle?","Doctor":"Hi, First of all, I would like to reassure you that we are not dealing with any serious neurological disease. A normal MRI rules out most of the serious conditions. As told to you, pineal cyst is incidental and is not the cause of your symptoms. As of now, it seems to be eye muscle strain.

My weight is 78 kgs. I am doing a private job in Bangladesh.I have been suffering Ankylosing spondylitis from 2003 when it was first detected through the test of HLA-B-27. I was under treatment of a Rheumatologist Professor Dr Syed Atiqul Haq (MBBS, MD,FRCP,FCPS) from 2003.During this period I have taken the exercise (NASS booklet) as per prescribed by Doctor & following medicine:i)Salazine /Salazopiryn(Sweden) ii)Inhibita iii)Pain killer(voltalin SR,Diproxin CR). But in the year of 2009 I feel very bad, my neck movement is restricted, feels weak, ankle pain and I become sick & weight lose severely. Than I stop to take medicine of Salazine and go to a Chiropractic (Physiotherapist). She suggests me to avoid all kind of Drugs and take cirotherapy (Physiotherapy) regularly. After taking therapy of one month I feel little bit better and did not take any medicine except pain killer which is prescribed by Dr Atiqul Haque(Rheumatologist) from last two years. In spite of that therapy my ankle pain and swelling exists. I can’t walk properly because of ankle & knee pain.In the year 2010 I have done the following test & Xray: Test Result 1)Lumbo-Sacral Spine B/V Bilateral sacroilitis ,Ankylosing spondylities 2) Cervical Spine B/V No significant abnormality is defected Now I take therapy one day in a week and take a Pain killer Reumacap SR (Indomethacin USP 75 mg) once daily but my two ankle swelling is not so well. I can’t walking properly, mobility of the leg is decrease, can’t sit in the floor, I can not stand in a place long time and also I feel very week. Now I want proper & advance treatment on AS.What can I do & want to proper treatment immediately. Please suggest me asap. Thanks Mohammad Shafiqur Rahman. Email: YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi, First of all, I have to say that diagnosis of AS is not by HLA-B27. This test only supports the diagnosis when we suspect AS by history, lab data and other tests (such as ESR, CRP). Your important finding is sacroiliitis on X-ray. The physiotherapist has made a big mistake by telling you to stop medication. you should know that AS is a rheumatologic condition and medication is a mandatory part of the treatment, although physiotherapy and/or chiroraxy could be of benefit.  Overall, you should have a combination of treatments. First of all, Indomethacin, 75 mg/day has little anti-inflammatory effect. Usually, I prescribe 75 mg, twice daily to get the full anti-inflammatory effect of this drug (consult with your doctor on this). Also, you should have some physiotherapy sessions from time to time. Chiropraxy does not help a lot, because the nature of your problem is inflammatory, not mechanical.  I suggest aquatic therapy. You can walk and perform mild exercises in the water.  Another important point is avoiding high impact exercises and activities such as biking, and jumping. A regular, moderate intensity activity such as stationary bicycling, or high speed walking or swimming could of great help if done regularly. you will see the results after 4-6 weeks. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Hooman Mahmoudi, Neurologist"},{"Patient":"My husband had surgery in June, 2010 on his right shoulder to repair a partially torn rotator cuff and bicep detachment. A nerve block was inserted in his neck/shoulder area for pain. When the block was removed three days after surgery, there was a tremor in his right hand - sort of a rolling motion between his thumb and first finger. The orthopedic surgeon could not determine the tremor s cause and referred my husband to a neurologist for tests. The neurologist spent five minutes with him and said that it was Parkinson s. He has no other Parkinson s symptoms. He prescribed Mysoline, which had no effect on the tremor and made him feel as though he were on speed. He was referred to a neurologist who specializes in motion disorders who prescribed Sinemet. After beginning with 1/2 tablet 3x a day, my husband is now taking 2 1/2 tablets 4x a day with no reduction in the tremor; in fact, his tremor has increased. We were informed that Sinemet was the go to medication for Parkinson s. However, having been on it for several months with no change, maybe this tremor isn t Parkinson s-related. We would like information as to whether this tremor could be related to the shoulder surgery and/or the nerve block that was used.","Doctor":"Hi, I don't think that the tremor is related to the nerve block or surgery. The nerves that traverse to the thumb and index finger do not pass near the surgery site that you mentioned. Even if they did, there is no such complication for surgery. Regarding to the tremor, you should describe it better. It would help if I could see a clip of the hand, but overall, as you say it is like a rolling motion, the first diagnosis will be early Parkinson's disease or a Parkinsonism (symptoms like Parkinson's disease, but due to other etiologies). An essential tremor should be considered but less likely. You should inform me 1- Are there any other symptoms like slowing in regular activities such as getting up and walking,  or decreased balance during walking? 2- What is your husband's age?  3- Have the tremor increased over the past years? Another important thing is that you should have done a brain MRI to reveal some etiologies that cause such symptoms (such as a small stroke). Hope I have answered your question.

That makes him all the more inert and very drowsy. Befor the fall he was in a very fit shape, inspite of his age, and performed all his activities very well. Today he can neither read the newspaper, or watch TV as he says he cant understand whats going on. What is the prognosis in such cases. ?","Doctor":"Hi, An important information that I need is: \\"Where is location of subdural hematoma?\\". Generally, we see the above symptoms when there is an insult is in the frontal lobe. Another point is \\"A resolved clot at CT scan does not change the prognosis\\". You should note that after a brain injury, there is only a 3-4 hours window to put off the pressure. After that the brain cells will be damaged and the damage will remain, even if the clot or the pathology resolves. The other point is: As there is only 3.5 months since the insult, there is still hope for more improvement (at least for other 6 months). So, overall, you have still time for improvement, although the prognosis is worse in elder people. The two drugs that you mentioned seem to be good. I would suggest adding NeuroAid II to increase the chance of improvement. Also, if a good occupational therapy center is available, I strongly suggest regular treatment sessions there, as rehabilitation is the only, evidence based treatment after brain injury due to subdural hematoma (if surgery not indicated). If occupational therapy is not feasible, or you cannot take him to the clinic, you can contact me or other neuro-rehab expert doctor to design an in-home exercise program for you.

It s happened to me a few times at night (woken me up) - it s a very strong smell as though it s right by my nose and then it s gone. In the past I ve had some weird crackling in my head so right now I m putting two and two together and possibly making five...what are your thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi,Symptoms of brain tumors can vary. Abnormal smell are very nonspecific and can be caused by many causes including congestion, sinusitis and allergies. Abnormal smells in neurological disorders are best described in temporal lobe seizures which can be caused by brain tumors. However, there are other signs that can occur with brain tumors.Headache being the most common which is typically positional (worse when lying down and in the morning), vision changes, worsening balance, problems with speech, weakness, numbness and tingling.It really depends on where the tumor is. A crackling in the head is unlikely to be related to any sort of tumor. Such a sounds could come from the neck or ears for instance. If you are very concerned you can see a neurologist and have them do a thorough exam on your to see if there is anything abnormal. The gold standard for diagnosis is an MRI and if present then a biopsy, but I think it's highly unlikely that you have one.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The salt and fat intake should decrease, besides the medical treatment of hypertension. Second, the magnet gait and incontinence mean that your father has Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. So, your father should do a CT Brain to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of NPH is mainly surgical treatment. The neurosurgeon put a shunt to drain the excess CSF.

Balance issues are broken into internal/brain and peripheral / ear causes. Even though the ear causes can be inside the brain. The brain causes are basically always serious. The ear causes pretty much never are. So, ear causes can be drainage / sinus / wax / clogging even just sleeping wrong. They often go up and down.

Does it get reclassified as chronic AF by the passage of time? I take Flecainide 200mg per day which I read is not recommended for chronic AF. A brain scan shows multiple small embolic infarcts presumably from before I started on the Flecainide and (for 18 months) Warfarin. Should I press my doctor to be assessed for electrical ablation? The AF does not affect normal living, and I know the operation carries risk, but the brain scan scares me.","Doctor":"Hello, I will suggest you continue with flecainide and anticoagulants. Electrical ablation is recommended only when your routine drugs are not working the way they should be or you do develop some unwanted side effects of these medications (if still, it does reclassify as chronic A.fib).

I am also enclosing the list of medicines and blood report for your information. Case summary Mrs Sharmila Sen 37/f was to undergo planned hysterectomy on 28/12/11.she is a known asthmatic on MDI(metered dose inhalers).as her hemoglobin was low preop packed cell transfusion was decided(Hb was 7gm/dl) by her treating doctor.She developed sudden onset uneasyness followe by shortness of breath after getting about 70 ml of blood and then had a cardiac arrest on 27/12/11 evening.she was attended by the anaesthesist who intubated and cardiac resuscitation was done .she was then shifted to CCU where she had refractory status epilepticus which was managed with inj midazolam ,inj leveteracetam etc. she was put on ventillatory support soon after shifting to ccu. tracheostomy was done on 05/01/2012. she had once developed pulmonary oedema which was taken care of. at present she is on ventillatory support and is comatosed.she is noticed to have myoclonic jerks off/on.signs of decorticate rigidity were also noticed . she had developed fever last week which has settled down. at present on anti-epileptics,suppurtive care.she is off ionotropes . clinically looks post cardiac arrest hypoxic brain damage. Additional information # She is an old patient of asthma and used to take Tab - Derifyline (Theophyline) and inhaler Asthalin regularly, & Tab - Prednisolone occasionally. # She had brain hypoxia lasted for approx 6 - 7 minutes. # She is presently maintaining Glasgow coma scale at 4. # Her present hemoglobin level is 9.1 after one pack of ( Leuco reduce ) Blood (Hb was 6.6 before transfusion).

Basal ganglia are normal. No ventricular dilatation seen. Basal cisterns brain stem and cerebellum are normal with normal cerebellar peduncles. Vessels visualised at base of brain reveal normal flow void on all sequences. No abnormality of cranial nerves that could be defined and seen.

No morphological abnormality is seen. No steno sing lesion is seen. Regards, Samrat","Doctor":"Hello, I will agree with the diagnosis because it is consistent with the sequence of events. A good aspect out of all the information is that she is having brain activity in the form of fits and myoclonic jerks. Recovery from hypoxic brain injury maybe there, maybe slow, maybe good being young. The micro colts which are there during an allergic reaction (highly expected in allergic asthma patient) had traveled to lungs and brain and heart leading to cardiac arrest, coma and pulmonary edema. Nature will take its course. If her brain has activity as I already mentioned. She definitely has positive chances of getting out of coma. Meanwhile, you need to keep pelvic area more or washed thrice a day, passive exercises thrice a day, feeding via tube regularly, changing her postures every 2 hours so that when she is out of coma, she is physically in a good condition without any complications of being in coma.

An MRI showed a bulged disc, etc., but nothing too serious. I had some mild neck pain as well. I was getting lower back adjustments and neck adjustments at the chiropractor. Three weeks ago, shortly after receiving one such neck adjustment, I began experiencing a somewhat dizzy, foggy, space-y feeling in my head that comes and goes at random every few minutes. Sometimes I have tension headaches in my forehead area and around my temples, kind of like a band squeezing around my head, but I also had sudden stabbing pains in random parts of my head; this would mostly occur as I was lying down, dozing off. This happened more in the first few days of this. When I have a particularly repetitive episode of this dizzy feeling, I sometimes have a slight carsick-y feeling of nausea. I also have a sort of weightless feeling in my left leg when I feel the spacey feeling come on. My chiro is referring me to get a brain and neck MRI to check for some nerve or disc issue. My initial fear was that I was having a stroke! My chiro did a check of my neurological facilities and found no issues, so my more rational guess is that the neck adjustment caused one of the vertebrae to impinge on a nerve. It is not as bad now as in the first couple of days, but it seems to have plateau ed since the first week -- not getting worse, but not really getting any better either. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi, I cannot say in your particular case, but generally, there are a lot of possibilities. The most common is a reaction from nerves in the neck to pressure that lowers the heart rate (vaso vagal) it is common. It is not serious. On the other hand, it could be changes in brain circulation in the neck vessels going to the brain due to blockages there that can lead to a stroke. Getting neurologist evaluation with carotid flow studies would show what is going on. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

For the last 6mo every time I lay down my body jerks until I am worn out and I get very little sleep, also when I am really tired sitting up it also jerks and I am not talking about small jerks, it jerks so much at night my chest starts to hurt from it. After having my mri on my neck I was sent for physical therapy, was told by therapist that therapy would help my neck but I needed to find out what was causing the jerking, also said that my left are reflexes are hyperactive and my right arm has no reflex. My right foot also feels like electricity is flowing in it, but not my leg.

Last night I went to the ER because I was vomitting black very thick vomit and eventually bile. My CT Scan came back ok, blood work came back ok, and urine came back ok. However then they ordered an IEP with contrast and it showed my right kidney was not draining and still was not draining 18 hours after they first put the dye in. I had another surgery this morning, (my 8th surgery) and have to have another surgery in the future said my urologist. My question is, could these other symptoms, (numbness, vommitting, eye and lip twitching) be related somehow to something else?? I am a 26 yr. old female, with no medical concerns other than this and I am healthy. weigh 118 and a mom of 3. Also, could my renal bruie be significant to any of this...all the doctors i ve dealt with seem to blow off the fact there is a bruie in that artery?? why?","Doctor":"Hello, It can be due to the side effects of anesthesia.

Read from MRI report. Has changed in past 2 years as has my symptoms, ie: left hand is pins/needles, increase in migraines & seizures. Dr is doing 2 epidural injections if they don t help I will be referred to Neurosurgeon. Do you think this requires surgery?","Doctor":"Hi, I do not think it is the cause for the seizures, there is no relation between seizures and cervical issues. Cervical issues may cause headaches, but may not necessarily be the case, they do not cause migraine type headache, so more info on headache characteristics is needed to understand whether related. Still wouldn't consider surgery for that indication. Pins and needle may be related to cervical issues. However if the only symptom, surgery is not the first choice. Physical therapy and pain killers are preferred. Surgery is done only if on the MRI there is evidence of damage to the spinal cord (the MRI report hints at some mild damage) and clinical signs on physical exam suggesting spinal cord damage. Another indication would be intense, persistent radicular pain, pain due to compression of a nerve root, but your account doesn't suggest that. Hope I have answered your query.

Third most recent surgery x 2 weeks ago to remove nasal pollups. Surgery went well, seeming normal recovery. However, developed two blood clots in r leg ( below the kne in calf area.) Blood clots were discovered a week following surgery. Immediatly started on Lovenox. 24 hours after beginning lovenox tx, exhibited siezure like symptoms, inclusing headache, aura, muscle spasm and slurred speech. Admitted to hospital, all ct scans and blood work were negative. Seizure symptoms decreased significantly following the 18 hours after the initial seizure/hospital admission. Seizures returned after about 5 hours later. Hospital did not discharge as the seizure persisted continously. Is there possibility that the seizures are side effect of surgery to remove sinus pollups? Speculated that it could be side effect of Levenox because she does not have bleeding in brain.","Doctor":"Hello,There is an increased risk of seizures following anesthesia, but typically the individuals already has a risk of having seizures if they occur. It is highly unlikely that lovenox would cause seizures, unless as you said there was bleeding into the brain, but that could be seen with a CT scan or MRI. The symptoms you describe, although they can be seen in seizures, don't particularly strike me as such.A typically seizure involves convulsions with loss of consciousness. The period after seizures however can present as you described. There are more focal seizures that again can show up as you describe. Continuous seizures would cause significant harm, most likely loss of consciousness as they often spread to involve the whole brain. In any case, an EEG should have been done on you to evaluate for true seizure activity, and if you haven't had one done, you definitely should.The description of the symptoms could easily be due to a migraine as some types of migraines can actually result in neurological symptoms with confusion, slurred speech, weakness, vision loss, and numbness/tingling. I feel that this would be more likely, unless an EEG was done and it showed true seizure activity.Surgeries can cause stress on the body which can result in both headaches and seizures. I don't think it is lovenox would cause either unless as you note there was bleeding in the brain. If an EEG was done and there is seizure activity, then she should be started on a seizure medication such as Keppra 750 mg by mouth twice a day. If this is the case, then she has likely had a propensity for seizures, which was simply unmasked by the surgery. None them less an MRI with and without contrast with an epilepsy protocol (thin T2 cuts through the temporal lobes) should be obtained to evaluate for any lesions in the brain.Hope I have answered your query.

I m still having lots of back pain, especially after therapy. My pain doctor wants me to get an MRI. My question is will an MRI still find a healed herniated disc or slipped disc?","Doctor":"Hello,A herniated or ruptured disc does not usually heal given the poor vascular supply to cartilage - this is similar to the menisci in knees that do not heal when they tear.

It's hard for me to say what \\"mild cerebral atrophy\\" means without actually being able to see the images for myself. That being said, a small amount of atrophy (brain shrinkage) occurs with normal aging, and I'm suspecting that that is what the radiologist saw. As such it would not explain your symptoms.If you did not have a head impact a subdural hematoma is unlikely and typically would also cause other focal neurological symptoms such as weakness, headaches, numbness and tingling, possibly loss of coordination depending on where it is located. Headaches are very nonspecific and unless you have never had headaches before, or the type of headache you have had has changed in quality, it does not warrant re-imaging. However, if it has markedly changes or it is a new onset headache, then an MRI should be done. For the fatigue, I would recommend a full blood workup for vitamin B12, folate, TSH, CMP and CBC with differential to start to look for any blood abnormalities. If all are negative, then a cortisol test is reasonable. If your sleep hasn't is not evaluate, that should also be done. As we age obstructive sleep apnea becomes more common and can cause very nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and headaches due to poor sleep quality. If you are experiencing any symptoms of depression and anxiety, those should also be manages as they can result in non-specific fatigue.Hope I have answered your query.

The visualized mastoid air cells, paranasal sinuses and orbits are normal.My concern is these statements, what does this mean?

I have history of headaches, tension types and occipital neuralgia.

You're are normal in sizePost contrast images demonstrate no abnormal intraparenchymal or extra-axial enhancement: When they gave you dye, no areas became bright. Areas that typically are bright are things such as tumors, infection, inflammation and bleeding. You have none of these. It is a normal result.Diffusion of weighted images demonstrate no areas of restricted diffusion: There is no abnormal movement of water molecules, which is seen in stroke, infection and in some tumors. You do not have any of these and the result is normal.The visualized mastoid air cells, paranasal sinuses and orbits are normal: Your sinuses are clear and don't show any sign of infection. A few tiny punctate areas of subcortical white matter signal abnormality in the high frontal lobes. T2/FLAIR white matter signal hyperintensitites in the the high frontal lobes. These are very nonspecific in appearance:This statement refers to a specific type a signal seen on two different types of pictures seen on MRI: T2 and FLAIR. There are multiple different reasons for these, and almost everyone will have a few. Factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, vascular disease and multiple sclerosis can cause such spots, though the ones in multiple sclerosis have a particular look to them and per the radiologist report he/she did not suspect that. We think that the spots are formed when tiny blood vessels become diseases from high blood pressure,diabetes and high cholesterol. HOWEVER, people with migraines are known to develop them as well, and we don't know exactly what they mean. Because of that we literally called them \\"UBOs\\" - unidentified bright objects. You have very few, they are as the radiologist said \\"nonspecific\\" meaning they are not pointing to a particular disease process. So a few rare spots in a person with migraines is to be expected and is of no consequence. Even if not caused by migraines, they are very few and far in between, so you shouldn't be concerned about them. Essentially you have a normal brain MRI for your age and history of possible migraines.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Moreover, the high lipid and cholesterol in the blood deposit on the blood vessel wall leading to losing its elasticity. In this case, the blood vessel wall becomes weaker and more liable to develop an aneurysm. Second, the drug cannot control high blood pressure without reducing the salt and fat intake.

Since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare, but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely.None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to adrenal gland dysfunction, autonomic nervous system issues or heart issues. You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated.I hope this helps.Sincerely,Kristoffer Nissinen"},{"Patient":"At night I feel numbness on the right side of my face, my right hand swells and I feel some numbness in my hand and wrist.

I had extreme dizziness for a week which has quickly improved to almost near normal pre-accident state now. I have restarted smoking (2-4 cigs/day while pre-accident it was ~15/day). Is this likely to be dangerous? I experienced mild dizziness when I first restarted smoking, but now that has passed.

Even though you did not have the subarachnoid hemorrhage, smoking is still bad for your brain. Subarachnoid bleeding, together with smoking, will lead to cognitive effects when you get old. The decline in memory will be fast-paced, and you may experience cognitive loss once you reach the 50's to '60s. Without smoking, you can enjoy a mind with only a minimal decline.

I'm a neurologist and do have a couple of patients in my HEADACHE CLINIC since these patients will suffer from headaches (both primary types such as migraine or tension as well as mechanical types due to hypermobility issues of the neck because of cervical spine instability from the ED).  EDS is confirmed by genetic testing.  Actually, Kudos to whoever suspected the diagnosis enough from your presentation to send you for confirmation.  The problem with now going to a SPECIALIST for this problem is that there isn't anybody aside from GENETICISTS who may be medical clinicians who would see that many cases during their training in any other field EXCEPT as it relates to the CONSEQUENCES OF the malady.  So, I got to meet these 2 patients whom I've been following (and learning a lot from) because of headaches that were not easily treatable but their primary doctors or other specialists.  Orthopods might have EDS patients due to musculoskeletal issues that may be best handled by them because of ED...but they do not have truly specialized knowledge in the infirmity since it is really considered a RARE GENETIC problem.  Here's a link you can look up if you're not familiar with it to get more information.  I suggest you look up doctors who are on their list of treating physicians since these folks have expressed an interest in treating this problem and therefore, through sheer experience and having an idea of what works and what doesn't work in their patients can guide you or help you get some relief using creative use of prosthetics or knowing who else they might be able to call in case they're not sure what to do next.  Make sense?  First of all, you may be interested in signing up with a REGISTRY which is GLOBAL and tracks all those who fit the criteria for EDS....check it out...maybe you don't wish to make your information available but it is a Legit site and has a bona fide mission directed at being able to track and have on hand all folks who fit the registry for future things such as research programs, etc.   here is the official website for the Ehlers-Danlos Society where you can find a lot more information related to HELPLINES, SUPPORT GROUPS, ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES, CONFERENCES, MEETINGS where both patients and doctors get together and have POW WOW sessions to get on the same page with where the research is, what steps a person can take if they are game to get into a protocol, etc.  Send me more questions to www.bit.ly/drdariushsaghafi and I'll be happy to answer.

One is called BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO (BPPV) which typically comes on in male subjects above the age of 50 or 55 years though it can be present in younger patients and when in this age group tend to be females who do a lot of aerobic exercising that involve a lot of pounding of the feet on a floor. The typical feature of BPPV is that VERTIGO that can be severe comes on upon sudden movements or changes in position of the head. The other possible diagnosis is Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD).  This condition is similar to BPPV except it is more continuous and ongoing but does have fluctuations unrelated to head position.   Your best choice at getting a firm diagnosis is to see either a NEUROLOGIST or NEURO-OTOLOGIST for a good history and physical examination since other considerations are possible and should also be ruled out.

It may be noted that he is going to toilet alone with the support of the nurse and closes the door behind and opens by himself! Also, I may note that he is 46 years and is diabetes ... Thanks,","Doctor":"Hello,I'm very sorry to hear about your friend's stroke.Here is some information relation to hemorrhagic strokes (brain bleeds).First of all, brain bleeds can happen for different reasons such as a head injury (traumatic), a rupture of an aneurysm and bleed within the brain matter itself (parenchymal hemorrhage).It is very important in your friends case to determine what caused his bleed. Given his fevers any infections need to be ruled out and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) should be done to rule out any sort of infection of the heart valves which could send bacteria to the brain which could result in a bleed. He absolutely needs to have blood vessel imaging in the form of either a CT angiogram and MR angiogram to make sure that there are no abnormal collections of blood vessels in the brain and aneurysms that could have cause the bleed. Also when there is a bleed in the brain a tumor must also be ruled out.All that being said, the most common cause of a bleed in the brain is due to high blood pressure which causes weakening of blood vessels and can result in a hemorrhage. Most commonly management of brain hemorrhages is supportive, meaning that the only things that are done is blood pressure control, pain management and if the person is unconscious then support for breathing. If the bleed is very large then surgical intervention may be necessary. What the doctors are saying as that they want to repeat a CT scan to see if the bleed has become larger, which can sometimes happen. There are several different risk factors for the bleed worseing: one is poor blood pressure control, another is if there is an underlying aneurysm or blood vessel that could bleed. That's why it is so important to determine what caused the bleed. For small bleeds with no underlying vascular or malignant pathology the outcome is typically fairly good. The blood causes irritation and pressure on the surrounding brain causing weakness and neurological symptoms, but as the blood subsides the symptoms improve and sometimes there may be a remarkable improvement. The language area of the brain is very delicate and it is hard to predict how well he will recovers, but my best educated guess is that he will recover at least some language function and could even recover close to how he was though probably never quite back to level his language was before the bleed. It sounds like he is doing relatively well overall since he is able to go to the restroom without support, so that is an encouraging sign.Hope I have answered your query.

What do you suppose that is? The bells palsy began with a swollen ear but I understand that it can also be cancer. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello,Bell's palsy is by definition a paralysis of the nerve that controls the movements of your face whose cause we don't know, but we often blame it on a virus. The symptoms of Bell's Palsy are as follows: Half of the face will gradually (usually over several hours) become paralyzed. People often realize this either by looking in the mirror, realizing that one of their eyes is not closing or that they are having trouble drinking liquids because they cannot close their mouths properly. There may also be changes in taste, where taste in half of the tongue is diminished. The symptoms is hard to notice though since the taste receptors in the other half of the tongue are still functional. There may be sensitivity to sounds ans the muscle that helps dampen loud sounds in the ear becomes paralyzes as well.There are usually not external signs other than nerve paralysis, meaning that there should not be any swelling, pain or tenderness anywhere in the face. What you are describing sounds more like an infection or some sort of inflammation because you are having swelling in your ear. The lump behind your ear may be a lymph node that is swollen as there is a collection of lymph nodes behind your ear. I would say cancer is lower on the list of diagnoses, but based on the information I have and lacking a physical exam I cannot rule it out entirely.None the less you should go see your physician to get a proper physical exam which would include a full neurological exam and an exam of the Head, neck, mouth, ears and nose to identify any possible causes. Imaging may also be necessary in which case an MRI would be the best choice without and with added contrast to visualize infection and growths better. Routine blood work would also be recommended including a complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic panel and an ESR to evaluate for signs of infection. Depending on the physical exam, other tests may be necessary.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

While she fainted her body started shaking like she was having a seizure. I blew slowing on her face while this was happening and she was only out for less then a minute, but what causes the body to shake like ths?","Doctor":"Hello,Unfortunately for physicians \\"shaking\\" is a very vague term and it could mean many different kinds of movements, ranging from tremulousness of the body, to flailing, to arrhythmic shaking to rhythmic shaking and all have very different implications. However, I will given you the most common cause of what you saw.Most likely what occurred is called \\"convulsive syncope\\" which means that when you pass out you have some jerking movements, but it is not considered a seizure. What happens is that blood flow is disrupted to the brain and the person loses consciousness. Because the nerve cells are suddenly deprived of oxygen, they fire abnormally for a few times causing body jerking, but when the person collapses blood flow is restored and the movements stop. So essentially the movements are caused by passing out and not by a seizure.Likely what happened also was what we call a \\"vasovagal reactiong\\" in which due to stress, emotional response among other things, the blood vessels dilate and blood rushed down from the head into the legs causing a person to pass out. The classic example of this is when a person who is getting their blood drawn passes out. It is not considered abnormal, and can happen to anybody. Lastly, just to describe what a true seizure looks like. Typically what happens is that a person will first stiffen up, the eyes will turn up into the head with the eyes remaining open. There is often a very loud scream due to the abdominal muscles tensing up and expelling air from the lungs. The stiffening phase is then followed by a rhythmic, whole body shaking. When I say rhythmic I mean that the jerks occur at regular intervals and at the same time in all extremities of the body. The gradually slow down and the person becomes limp and often is breathing very hard.When they wake up there is almost always confusion that lasts several minutes and then slowly the person returns to their normal state of mind.Hope I have answered your query.

None the less, if would not be related to your symptom of vertigo.Vertigo can occur for multiple different reasons and the most common cause by far is inner ear pathology. The most common causes are viral infections and what is called \\"benign paroxysmal positional positional veritigo\\" in which crystals become dislodged and end up in semicircular canals causing an abnormal sense of movement. Rarer causes are cerebrovascular disease, in which blood flow to the back of the brain is diminished, Menier's disease which also causes hearing loss, tumors/growths and malformations of the structure of the inner ear.You have had part of the workup done, but the first thing is to find out whether your vertigo is central or peripheral. Your VNG was normal which can be helpful, but if you are not experiencing symptoms at the time of the test, it may miss it. Your neurologist may perform what is called a \\"dix-hallpike\\" maneuver in attempt to trigger your vertigo. Also a head-thrust may be done to visualize corrective eye movements. However, the VNG is usually more sensitive than the head thrust test. An MRI of the brain and an MRA of the blood vessels in the neck and brain would be a reasonable test to perform to rule out any vascular problems. Lastly a high resolution CT scan of the temporal bone can help look for any small malformations in the structures of the inner ear. An audiogram may also be useful to screen for any hearing loss that may not be evident in daily conversations and function.Almost all of these causes are treatable, it just needs to be determined what is causing your symptoms. In the mean time the vertigo can be treated with vestibular suppressants. Meclizine is sometimes used, but is not very effective in my personal experience. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam can be used to treat severe vertigo as well. I suggest you speak with your neurologist regarding which medication is most appropriate for youHope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Of course, I always recommend to my B12 deficient patients (even those on injections) that they should improve their overall dietary consumption of B12 by simply escalating the amounts of ANIMAL PRODUCTS in their diets. Everything that is meat, fish, liver, chicken, and dairy products contain a very good amount of B12 in its content and if you eat large amounts of these items on a daily basis your levels should go up.

If a doctor who has examined her and has had the benefit of reviewing an X-ray or other imaging study believes that surgery is likely able to help her reduce the back pain then, I believe it is worthy of consideration.
