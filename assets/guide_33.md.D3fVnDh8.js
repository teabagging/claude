It is due to fast renewal process of the skin.Methotrexate is the mainstay of the therapy but has its own blood and liver related side effects. Always take it under dermatological advise other wise can cause serious side effects.You should start it after dermatological supervision and complete blood counts and liver function tests.Topical steroids such as clobetasol can be used in combination with moisturizing cream.Take care."},{"Patient":"a while ago my doctor said i had psorasis after looking at my skin because i repeatedly was getting sick and needing antibiotics because of the virus. shortly after i went to a dermatologist to talk about my skin and flakes in my eyebrows and hair. mentioned what my doctors said about psoraisis. she said no just dandruff. a little insight would be nice as to why now a year later my scalp is always itchy and completely covered in  dandruff or flakes or whatever it is. im of black, i wash my hair every week. i grease it . i scratch the dandruff off. idk whats going on.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for posting your concern at HCMSeborrhoeic dermatitis OR Dandruff can affect the scalp, face(eyebrows, eyelashes, sides of nose, chin), chest, back and area behind the ear etc.Clinically it presents as itchy, ill-defined erythematous lesions with adherent greasy and yellowish scaling which when scrapped or picked with nails oozes sticky liquid.Keeping the scalp clean with either daily OR alternate day shampooing and avoidance of greasy products on scalp helps in resolving the condition.I advice my patients of seborrhoeic dermatitis to use an anti-fungal shampoo twice OR thrice weekly(can also be used once OR even twice daily depending upon the requirement).If shampoo is not enough i ask my patient to use a topical steroid lotion twice daily for 2-4 weeks.Once the scaling and erythema subsides it is important to stop the steroid lotion but continue with an anti-fungal shampoo for maintaining the improvement.take careregards"},{"Patient":"HiI have a couple of spots of dry skin that are starting to concern me. The largest spot is about 2 inches in diameter on my left leg. It is over an old childhood scar from an injury that caused a dent or missing bone in my femur. I have a couple of other dry spots on the same leg and one on the other leg. The other spots are only about a 1/2 inch in diameter. There is also dry skin on my hip bone, right around my jeans' waistline. All of these spots are incredibly itchy and scaly, but do not have any puss visible. Itching inflames the skin. My back is also very dry and occasionally itches. A cream with cortizone calms the itching, but it concerns me that the skin hasn't healed in over a month. I'm not sure if the location of the main spot is of any importance. I have not seen a doctor for this. It seems different than eczema, but I am not sure. I have not started any new medications and not made any changes in my diet. I do not take any medication regularly. I have been told that I am anemic, but am not on any medical regime.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,I read your query and understood your concern about the itching spots. It is very difficult to make a diagnosis without a picture, but your description points towards psoriasis. Around the jeans waist line psoriasis like lesions are commonly seen due to phenomena called koebner's. Cortizone is a topical steroid commonly used to relieve symptoms of itching. I'd suggest you to continue it. Apply a lot of moisturizer over the skin when the skin is still damp after a wash/ bath.Consult a dermatologist as soon as possible to assess the severity of existing lesions and directing on the proper treatment modality."},{"Patient":"HI , This  is GANGA  having  psoriasis  for  almost 10 years ,,  showe  to multiple  doctors  in  multiple cities and state  , but no  improvement ,  currently usin PROPYSALIC  NF  ointment   but it  has  only to  control scaly patches  but  not cures completely ,    i have  to  keep on applying on the  area  where ever red  scaly patches comes...  if i donot   apply for  3  days same  patches  gets  bigger and makes  to  get irritated .

It is an autoimmune dermatosis with genetic tendency.Exact cause is not known. There are so many factors which precipitate or exacerbate the disease.

Topicals in the form of Propysalic ointment can be used if involvement is up to  a certain percentage of body area by Psoriasis. Beyond a specific limit, you will need oral /injectable therapy which unfortunately has the potential if side-effects ,if not monitored closely. For a chronic condition like psoriasis , treatment regimen is modified according to the severity of disease ,which might be different in different times of the year.So, a close follow-up with your dermatologist is important for optimum result and achieving a remission. For the methotrexate that you are using , side effects like nausea and vomiting may be dose-dependent.Therefore, several physicians consider  adjusting the dose or modifying the mode of intake to eliminate the problem.The total dose of Methotrexate can be divided & taken over 2 days every week; or you may take it at bed-time ,if taking during the day causes nausea; it can also be take after food ,instead of before . Still if nausea persists , you may consider switching over to injectable Methotrexate once a week .

It may go into remissions but cure is not possible. So stop going from one system of medicine to other searching for cure as it is there in your genes.

There are a lot of treatments for it according to severity. Even methotrexate induced nausea can be controlled by certain precautions. Oral retinoids like Acitretin works. Cyclosporine, Phototherapy, topical steroids, calcipotriol, tacrolimus, Biological injections etc is available for treatment. Consult an experienced dermatologist and stick by him. He will discuss with you the pros and cons of each and choose the best line of treatment. If one modality does not work go back to him rather than somebody else because he will know what works for you and what not.

I will try to answer your query Psoriasis is autoimmune disorder , which means body's immune system starts working against ones own cells instead of foreign substances in particular areas . In psoriais  this results in increased formation and shedding of skin in the form of scales. psoriasis is not curable but symptom free period can be achieved with medication and supressive therapy In your case since it is mild you might remain symptom free for longer duration. The following may help: Keep your skin hydrated throughout the year . Avoid cold, dry climates. Avoid scratching and picking skin, and avoid skin injuries (cuts or scrapes). Avoid stress and anxiety. Infection like sore throat may cause guttate psoriasis so try to avoid, take early treatment if infection occurs Aviod Alcohol and smoking Certain medicines can cause flaring of lesions , so inform your doctor about psoriasis Hope this solves your query"},{"Patient":"Hi, Ive been really paranoid about being pregnant because last saturday things got a bit hot and heavy with my boyfriend.

Over the years I got more and more back pains and pains in other joints like elbows and shoulder and knees. I kept on working but after another break upin the relationship and since my mother passed away in january, i am unable to work at all. The pains were horrible, couldn t walk the stairs or move my right arm. At the hospital i was finally diognosed with Psoriatic Arthritis . I got shots in my shoulder and hip and since then it is bearable but still very sore. Also got perscription for Methotrexate and Folic acid . My questions are the following 1) This all was triggered by stress, does that mean that when my life settles it can just as sudden disappear again? 2) Can I start exercises even though I am still in pain or do I make things worse by doing that? Thanks in advance Hendrika","Doctor":"hello Hendrika..thanks for your queryI do understand your concerns regarding the pain and well as the stress due to multiple occurrences.It is important to understand that psoriasis and its outcomes are triggered by stress ,however , the pathology occurring is not only due to that.The exact causes are not yet known, but a number of genetic associations have been identified for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.Hence , it is important to take the medications and stop them only after proper medical advise .In many cases, a smaller dose of the same medication helps in  maintaining the remission and keeps you debility free.Exercise is advised to many suffering from this concern as this helps in improving the symptoms and maintaining remission .However, any kind of exercise should not be started /pursued without advise and supervision of  physiotherapist.So you can consult one and learn what kind of exercises are suitable for you .Hope this helps.Take care.."},{"Patient":"I am a 60 year old woman.who has worked in nursing care for 30 years.I still work as a h.c.a. in a local hospital,for the past eight years i have suffered with psorisis.my older sister has had it most of her life .there are 8 children in our family and noticed only 4 have developed some psorisis.I am now waiting to be refered to a rhumotollgist.but afraid they may ask me to take methotrexate ..my ollder sister has had this and has had been loosing her sight.I dread that happening to me as I have inhereted stigmtism and my long sightedness is plus 8 in my right eye.can you reasure me please.","Doctor":"hi..thanks for your query Methotrexate is very well known for its potential toxic/side effects.

Firstly psoriasis is just a skin condition and it is not a hinderance to get married. Secondly as far as libido is concerned it seems more of psychological or stress induced. Psoriasis as such is not directly linked to libido.Try to remain stress free, do mind calming exercises as stress can also exacerbate psoriasis.

Don't be disheartened, consult a good dermatologist and discuss your problems at length. Psoriasis is a recurring skin problem which can be kept in remission with proper treatment.

Psoriasis can be brought into remission but cannot be completely cured. However dont lose heart and do not change your doctor frequently as it affects the treatment.

Natural sunlight has been shown to sigificantly improve, or clear, psoriasis. Get regular daily doses, but keep them short and avoid the sun from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when the rays are strongest. 2) Add over-the-counter tar solutions, bath oil, oatmeal, Epsom salts and Dead Sea salts to your bath. All of these will help soften the skin. 3) Use moisturizers after bathing and periodically during the day. These may not clear the psoriasis, but will help reduce itching and retain moisture in the skin. 4) Try using aloe vera gel, jojoba oil, vitamin E oil or natural vegetable oils as moisturizers. They are a natural and relatively inexpensive way to moisturize the skin. 5)  Take flaxseed oil or evening primrose oil according to directions on label. They supply essential fatty acids which are important for the skin and preventing dryness. 6) Take natural beta-carotene, 25,000 IU per day. It helps protect skin tissue. 7) Take zinc, preferably in the form of zinc gluconate lozenges..., for maximum absorption. Do not exceed 50 mg per day 8) Try shark cartilage. Take 1 gm per 15 lbs of body weight. Divide it into 3 doses a day. Shark cartilage has been known to stop the spread of psoriasis, but you will need to give it 2 to 3 months to see results. 9) Take vitamins A (10,000 IU daily) and E (400-1200 IU daily). 10)  Take Vitamin C (2,000 to 5,000 mg a day) in divided doses. It is necessary for immune system function and for formation of collagen and skin tissue. 11) Brush scales lightly with a loofah, then apply an alcohol-free extract of the herb goldenseal..., This will help reduce inflammation and swelling. 12)  Keep a record of your outbreaks. Psoriasis typically flares up and then improves. Write down what you were doing, eating, or what was going on in your life at the time of a flare-up. Triggers to flare-ups include stress, tension, illness, sunburn, certain drugs and alcohol. 13)  Decrease or eliminate red meat and dairy products. They contain arachidonic acid, a substance that can cause inflammation and, in turn, make your psoriasis lesions swollen and red..., Ok..good luck...,"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am having psoriasis , though very much reduced now after taking healthy diet and reducing my stress level by physical workout.

Over the years you might need something or  the other to maintain yourself.Initially you might require aggressive therapy. You have not mentioned your age and marital status ,kindly do so.

The result of combination of all this is excellent. Apart from this one should understand that there are certain aggravating factors also which one remember.

If you really want to see psoriasis cases cured by homeopathy visit us at  Here are some tips for you.. Wash your hands often. Hand washing is the number one recommended act to prevent the spread of any disease. Do not share towels, blankets, or pillowcases. This is a common method of transference for skin diseases. Treat wounds immediately. Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. When there is an itching area, do not rub it. Rubbing can aggravate developing skin infections. Use mild soaps and detergents. Or it is better to avoid soaps & detergent at all. Try to find out to what you are allergic and avoid those things as far If you are suffering from any skin disease, do not take any steroids or cortico-steroids as it will only supress your skin condition, which is very harmful and can lead to incurability of your skin disease. If you have any skin problem, then consult your Homeopathic Doctor & take proper Homeopathic treatment and get a complete safe & effective treatment. Skin diseases may be well-prevented by careful efforts. And all of these tips can help you achieve that.

Apparently it lasted about 15 seconds and I lost consciousness and bladder control falling to the floor (luckily only a short distance as I was sitting on a chair). Reportedly there was only a fluttering of my eyes and no jerking. I guess I had convulsions as an infant (once treated with Pheonobarb (sp?)), and then what I thought were random fainting episodes through out my childhood, teen and early adult years. I do not recall any since then 20+ years. I am on Soriataine for Psoriasis and no other medications and wonder if it maybe a \\"un-listed\\" side effect.

I only apply it when redness and itchiness occur. I have learned lately that using this type of medication which contains steroids may have serious side effects such as the effect on normal production of steroids in the body. What would that exactly mean? What are the symptoms in such cases? Does it have anything to do with metabolism or overweight issues?","Doctor":"Generally topical steroids side effects are present at the site where they are applied such as thinning of the skin, easy bruising, skin infection, etc. Topical steroids are likely to be absorbed through the skin into the body and cause side effects similar to oral steroids, especially if they are used continuously for long period on large areas of the body such as the back. You are right, it affect normal production of steroids in the body which is the function of the adrenal gland. Side effects would include increased risk of getting infection (takes place with very high doses), reduced calcium absorption through the gastrointestinal tract resulting in bone thinning and an increased risk of osteoporosis amongst others. It can suppress growth in children. Some of the more common side effects include changes in appearance, such as acne, development of a round or moon-shaped face and an increased appetite leading to weight gain. Steroids may also cause a redistribution of fat, leading to a swollen face and abdomen, but thin arms and legs. The side effects are usually reversed once the steroids are stopped on short term use."},{"Patient":"I had Azax 5oo day before yesterday along with crocin pain relief as ihad body aches since 4 days.Yesterday my body broke out in rashes which r filled with water. they r on my face , hair, stomach , back and thighs.Also they r itchy.After the rash i did not repeat the azax medicine. i am a female, 30 years.","Doctor":"Hi, According to your complaints it seems to chicken pox.

Didn't think much of that but then my left testicle started hurting, so I dealt with that for a day then it became both testicles that were sore. It wasn't too bad mainly bedtime where I couldn't get comfortable was where I noticed it the most. Next the tip of penis started hurting like a slight burning bit it was more so my actual urinary tract. Finally I went to emerg at like 2 am because I had just had enough. Showed him the rash which by then was almost gone. He said the rash was nothing at all. No discharge from penis so he ruled out STD which I was worried about because I read they can at times lay dormant for years and I've been faithfully married for 3. Anyways he poked around my testicles and had me cough and I said it wasn't feeling any more or less pain it was just a constant painful sensation. So he said it was some kind of infection and put me on antibiotics for 2 weeks. This is only my second day on them but nothing has changed the pain and tingling just seems to be moving. From both testicles to mainly my left testicle and left thigh now have the same feeling. I find it all to be extremely odd and troubling.

For elieve you can apply ointment Bactroban in the area affected. Take care of your personal hygiene, do not sgare your clothes or toiletries. Avoid sex while you are being treated.

It has not gone away and got a little bigger.  I'm concerned because when I was pregnant they saw a spot on the sonogram which they were concerned was spina bifida.  They did not see the same spot on a follow up and chalked it up to her position.  Should i be concerned?","Doctor":"HiI have gone through your query.A swelling over the back can be seen with spinal bifida. However, there may not always be a rash only over the area. Many children tend to have rash or bumps over the skin. This can happen when a child is wearing tight clothing. This can block sweat pores and cause the area to overheat. A few things that can help include wearing loose cotton clothing, staying in a ventilated room, and keeping the room breezy can help.In case the rash is persisting or increasing in size, getting a check up can help. A biopsy or an ultrasound over the area would be useful. Hope I have answered your query.

Im guessing its not contagious. Could it be caused by stress with my immune system messed up? I dont know what to do i been putting on ointment and aveeno anti itch lotion I'm worried that it wont go away!","Doctor":"Hi. I have looked through what you have written. An eczematous or dry scaly rash can be seen with fungal infection. This is known as tinea cruise. It is usually seen over the groin and may spread to the buttocks area as well. Tinea cruris aka Jock itch occurs when one wears tight clothing for long periods of time without showering. This can cause sweat to accumulate and provide a growth medium for the fungus. Treatment of this is with antifungal cream that a chemist would be able to suggest. Along with using an antifungal cream, drinking lots of water, wearing loose cotton clothing, and maintaining personal hygiene can help. A few ways to maintain personal hygiene are to shower a few times a day and to trim the hair around the groin.Hope I have answered your query.

Any redness / soreness around mouth? Rash in this area can be diaper rash, fungal infection, or a manifestation of zinc deficiency (acro-dermatitis). Since there was no history of loose stools, and no response to emollients(diaper rash creams), diaper rash is unlikely. Rarely, fungal infection (candidiasis) fails to respond to first line treatment, necessitating changing to another anti fungal ointment. For acro-dermatitis, a course of zinc will be useful.

So, do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also a semen analysis of your husband should be done.  If everything is fine, you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Loestrin only will not help.  Hope I have answered your question.

Applying cotton compresses saturated with drying solution such as Burow's solution to the skin folds for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day can also help the rash heal.Hope my answer was helpful.If you have further queries feel free to contact me again.Kind regards!

An hour later my gf went to the restroom.  When out I asked if there was urine on the sat.  She said she didn't experience any.  Is there any chance of her getting pregnant this way?","Doctor":"Hi , How are you doing ?That's not at all a stupid question !!To be frank there is a small chance for pregnancy. Sperms can stay alive for quite sometime outside the body. So it can be alive on the seat-cover. Sperms reach the egg by chemical attraction & not by physical means , so even if sperms come in contact with the thighs or the  genitals, they will find their way in !!.

If positive consult a doctor.  If negative, you can take some medicines for inducing periods.  In pcod, ovulation doesn't happen.  Thus, pregnancy doesn't occur and periods get delayed.

Let me first tell you that NEARLY EVERY PREGNANCY WILL HAVE PLACENTA IN THE LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT.Placenta is formed at 12 weeks of pregnancy. There is no much growth in placenta after that, only the baby grows, so also the uterus . In early pregnancy as the space in uterus is restricted, the placenta which is a sponge like discoid structure will have some part of it in the lower segment. As the baby grows , the uterus also grows & it will pull along with it the placenta up into the upper segment. This happens normally. It is a big blunder to advise a cesarean section for placental location based on scan in 20 weeks. Only placenta in patients with scar on uterus ( like Previous cesarean scar or removal of fibroids or any other scars will not allow the placenta to go up.Am sure next scan at around 30-32 weeks will show the placenta in upper segment. You can then have a normal vaginal deliveryDrink whatever juice you want, it will not affect the baby or placenta.Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"I am recovering from Guillain Barre. 6 months in hospital.

Met a gynecologist and she suggested ultrasound follicular study. But when ultrasound scan was done the dominant follicle was 26 mm on 17th day and so my doc was worried. Another ultrasound on 26th day showed ovulation had occured. But inbetween this cycle we had relations. And the next cycle actually was delayed by some 5 days which had never previously occured in my case. But unfortunately I got my periods some 5 days later. (As I get my periods regularly and get it exactly on the 29th or 30th day). But during that time i was really stressed and had a heavey workload. Does that mean may be i was about to concieve but something happend? Can you explain this? All the tests including TSH,FSH,Hb,Fasting sugar,prolactin and LH have been done and all the results are very normal. Only that the follicle doesnt ovulate in the normal size. So doctor advised for induced ovulation in the next cycle and i started taking fertyl from the 5th day of my cycle and continued till the 9th day. When an ultra sound was done on the 12th day, it revealed 2 big follicles one 33mm and the other 27 mm. The 33 mm one she categorised as cyst, but she told me to do an ultra sound the very next day to make sure if ovulation will occur or if the induced ovulation injection can be given. The next day the cyst measuring 33 mm had increased to 38 mm but ther was not much of a change in the 27 mm  follicle. So doctor advised me not to take the injection as it looked like some hyper-activity. And wait for another 2 cycles till this subsides. I am worried because of this cyst formation due to the induced ovulution drug that she administered. Will it be a serious problem in future? And is the cyst size of 27mm too large or ripe to even ovulate? should I get into some other medication, or wait and try for another 3 months?","Doctor":"Hi, the cysts is not much of a problem.  They resolve in 2 to 3 months. But I think in your case it is better to start the ultrasound from 2nd day of your periods.  It will tell exactly regarding the status of your follicles.  You can monitor your cycles every 2 to 3 days.  Don't take any medicines.  When follicles size reaches 18 to 20 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  It will make sure your follicles rupture at a normal size.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to  6 months.  Hope I have answered your question.

If you are getting one dominant follicle in each cycle more than 18 mm around day 12 to 14 , it is fine. You can become pregnant.  You should confirm that there is rupture of follicles also. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  Try like that for 6 months.  If it doesn't work then you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.

It started on my legs from what I noticed, and I thought they were just a few bug bites or maybe razor burn. But then over the next few days I began to noticed more and more itchy bumps on my arms and legs. On the front of my thighs, and tops of my forearms, back of my arms, and sides of my hips I began to get these little red clusters. They look like hives (urticaria from pictures online) now but don t go away. Some of the bumps have healed but I develop a few new ones almost every day. The rashes have not healed yet but do seem to be getting a little better. At first I panicked and thought we might have bed bugs but I ve searched my bed and surrounding furniture for them daily since the beginning of all this and have not found a single sign of them. I also share a bed with my husband, and our 3 children (4 years, 16 months, and 6 weeks old) most nights and I am the only one with these bumps and rashes. I went to the doctor and she told me that if she were just judging by the random bumps on my legs and arms that she would think they could possibly be bed bug bites, but with the huge rash up my entire right arm, and the small ones on the left arms, both thighs, and hips, that she was 99% positive it was not bug bites, and was some kind of allergic reation. She gave me a steroid shot and cream which seemed to help a little but certainly did not clear it up. A few days later we did a blood test and I just got the results back and I have a slight milk allergy and slight wheat allergy. My question is could one of these allergies be causing this rash? Can a slight wheat allergy cause the rash to take the form of bug bites in certain places of my body, and a very obvious rash in other places? If I only had the rash I would not be so concerned about bug bites, but on certain parts of my body (calves, knees, ankles, upper thighs, and arms where the rash has healed) I just have a few random itchy bumps here and there that pop up sometimes overnight and sometimes during the day. The only thing I can describe them as are bug bites, but they all are different sizes, and generally start out skin colored and not very noticeable until I scratch and then they turn red and stay red. Can a wheat allergy rash look like this? I m going crazy and at my whit s end because this is so itchy, and ugly/embarrassing.

I came out of the neck fusion fine, textbook recovery and doing well. However, with my back surgery I developed a really bad reaction to the surgical glue they used to glue the steri-strips (sp?) to hold my incision together. After a medrol dose pack I was fine, and felt very well at about 2-3 weeks post op. Then suddenly at about 4 weeks I developed a really bad itching with swelling in my hands and feet as well as huge hives, small welts and patches of rash all over my arms, neck, chest, tops of my feet, on my face and in my ears. At one point I ended up with a swelling and burning feeling on the left side of my tongue and left tonsil. My hands and feet would end up being painful in all the joints at the worst flare ups . I ended up going to the ER three times for various problems with this reaction and was told to take benadryl. After followup with my primary care he put me on hydroxyzine and another medrol dose pack. After finishing the dose pack I did really well for about 3-4 days and even got to where I didn t have to take anything for itching/hives. But then the rashes, itching and hives have slowly come back and gotten worse, I m now on another medrol dose pak and taking the hydroxyzine every 4-6 hours.

With diet and exercise, I have lost 16.5 pounds and my Insulin number has dropped back in the normal range.  However, In early October after traveling for about 6 hours by car, I noticed that I had developed a rash, that later was described as a Dr. as looking like petechiae or purpura along my abdomen.  The rash slowly fade away from a red color to a rust color.  Then almost as soon as my stomach would look clear, the rash would reappear.   Each time it gets worse and spreads. I had just finished a Z-pack for a sinus infection and two prescription eye drops for conjunctivitis.  My platelets were checked and were fine.  The rash now covers the front of my abdomen, parts of my arms, some on my stomach, under each arm pit, both legs, the tops of my feet and is now spreading onto the soles of my feet.  The rash began as flat, but as it spreads and reappears it has become slightly raised.  The rash on my abdomen is blotchy.  The rash on my legs and arms are small red, raised dots.  Last night they began burning whenever they were rubbed, such as my jeans moving while walking.  As I laid down to sleep, both legs began throbbing.  I elevated them with pillows and it seemed to help.  I have some joint pain in my ankles and knees that may or not be related.  I have also had headaches, but that could be related to the seasonal allergy/sinus junk. The endocrinologist was at a loss yesterday and suggested seeing a dermatologist.  However,  I can not get into a dermatologist here until February as they are all booked solid, and with the rate this rash is spreading and burning, I am at my wit's end.  I need help or relief.","Doctor":"Hello, Your symptoms seem to be related to an allergic reaction. I suggest using antihistamines such as Cetirizine.

The exact treatment varies based on the cause and the resistance to medication. It is possible that the complete removal of the spots has not occurred because the treatment has not been completed, is ineffective, or because there is some resistance to treatment. Another reason may be that the spots or rash is unrelated or a side effect of the medication that you were using. It would be a good idea to see a Dermatologist confirm if the spots are related to the older spots and if you are allergic to any of the medications that you were using. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It is very important to find out what exactly causing hives or what factor is responsible for their occurrence because treatment depends upon the causative factor. As such hives are harmless but when they start interfering in vital activities of life like breathing difficulty in your case then the condition becomes a kind of medical emergency. Apply ice packs to the body for itchiness and redness. So I would suggest you consult allergy specialist for proper diagnosis.

How long is the recovery period and how soon can I try to concieve after surgery?","Doctor":"Hi, How are you doing ?In your history only problem is your age. Something you cannot change. You can try for pregnancy anytime after the surgery of polyp & cyst removal.A lady is born with a fixed number of eggs, every month you throw out a fixed number of eggs. You ovulate only 400-450 times per month. Always the healthy eggs are selected for ovulation, So after each cycle, the crowd of healthy eggs is lesser than the previous period. By 35 yrs eggs are significantly depleted. Then by 40 yrs nearly all good eggs are gone. I won't disappoint you, am just giving you the facts.Highest age of pregnancy reported is 45 yrs, highest age of pregnancy I have got by treating is 41, she got twins. I just wanted to say chances is reduced not absent. So first have a Serum AMH level too find the number of eggs left in ovaries. This will only give the Quantity , not quality of eggs. Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is doneHusband- Semen analysis at least 2-  done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center ( examination done by andrologist), Blood sugarsWife - Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile Ultrasound scans to evaluate Uterus , Ovaries & adnexa          Confirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.           So check with HSG( Xray with dye), or SSG ( Scan with dye) or           LaparoscopyIf all this done & found normal , nothing can stop a pregnancy with God's will.Een if evrything is normal, I would suggest you to have IUI for 3 cycles, if negative go for IVF, as you are running out of timeNow if tests show that you have low or no eggs, you can opt for donor eggs. Here a donor ( just like blood donor ) is stimulated with injections & egs are taken out under scan guidance, she is free to go. Same day your husband's sperms are taken & injected into the egg, inlab. They form embryos which are frozen in your name. These embryos are kept into your uterus & you deliver as a normal pregnancy. You can have a second baby with the frozen embryo. There is no age limit, you can keep having babies as long as the embryos are  there Hope I have cleared your query, do writa back if any more queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"My 9 year old daughter has a rough red veiny rash that is tender to the touch on her collar bone and neck.

Scan report is not reassuring . Follicles reach up to 13 mm then they stop , typical of PCOD. If they don't grow , they will not rupture & so no chance of pregnancy.

Excessive body hair growth, hair fall , dark shade over lower half of face, acne , oily face skin, black skin over back of neck, inner thighs & under surface of breast. May have a family history of Diabetes, especially father or his family.This will not allow ovulation to occur at time & so you cannot get pregnant, till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution.Just delay pregnancy for few months. Your weight has to be Weight(in Kgs)= Height (in cms)-100eg- If height 160cms, 160-100= 60-65 kg is expected weight.Once you reduce weight to normal range, you won't need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant & pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight -NO FASTING, No junk food/ fast foods/ red meat, reduce snacks in between mealsHave low calories food, high proteinsRegular exercise, aerobics , yoga, brisk walkingtry to reduce 2-4 kgs / month. Don't hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce atleast 5 kgs , you will see changes.Even if you are in normal weight range , try this schedule, it will help.Once this hormonal imbalance is corrected, not only chances of pregnancy is increased, but also the chances of abortion is significantly reduced.

Take a bath & apply Ascabiol (Benzyl benzoate) all over the body except the eyes & the face, leave it for an hour & then take a bath. Repeat this after 15 days. Wash all your clothes with Dettol or Savlon. It is very contagious so it is recommended to treat any other member who stays with you with Ascabiol lotion to prevent spread  of infection.

If you have conceived once then you will conceive for sure again.( No matter what the end result of the pregnancy was)( Miscarriages are just like an accident, any lady can have it, but you have 97% chances of having a normal pregnancy).Now about the medication1.Tab.Letsi is a hormone pill which suppresses the body from producing it's own hormones, thus there is a sudden surge of follicles. So more follicles/ eggs means more chance of sperms meeting the egg.So pregnancy chances increase2. Tab Duphastone , is Progestrone hormone which prepares the uterine inner lining for the possible baby & give a good attachment to the uterus , preventing any bleeding & early abortionMay I advise you, Now you are blindly trying for the pregnancy, what if there is an undetected hindrance !!Kindly see if the following checklist of investigations is doneHusband- Semen analysis at least 2-  done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center ( examination done by andrologist), Blood sugarsWife - Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile Ultrasound scans to evaluate Uterus , Ovaries & adnexa          Confirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.             Being such a small opening tube can get blocked easily,            So check with HSG( Xray with dye), or SSG ( Scan with dye) or             LaparoscopyIf all this done & found normal , nothing can stop a pregnancy with God's willOnce all doubts are clear,When you try for pregnancy, start having sex daily or on alternate days once bleeding stops till Day 10 of periods, this is not for pregnancy, it is to throw out the older sperms. Then no sex for 3 days, now young sperms accumulate. Then from Day 13 have sex daily at least once for 5 days, later is optional. So now young & healthy sperms are more . Older the sperms pregnancy chances are low & such pregnancy has abortion rates tooHope I have clarified your query.We can only prepare the way to pregnancy, rest is left to God, so pray well.Do write back if any more queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"I am 38 years old and four months ago I got MMR Vaccination after that started having bumpy ,red rashes in my legs ,arm and back .

You can surely have at least babies more, because your uterus can withstand only up to 4 CS. In the 5th pregnancy, the wound may give way on it's own.There are two ways now1. Either have a tubal recanalisation done Laparoscopically or open method . Here the tubes are reopened & sutured to each other. Only problem is , as the embryo is formed in the tube, it may get stuck in the tube & end in tubal pregnancy. It may occur, but not always.2. Or have IVF. You will be stimulated with hormone injections, when they mature they will be taken out under scan guidance. Then in lab each of the egg is injected with your husband's sperm. This becomes the embryo. They are frozen & kept in lab. When your uterus inner lining is mature , the embryo is kept into the uterus. After the delivery of the baby, next embryo can be kept, so you can have babies till the embryos get over.Hope I have clarified your queries, do write back if any more queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"I have a rash that appeared on my arm a few days ago.

Your weight has to be Weight(in Kgs)= Height (in cms)-100Expected weight is 55-59 kgs.Once you reduce weight to normal range, you won't need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant & pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight -NO FASTING, No junk food/ fast foods/ red meat, reduce snacks in between mealsHave low calories food, high proteinsRegular exercise, aerobics , yoga, brisk walkingtry to reduce 2-4 kgs / month. Don't hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kgs , you will see changes, you will ovulate on timeThese medicines will do wonders only after correction. Now it's not that effective.

However I still have some personal concerns which I would like clarified about my menstruation. Having started my periods at the age of 13, I always seemed to have them at irregular intervals, and on getting consulted I was always told by the doctors to get my weight under control and was also prescribed with Primolut N and Glucophage to bring my periods to a regular pattern (although I have been on the medications on and off based on different doctors suggestions, and my periods continued to be irregular). Now 27 years of age and married, did manage to shed off some weight at the age of 22 which helped to a certain extent as I now have my periods once a month but the interval between periods still varies each time including the flow of periods. Just to give an idea on the frequency (or infrequency for that matter!), for instance:- February 2012: Period started 20th - ended 25th- March 2012: Period started 31st - ended April 6th- May 2012: Period started 19th... likewise its always been hap-hazzard and what also worries me is the flow. During a proper period I have a moderate flow, but it's as though if 2 times in a row I have a proper period the following month there will hardly be much bleeding...such that I don't even require a sanitary pad. Would this kind of infrequency, and blood flow affect my chances of conception in the near future? I have had an ultra sound test done, and test results show my uterus to be normal. Is there any cause for concern and should any precautions be taken, as I would like to start considering pregnancy soon? Would really appreciate a feedback on this...thanks.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking your question at healthcare magic. I understand your concern. Long term history of menstrual irregularities can affect the chances of getting pregnant and need to be evaluated.Since you had been prescribed Primulut N and glucophage before, I am thinking the first possibility for the irregularities in menstrual cycle as Polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS) ,which presents with multiple cysts in the ovaries.It can lead to anovulation/absent ovulation and lead to infertility. Maintaining a healthy weight is very important in treating PCOS.There rare also medications available for treating PCOS and helping ovulation.Other causes of irregular periods like thyroid disorders, prolactin levels also need to be checkedI recommend that you consult your doctor for further evaluation and approriate management Hope I was able to help youPlease feel free to address any more concerns Regards, Dr.Lekshmi"},{"Patient":"I have a rash that itches on my hands and lower arms and a few on my upper legs.

Later that night I had a bumpy rash behind my ears (I m have never had an allergic reaction in my 21 years of life, not even dermatitis allergies)...a couple days later I was feeling sick and spiked a fever, then I developed a rash all over my face, little red bumps. Soon in turned into a petechial rash, all across my face and neck. and some spots on my arms. I went to the ER and they took blood tests which showed my white blood cells were fine...and recommended me to a dermatologist thinking it was a contact derm problem. They said the petechial rash wouldn t have occurred from a derm rash that occurred from the oil based perfume. I also was itchy as if I had the chicken pocks. I have gotten the rash once again since then...not the petechial rash, but the little red bumps all over my face. It seems to happen when I take women s multi-vitamins.

Only way to confirm would be , have a urine pregnancy test on 2nd or 3rd day after your expected periods . If this is not conclusive have serum Beta HCG to diagnose even the smallest of pregnancy, any where in the body. Don't worry, once you have tubal pregnancy , risk of recurrent tubal pregnancy is higher than normal population ( 8 per 1000) , but need not always be. You can still have an intrauterine normal pregnancy. Just prey well , you will do well.
