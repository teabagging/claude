Inversion table? Thanks!","Doctor":"dear patient.A person with chronic neck pain may benefit from receiving a cortisone injection during the initial stages of their treatment.Cortisone works by reducing inflammation around a joint, nerve, or other structure, which helps with pain and can speed up recovery. It’s commonly used to treat pain in a variety of joints, including the knee, elbow, shoulder, hip, and lower back, and can also be used, in some situations, for neck pain.Cortisone is often injected as a mixture with a local anesthetic. The anesthetic allows for near immediate but temporary pain relief if the injection is successfully placed, while the cortisone allows for more gradual but longer-acting pain relief as it takes effect.Doctors use cortisone to treat neck pain by injecting the steroid directly into the site of the inflammation. If strained muscles are causing your neck pain, the cortisone will work to reduce swelling in those muscles. If neck pain is being caused by the inflammation of a pinched nerve, cortisone will reduce the swelling and relieve the pressure on the nerve."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, After 3 years of working in open space office under air conditioner, which blew air into my leg, I have terrible pain in the muscles and tendons.

Usually MRI scans pick up even minor amounts of disc herniations which will be present in almost everybody. It is mainly the disc herniations which impinge on the spinal cord or its nerve roots which can cause a problem. If there is a definite weakness your right leg and radiating pain associated with it that could be an indication for you to undergo surgery. From your report i would be worried about the L4-5 disc levels which is causing moderate stenosis of your lateral recess. Sometimes with stenosis another problem that can occur is a dull cramping pain that can occur on the affected leg. So kindly get your neurology evaluated if your symptoms persists and if you notice a definite decrease in your walking distance, radiating or cramping pain or weakness.Consult a spine surgeon. Also know that if at all you might need any operation, it is going to take care of your leg pain. Your back pain may or may not get relieved."},{"Patient":"MRI taken in Dec (two months after experiencing severe pain on left knee) shows undisplaced subchondral fracture of weight bearing portion of the lateral femoral condyle with surrounding bone marrow oedema. No visible swelling was there any time. It is 4 months since the pain started. Though general walking doesn t give pain; climbing up and down the steps generates pain. How long will it take to fully recover and heal the fracture? No surgery was performed.","Doctor":"Hi there. Subchondral fracture as such do not always require surgery and they tend to settle over a period of time. What one needs to mainly concerned about here is injury to the cartilage overlying the area where the subchondral fracture has occurred. This can cause pain similar to osteoarthritis. Since you're having pain on climbing stairs its most probably occurring in the patello-femoral region. The fracture would have probably subsided by now. If you are having this pain which is persistent and really limiting your daily activities, you should undergo an arthroscopic examination of the knee joint which can identify these areas of cartilage injury and therapeutic procedures can be performed in the same sittingif required. If the pain is not so bad you can try with conservative measures like losing weight doing physiotherapy like static quadriceps strengthening exercises and knee range of motion exercises."},{"Patient":"Thank you for your time sir, I have been diagnosed with multilevel moderate to severe degenerative spondylosis. 1mm at C3-4 and 2mm at C7-T1....I have had fusion and rods surgically implanted (obviously).

This pain is waking me up and noticing the loss of strength in my left arm. What are your thoughts? Again, thank you for your time. Michelle","Doctor":"Hi Michelle, Following surgery to the C spine, what you can develop after a period of time is called as adjacent segment disease or degeneration. What is means is that the cervical vertebrae are subjected to increase movements and following fusion surgery this places additional stress on the intervertebral discs above and below the fusion levels, the superior levels being more affected. This can lead to narrowing of the cervical canal and cause nerve root compression if its severe enough. So kindly get Cervical spine x rays done, get a neurological checkup done to see if you're having any sensorimotor deficits and consult a spine surgeon if these levels will require decompression and fusion as well."},{"Patient":"I have been having pain in lower abdominal region, not left or right, but a band across, for 4 days.

What could be causing this pain?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.It is possible that the diveticulitis have flared up, the part is in contact with the urinary bladder in the pelvis giving rise to pink urine - this may basically be cystitis giving hematuria. In such a situation where you know you had diveticuitis , the best way is to go for CT scan first to see if there is flare-up or not. Also go for the routine lab-work. Urine for routine, microscopy, culture and sensitivity.Cystourethroscopy will help to substantiate the diagnosis.

Hip pain in the young is definitely a cause of concern. If your daughter is in the age group of 12-14 years, the foremost problem that come to my mind and i would need to rule out if such a patient presented to my clinic would be a Slipped capital femoral epiphysis(SCFE) , where the growing end of the femur head separates or slips from the growth plate. This can lead to subsequent abnormalities in the hip and arthritis leading to an early joint replacement surgery if not treated on time.Girls can be affected even though it affects boys.It is more alarming if they are not able to bear weight on the affected side. Another problem which may present in the children is transient synovitis of the hip which needs a clinical examination and ultrasound examination as well.So i suggest you get X rays of her pelvis done with both hips and consult your doctor."},{"Patient":"I have had a dull pain under my right rib cage that comes and goes for over 6 months.

In 1986 I had my first primary hip replacement due to a car wreck. In 1994 I had my first hip revision on the same hip as the first did not take without cement. Second revision, same hip in 2004 on the acetabular. Over this 30 year period I ve lost much bone in my pelvis as well as the trochanter which is now unattached and drifting. Three nights ago I developed extreme pain in the subject hip and was taken by ambulance to the ER for examination. A large blood clot was found in the subject pelvis causing the pain and a lot of nervous fear on my behalf. Might you sense a relationship?","Doctor":"Hi there. Blood clots in the pelvis may need not necessarily be related to hip replacement. Since you have not disclosed your age, but have a 30 year history of undergoing surgical operations, i am assuming that your age might be more than 50. If you are not moving around too much as you have been having a lot of pelvic bone loss and drifting trochanter, you might be having a blood clot in the deep veins of the pelvis which can lead to pain. If on account of prior multiple surgeries done earlier or due to added medical illnesses you might be taking any anti-coagulation medicines , it might be due to bleeding inside the soft tissues. So i suggest that you get a venous ultrasound doppler examination done for your abdomen. Go through your medications with your doctor to see if you're taking any medicines such as warfarin or aspirin etc. Also get relevant blood investigations to see ig your bleeding parameters are normal or not."},{"Patient":"I was playing basketball and was sandwiched in between to other players I heard a popping of knuckle sound.

These injuries are a common occurrence while playing basketball. I would advice you to give it a rest for 3-4 days. Apply local analgesic creams and some ice packs to help with the recovery. Take tramadol 50 mg tablet if the pain is too much or unbearable.

It is unlikely that the tingling sensation is related to stress.It is more likely that he might have simply stepped over his foot in an awkward angle that could have compressed one of the nerves supplying the foot. I don't think that's any cause if worry. But if this sensation persists, then he might need to get himself checked for the same for any chronic nerve compression, diabetes related neuropathy or any back pathology related root compression.

Lots of issues... Right now, he had an upper endoscopy in April and found he has the disease where the esophagus reacts to food like it is allergic, so he is on spray steriod of a type twice a day. He has swallowing issues and parallel to that, twice in the last four years he has suddenly dropped weight... 40 pounds in three months, changing nothing about how how he eats, which is a lot. Now he is in his third bout and I see his appetite increasing. Plan to weigh him tomorrow and see if loss part has mysteriously stopped as it mysteriously started...and now, third time, he has been losing but has a big appetite. . He is 5 10 and was 225, now 194 with NOTHING changing about his eating. So yeah, thinking dumping as I know the whole swallowing to rectum can be effected by DM1. With the added autism, the habits are hard to change. I don t know whether to keep watching what he eats and he sneaks to fillin what I don t know... or call the family Dr. We moved two years ago from all the Drs he had been seeing and only has a family doctor here and one for sleep studies and now a GI we saw once.

Even though the diet remains the same or even increases in affected patients, they continue to lose weight. I suggest you get a stool examination done to look for enteric parasites or any signs of occult blood.  The GI disorder that you are talking about can also cause malabsorption of nutrients but the patients who are suffering from them show other symptoms of vitamin deficiency as well. Look for any signs of listlessness, lethargy, irritability or any skin or nail changes in that case.

(It now hurts a little when I try and turn it, it is not too bad when I walk but I am trying to use a cane not to put any stress). your advice?","Doctor":"Hi there. By the looks of it you have either sustained a ligament injury or a mensical tear, both these injuries occur due to a twisting force aaplied to the knee. The anterior cruciate ligament tear mainly occurs when you're tackled during a football match or making a turn while you're on a motorbike commonly.  Either way, the initial management is the same. RICE is a good way to do the acute management. Within a few days the swelling will settle down. avoid pitting weight over the affected limb for 2-3 days and as the swelling settles you'd find yourself to be able to do so without any difficulty. Having a knee brace is good as it gives some rest to the joints. Ask your physiotherapist to teach you static quadriceps exercises in the beggining and knee range of motion exercises and quadriceps strengthening exercises as you become better. This will take care of most of the minor injuries and tears. in case you have symptoms of locking, which means you'll have these episodes of not being able to extend a flexed knee and there will be a lot of pain, or instability while walking especially on uneven surfaces, that is when you will require an MRI for your knee joint and you will need to show your doctor. So keep up the good job, buy yourself a knee brace for 10 days and watch out for development of locking or instability of the joint. Do as much physio as possible. It is certainly a payoff."},{"Patient":"i have been in cronic pain since 1998 have had 14 surgeries 2 on back 7 on rt shoulder 3 on nose,cheeks and jaws. 1 on right leg.car accidents i also have high blood pressure.taking pain meds from pain management.had piece of bone taken of rt hip to fuse lower back the first time,now rt hip is killing me and blood pressure running around 240/220 or so.tried of being in pain i do not want to be in a haze just trying to be comfortable.lost my mom and my wife within 5 days.have lost over 45 lbs in a month and a half.any ideas?","Doctor":"Dear patient i am so sorry for your loss.Let me fist start by saying that a blood pressure of 240/220 is very dangerous and can lead to a haemorrhagic stroke.

So I shall try and explain the most likely and most dangerous ones and the rest I shall list under a broad heading while telling you what to do about those too.1) Angina: It results in a squeezing sort of a pain. My reason for mentioning it first is that is dangerous and easy to rule out. Just get an extra done and a troponin level done2) Breast cancer: Swollen lymphnodes can result in such pain which could either be due to an infection or the tumour has spread to your lymphnodes. Get a mammogram specially if there is a family history of Breast cancer3) Pleural pain or pleurisy: Inflammation of the membrane covering the lungs can result in such a type of pain. Get an x-ray and see if taking Ibuprofen 800mg helps. A Charleston of Pleural pain is increase in inspiration4) Neuropathy: Classically a shooting sort of pain which runs down the arm. it is due to the involvement of the brachial plexus and a nerve conduction test may rule it out5)Anxiety is often associated with underarm pain since it results to rapid heart rate, shaking, sweating and irritation; all which might cause underarm pain in some way i.e. rapid heart rate and shaking strain chest muscles and making them feel achy while sweating will cause irritation which can cause burning and itching (burning and itching can make your underarm painful.6)Local glandular infection: Stand infront of a mirror. Raise your arm and touch the armpit to look for any increase in temperature or any local tendernessDiscuss these with your Gp and come to a diagnosis and again I cannot stress enough that please rule out Angina and Breast cancerI hope this answers your question"},{"Patient":"My name is Adnan. In the last 3 years or so, I have been experiencing psychological and physiological symptoms which have started spontaneously as a result of suffering in the past, which lead me to undertake spiritual work. It all started with Eckhart Tolle and trying to not identify with the mind itself. As a result, my view of the world started to change. The symptoms used to include tingling and irritation in the body, pain moving from the legs up the body, and now after three years I experience extremely strong pressures in the body, in particular forehead, neck and stomach. These pressures move. This also often increases during meditation. That pressure moves around the body and eventually exists as shooting sharp pain through the legs and arms. Then I feel relieved. The pressure is now initiated by a single negative thought. I used to take medication for sleep before this started to happen and in the last 12 months I am not on any medication. I have been working with a life coach since April who is helping me get over certain blocked emotions. His approach is very spiritual. In the last 2-3 years I basically do not experience emotions as purely as I used to, they seem to be somehow converted to these pressures and pains as if they are supressed. Sometimes I am not able to sleep at all because of this pressures. They are there until I consciously identify the trigger or what I am not seeing in my subconscious mind. Once I identify the mind program, the pressure is relieved. Sometimes it is very difficult to consciously identify the underlying emotion that is masked by the intense pressure. My sleeping pattern has actually improved over the time I have been working with the life coach who was teaching me ‘letting go (Sedona method)’, ‘12 step program’ (although I was never an alcoholic) and ‘Course in Miracles’. They worked as I feel much better but the pressures also got much stronger and any conscious error I make, the pressures and shooting pains come up. Just would like to check if this qualifies for psychiatry or should I seek other kind of help? I am getting worried now that as I am going deeper into letting go of negative programs using the Sedona method, that these pains are getting stronger and they have started coming out of hands and feet. Is what I am experiencing documented anywhere, perhaps it is some kind of depression? Thank you.","Doctor":"I hope you are fine, I would suggest you to consult a psychiatrist along with your coach. the psychiatrist will advise you medicines to relax your brain as well as evaluate you for depression and personality disoder"},{"Patient":"I had torn my frenulum (frenulum breve) a few days ago. I have two small bumps that are at opposing sides of the tear that are really sensitive and stick out about .5-1cm.

I understand my options with frenuloplasty/circumcision, I just want to know if these bumps will heal on their own, and what the odds are that my banjo string or frenulum will heal and not tear again. Added info: The tear wasn t a major one, the bleeding had subsided in a few hours.","Doctor":"Dear patient thank you for the question.Here is my input regarding the 2 small bumps.1) Hematoma: a collection of blood on either side can result in bumpiness which is quite tender. Just like a bruise it resolves on its own and can be hastened my taking anti inflammatories like ibuprofen.2) Skin tags: The rupture can lead to skin tags which aretaken care of my the surgeon who merely excises them as they are useless pieces of skinEither way you have nothing to worry about and all the best for your surgery"},{"Patient":"hi there my father has an aortic stenosis condition...we knew about it.today he said he felt bit tight in the chest which happens from time to time,but only tonight i notice that his ankle especially the left one swells like i have never seen before.is this something serious, as in i need to find a doctor or bring him to the hospital or is this just come with the tightness and when the tightness goes away tomorrow the ankle will be back to normal?","Doctor":"Dear sir/maam, I must insist that you take your father to the ER for a 2d echo of the heart especially to see the ejection fraction.Ankle swelling is a sign of heart failure in patients of aortic stenosis and i cannot stress enough the need for him to go the hospital immediately.On top of that tightness in the chest is a classical angina pain which means the heart is overworked.THe ankle is swollen because the heart is not able to pump the blood as it is in failure and so the blood accumulates in the extremeties due to gravity. THis leads to an increase in interstitial fluid and causes ankle swelling or oedema in the medical term.I hope your father feels better"},{"Patient":"Ever since the age of 16 or 17, I ve had this lump deep beneath the surface of my skin. I have never had problems with it before. I could put pressure on it etc. Here recently, I have been having some discomfort in that particular spot.

It cannot be touched. the surface above this lump is white with a red ring around it. Today, the lump feels like its grown in width.

Let me just start off my saying that without a hands on examination of your lump it is next to impossible to tell you what exactly it might be.However i will try my best to point you in the right direction.Lipoma: The most common cause of solid lump it is quite possible that is a lipoma which has now become a liposarcoma and thus is red painful and expanding. A biopsy would confirm soCyst: A solid cyst filled with cheesy sebaceous material may have become infectedSwollen lymph node: Swollen lymph nodes are often caused by something as simple as a cold or the flu. In rare cases, the cause is something more serious, such as HIV or cancer.Malignant tumor: It’s possible that the lump under your skin is a cancerous tumor. Fortunately, the chances of this being the case are quite slim for most individuals, especially considering all the other possible causes of this condition.After having explained all the possibilities i feel it is either an infected cyst or a liposarcoma.

Here are a few causes of spontaneous bruising and some tips to help you figure out what you migh t have1) Blood disorder:a. Von willibrand's disease/ Haemophilia: A blood disorder due to lack of coagulation factors. It results in spontaneous bruising and is easy to rule by a simple blood test called COAGULATION PROFILE.b. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count can result in such symptoms. A coagulation profile will help diagnosing this condition as wellc. Leukemia: My intention is not to scare u but practically speaking it is a possibility especially if u feel fatigued and have bone pain or headaches.Please get a complete blood profile done2) Liver disorderMost of your coagulation factors come from your Liver hence a Liver disorder mostly cirrhosis can result in such symptoms. Get a LFT done. Yellowing of your eyes/jaundice may hint at a Liver disease however it is not a rule3) Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin C and b12 deficiency can result in bruising as well. The test is time consuming and expensive so just take a multivitamin tablet every day and see how u feel after 2 weeks4)Grace's disease: This is a thyroid disorder and may be accompanied by excessive sweating feeling hot increase appetite yet wt loss. A thyroid profile is warranted. More common in females5) Excessive medication/ Injury: If you are taking any medication please read the label to see if hematoma or bruising is a mentioned side effect.Also if you go to the gym or run a lot this can happenI strongly urge you to discuss this with your go and reach a diagnosis. in the meantime for your pain here is what you can do1) Ibuprofen 800mg twice a day2) Cold compression over the bruising3) Elevation of the leg while sitting downHope this helped."},{"Patient":"Completely unexpectedly, with no prior history, or obvious injury, I went to get out of my car and felt like my left ball of my foot had something stuck between foot and sandal.

I have pain when standing or walking for long periods of time, and i read that bow leg correction surgery would fix that issue. However, would the surgery lead to a height increase?","Doctor":"Dear patient,Thank your for your question. To answer the first part of your question here is a little summary of how the operation worksThe surgeon makes a small incision though the skin and a partial cut in the bone. After the leg has been straightened, the orthopedic surgeon applies an internal rod or an external device called an external fixator. The external fixator is like a scaffold outside of the leg. It helps straighten and support the leg through the healing process.Bowleg correction surgery takes about an hour in the operating room. Most patients spend the night in the hospital and go home the next morning. A cast is not necessary and patients are encouraged to walk and put weight on the leg almost immediately. Most people are able to walk without crutches and have little or no pain. Some patients with bowlegs report pain in the knee that typically disappears after surgeryTo answer the second part of your question Yes you definitely will increase in height at by a minimum of 1.5 inches I hope this helped"},{"Patient":"I have extreme bloating and pain in the left side of my stomach - this also hurts under the left bottom rib, my left side is extremely sore but the bloating is getting worse all the time, i can visibly see the left side is slightly bigger than the right.

The best test to diagnose it is by Carotid angiography although a simple examination might help2) Venous damage: Deep vein thrombosis or a venous ulcer. A venous Doppler can easily rule it out3) Local Trauma: Sometimes the simplest explanation is the best one. Your shoes may not be the best for your feet leading to repeated Trauma and ulceration. Change your shoes.Let me reiterate that first please show yourself to a doctor and make sure u rule out the first 2 possibilities before going to Trauma as a diagnosisIn the meantime I suggest cycling rather than joggingI hope this answers your question"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Grief Yes, Thank you . I have a number of issues going on simultaneously that could be contributing to this odd, relatively new symptom, so probably it is nothing to worry about, but i thought i would just ask... my muscles all over my body will cramp up and get completely stuck and almost deformed looking and feeling! I cant say that there is pain but it does not feel pleasant trying to contort them back in to place. I had a surgery in 2010 that resulted in a DVT and 16 large pulmonary emboli that I know did some damage to my left leg and one toe and does cause me some pain, but that really isnt where this muscle contorting is coming from. Also, I have Lyme disease and suffer tremendously with that... but again I have been dealing with it for almost 3 years so I feel this is a possible cause, but odd that it has started this late, but understandable, as Lyme disease is a hateful PAINFUL experience and horrible with its intensity and constant new and obsolete injustices! So, possibly this weird one as well?! The last thought I have that could be causing the muscle issue, is that i am taking a medicine for my severe migraines. It does cause tingling, so could this be interfering with my muscles all over my body and neck too? I would hate to stop a medicine that has been my first help for migraines since childhood. I would appreciate any feedback or helpful suggestions! Thank you for your time! Tracie","Doctor":"Dear Tracie thank you for the question. Let me start by saying how sorry I am that you have to suffer like this. To answer your question Yes it is quite possible that these sudden spasms and cramps you are having is due to Chronic Lyme disease or Post Treatment Lyme disease syndrome in which case a review of the current treatment you are taking is the only treatment.However I would be remiss if I did not tell you the following.1) Get an electrolyte panel done: In many cases due to various medications potassium levels may fall leading to such symptoms. U should get this test done asap2) Drink at least 6-8 litres of water a day to prevent dehydration3) The problem with migraine medication is that there are lots of options each with different side effects. Since you have not mentioned the medications you are taking I cannot guide you further but I will say this that even in such a case an electrolyte panel is necessary.4) Fibromyalgia: Go to your Gp and discuss with them the possibility of this condition. Let me reiterate by saying that in all probability it is Lyme's disease. Also be strong and do not give up Tracie. I'm sure you can get through this"},{"Patient":"I have mitochondrial and was advised to take 800mg in the morning and evening this is also taken in the morning with COQ10 600mg.

Thanks, Nick Farris","Doctor":"Thanks for your question Nick.To answer the first part of your questionThe outlook for people diagnosed with Paget's disease is generally good, particularly if treatment is given before major changes have occurred in the affected bones. Life expectancy is not altered and the chances of developing osteogenic sarcoma is less than 1 %. Also note that disease does not spread to normal bonesTo answer your second questionBone pain can require anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or pain-relieving medicines. Prior to undergoing surgery on bone affected by Paget's disease, it is helpful for doctors to treat patients with medications, such as bisphosphonates or calcitonin (Miacalcin), as this tends to diminish the risk of surgical complications, including bleedingBisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment for Paget's disease of boneLet me tell you Nick that I cannot inform the dosage over the Internet as tests have to be run specially your Liver profile to decide the dosage.Therefore I suggest you talk to your treating physician about the dosage of bisphosphonates and calcitoninI can however suggest Ibuprofen 800mg twice a day for your painI hope this helped.

However last night (May 4th) I had an enormous amount of discomfort, feeling like some of my joints are just on FIRE and the feeling of fatigue that is simply NOT normal for me with constant feel of sourness or just tenseness in my back/shoulder area . Yesterday (May 4th) we went out to eat and within seconds of our meal I had HUGE abdominal issues that had me in the restroom before we left the restaurant. Today I just feel feverish although not registering a fever but an over-all feeling of not being well. Are these symptoms of a tick bite... it seems a little fast for what I have learned in the past.","Doctor":"Dear patient these could definitely be due to a tick bite. Also please check if u have some sort of ulceration or blackening at the are of bite and if you notice an progressive rashes spreading from your trunk to your limbs or vice versa.These two will clinically confirm a tick bite .The diagnosis is made by PCR of the skin biopsy of the tick bite area.The treatment for a tick bite is a 7 day regimen of antibiotics specifically azithromycin or tetracycline.Also paracetamol 600mg 6th hourly or sos for fever.The type and dosage of antibiotics is to be prescribed by your GP after a detailed history specifically for allergies.Also tick bite can have some severe complications so it is imperative that you show it to your GP at the earliestA differential diagnosis could be Dengue fever.

The pain is constant and the toe is thick, has turned to the outside and it makes it difficult to wear anything other than wide/soft shoes. I walk a great at least 3 miles a day, play golf and am active. Is it likely that surgery will correct it enough that I will be able to wear normal shoes and resume physical activities?","Doctor":"Hi there. It looks like due to multiple fractures sustained by your previous toes previously it has not united into its proper position. You can opt for various corrective surgeries around the little toe at the level of the metatarsal bone or at the level of the joint to help correct the alignment and help you with wearing a shoe, and improve your walking. Arthroplasty involves removal of bone and will limit any future bony procedures that may be needed in case. The type of procedure required is mainly based on how your x ray appears and where exactly is the deformity. In order to reduce your pain, consider wearing footwear with soft soles and certain microcellulised rubber(MCR) footwear which has the property of reducing the excess pressure over the prominent bbony region.

Your symptoms are suggestive of muscle spasm. The main treatment required is taking adequate rest to relax these muscles. So try taking bed rest for couple of days. Avoid bending down or lifting heavy weights. Apply topical analgesic ointment over your back and some short wave diathermy under a physiotherpaist might help. This sort of pain can occur when your muscles have been getting fatigued over a long time. Also check your vitamin D levels as well. Low vitamin D levels can cause muscle cramps and spasms.

If youre an older individual, then  looks like you have age related degenerative arthritis of the knees and this episode of injury has flared it up because of which youre having pain. This can be controlled with analgesics itself. Once the pain subsides you should start doing some quadriceps and hamstring muscle strengthening exercises. Now if you are a young individual, the popping and locking sensation at the time of injury may suggest an ligament injury which you would need to get a further evaluation of if your symptoms persist even after 3-4 weeks. Until then analgesics and cold compress should do just fine. The pain will take time to subside.

An ultrasound is suggested4) Spinal: If pain is also felt in the arm along numbers or tingling or loss of sensation in the arm or even bowel or bladder loss of control it could be this. an MRI is suggested5) Others: If it is none of the above it could be the worsening of your ulcer leading to rupture and abdominal gas collection.

First off your doctor should have told why he said it was muscle wastage and what could have caused it. Since I do not exactly know where the indent is I have a few suggestions1) Hernia: This is a rare possibility but easy to rule out. Just strip below your waist and lie back with your head under a pillow so that u can see the dent. Put your hand on and around the dent and cough. If u feel a bulge it is probably a Hernia2) Neuromuscular disease: Conditions like multiple sclerosis and AlS present as patch muscular atrophy which can result in such an indent. It is why perhaps your doctor told you to comeback if it worsens. A head MRI for MS is recommended3) Normal: If you regularly exercise or walk or even use your right leg more this could result in an indent due to loss of fat in that area. In this case you have nothing to worry about.However since you do have dull pain I suspect sciatica with lumbar spondylosis in which case an MRI is required"},{"Patient":"Well me and my sister were playing and she kicked me really hard on the bottom of my right leg and its been at least 6 hours since that happened and now my leg pain spread to my foot all the way up to my knee and it hurts really bad when I walk or put pressure on the leg also my right feet looks a little bit swollen and pink but I did not get kicked in that area... What can it be ? A deep bruse ?","Doctor":"Thank you for the question. Yes a deep bruise is quite likely and rarely the collection of blood may impinge a superficial nerve causing pain to spread to the knee.However I have to say that as per protocol such trauma always warrants an x-ray or at least a general physical examination to look for crepitus or severe tenderness to rule out a fracture.Hence my suggestion is get an x-ray especially if the swelling has still not subsided"},{"Patient":"While playing tennis i damaged the vein in my middle finger near the firts joint.

First of all i hope your joint movement has returned to its full motion.

And my heels are really callesed. And I have just noticed that their are these tiny holes about the size of a lead pencil on my heels. And my feet stay red all the time. What is causing my feet to stay red all the time and what is causing the holes in my heels?","Doctor":"Callousness results in ridges in the feet which may appear as tiny holes sometimes. However if you are not satisfied with my explanation i suggest you show it to your dermatologist.Athletes foot is a fungal infection due to tinea pedis. 2 known causes of redness:1) Inflammation due to the worm. This is more for localized redness2) Vasodilation. This is related to inflammation as the body tries to fight infection by releasing protective cells from our blood stream to the affected tissue. For an increased number of cells the blood flow needs to increase which happens by vasodilation.

She is ok, but soon after the accident she started having hip pain. She was diagnosed with snapping hip six months later, but my question is is it possible that the accident would have been the main reason of her pain and diagnosis?","Doctor":"Snapping hip is a condition in which you feel a snapping sensation or hear a popping sound in your hip when you walk, get up from a chair, or swing your leg around.The snapping sensation occurs when a muscle or tendon (the strong tissue that connects muscle to bone) moves over a bony protrusion in your hip.Yes it is possible that the main reason is the car a it can lead to hip fractures as well.The diagnosis of snapping hip is seldom associated with pain and the diagnosis of a hip fracture is more common in accidents.However having said that i hope your doctor has done a thorough clinical examination along with an xray/ct scan to rule out a fracture.I hope i have answered your question"},{"Patient":"My husband has been having what he describes as a rightness around his chest.

This usually takes the form of a squishy pocket of fluid or drainage from the incision. If leakage is suspected, apply a pressure dressing over the incision and contact the surgeon immediately. If the leak continues, surgical repair may be necessary. New closure techniques and use of biologic glue greatly reduces the risk of CSF leak.The other explanation is that there is a risk of pseudomeningocele, an abnormal collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) under the tissues of the neck.

I do have a rash below my pannus (gastric bypass surgery one year ago, weight loss of 100+ lbs) and groin area. I can clearly feel the bump, so can my significant other, nothing on the left side. Any thoughts would be appreciated.  THank you.","Doctor":"Hi since you have a lump with pain--it could be a sprain or a bony swelling---it is best to get an x-ray taken to find out the cause--regards"},{"Patient":"I am 49 year old white female that has had a supra cervical abdominal hysterectomy 3 weeks ago.

What you have had is a bad soft tissue injury of the foot and ankle region. At your age the skin starts to become loose, so if there is an injury of the ligaments, muscles underneath the hematoma spreads towards all directions and this manifests itself as bruising with a black to blue color to begin with. As the days go by the bruising will subside and change color to green or yellow as the blood present in the hematoma gets broken down. The two main problems in your case is that you are a diabetic and have CHF as well. So please maintain a strict control over your sugars, take some bed rest for around 5 days. Keep your foot elevated over 2 pillows, apply crepe /compression bandaging to reduce the swelling and avoid putting weight on the affected foot to let the injured structures heal. At the end 5 days see how your problem is and whether it is still persisting. In that case get an x ray done and get yourself evaluated for the same."},{"Patient":"I am a 61 year old male.

My overall abdomen is soft and there are no lumps or irregularities that I can detect. I have a slight beer gut and was wondering of one side can naturally protrude more that the other with weight gain and age?","Doctor":"Hi there. With ageing what happens is that the general tone of your muscles start become less. That means that your muscles start to become more slack. This generally manifests itself as wrinkles on the face, loosening of the muscles over your arms and thighs etc. So the same process is happening to your abdominal muscles which basically results in people noticing that they have a paunch belly. So most likely this is what is happening with you. Since the area where the love handles are present is quite prominent, this makes it more noticeable when you are concerned. There is no need to worry about it."},{"Patient":"My friend twisted her ankle pretty badly. A day after the accident she has bruising in multiple places on her ankle and has severe pain especially when flexing or turning her foot a certain way. When she injured her ankle she reported that she heard a loud pop in her ankle. She has also now developed pitting edema in the injured ankle","Doctor":"Hi there. Looks like your friend has had a ligament injury to the ankle. The pop sound she's heard is suggestive of the same. For my patients, if the swelling was really bad to begin with, alongwith inability to bear weight on the affected lower limb, i would firstly put a plaster cast for 4 weeks for the ligaments to heal and then remove it and start them on ankle exercises. If her pain and edema/ swelling are not so bad then compression/crepe bandaging should be sufficient enough. Rest, elevation of the involved leg and ice pack application are the additional supportive measures. So for your friend whaat i would advise is that if she has had this injury few weeks ago she should take rest for 3-5 days, avoid putting weight on the lower limb involved, minimum ambulation only to the bathroom if need be, and ice pack application locally. If it does not subside within a week she should do x rays and get herself checked."},{"Patient":"I suspect I have a fractured 5th metatarsal from a fall.

It mainly does this when I bend my arm. I ve been told that I have a slight pinch in a nerve in my neck. Could this be a cause? I don t think so.","Doctor":"Hi there. It may sound difficult to believe it ,but the nerves which supply your forearms and hand, start at the level of spinal cord and on their way towards the forearm and hand regions which they supply, the course of these nerves pass through difference fascial and muscular planes that can make them susceptible to entrapment neuropathies. Its a group of conditions where a nerve gets compressed between a muscle and a bone, or between the fibers of a muscle that it pierces or passes through. Also, the compression can happen when the nerves are travelling around a blood vessel which can mechanically put pressure on them. Usually patients who would be having such a problem present with a dull aching pain over the arm and forearm. If it is not too severe and does not cause any neurological deficits then conservative management with Pregabalin and Vitamin B complex tablets, activity modifications and physiotherapy can be started which will provide relief. Avoid the activities which exaggerate your problem."},{"Patient":"my daughter had mono and an enlarged spleen. The mono was confirmed 11/24/13.

Mono has a 0.1-0.5% chance of causing a splenic rupture, so any sort of physical activity, and contact sports in particular should be avoided during the first three weeks. Following that, if there are no further symptoms of fever, and ultrasound shows that the spleen size has shrunken and reduced, patients may start gradual increase in the physical activities and return to contact sports after a period of time.

CTS mainly presents with dull aching pain over the wrist and hand, its more in the night and certain group of people- commonly diabetics, pregnant ladies, chronic alcoholics, patients suffering from thyroid disorders are the ones who are more susceptible to have this condition.The person suffering from CTS gets multiple pins and needles like sensations over the palm. What you could be having may either be a sign of a muscle fatigue of your thumb flexor muscles, or you could be having a trigger thumb, which are again both really benign problems and you need no worry about it. Drink plenty of water, give the involved limb some rest if its related to activity related fatigue and it should be alright."},{"Patient":"I had total knee replacement six weeks ago. Last week I was cleared to swim.six days after swim I work up with bloody yellow liguid pus I. O e tiny sectionpf survival site. I called Md and will be starting on antibodics today. I willserdr onmonday. Should I worryabout I fectipn","Doctor":"Hi there. You should be worried about pus discharge, especially if its coming from the area on or around the operated site. If you're having any operated site infection which is coming from the joint then that's bad news. But if you're having pus discharge from a site away from the operated site, then there is little cause for concern. The only thing i would be worried about in that case that the infection might spread from that site to the joint through bloodstream. So a course of antibiotics to control  the infection as soon as possible is a wise thing to do. Please go ahead with the checkup and keep the area of infection clean. Do simple and regular dressings if you have to.Post replacement surgeries one does need to be careful."},{"Patient":"What is best way to lower level of inflammation in one s body (elder), to combat knee osteoarthritis, and prevent subsequent damage to other organs and systems, ie. heart and brain especially. I always prefer natural solutions. Thanks so much for considering my question.","Doctor":"Hi there. Combating inflammation knee osteoarthritis in elderly can be tough, but not impossible. First of all you have to understand that osteoarthritis mainly arises due to normal degenerative processes that occur with ones ageing. So the best way to reduce inflammation and pain is to reduce the factors that cause them. The most important aspect of the treatment that i prescribe to my patients is physiotherapy. Not only does it strengthen the quadriceps muscles, which are important stabilizers of the knee joint, the physiotherapy is useful in terms rehabilitation following knee replacement, if at all it comes to that. Secondly if the muscles are strengthened the surface of the bones that rub against each other and cause pain in osteoarthritis are less prone to do so and the further rate of degeneration comes down. Analgesics can help control acute flares. But like you i prefer less of allopathic treatment for osteoarthritis and more of exercises. With their muscles becoming stronger they become more confident of ambulating around the house as well. I am not very certain of the extent natural remedies and alternative medicines can help.  And rest assured that inflammation arising in osteoarthritis is least likely to affect the heart and brain. There is no correlation. Some lifestyle changes like avoiding too much of climbing stairs or squatting can be avoided."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir For months on and of I have been having bad stomach cramps.

Where the flesh was bitten off..I've been hospitalised for a month and a half,wounds have closed completely in september,eversince I have been elevating my left foot,coz it used to swell a lot,its now december,my left foot is still so stiff,can hardly walk a distance,can't wear shoes and when I tickle the underneath of my foot it has that slight tingling rush.....what do you think is the problem and what should I do,it is very depressing with all the scars and the stressful part is that my foot doesn't work the way it supposed to......thank you your reply will be much appreciated....","Doctor":"Hi there. It does appear from your history that you have sustained a severe injury to the left ankle and foot region. Now the first thing that you have to understand is that the problem of recurrent swelling will be a persistent one and will only resolve so much. The overall blood supply over the foot and ankle is relatively poor, and further more the multiple scars which are present around the foot would make the venous and lymphatic drainage difficult. This would lead to fluid retention which should have ideally been pumped back so the result would appear as generalised swelling of the foot. The tingling sensation at the sole of the foot is probably due to a nerve injury that you would have sustained there. If i had a patient who'd present to me with such symptoms, i would prescribe a course of Pregabalin 75mg and B complex tablets for the nerve injury and advise using compression stockings for the foot. Do active and passive ankle range of movement exercises to reduce some of the stiffness that you might be experiencing now. Ask your physiotherapist to help you out for the same."},{"Patient":"hello ,sir i m 16 years old & my height is 5'2.& my weight is 70kgsir i m feeling very shame on myself my all friends are taller than me.sir i hved joint gym but that also not making any type of change.what should i do please sir give any solution to me.","Doctor":"Hi...Don't worry you have still lot of time to grow height...Growing height depends in Genetics...

The general treatment follows rest, ice, compression and elevation. Rest your leg over two pillows so that the swelling comes down.Take rest for 2-3 days if you can. Avoid letting it hang down as it can increase your swelling. Avoid putting any weight on it for the next 5 days to one week.  Apply ice packs over the ankle regularly. Do some minor exercises like moving your foot up and down, gentle ankle exercises to avoid stiffness. If the swelling is really bad, use crepe bandage. If its not a bad injury it should subside in a matter of a week.

Looks like your husband might take some time to recover. Post injury there is a tendency for the patients not to move their affected body parts and joints which results in joint stiffness. This can lead to restriction of their movements. He can continue ibuprofen, but you have to understand that painkillers act for a limited duration of time only. If you expect him to make a  good long term recovery then i suggest you start him on some gentle passive range of motion exercises for shoulders, elbows and knees.

It is on the top of the wrist on the left hand.  When the hand is straight it does not show as much.  When the hand is bent downward it pops up like a bubble.   Could it be related to carpal tunnel?  Or something else...","Doctor":"Hi, The most common problem leading to a hard knot over the back of the wrist is either a carpal boss, which is a hard swelling which forms at the junction of the wrist and hand bones. It is mainly related to common wear and tear processes occuring in the joint and very occasionally leads to any problems. Another possibility is a ganglion, which is an outpouching of extra lubricant fluid around the tendons crossing the wrist that can appear like this.It can be a cause of carpal tunnel, which is when it would be requiring surgery. But only if you have symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome such as tingling and pins and needles over the palm of your hand, wasting of t he muscles over the palm, weak finger grip is when it could be a likely cause for which you would need to seek treatment but otherwise it is again not a reason to worry as that is not a common occurence.So my suggestion would be to leave it unless it is causing pain or loss of function. Cosmetic problem alone is not enough to warrant removal.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I took Accutane twice. 2 separate courses of the drug about years ago for acne.

Twisting injury to the foot is not always a trivial issue. It can lead to some serious injuries of the ligaments between the foot bones that can lead to chronic pain. Generally foot and ankle injuries are treated with taking bed rest for a week, elevating the affected foot over two pillows, ice pack application and compression with a crepe bandage. Avoid putting weight on the foot to let the soft tissues heal. And after a week or so if it doesn't subside is when you would need a more formal evaluation. In such a case as yours, it might be worthwhile to get an x ray done and get it shown."},{"Patient":"FOOT PAIN! HELP! 17MaleSo a few days ago I woke up with a pain in my right foot, I didn't think it was much so I just went on with my day just dealing with it. Then, yesterday the pain got worse and I could barely walk, I was limping a little. This morning, I woke up at 4a.m. (2 hours before my alarm) with an unbearable pain. The pain is now going from my calf to my foot and on my foot there is a bump. I didn't play any sports, didn't do any running, so it couldn't have been from any of that. It just started after I woke up Sunday morning. Now I feel surges of pain at random times that make me want to cry because I can barely stand and I can't walk. What do you think this is?","Doctor":"Hello there. Surely your problem must be quite a disabling one. What you might be having is a plantar fascitis. This problem presents commonly as pain over the sole of the foot, particularly over the region oft he heel, more in the mornings and subsides over the day. The pain is quite unbearable sometimes and people find walking at the start of the day really difficult. Its also associated with another bony spur over the heel and associated inflammation of your achilles tendon.  Generally people with flat foot are more predisposed to have this problem. Personally i have this problem as well. Changing your footwear to something with a soft sole really helps, there is also a role of some physiotherapy which can help you. If it is really bad to start off with i generally prescribe my patients a course of Aceclofenac 100 mg. The footwear modification i tell my patients to get is made of MCR or microcellulised rubber footwear."},{"Patient":"I have pain in shoulder that radiates into right shoulder blade, armpit, down my arm into the palm of my hand. Previously had 2 cortizone injections over last 1.5 yrs. for rotator cuff inflammation.  Never pain in my armpit, forearm or hand though until now. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi there. Firstly rotator cuff pain is more localized to the region around the shoulder. What you might be having here would probably be a nerve compression. This can happen at the level of your spinal cord, vertebrae to the many nerves supplying your hand. So if a patient presented to me that's what i would be ruling out.Especially since you mentioned that your pain is radiating, that is why i would be suspecting this all the more. You need a checkup of your right upper limb muscles to see if there is any associated weakness or any sensory loss, and a spine evaluation as well. Its also more likely if you had any history of doing any strenous activity or trauma in the recent past. So i would suggest that you get yourself evaluated for the same."},{"Patient":"I crashed my lower leg into a metal beam about 4 weeks ago.  It hurt like heck, enough to be fractured,  but I ignored the injury and used my legs as I normally do.  A large, normally-flesh-colored lump about the size of a lemon remains, and is sore at times.  I assume it is a left over hematoma that will gradually dissipate.  Are there any concerns I should have about this? After how long should I be worried if it is not gone?","Doctor":"Hi there. Looks like your injury is taking a long time to recover. I would suggest you keep an eye on for the swelling to increase in size or become suddenly painful. There are instances where an underlying tumor of the bone manifest after an episode of trauma. So you need to watch out for the same. If it is a hematoma with a fracture associated with it that is getting neglected, you will find difficulty in weight bearing and walking on the affected leg and you will need to get an x ray of the involved region for the same and get treated appropriately."},{"Patient":"hi i have broken my big toe and it was put in a cast yesterday i have anxiety problems and when i got in bed i could no longer bear it being in the cast so i pulled it off is there anything else i can wear besides the cast like maybe just bandage it up","Doctor":"Hi there. What mainly directs the course of treatment is which toe is broken. Generally if there is no external injury of the toe which is communicating with the fracture then conservative management is done. If it is the big toe which is broken, then casting is necessary as a majority of your weight bearing is transmitted through the big toe.  If your fracture is not a bad one then you can put on a crepe bandage and see if that works for you, but i would still strongly suggest putting on a cast. Whichever mode of treatment you choose avoid putting any weight on the affected foot for a minimum of 6 weeks until the fracture unites. It might be worrying for someone who has not been put on a cast earlier, but with good care and following adequate precautions it is very safe."},{"Patient":"Good evening,I jarred my ankle getting off a bus three weeks ago and am still getting sharp pains after resting.

You need to rush to ER.Do not take anything orally.You have to go for :X-ray of the abdomen in the standing position and-Barium enema- as for diagnosis and many times it is the treatment on its own. The pressure of the barium can resolve the intussusception.Once the problem is sorted out temporarily, you have to undergo definite diagnosis by way of CT scan , colonoscopy and other investigation and the treatment then is well planned to remove the cause that caused this.

The pain you say starts in the abdomen - radiates to the back and then passes through your right hand.Occurs at 4-5 am - in the morning and sometimes in the day too. Choking and difficulty in breathing may not be related to this. I wouls advise ::A through check by an ENT and General / Gastro Surgeon and if necessary by a neurologist may help to get at a diagnosis. If all the examinations and clinical findings are negative , a help may be sought from a Psychiatrist too. Before this you can have a survey MRI of the whole spine."},{"Patient":"my name is fahad... sir i have a problem that my nose bone has bocme so fat for last 5 months... doctors suggestd me that surgery is the only solution... sir i m using sinus eaz drops suggested by our family homeo doctor... plz tell me can i get the shape of my nose same as it was before????","Doctor":"Hi i am Dr Ahmed Aly    thanks for using HealthcareMagic site ,I had gone through your question and understand your concerns ..

It resulted in a skin abrasion on the left side of my left legs shin bone. It s about 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. I also have a 3 inch scrap about an inch wide on the inside of my right knee. Both abrasions were really soar after it happened but I was able to finish the rest of the game and walk with a small limp the rest of the day. Sunday night was restless when it came to sleep but, nothing compared to Monday night. I had a relentless leg throb in both legs all night long. I slept a total of 45 mins. Last night I actually slept through the night while keeping the larger of the two abrasions outside out the blanket while I slept. They have both had a lot of heat coming off them ranging at a 7-8 on a 1 to 10 scale. They have both been oozing a clear to diluted yellow puss. My skin is hard and tight around the larger of the two abrasions and it s tender to the touch. I ve also had a fever on and off since this has happened Sunday afternoon. The most pain I feel from all of this though is when I attempt to walk. I ve been out of work all week because It s too painful to walk on my legs. I ve been on bed rest keeping my legs elevated on pillows. The only time I get off the bed is to use the restroom and shower. The moment I shift my legs to the edge of the bed and proceed to put my weight down on them to walk to the bathroom I feel an intolerable heart throb in my legs. I walk on my toes on my left leg and i brace myself on my right leg with a hop between leg shifts. I cry every time I shower and use the restroom because the pain is so intense. If I can hold onto something to keep a lot of the weight off of my legs It doesn t hurt as bad so, needless to say I ve been using a lot upper body strength to get around. I don t feel any pain when I lay in bed with my legs elevated but the pain grows intensely when I attempt to walk. I ve been taking Tylenol extra strength 500mg (1) before I got to sleep every night. The abrasions are developing scabs around the outsides but, the center is still a foggy yellow colored scab. What is the best pain killer to ingest? What is the best abrasion dressing to use? What is the best ointments for abrasions? I m a 23 year old female. Please help.","Doctor":"1) Tylenol is enough for abrasions, or you can take NSAIDs like Ibuprofen for pain relief2)As the wound is big it is bound to take some time to heal completely. The foggy part in the center is exudate and antibody collection that will help in healing. 3) Abrasions are best left uncovered for faster healing. I would suggest and antibiotic ointment like Soframycin to prevent wound infection4) I would also like to suggest getting an X ray done if not already done. Thank you.

He only took two pills in two days and became extremely ill (vomiting, sweating, fever, chills, tremors, twitching, and inability to sleep). He returns to the doctor in a month to have a follow up lab test. I am curious if this is indicative of cirrhosis.

I have had a hard time walking on it since Friday and it seems to be getting worse. I wore a orthopedic boot for a day that I had previously and it seemed to help.

Also raised BP on one side is also a reason for visit to the ER. Hope it turns out to be nothing. Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi! My name is Clairissa Silva from Portland Oregon. I have a very important question that seems to have a very elusive answer. I have spent hours online searching, but have not had any luck finding anything close. Before I drop this bomb on your fancy brain, let me paint the whole picture for you......I m a very physically active 36 year old with a high pain tolerance, lots of piercings, and is particularly stubborn about going to the doctor for ANYTHING....Oh... and I like to climb just about anything, but that temporarily got put on hold when I broke my ankle pretty bad in July 2012. I dismounted from a tree about 12 - 15 feet up and landed all my body weight on my right ankle which dislocated it. The talus bone was the force that snapped the ends of my tibia and fibula off during the dislocation process. (I didn t even know that it could do that!) When anyone shows up to the ER with a dislocation, the doctor on board is required to relocate the body part before the onset of inflammation occurs which makes task more difficult with every passing moment. When the time came for that nasty event to unfold, he preformed it without knocking my ass out first due to his observation that I appeared to be in little, or no pain. Because I was currently training my body, and mind to convert any consensual pain into pleasure, you could say that I was having an abnormally good time, and the doctor took that as a green light to make a mistake that later on would eventually bring me to where I am today. Long story longer... The unnecessary trauma, created a fracture blister, so when the foot specialist went to open me up and fix me, he couldn t until it had cleared up. My bones had already started to regenerate by the time he could cut me open to screw in the 2 initial plates, which threw off his placement. Instead of both of the bones reaching out to grow back together, the fibula was bolted down, and secured just a tiny bit too far away from the broken off bit to reach it sufficiently. He had to slice through the same incision, unscrew/remove the plate, create another incision to remove bone from my own heal, mix that with bone from a cadaver to make a putty to fill the gap, drill all new holes, and place a new plate. On top of hitting the reset button on healing time, I had to use a bone simulator machine daily, but the job was done right. I got to keep the old plate and screws, so I have a 1,300 piece of titanium jewelry in my collection which I wear around my neck. Everything healed perfect, except for the skin that covered the outer plate. It always seemed to be irritated to some degree. I could feel the screw heads pretty clearly, and trace the outline of both plates through my skin. Then in April 2013, while working full force as Farmboy landscaper, one of my employees accidentally hit me directly in the ankle with a shovel. The only thing between steel, and titanium, was that fragile skin. A few days later I looked down to see something shiny. Thank God that my actual bones have been long healed, and sealed up or else I could have been in trouble I m sure. I called the foot specialist to get his advice before making any appointments but he was on vacation, so I waited a bit. Metal attracts bacteria like crazy, so being extra cautious has been the norm. I have had a daily routine from the start which includes cleaning, sanitizing, and bandaging. The current amount of plate that you can actually see is significantly smaller than what was initially there. I was even instructed by my doctor to squeeze the skin around it together, then secure it with tape to encourage it to form together. There is virtualy no recorded cases, blogs, entries, pictures, medical forums, or info of any kind at the library/internet, so I m now starting to ask around to the web doc s to see what they can make of it. The 1 year anniversary of being visably bionic is coming up, and without any real issue.Trust me when I tell you that I have more than enough experience with how to deal with metal objects in, and through my body. I ve gotten close to getting critically infected from a handful of the various, and abundant amount of adornments that I ve acquired throughout the years, and had to do some major home remedies that saved the day. I was curious what my risk factors are for getting into some real trouble in the future if I just continue to treat my ankle bling like....well....ankle bling. Thanks for hearing me out! I have tons of pics as well if you are interested in checking them out. Thanks!

From your given history your swelling could be due to an old trauma , cardiac or renal problems .   If your edema is bilateral this is a sign of underlying systemic disease if cardiac output exceeds its output ( heart failure ) or your kidneys cannot wash or flush your venous system .in rare cases your medication may cause such symptoms if used for long periods .   You have to maintain leg elevation , avoid standing or bending your knees for along time and use hot foments with topical gels of anti-inflammatory .wearing compression stockings will be helpful to push up blood towards the heart and increase your venous return .  If you have not examined your arterial system by Doppler U/S you may need to check them up in very rare cases arterial system clots or atherosclerosis may occur and cause such edema.

In my opinion even when both parents have no seen genes they could have sons or daughters with brachydactyl , all genes consists of two parts sometimes parents have this kind of genes but do not show their properties this means that they have that gene in a weak form or medically called recessive genes which will only be seen in their offspring i think that is your case .   I do not want you to feel bad but that does not mean that your children will have that gene for sure , actually you could have perfectly normal offspring without any kind of abnormality , it is just said that the percentage of having it is higher than that of your patients .   If you have that gene and your wife does not this means your children are less liable to have it unless your genes are strong enough to be shown or dominant .  I hope you have good , healthy children and do not worry you having type A2 brachydactyl does not mean that all of your offspring will have it .

He has all ready had 5 tubal surgeries since a baby.  Recently he has had a CT Scan which showed opacification of the masoid air cells more prominent on the right side then left.  What does that mean?","Doctor":"Hi i am Dr Ahmed Aly    thanks for using HealthcareMagic site ,I had gone through your question and understand your concerns ..    I hope your son feels better soon and wont need any more surgical interventions .    From your given history your CT opacification of mastoid air cell means that these cells are inflamed with fluid or pus from his previoous mastooid infections and these cells are more prominent on his right side . this means that his air flow on the right side will be lower from that opposite side .   I think that means that your physician may prescribe antibiotics whether intravenous injections or syrup forms to decrease such inflammation and ear drops to help drain this cysts or inflamed cells .   In more severe cases or recurrent chronic mastitis your ear specialist may mention minor interventions like , small tube may be inserted into the middle ear to ventilate and prevent fluid from getting into the middle ear. Typically, the tube will fall out on its own after six to 12 months simultaneously without medications .    Follow up your results with a good specialist and try medical treatments first for 3 consecutive months and you son will feel better and avoid late treatment and diagnosis to decrease the need of any further interventions .

I'm also taking a low dosage of Prozac for depression and have been taking it for many years. How does the amitriptyline help with the pain or does it? I'm concerned with the two anti-depressants at once and have not read the usage of amitriptyline for nerve pain anywhere that I've done searches.Thanks pb","Doctor":"Hi i am Dr Ahmed Aly    thanks for using HealthareMagic site ,I had gone through your question and understand your concerns ..    Actually amitriptylene HCl is a type of antidepressant used for balancing chemicals in your brain . sometimes used as a painkiller or a sedating agent to help you sleep with patients having severe chronic pain .    You could not use it without your doctor prescription especially with Prozac as both antidepressants may cause severe side effects sometimes very dangerous or even fatal with increased doses .   In my opinion if you have a kind of neuropathic pain pregabalins or gabapentin will be more reliable  but you have to ask your trating doctor for best dosing if you are using any other medications for other health issues .   You may avoid heavy lifting , over weighing , vigorous movements , bad sleeping or sitting postures and high cholesterol or high protein and salty components and you will feel better soon .   For my patients i recommend painkillers like advil tab when needed , hot gentle massaging with topical gels of anti-inflammatory , B12 vitamin supplements , muscle relaxants will be effective for most of cases . steroid tabs or injection may be needed in more sever cases .   B12 supplements and pregabalin have best results with nerve pains , if pain persist i recommend some lab investigations like urine analysis , ASOT , Rheumatoid factor and X rays , MRI and follow them up with your physician for proper evaluation and management of the underlying causes of such nerve pain .

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your symptoms specially the feeling of fainting with abdominal pain and being sexually active, I would suggest you to see your family physician/ER of the nearest hospital for a clinical examination and related investigation like a CBC, a urine routine/microscopic/culture sensitivity test to rule out UTR, serum HCG estimation, and an ultrasound abdomen to rule out a unsuspected intrauterine/extrauterine pregnancy. All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% fool proof in protection against a pregnancy. And I would like you to report to your doctor at the earliest possible time to avoid any complication.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

A hairline fracture in the scalp can take up to six weeks for healing. You need to apply ice and avoid using any tight pillow or support for your head.  If there is any itching then you need to contact your skin specialist as this is not related to fracture. It can be due to hair oil or scalp oil.

I m a patient who has been living with Rheumatoid Arthritis for 20+ years.

Experiencing much pain; I just had x-rays of the right elbow taken waiting for results. Prior to taking the x-rays I asked the Rheumatologist for a cortisone shot but he insisted on getting results from the x-rays first. What information can you give me regarding this type of pain. I am currently taken Humira; took Enbrel in the past.","Doctor":"hello, I understand your concern over the issue. First of all you are RA positive( rheumatoid arthritis) for more than  20 years. Good that you are taking treatment for it from rheumatologist. RA is a slowly progressive autoimmune disease, hope your are taking medicines on time that your doctor has prescribed. Do not change or modify dosage or any medicine without asking your doctor. I hope you are doing routine blood tests advised by your doctor every 3-4 months and do follow ups. The medicines work to slow down the progression of the disease which damages joints.           For the elbow, looks like there is accumulation of fluid that is leading to swelling and pain. The pain and  and swelling shall be there for some time but it will reduce after treatment. So till then I would suggest you do as per your doctor says. As first need to see the extent of joint damage and other things before giving you cortisone shot. Because if there is need to take the fluid out and get it examined, then that should be done prior giving you the cortisone injection if it is needed.The medicines you are taking for RA, keep taking those  till you get the x-ray reports as your doctor advices. If the pain is extreme you can use pain killer spray for relief. Keep yourself active with slight exercising. And visit your doctor as soon as you get the results. After that your doctor will suggest you what next step to do.         Hope it helps. If any queries, feel free to contact. Stay healthy."},{"Patient":"Hello sir, I am 22 years old..

I think most probably you are having chondromalacia Patellae which is a disease of a knee joint with cartilage softening.

Sudden shivering can be due to two causes. First, it can be due to anxiety. Other causes can be due to the hormonal problem like excessive thyroxin hormone in the body.

Please tell me what's wrong.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, after a clinical examination of your abdomen I would advise you for a stool test for ova and cyst, followed by a per rectal examination to rule out a fissure to be the cause of burning feeling on defecation. I would also advise you for a sitz bath (sitting on a tub containing warm water for five minutes) three times a day to give you symptomatic relief and help in the healing of the fissure if one is present. In case of a fissure in ano, I would also advise you for an anti inflammatory, an antibiotic, and a stool softener. In case of any positive finding in the stool test, this could be treated as well.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

For now you may try elevation , compression stockings and hot massages with topical gel will be helpful for such cases .

No CT scan (radiation risk) But we asked about MRI, they deferred , What wold be your plan of action?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon. i am Dr Shareef answering you query. If all the investigations till now showed nothing, and the symptoms persist, then I would either go for a MRI or a diagnostic laparoscopy which could visualise the pathology, and perform an appendicectomy. There might not be much harm in taking out a normal appendix, but much harm might be done on leaving a diseased appendix. However, decision would be of the treating doctor, who already has examined the child clinically as appendicitis is more of a clinical diagnosis than a investigative diagnosis.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query. It is usual to have some pain during the periods in the initial years. However, if it is much in intensity as stated by you, I would advise you to get your self clinically assessed by a gynaecologist, who might advise you with some anti inflammatory and hormonal therapy for some time, and might advise for an ultrasound of abdomen if need be. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

Any clue if I need to see a doctor or is this most likely an inflamed muscle?","Doctor":"Sharp pain in lower pelvic region can arise due to several causes. In women, mostly a pathology associated with genitourinary system is the cause. But considering your symptoms, the pain looks to be arising due to a local nerve impingement arising due to some muscle spasm, not an inflammation. You need to see a doctor expert in pain management, such as a Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Physician or an Anaesthesist. Some muscle relaxants and proper stretches can help you overcome the pain."},{"Patient":"Hi, I recently slipped on the ice and fell on my back. i have a sharp pain in both the left side of my chest and the left side of my upper back (shoulder area). it hurts more when i breath or move in certain positions. i cannot sleep on my left side, and trying to move in bed or get in/out of bed is very painful. does this sound more like a muscle tear or a break?","Doctor":"Considering your symptoms, and comparing it with the patients coming with such symptoms, it is sure that the disease is related to shoulder. Most of the people are afraid of it as a heart condition, but you have suspected it on the right track. It might be a rotator cuff tendinitis or an impingement syndrome of the affected shoulder, but it might not be a muscle tear or back. It can heal with help of NSAIDs and specific exercises, but sometimes a subacromial injection is necessary to relieve the symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hai sir, my son 18 years old lives in India suffering with low back pain & right leg nerve and also foot.

It might be an incidental finding which is usual because of the degenerative changes suffered in older ages. The pain might be due to Piriformis syndrome which causes the pain in leg at rest, although a complete clinical examination is essential. You can consult a PMR physician. Meanwhile:1.

Taking a warm bath, massaging your legs, and applying warm or cool packs can all be useful in calming RLS. Stretching, followed by exercise at a moderate level on a regular basis, and establishing good sleep habits can also make a difference. Caffeine, alcohol and tobacco may trigger RLS symptoms or make them worse. Try cutting back on these substances to see whether that decreases your symptoms.  Your diet may have an effect on RLS. Research shows that too little iron in your diet can contribute to restless legs syndrome. If your doctor suspects this may be the case for you, he or she will likely check your blood-iron level. If it is low, eating more iron-rich foods can help. Examples include red meat, dark green leafy vegetables, beans and iron-fortified breads, cereals and pastas. Your doctor might also recommend you take an iron supplement. If lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may prescribe medication to reduce leg restlessness. they include several that affect a chemical in your brain called dopamine. Dopamine’s job is to send messages from your brain to your body that control muscle movement. to insufficient activity of dopamine in the nervous system.  Oral iron is helpful but take care of certain medications used to treat pain conditions . Use of dopamine agonist drugs, such as ropinirole, pramipexole or rotigotine, may be considered when oral iron and gabapentin have not proven effective.Be aware that certain medications , including over-the-counter sleep aids that contain diphenhydramine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and anti-nausea drugs.

It only hurts when I walk for a long time in slippers. I know it has something to do with the bump because I never used to get foot pains on the side of my foot until the incident.What should I do? Is this bump permanent? Is my foot bone deformed? Do I need surgery for this? Can massaging the side of my foot help or worsen the situation?:O?

In my opinion yes i think its the cause of your severe leg cramps but indirectly as alot of studies say that it decreases the bone density and thus alters serum calcium and other minerals  .   For now i suggest some lab investigation to diagnose mineral level in blood for proper evaluation and management , However, estrogen use appeared to negate the adverse effects of thyroid hormone on bone mineral density.

Sometimes early treatment and diagnosis are life saving and doing it earlier is better than doing it after going in an ambulance when no other choices you have soo i suggest you take more than one neurologist opinion for doing a surgery and if you needed it i recommend you go for it and dont worry nowadays surgeons are more developed and such operations are done daily .

I also have scoliosis - the last time I checked the degree (about 3 years ago), it was at 19. My query is - I ve recently in the last few months noticed a small bony lump just at the top of my butt crack, but more to one side than in the center. It doesn t usually give me much pain, except for in rare situations when I may be sitting/lying on it. When I am conscious of it however, it does hurt slightly when I rub my finger on it. Should I be concerned about this? Thank you :)","Doctor":"Hello,It may be a simple cyst, but it would be best to have a doctor look at this. If it is a simple sebaceous cyst then it can be removed in the office.

My family physician is not keen on this and pharmacist says it is hard on organs. I am perplexed. I take a 1 a day vitamin and one a week an osteo pill.

The diclofenac is an anti-iflammatory medication like advil and can be hard on the kidneys. It really depends upon the amount of pain that you are in. If you are in enough pain to require an anti-inflammatory every day, this is not a bad choice since it will not cause an ulcer. If you are not in too much pain then I would avoid it.Regards"},{"Patient":"For the past two and a half days I have experienced on-going pain and discomfort along the clavicle area.

I recommend using ranitidine before meals which may help some say olive oil, milk, yogurt helps with gastric acidity also malox sachets now are available.

Other reason is tear of rotator cuff, patellar tendonitis, back sprains and strains, herniated disc.Do some stretching before weight lifting.

Treatment of the underlying cause of the compression is needed in cases of epidural abscess, epidural tumors, and cauda equina syndrome.

My wrist on the thumb side of my dominant right hand started bothering me about 8-12 months ago. I work with a computer and phone and write a lot. I use a wrist foam pad in front of my keyboard and tried using a device with the mouse for keeping the hand in the right position, but that didn t seem to make a difference. So, I trained myself to use the mouse with my left hand and write with my right hand. It seemed to help for awhile. But the pain gradually returned and worsened. Writing and using the keyboard with my right hand was causing some pain, swelling and partial numbness in the right wrist an inch or so below the thumb. My forearm would ache. Then I noticed the right shoulder aching. I could not move my elbow out away from my body without a lot of pain. I could not sleep on it at night. Then my right arm began aching also. I went to my primary care physician and she put me on Mobic. Later, while driving, I started noticing tingling in my LEFT hand on and off. Both shoulders were bothering me and tightness in my neck. Then I worked late for a couple of times. In the middle of the night, my left hand was burning ON FIRE. It was tight and somewhat swollen. It started with the little and ring finger and gradually moved to the middle finger, then index finder. I held it in cold water and the pain was tolerable. I slept a couple of hours and woke up with it burning again. The left hand has improved in the same order, finishing with the index finger., but it is a little weaker, but getting better. Both hands tire easily and sometimes tingle, like if I text for awhile, though the pain is better.","Doctor":"Hi,Do hot and cold therapy (do take a bowl of lukewarm water and another of cold water, dip your hand  in hot water for three mins then dip in cold water for one mins.

IN general anesthesia, vomiting, late coming out of anesthesia, giddiness due to drug-effects ; all are reversible and negligible now-a-days. The difference has been possible due to various reason:*Better anesthesia*Better techniques- now Laparoscopy and Robotic surgery has made it possible to have very small incisions in millimeters and the recovery is fast. Patient can walk on the same day or the nest day and goes home on 2nd or 3 rd day.* These techniques also are almost bloodless. The blood loss is very minimal* least tissue trauma, so fast recovery , almost no post-operative pain.* better Medicines for pain management, better antibiotics.*Training = Due to the advent of internet, the world is one, A Doctor can get training sitting at his home / hospital. He can attend seminars and workshops all over the world and learn the most advanced techniques.

At first, the pain would shoot down my leg from the hip to just below my knee. Nowadays, the pain only occurs in one spot on the outside of my leg about 3 inches above my ankle. Years ago, I was dating a chiropractor and she was convinced that I was pinching my sciatic nerve in the Piriformis. I would stretch and pay attention to my movements and the pain occurred sporadically. It didn't matter what position I was in. It would hit randomly and feel like I was being stabbed in the leg with a knife or needle. I would go months without an episode. But when it hit, it takes me down literally. The pain is so severe, that I would drop to the floor. Now, in recent weeks I've been experiencing this shooting pain, along with another symptom. I awoke one morning about two weeks ago and I could not touch my lower leg without searing pain. Its very similar to the stabbing pain, but I'm able to trigger it by just touching my skin. It must be nerve related. There is a slight lump in my leg (3\\" above my ankle, on the outside of leg). This lump is so tender to touch. It sends a lightning bolt pain through my leg. My touch, running water, and even the sheets on my bed are enough to trigger it. It's so darn painful. So I spent a few days doing absolutely nothing. I lay flat on my back a lot, applying ice packs to my lower back and buttock area. I awoke one morning and that localized pain was gone. However, I began to get that stabbing pain again (identical to the shooting pains I'm used to experiencing). Just a few days ago, I just lost hope in being able to heal myself. I went to a neurologist who performed an EMG test, MRI and Xray on my leg. I am currently awaiting the results. The reason I'm posting is to see if anybody has come across symptoms like this. Can this be a herniated disc? Yes, I do experience lower back pain. But this is more of a gnawing, dull achy pain. I've been experiencing this for years, and have just learned to live with it. Lately, I'm feeling a gnawing, dull pain in my left buttock area too. Again, these pains are nothing compared to that shooting/stabbing pain in my lower leg. I sit here and wonder when the next shooting pain will occur. It could be days, or hours. I just can't stand this random appearance of this pain. It's taken such a toll on my life. If I can't find relief, I'd consider ending it all. I can't live with this pain anymore. Just imagine some little troll following you around all day and sporadically sticks you with a burning hot knife. The pain is so intense, I choke up a bit, and hold back the tears. I'm done with this. I must find relief or just check out, period. I hate to talk in such a morbid way, but I'm at the end of my rope here. I anxiously await the test results. Now, I ask you pro's out there....could this just be an extreme case of Piriformis Syndrome? Could I have a bulging or herniated disc? Could it be both? I want to do Yoga and isolated stretching exercises, but I can't. The pain hits when I try. And they say stretching that causes pain, should be stopped asap. I take NSAIDs, but they don't curb the stabbing pain. They may reduce the number of episodes I get, but the actual pain does not diminish. Please, anybody who may have heard of such symptoms respond. I'll give it another few weeks. If I can't get relief, I'm outta here. See ya on the other side.","Doctor":"Hi,I understand your pain that's really bad and hurting you. You need to relax a bit. Your pain is treatable. There are many causes:- Herniated disc- Pyriformis syndrome- Obstruction of sciatic nerve elsewhere in back of thigh like a tight hamstring Also there are chances that you have all the above as all are interlinked If pyriformis stretching is not possible you can release it by massaging on your buttock with a rolling pin (Pilates). Also hot packs will help in better relaxation especially when you have pain. It won't be possible for you to do all yoga poses, but I suppose pranayam, vajrasan, dhanurasan are some of them which will be helpful. Avoid bending from your back. Walking, cycling and swimming will be helpful activities for back pain. It will be good if you consult physiotherapist. Hope this helps you. Let me know if I can assist you further.

This has been going on for almost 3 yrs now. had xrays, CT, MRI, and ruled out ultrasound for gallbladder problems, even thou there were some stones was told it wasnt causing the problem. physio said they cant do anything this coming from two different physio clinics. massages dont do anything. on celebrex now and it doesnt do anything for the pain as did nothing else before. was suppose to get a cortizone shot by a surgeon but he did not feel comfortable about doing it as he said he could hit my lung as it is difficult to to get behind the shoulder blade.","Doctor":"Hi,In my opinion you may try the cortisone injections which I will think will progress your mobility and decrease inflammation around the joint, muscle origins and nerve but usually in cases like you recurrence is common. So I would recommend a neurosurgeon for minor endoscopic intervention or even a spinal surgery could be effective. Discectomy (the partial removal of a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments.

Advil tablets, muscle relaxants like Thiochochicoside is highly recommended in such cases. Scoliosis typically progresses with time, so your doctor might suggest scoliosis surgery to reduce the severity of the spinal curve and to prevent it from getting worse. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is called spinal fusion.In spinal fusion, surgeons connect two or more of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) together, so they can't move independently. Pieces of bone or a bone-like material are placed between the vertebrae. Metal rods, hooks, screws or wires typically hold that part of the spine straight and still while the old and new bone material fuses together.

Since you are responding well to prednisone, there is no need in change of medication. However you need to follow some ergonomic advice. Avoid extension, pronation and wrist flexion to prevent repeated injury. Take cold packs on your elbow to minimize inflammation. For the inability to move the thumb and index finger, you can slowly start with moving them with your other hand and as the irritation of the nerve subsides,slowly you will regain the strength (try doing this with your elbow flexed, forearm supinated and wrist extended).

To help with acute attacks, your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce the swelling and relieve the pain. You may not be able to take NSAIDs if:- you are taking blood thinning medication, such as warfarin (Coumadin)- you have poor kidney function- you have a history of stomach ulcersTo help reduce the risk of additional flare-ups, your doctor may prescribe low doses of colchicine (Colcrys) or NSAIDs (which is a lot cheaper). Other medication treatments include:  hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil, Quineprox), Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), Interleukin 1 beta-antagonist (Anakinra).If your joints are wearing out, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace them.

It hurts to straighten it out and when I do stretch my elbow it stops at angle. I can't fully flatten out my arm. Also it makes a loud popping sound. What is causing this and what's wrong with my elbow??","Doctor":"Hi,There are two possible causes of elbow pain. First is osteoarthritis and second is any previous injury. In both these cases there is a loose fragment inside the joint which gets stuck in the joint while moving and this is a reason you get this popping sound. This can be confirmed under an x-ray. Application of hot packs and elbow strengthening exercises will help you to relieve pain to some extent and if the pain is uncontrollable and the presence of a Loose body is confirmed on X-RAY minor operation needs to be done.There are no medications present that will give permanent relief from this pain.Hope I have answered your query.

Any ligament sprain or strain needs 3 weeks to heal so till then you can't play soccer. Also try avoiding weight bearing on your ankle as this will relay the healing process.Continue taking hot packs, this will help in pain relief. Since pain is bearable no need to take any painkillers.

Pain is from the crease between the upper arm and forearm down a few inches. no pain on either inside or outside of elbow.

When I woke up this morning I had a large bruise running up and down my inner arm centered around elbow but still no elbow pain. The area at the center of the forearm close to the elbow is tender when pressed, there is no pain when the arm is relaxed or when fully curled to the should but gets progressively worse as I straighten the arm.","Doctor":"Hi,In my opinion this is a type of tendonitis which when come from inner side of elbows from your given history it is named Golfers elbow. Golfer's elbow is a condition that causes pain where the tendons of your forearm muscles attach to the bony bump on the inside of your elbow. The pain might spread into your forearm and wrist. Golfer's elbow is similar to tennis elbow, which occurs on the outside of the elbow. It's not limited to golfers. Tennis players and others who repeatedly use their wrists or clench their fingers also can develop golfer's elbow. The pain of golfer's elbow doesn't have to keep you off the course or away from your favorite activities. Rest and appropriate treatment can get you back into the swing of things. Also known as medial epicondylitis, is caused by damage to the muscles and tendons that control your wrist and fingers. The damage is typically related to excess or repeated stress — especially forceful wrist and finger motions. Improper lifting, throwing or hitting, as well as too little warm-up or poor conditioning, also can contribute to golfer's elbow, common with (tennis players, golf, racket, throwing sports, weight lifting).

What is/ can be the cause of this??","Doctor":"Hi,In my opinion it is a sort of neurovascular injury of your median nerve or neurovascular comrpession of cervical spinal nerves. Your symptoms is showing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome which is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In more than half of cases both sides are affected.Risk factors include obesity, repetitive wrist work, pregnancy, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. It is unclear if diabetes plays a role. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. Types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools, and work that requires a strong grip. Diagnosis is suspected based on signs, symptoms, and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. If muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present, the diagnosis is likely.Being physically active can decrease the risk of developing CTS. Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. Taking NSAIDs or gabapentin does not appear to be useful. Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options. Further splinting after surgery is not needed. Evidence does not support magnet therapy. Hope the above information helps you.

I can t open them as if they are paralyzed (looks like I have Dupuytren s Contracture) and when the carsickness is going away, my hands shake so bad and my fingers tremble uncontrollably. Is the hand paralysis normal for severe carsickness?","Doctor":"Hi,In my opinion that could be only over stress of muscles that is cured by relaxation, muscle relaxants, and physiotherapy. But if it is Dupuytren Contracture, it typically progresses slowly, over years. The condition usually begins as a thickening of the skin on the palm of your hand. As it progresses, the skin on your palm might appear puckered or dimpled. A firm lump of tissue can form on your palm. This lump might be sensitive to the touch but usually isn't painful. In later stages of Dupuytren's contracture, cords of tissue form under the skin on your palm and can extend up to your fingers. As these cords tighten, your fingers might be pulled toward your palm, sometimes severely.The ring finger and pinky are most commonly affected, though the middle finger also can be involved. Only rarely are the thumb and index finger affected. Dupuytren's contracture can occur in both hands, though one hand is usually affected more severely.The main or exact cause are still under researches till now. So I would recommend relaxing your driving hand and take some muscle relaxants with specific physiotherapy. That would be the best choice for you.Hope the above information helps.

Any injury to the neck like ligaments and muscle injury called sprain or strain leads to pain and stiffness over neck. A stiff and painful neck may be treated within a days but firstly we will have to rule out that there is only muscle strain or sprain or any fracture? If the stiffness of neck doesn't subside within a week it needs medical treatment.But some treatments are:- REST - Take rest for one or two days so that the injured tissues of neck could be heal, which in turn will help to relieve the pain and stiffness of neck.- STRETCHING - The stretching will help to ease the stiffness and restore the movements of neck.- MEDICATIONS some medicines like ibuprofen and naproxen which are NSAIDS can be a first line treatment of neck stiffness and pain.- HOT AND COLD FOMENTATION - Cold therapy or ice packs can help to relieve neck stiffness .

Pain attacks or stiffness occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement.Doctors aren't sure why this happens to some people, although it's more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture. In my opinion physiotherapy, yoga, hot fommentations with topical gels is helpful, advil, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, rest  is recommended it may take sometime. In some cases if persists you may ask your physician for imaging and physical examination for the best evaluation for proper x-rays, MRI, other investigations like RBS, urine analysis, SUA, RH factor, and ASOT titre.

Unless there isn't a cyst or an abscess under your toe or your skin. I don't think you have to worry about it. Try bandaging your toe properly after applying topical anti-fungal or antibiotic ointments (nowadays there are oints that have both with addition of steroid). Avoid moisture, keep your toe dry clean and dressing it with bandaging and oints twice a day for 3 to 4 days would be enough. If it persists for more than a week I would recommend a dermatologist.

She hurt her left lower back around the SI joint area. It was 10 days ago. X-ray taken next day, found no acute fracture and no dislocation in sacrum area. She has been taken 1800mg ibuprofen for 8 days. Since then she is taken IB 2 days a day, each time 600mg. She slided her feet forward in order to move around at home by holding the back of a chair with very slow motion and a bent forward position at 70 degree angle. She could make small steps with same body position and help of a chair, just like a senior in the past 3 days. She has not been standing up straight nor lie down to sleep as there will be extreme sharp pain shoot up from injured area. She has been in a sit-up position to take naps at night. She has not been able to walk up or down stair so to take showers or bath. She has no problem on calls of nature. Her both legs muscles have been very hard and they look much fatter than before the injury. She has very sharp pain sometimes in the SI area by just lifting up her right arm to reach something. She dares not to move any part of the body fast as it might trigger sharp pain from injured area. Questions are: Does it seem like she has pinched nerve. If yes, what does that mean? If yes, how long will it get healed? Are her muscles or bone bruised? She only iced her lower back area in the first 48 hours. She stopped using heat pad for about 2 days ago. Should she continue to use ice pad or heat pad? Is it safe for her to continue to take IB? If yes, how many more days and the dosage please? She wants to know what actually is wrong with her and what should she do to help improve the healing? I asked on her behalf as she has been pretty upset with no sign of obivous improvement. Kindly let me know what she could do for better and fast healing. Thank you. Catherine","Doctor":"Hi,Your daughter really had a very bad fall which is ought to give her a bad injury on her back. The answers are as following:1) Yes there are chances of having a pinched nerve. A pinched nerve means the nerve fibers that exits from the vertebral Gorman is trapped by a disc bulge (most of the cases) or a broken bony fragment.2) The duration of healing will depend on the severity of entrapment and at what levels has it taken place.3) The body gives a protective mechanism by developing a muscle spasm to prevent further damage, so not to worry about muscle pain also a bone injury can be only confirmed on x-ray or MRI.4) Yes it will be good if she continues taking Ice and hot packs both as it will provide some relief from the pain and stiffness5) No I would not suggest taking Ibuprofen for a longer duration as it will not help in treating the basic injury that she is having. Moreover I would like to suggest to visit an Orthopaedic for a detailed examination. For proper healing she needs to take rest, avoid activities as much as possible and take the medicines regularly as prescribed by her Orthopaedic based on detailed examination. Hope this helps you to some extent and release your daughter of some stress that she is having due to this injury. Please convince her to go to a doctor and stop taking any home remedies as this will only worsen her condition. Again worrying will only lead to delayed healing.Hoping her to get well soon.

Generally, patients tend to deteriorate over time, but prognosis varies with the SMA ( spinal muscular atrophy ) type and disease progress which shows a great degree of individual variability. The majority of children diagnosed with SMA type 0 and 1 do not reach the age of 4, recurrent respiratory problems being the primary cause of death. With proper care, milder SMA type 1 cases (which account for approx. 10% of all SMA1 cases) live into adulthood. Long-term survival in SMA1 is not sufficiently evidenced; however, recent advances in respiratory support seem to have brought down mortality. In SMA type 2, the course of the disease is stable or slowly progressing and life expectancy is reduced compared to the healthy population. Death before the age of 20 is frequent, although many patients live to become parents and grandparents. SMA type 3 has normal or near-normal life expectancy if standards of care are followed. Adult-onset SMA usually means only mobility impairment and does not affect life expectancy. Managaement is usually with the researches of gene replacement, splicing, or even activation, muscle restoration by physiotherapy, stem cell, medication doses should be given by your specialist according to the tests.Hope I have answered your query.

You may be asked to walk on your toes or heels, rise from a squatting position and, while lying on your back, lift your legs one at a time. Pain that results from sciatica will usually worsen during these activities. Then some imaging, some medications like anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxant, narcotics, tricyclic antidepressants , and anti-seizure medications.

It may start with some brain shivers, dizziness, acute depressions and irritability, as well as heightened senses of akathisia.Treatment is dependent on the severity of the discontinuation reaction and whether or not further antidepressant treatment is warranted. In cases where further antidepressant treatment is required then the only step required is restarting the antidepressant. This is usually the case following patient noncompliance with the drug. If antidepressants are no longer required, treatment depends on symptom severity. Mild reactions may only require reassurance. Moderate cases may require symptom management. If symptoms of discontinuation are severe, or do not respond to symptom management, the antidepressant can be reinstated and then withdrawn more cautiously. In rare but severe cases, hospitalization may be required.Hope I have answered your query.

Since the procedure was first introduced for the treatment.it has been shown in numerous studies to be less invasive and expensive, to result in less bone destruction and to have equivalent safety and efficacy to surgical techniques, treatment with incision less surgery utilizing an MRI to guide high-intensity ultrasound waves to destroy a benign bone tumor in the skull has been demonstrated lately you may ask your specialist about it if you really need to remove it.Hope I have answered your query.

Most cases of a twitching lip may be due to stress, fatigue, emotion, excessive caffeine intake (drinking large amounts of coffee or caffeinated soft drinks), or some deficiency in the diet such as potassium. Lip twitching in most cases is self-limiting, disappearing in minutes or maybe in a few days without any residual problems. However persistent lip twitching with other signs and symptoms should be investigated for other underlying disorders: - Stress- Fatigue- Severe anxiety- Emotions, such as anger, amusement, fear.- Potassium deficiency.- Excessive stimulant intake – coffee, certain soft drinks, tea, chocolate and over-the-counter (OTC) stimulants.- Alcohol withdrawal or abuse.- Cigarette or nicotine withdrawalOther causes of lip twitching may include :Damage or irritation of the facial nerve due to any cause. Bell’s palsy may cause occasional twitching of the lips and a facial droop is usually present. These cases are quiet rare, so I don't want you to worry unless it persists.

My advice would be according to degree of cases. Mild cases of hemifacial spasm may be managed with sedation or Carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant drug). Microsurgical decompression and botulinum toxin injections are the current main treatments used for hemifacial spasm. For moderate to severe cases we use Microvascular decompression appears to be the most popular surgical treatment at present. Microvascular decompression relieves pressure on the facial nerve, which is the cause of most hemifacial spasm cases. Excellent to good results are reported in 80% or with a 10% recurrence rate. Approximately 10% had previously failed surgery. Side effects include hematoma, swelling, infarction, and brain death. Botulinum toxin is highly effective in the treatment of hemifacial spasm.

Ramez mohammed,Thanks for using health care website ,I had gone through your question and understood your concerns.. Spondyloarthritis is a term for inflammatory diseases that involve both the joints and the entheses (the sites where the ligaments and tendons attach to the bones). The most common of these diseases is ankylosing spondylitis. Others include reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and enteropathic arthritis.Spondyloarthritis, in most cases, primarily affects the spine. Some forms can affect the peripheral joints , those in the hands, feet, arms and legs. 1.may order imaging and blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. X-rays of the sacroiliac joints, a pair of joints in the pelvis, often show changes called sacroilitis in people with spondyloarthritis. If these changes do not show up on X-ray but symptoms suggest spondyloarthritis, may take a magnetic resonance image (MRI) that can show these changes before an X-ray can.2.A blood test for the HLA-B27 gene can also help confirm a suspected diagnosis of spondyloarthropathy. However, not everyone with the gene have or develop arthritis. Therefore, a positive finding by itself doesn’t mean spondyloarthritis.Several medications, including various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are effective for relieving pain and inflammation in spondyloarthritis. When joint swelling is not widespread, injections of a corticosteroid medication directly into the joint or membrane surrounding the affected area can provide quick relief.When these drugs alone do not provide relief, may prescribe disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to relieve symptoms and prevent joint damage. DMARDs are most effective for arthritis that affects the joints of the arms and legs.Another class of drugs called tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers are effective for arthritis of the both the spine and joints of the arms and legs. However, they are expensive and can increase the risk of serious infections.Antibiotics may be helpful for reactive arthritis.When inflammation destroys the cartilage in the hips, surgery to replace the hip with a prosthesis, called total hip replacement, can relieve pain and restore the joint’s function.Self care for spondyloarthritis should address both the physical and emotional effects of the disease through healthy lifestyle choices such as exercising regularly and not smokingHope above informations helps you, thanks again for writing into healthcaremagic website and if you have additional or follow up questions then plz.

Ramez mohammed,Thanks for using health care website ,I had gone through your question and understood your concerns.. At first i'll inform you in summry about epilipsy and epiliptic seziurs ,Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures.The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems.For good diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on observation of the seizure onset and the underlying cause. 1.An electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves.2.Diagnostic imaging (CT scan or MRI) to look at the structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup. 3.testing of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is important .4.An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with the rhythm of the heart.Treatment:At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.SurgeryEpilepsy surgery may be an option for people with partial seizures that remain a problem despite other treatments.The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases.Avoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, in those who are sensitive to light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful.Low back pain (LBP) is a common disorder involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling.MedicationsThe medication typically recommended first is acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs (though not aspirin), and these are enough for most people. Standard doses of acetaminophen are very safe; however, high doses may cause liver problemsNSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; there is no evidence to support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial& multivitamins for nerve injury ..For further investigation .. you may get an xray or MRI scan to rule out the cause or signs of injury & pain .Hope above informations helps you, thanks again for writing into healthcaremagic website and if you have additional or follow up questions then plz.

Some back ground- I have had 2 knee surgeries on my left knee. One in January 2011, with a torn medial meniscus (minor tear) and an ACL tear.

However, finally last night I was able to sleep and I woke up with very minimal knee pain and swelling. Originally I though I tore my meniscus again.

If the answer is yes then nothing to worry about the meniscus but exercise need to be done to strengthen your muscles especially the quadriceps, glutes, and hip adductors. If the answer is no then you need to get yourself checked by the doctor for any reinjury (till then you are not supposed to bear weight on your knee.

My mother died from this disorder, in the end they said it was a type of bone cancer(acute leukemia).","Doctor":"Hi,Myasthenia gravis  is a long term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. It is an autoimmune disease which results from antibodies that block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the junction between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia. Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia. Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or nerve conduction studies. Early diagnosis and treatment is the best way to protect your self from it.

Should I be worried or did I just strain a muscle?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Please let me know how much time has passed since your c section. Did you feel that any thing gave way from that scar? Is there any swelling in that area? What is the quality of your abdominal muscles? Are they lax or tight? From your history I am suspecting three things:1. incisional hernia.2. rectus sheath hematoma3. muscle stretch or spasm.In case of incisional hernia there will be a swelling with cough impulse. It is common. The definitive treatment is surgery. It can be mesh hernioplasty, or keel repair herniorrhaphy. You can apply abdominal support until you have met your doctor. Don't panic and remain calm as there are less chances of obstruction in these cases in case oaf rectus sheath hematoma a blood vessel is disrupted within abdominal muscle and collection of blood is present beneath the skin which causes pain and swelling.It can regress by itself but if it is large enough it will need incision and drainage. Muscle stretch and spasm can also cause pain which is self limiting and will be okay with rest. Kindly take nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug ie tab dicloran or acemed. Take muscle relaxant such as tizanadine or thiocholchiside. Take plenty of fluids and fiber diet.Hope I have answered your query.

As muscultaneous nerve is one of the major nerve which supplies to many muscles of your upper arm directly and its branches supply to muscles of forearm and hand, so if it has been damaged you are bound to have weakness in majority of your arm muscles.

It will be a very slow process and it might take you own time, like two months to get a noticeable difference in your arm. But along with exercises and if you continue to extend the treatment we can expect good results in a span of six months to one year or sooner. It depends how you respond to the treatmentKindly have your NCV done of radial nerve, ulnar nerve and median nerve of your hand. Hope to hear from you soon once you had taken sessions.

The chiropractor seems to think I may have fibromyalgia to. Pretty uncomfortable. During the night especially my shoulders have intense aching as so does many other parts of my body. To touch my arms and different places are very sore Who best can tell me what is going on. I am 55. Have always been healthy outside of severe endometriosis since in my early 20s. Not really sure which type of medical professional to go to. The doctor at sports orthopedic and spine gave me diclofenac 75 mg 2xd. It was like a miracle drug for me. Seems to be a lot going on. Notion to all of this I was in good shape. Running 3-5 days a week for over 10 years. The last 4 years I can t do much of anything. Bone spr in foot an then my back. Trying to get back to to my life","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. To address your problems you would need to see a rheumatologist and a pain management doctor. If you have underlying inflammatory disorder, a rheumatologist would be able to identify the problem and start you on a treatment regiment that could consist of steroids, NSAIDS and possibly pain medications. Regarding your bone spur, bone spurs do not cause pain, its your calf muscle being too tight is what causing you pain. If your primary doctor can give you a referral for either physical therapy to improve your strength and flexibility in lower extremity to improve your heel pain. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Samuel Parmar"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor,I have been diagnosed of having multiple calculi with largest one measuring 6.4 mm.
