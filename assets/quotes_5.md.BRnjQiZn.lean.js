And how many points should be of each color?","solution":"Solution: Let 1996 points be colored with n colors, where each point is colored one of the n colors, and let the number of points of each color be m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}, m_{4}, cdots, m_{n}. Without loss of generality, assume m_{1} geq 1, and m_{i} - m_{i-1} leq 2 (i=2,3, cdots, n), otherwise, if m_{i} - m_{i-1} geq 3, take m^{prime}_{i-1} = m_{i-1} + 1, m^{prime}_{i} = m_{i} - 1, then m^{prime}_{i-1} cdot m^{prime}_{i} = (m_{i-1} + 1)(m_{i} - 1) = m_{i-1} cdot m_{i} + m_{i} - m_{i-1} - 1 > m_{i-1} cdot m_{i}.

If the first term is 3, then m_{1} + m_{2} + cdots + m_{i-1} + m_{i} + cdots + m_{n} = 2 + m_{1} + m_{2} + cdots + m_{i-1} + [m_{i+1} - 2] + m_{i} + m_{i+2} + m_{i+3} + cdots + m_{n}, since 2(m_{i+1} - 2) = m_{i+1} + (m_{i+1} - 4) > m_{i+1}, then 2 m_{1} cdot m_{2} cdots cdot m_{i-1} [m_{i+1} - 2] cdot m_{i} cdot m_{i+2} cdots cdot m_{n} > m_{1} cdot m_{2} cdots cdot m_{n}, i.e., if m_{1} = 3, S cannot be maximized. Therefore, to maximize S, we must have m_{1} = 2, and m_{i} - m_{i-1} = 2 occurs exactly once, and the rest m_{j} - m_{j-1} = 1, then we can set m_{1}, m_{2}, cdots, m_{n} as 2, 3, 4, cdots, i-1, i+1, i+2, cdots, n+1, n+2, their sum is frac{(1+n)(n+4)}{2} - i, thus (1+n)(n+4) = 2 times 1996 + 2i (i < n), solving this gives n = 61, i = 19.

Since rotating one chessboard 90^{circ} around its center swaps the two colors of the squares, when both chessboards are rotated 90^{circ} around their centers, the order of the 4 parts is exactly reversed, hence we get S_{1}=S_{4}, S_{2}=S_{3}. Furthermore, when the two chessboards are rotated in opposite directions by 45^{circ} and their positions are swapped, it is equivalent to one chessboard being stationary while the other rotates 90^{circ}, which can prove that S_{1}=S_{3}, thus the areas of the 4 parts are all equal, hence we get S_{4}= 32(sqrt{2}-1)."},{"problem":"Let ABCD be a square of side length 1, and let P be a variable point on overline{CD}.

Since b_n = log_2 a_{n+1}, we have b_n = log_2(2^n) = n.Now, let's find the sum of the first n terms for the sequence {frac{1}{b_n cdot b_{n+1}}}:frac{1}{b_n cdot b_{n+1}} = frac{1}{n(n+1)} = frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}.Thus, the sum of the first n terms, T_n, is given by:T_n = left(1 - frac{1}{2}right) + left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3}right) + dots + left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}right) = 1 - frac{1}{n+1} = boxed{frac{n}{n+1}}."},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate system (xOy), the focus of the parabola y^{2}=2x is F.

Note that the numbers x^{2}+1 and x, as well as the numbers y^{2}+1 and y are coprime, so x in the denominator can only cancel out with y in the numerator, meaning y is divisible by x and, in particular, y is not less than x. Similarly, y^{2}+1 in the denominator can only cancel out with x^{2}+1 in the numerator, so y^{2}+1 divides x^{2}+1, in particular, does not exceed it, from which it follows that y does not exceed x.

Note immediately that d_{s+1-i}=N / d_{i} for all i= =1,2, ldots, s.The number d_{i+1}-d_{i} is divisible by the GCD left(d_{i}, d_{i+1}right), so the GCD left(d_{i}, d_{i+1}right) leqslant d_{i+1}-d_{i}. For i=1, ldots, s-1, let r_{i}=left(d_{i+1}-d_{i}right)- GCD left(d_{i}, d_{i+1}right) geqslant 0.

This means that r_{k}=1 for some k, while all other r_{i} are zero.Thus, 1=left(d_{k+1}-d_{k}right)- GCD left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right). The right, and therefore the left side of this equation, is divisible by GCD left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right), so GCD left(d_{k}, d_{k+1}right)=1 and d_{k+1}-d_{k}=2. This is possible only if both numbers d_{k} and d_{k+1} are odd.Since d_{k} and d_{k+1} are two consecutive divisors of the number N, then frac{N}{d_{k+1}} and frac{N}{d_{k}} are also two consecutive divisors of the number N. Therefore, if frac{N}{d_{k+1}}=d_{m}, then frac{N}{d_{k}}=d_{m+1}.

But then d_{s-1} leqslant frac{N}{3}, from which GCD left(d_{s-1}, d_{s}right) leqslant d_{s-1} leqslant frac{N}{3}. Therefore, 1 geqslant r_{s-1} geqslant frac{2 N}{3}-frac{N}{3}=frac{N}{3}, i.e., N leqslant 3.

Suppose there is more than one. Let R, S be any two routes. They must have a stop X in common. Let the other stops on R be R 1 , R 2 , ... , R 10 and the other stops on S be S 1 , S 2 , ... , S 10 . Now there is just one route through R i and S j . Call it (R i , S j ). Note that all these 100 routes must be distinct and must be distinct from R and S (or we would have more than one route through two stops). But any route T must have a stop in common with R and a stop in common with S. If neither of those stops is X, then it must pass through some R i and some S j , so it must be the route (R i , S j ). If it passes through X, then it cannot have any other stops in common with R or S. But it must have a stop in common with Q = (R 1 , S 1 ). Q has 9 other stops, call them Q 1 , Q 2 , ..., Q 9 . So T must pass through X and some Q i . But there is a unique route (X, Q i ) through X and Q i . Thus we have R, S, 10 2 routes (R i , S j ), and 9 routes (X, Q i ), total 111.

Let's use the first equation for simplicity:[40 cdot 2y = 20y + n][80y = 20y + n][60y = n]Therefore, we have x = 2y and 60y = n. To find the ratio of x to y, we substitute y = frac{n}{60} into x = 2y:[x = 2 cdot frac{n}{60}][x = frac{n}{30}]Thus, y = frac{n}{60} and x = frac{n}{30}. The ratio of the cashier's checkout speed to the rate at which the number of people waiting to check out increases is:[frac{x}{y} = frac{frac{n}{30}}{frac{n}{60}} = frac{60}{30} = 2]Therefore, the cashier's checkout speed is 2 times the rate at which the number of people waiting to check out increases.Hence, the answer is: boxed{2}."},{"problem":"Given that angle theta is acute and sin theta = frac{1}{3}, find the value of (1) sin (frac{pi }{4}-theta ) and (2) cos 2theta.","solution":"(1) Since angle theta is acute and sin theta = frac{1}{3}, we can find cos theta using the Pythagorean identity:cos theta = sqrt{1 - sin^2 theta} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{1}{3}right)^2} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}Now, we can find sin (frac{pi}{4} - theta) using the sine difference formula:sin left(frac{pi}{4} - thetaright) = sin frac{pi}{4} cos theta - cos frac{pi}{4} sin theta = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}left(frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} - frac{1}{3}right) = boxed{frac{4 - sqrt{2}}{6}}(2) To find cos 2theta, we use the double angle formula:cos 2theta = 2cos^2 theta - 1 = 2 left(frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}right)^2 - 1 = boxed{frac{7}{9}}"},{"problem":"Find all triplets of strictly positive integers (x, y, z) such that(x+y)^{2}+3 x+y+1=z^{2} .","solution":"We can easily see that(x+y)^{2}<(x+y)^{2}+3 x+y+1<(x+y+2)^{2}Therefore, the only solution is z=x+y+1.

The condition of the problem means that for all x in [1; 3], the inequality |f(x)| leqslant frac{1}{2} holds.

However, 2017 equiv 33 pmod{64} and 2017^{2} equiv (1+32)^{2} = 1 + 2 cdot 32 + 32^{2} equiv 1 pmod{64}, so the powers of 2017 modulo 64 alternate between 1 and 33. Therefore, a must be even.

Therefore, evaluating these derivatives at x_{0} = 0 gives us f^{(n)}(0) = e^{0} = 1 for all n.The 3rd order Taylor polynomial, T_{3}(x), is constructed as follows:[T_{3}(x) = f(0) + frac{f'(0)}{1!}(x-0) + frac{f^{(2)}(0)}{2!}(x-0)^{2} + frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}(x-0)^{3}]Substituting the values, we get:[T_{3}(x) = 1 + x + frac{x^{2}}{2!} + frac{x^{3}}{3!} = 1 + x + frac{x^{2}}{2} + frac{x^{3}}{6}]Thus, the 3rd order Taylor polynomial of f(x) = e^{x} at x_{0} = 0 is boxed{1 + x + frac{x^{2}}{2} + frac{x^{3}}{6}}.For f(x) = -frac{1}{x}:The derivatives of f(x) = -frac{1}{x} are calculated as follows, leading to:- f'(x) = x^{-2},- f^{(2)}(x) = -2x^{-3},- Continuing this pattern, we find that f^{(n)}(x) = (-1)^{n}n!x^{-n-1}.Evaluating these derivatives at x_{0} = -1 gives us:- f^{(n)}(-1) = (-1)^{n}n!(-1)^{-n-1} = (-1)^{-1}n! = n! for n = 1, 2, ldots, 10.The coefficient of x^{3} in the 10th order Taylor polynomial is found by considering the binomial expansion terms that contribute to x^{3}, which are:[C_{3}^{0} + C_{4}^{1} + C_{5}^{2} + cdots + C_{10}^{7} = C_{4}^{4} + C_{4}^{3} + C_{5}^{3} + cdots + C_{10}^{3} = cdots = C_{10}^{4} + C_{10}^{3} = C_{11}^{4} = 330]Therefore, the coefficient of x^{3} in the 10th order Taylor polynomial of f(x) = -frac{1}{x} at x_{0} = -1 is boxed{330}."},{"problem":"Find the point symmetric to point M(2, -3, 1) with respect to the origin.","solution":"The coordinate rules for a point symmetric about the origin in a three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system are as follows: the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and z-coordinate of the symmetric point are the negations of those of the original point.Since point M has coordinates (2, -3, 1), the coordinates of its symmetric point with respect to the origin, denoted by N(x', y', z'), can be determined by negating each coordinate:begin{align*}x' &= -x = -2, y' &= -y = 3, z' &= -z = -1.end{align*}Therefore, the coordinates of the point symmetric to M with respect to the origin are boxed{(-2, 3, -1)}.

Ivan Ivanovich approached a source with two empty cans; one held 10 liters, and the other held 8 liters. Water from the source flowed in two streams - one stronger, the other weaker. Ivan Ivanovich simultaneously placed the cans under the streams and, when half of the smaller can was filled, he switched the cans. To Ivan Ivanovich's surprise, the cans filled up simultaneously. How many times more water does the stronger stream provide compared to the weaker one?","solution":"Solution: Let x liters of water fill the larger can while 4 liters fill the smaller can. After the switch, (10-x) liters fill the larger can while 4 liters again fill the smaller can. Since the flow rates are constant, the ratio of the volumes of water filled in the same time is also constant. We can set up the equation: frac{4}{x}=frac{10-x}{4} ; x^{2}-10 x+16=0, which has two roots x_{1}=2, x_{2}=8. The two roots of the equation correspond to two possibilities: placing the smaller can under the stronger or the weaker stream first. However, in both cases, the answer is the same: one stream provides twice as much water as the other.Answer: 2."},{"problem":"4.1.

On each face of the body, we place a roof-shaped body whose 4 sides are inclined at a 45^{circ} angle to the base. How many faces, edges, and vertices does the resulting body have? What shapes are the faces? What is the volume of the body?","solution":"It is evident that each roof-shaped body (excluding the base, its edges, and vertices) has 4 side faces, 5 edges, and 2 vertices. One of the edges is parallel to the base, called the ridge - its endpoints are the vertices. The two longer base edges are connected by a symmetrical trapezoid, and the shorter ones by isosceles triangles; each side face is symmetrical to the perpendicular bisector plane of the corresponding base edge, and the angles on the base edge are equal.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b4d49f9f746cc43fc19cg-1.jpg?height=1070&width=618&top_left_y=358&top_left_x=735)The foot of the perpendicular from the ridge vertices is at half the distance from the three edges of the base, compared to the shorter base edge, and the height of the roof is the same. Therefore, the length of the ridge is equal to the difference in the lengths of the base sides.The side faces of the roofs placed on two adjacent faces of the rectangular prism, which rest on the common edge of the bases, lie on each other's extensions, because their dihedral angles are 45^{circ}+90^{circ}+45^{circ}=180^{circ}. Thus, from the 24 faces of the 6 roofs, 12 faces remain on the body after assembly. Each face contains one edge of the rectangular prism diagonally, so every edge of the examined body belongs to only one roof, making the total number of edges 6 cdot 5=30. The vertices of the rectangular prism are also vertices of the examined body, so the total number of vertices is 8+6 cdot 2=20.Symmetrical trapezoids connect to the longest (a-) edges of the rectangular prism through both of their faces, and when combined, they form hexagons with opposite sides parallel. The isosceles triangles connecting to the shortest (c-) edges similarly form rhombuses. Two triangular and trapezoidal faces connect to the b-edges, and when combined, they form axisymmetric pentagons. It is evident from the above that the 4 hexagons, rhombuses, and pentagons are congruent.The roof placed on the a and b edges of the rectangular prism is divided by planes passing through the endpoints of the ridge and perpendicular to a into a three-sided prism and two pyramids. When the latter are combined, they form a regular tetrahedron with a base edge of b and a height of b / 2, so their combined volume is b^{3} / 6. The length of the lying prism is a-b, and its base (the cross-section perpendicular to its length) is an isosceles right triangle with a hypotenuse of b, so its volume is b^{2}(a-b) / 4. Therefore, the volume of the roof-shaped body isV_{a b}=frac{b^{3}}{6}+frac{b^{2}(a-b)}{4}=frac{a b^{2}}{4}-frac{b^{3}}{12}By substituting a, b with a, c and then b, c, we obtain the volumes V_{a c} and V_{b c} of the bodies placed on the intermediate and smallest faces of the rectangular prism, respectively. From these, the volume of the entire body isV=a b c+2left(V_{a b}+V_{a c}+V_{b c}right)=a b c+frac{1}{2}left(a b^{2}+a c^{2}+b c^{2}right)-frac{b^{3}}{6}-frac{c^{3}}{3}Katalin Szabó (Csongrád, Batsányi J. g.

How many four-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 9, 8, 8 that leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 11?","solution":"Can form 4 numbers that leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 1114.【Solution】Using 1, 9, 8, 8, 12 four-digit numbers can be formed, namely 1988, 1898, 1889, 9188, 9818, 9881, 8198, 8189, 8918, 8981, 8819, 8891.Subtracting 8 from them results in 1980, 1890, 1881, 9180, 9810, 9873, 8190, 8181, 8910, 8973, 8811, 8883.Among these, only 1980, 1881, 8910, 8811 are divisible by 11, meaning that using 1, 9, 8, 8, 4 four-digit numbers can be formed that leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 11, i.e., 1988, 1889, 8918, 8819.【Another Solution】What kind of number can be divisible by 11? A rule for determining this is: compare the sum of the digits in the odd positions with the sum of the digits in the even positions. If their difference is divisible by 11, then the given number is divisible by 11; otherwise, it is not.Now, we need a number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11. We can consider this: such a number, when added to 3, can be divisible by 11. Therefore, we get the rule for \\"a number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11\\": add the digits in the even positions to get one sum, then add the digits in the odd positions plus 3 to get another sum. If the difference between these two sums is divisible by 11, then the number is a number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11; otherwise, it is not.To form a four-digit number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11 using 1, 9, 8, 8, we can divide these 4 numbers into two groups, each with 2 digits. One group will be the thousands and tens digits, with their sum denoted as A; the other group will be the hundreds and units digits, with their sum plus 3 denoted as B. We need to group them appropriately so that the difference can be divisible by 11. Now, there are only 4 ways to group them:begin{tabular}{lll} & Even & Odd (1) & 1,8 & 9,8 (2) & 1,9 & 8,8 (3) & 9,8 & 1,8 (4) & 8,8 & 1,9end{tabular}After verification, the first (1) grouping method meets the requirement: A=1+8, B=9+8+3=20, B-A=11 is divisible by 11. However, the other three groupings do not meet the requirement.According to the rule, if a number leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11, then swapping any two digits in the odd positions or any two digits in the even positions will result in a new number that also leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11. Thus, in the first (1) grouping, either 1 or 8 can be the thousands digit, and either 9 or 8 can be the hundreds digit. This results in 4 possible arrangements: 1988, 1889, 8918, 8819.Answer: 4 numbers can be formed that leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 11."},{"problem":"One hundred and one of the squares of an n\\u0002times n table are colored blue. It is known that there exists a unique way to cut the table to rectangles along boundaries of its squares with the following property: every rectangle contains exactly one blue square. Find the smallest possible n.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Assumption:   - We are given an ( n times n ) table with 101 blue squares.   - There exists a unique way to cut the table into rectangles such that each rectangle contains exactly one blue square.   - We need to find the smallest possible ( n ).2. Verification for ( n = 101 ):   - Consider a ( 101 times 101 ) table.   - Color the top row entirely blue, resulting in 101 blue squares.   - This configuration ensures that each row and column has at most one blue square, making it possible to partition the table uniquely into ( 1 times 101 ) rectangles, each containing exactly one blue square.3. Lemma 1:   - Statement: For a blue square and its non-blue neighbor, there exists a way to cut the table into rectangles which partitions these two squares into the same rectangle.   - Proof:     - Assume the blue square and its non-blue neighbor are in the same row (otherwise, rotate the board by 90 degrees).     - Partition the non-fallow rows (rows with blue squares) into ( 1 times k ) rectangles, each containing exactly one blue square.     - Ensure the two squares (blue and non-blue neighbor) are in the same rectangle.     - Collapse the fallow rows (rows without blue squares) into the existing rectangles by adding each square in a fallow row to the first rectangle below it (or above it if there are none below).     - This ensures a unique partitioning, proving the lemma. (blacksquare)4. Corollary:   - Statement: The set of blue squares in any row is contiguous.   - Proof:     - If not, we could partition that row into ( 1 times k ) rectangles in more than one way.     - Proceeding as described in Lemma 1 would result in at least two possible ways to partition the grid, contradicting the uniqueness of the partitioning. (blacksquare)   - A similar statement holds for columns.5. Lemma 2:   - Statement: Any non-blue square ( s ) cannot have two blue neighbors.   - Proof:     - By the corollary, we only need to prove this when the two blue neighbors are not in the same row or column.     - Let ( n_1 ) be the blue neighbor in the same row and ( n_2 ) be the blue neighbor in the same column.     - Use the algorithm described in Lemma 1 to get a partition with ( n_1, s ) in the same rectangle but not ( n_2 ), and another with ( n_2, s ) in the same rectangle but not ( n_1 ).     - This results in a contradiction, proving the lemma. (blacksquare)6. Lemma 3:   - Statement: If ( a, b ) are blue squares which aren't in the same row or the same column, then the rectangle with ( a, b ) as opposite corners is entirely blue.   - Proof:     - Assume ( a ) is lower than ( b ) and to the left of ( b ).     - Consider the path ( a, s_1, s_2, ldots, s_k, b ) which first goes up and then to the right, moving one step each time.     - Let ( s_t ) be the turning point, i.e., ( s_t ) is above ( s_{t-1} ) and to the left of ( s_{t+1} ).     - If any ( s_i ) is not blue, then ( s_t ) is not blue by the corollary.     - Suppose ( s_t ) is not blue. Let ( 0 le i < t ) be the largest ( i ) with ( s_i ) blue, where ( s_0 = a ) by convention.     - Let ( t < j le k+1 ) be the smallest ( j ) with ( s_j ) blue, where ( s_{k+1} = b ) by convention.     - Apply the algorithm in Lemma 1 to get a partitioning where ( s_i, s_t ) are in the same rectangle but not ( s_j ), and another where ( s_j, s_t ) are in the same rectangle but not ( s_i ).     - These give a contradiction, so all ( s_i )'s are blue.     - Using Lemma 2, we can prove that the entire rectangle is blue. (blacksquare)7. Conclusion:   - Lemma 3 implies that the set of blue squares forms a rectangle.   - The set of blue squares must be a ( 1 times 101 ) rectangle, which implies ( n ge 101 ).Hence, the desired minimum value of ( n ) is ( boxed{101} )."},{"problem":"4.

On Thursday, she took out 40 gold coins again, and the pouch was empty.How many gold coins did Maruška put into the pouch on Monday?How many gold coins should she have put into the empty pouch so that she could repeatedly take out 40 gold coins each day, without putting anything in, and the number of gold coins in the pouch would be the same before each withdrawal?(M. Volfová)","solution":"1. On Thursday, after taking out 40 gold coins, the purse was empty, so there were those 40 gold coins before taking them out.On Wednesday, after taking out (before the nightly doubling), there were 40: 2=20 gold coins in the purse, so before taking them out, there were 20+40=60 gold coins.On Tuesday, after taking out, there were 60: 2=30 gold coins in the purse, so before taking them out, there were 30+40=70 gold coins.On Monday, Maruška put 70: 2=35 gold coins into the purse.2. To have the same number of gold coins in the purse before taking them out every day, the nightly doubling would need to offset the removal of 40 gold coins. This means that these 40 gold coins would have to be exactly half of the number of gold coins before taking them out, so there would need to be 80 gold coins before taking them out. To have 80 gold coins in the purse on Tuesday before taking them out, Maruška would need to put 40 gold coins into the purse on Monday.Alternative solution. 1. If we denote Maruška's Monday deposit as z, then- on Tuesday, after taking out, there were 2z-40 gold coins in the purse,- on Wednesday, after taking out, there were 4z-80-40=4z-120 gold coins in the purse,- on Thursday, after taking out, there were 8z-240-40=8z-280 gold coins in the purse.On Thursday, after taking out, the purse was empty, meaning 8z=280, so z=35. On Monday, Maruška put 35 gold coins into the purse.2. To have the same number of gold coins in the purse before taking them out every day, the number of gold coins would need to be the same after taking them out, or before the nightly doubling. By comparing these values, for example, on Monday and Tuesday, we get z=2z-40, so z=40. On Monday, Maruška should have put 40 gold coins into the purse.Suggested scoring. 3 points for each part of the problem (2 points for the intermediate steps in the chosen method and 1 point for the result)."},{"problem":"88.

(Write down the answer directly) |","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Task 1: Analyze the quantity relationshipLet's denote the number of electric cars installed by each skilled worker per month as x and by each new worker as y. According to the given information, we can set up the following system of equations:1. For 2 skilled workers and 3 new workers installing 14 cars: 2x + 3y = 142. For 3 skilled workers and 2 new workers installing 16 cars: 3x + 2y = 16Solving this system of equations, we start by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second by 2 to eliminate y:- 6x + 9y = 42- 6x + 4y = 32Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us 5y = 10, leading to y = 2. Substituting y = 2 into the first original equation 2x + 3(2) = 14 gives 2x + 6 = 14, thus 2x = 8 and x = 4.Therefore, each skilled worker can install boxed{4} electric cars per month, and each new worker can install boxed{2} electric cars per month.# Task 2: Determine a feasible planLet m be the number of skilled workers allocated and n be the number of new workers recruited. The total number of cars installed in a year (12 months) by these workers is 12(4m + 2n) = 240. Simplifying this equation gives 4m + 2n = 20, or further simplified to 2m + n = 10, leading to n = 10 - 2m.Given the constraints 0 < n < 5 and m, n are positive integers, we find the possible values for m and n:- If m = 3, then n = 10 - 2(3) = 4.- If m = 4, then n = 10 - 2(4) = 2.Thus, there are two feasible recruitment plans:- Allocate 3 skilled workers and recruit 4 new workers.- Allocate 4 skilled workers and recruit 2 new workers.# Task 3: Select the optimal planCalculating the total salary for each plan:- Plan 1: 3 times 2000 + 4 times 1200 = 6000 + 4800 = 10800 yuan.- Plan 2: 4 times 2000 + 2 times 1200 = 8000 + 2400 = 10400 yuan.Comparing the total salaries, since 10400 < 10800, to save costs, the factory should allocate 4 skilled workers and recruit 2 new workers.

Find m+n.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   - We have a cube with side length ( AB = 12 ).   - A beam of light emanates from vertex ( A ) and reflects off face ( BCFG ) at point ( P ).   - Point ( P ) is 7 units from ( overline{BG} ) and 5 units from ( overline{BC} ).   - We need to find the length of the light path from ( A ) until it next reaches a vertex of the cube.2. Locating Point ( P ):   - Since ( P ) is 7 units from ( overline{BG} ) and 5 units from ( overline{BC} ), we can place ( P ) at coordinates ( (12, 5, 7) ) in a coordinate system where ( A = (0, 0, 0) ), ( B = (12, 0, 0) ), ( C = (12, 12, 0) ), and ( G = (12, 12, 12) ).3. Reflection Path:   - The light beam reflects off the face ( BCFG ) and continues to reflect off other faces of the cube.   - Each reflection changes the direction of the beam but maintains the same distance traveled in each coordinate direction.4. Finding the Next Vertex:   - The beam moves 5 units in the ( y )-direction and 7 units in the ( z )-direction with each reflection.   - We need to find the smallest ( x ) such that both ( 5x ) and ( 7x ) are multiples of 12 (the side length of the cube).5. Finding the Least Common Multiple:   - The least common multiple of 5 and 7 is 35.   - Therefore, ( x = 12 ) is the smallest value such that ( 5x ) and ( 7x ) are multiples of 12.6. Calculating the Distance:   - The distance from ( A ) to ( P ) is given by:     [     AP = sqrt{(12)^2 + (5)^2 + (7)^2} = sqrt{144 + 25 + 49} = sqrt{218}     ]   - Since ( x = 12 ), the total distance traveled is:     [     12 times sqrt{218} = 12sqrt{218}     ]7. Final Calculation:   - The length of the light path is ( 12sqrt{218} ).   - Here, ( m = 12 ) and ( n = 218 ).   - Therefore, ( m + n = 12 + 218 = 230 ).The final answer is ( boxed{230} )."},{"problem":"What are the integers p such that p, p+2 and p+4 are all prime?","solution":"We look modulo 3:If p equiv 0(bmod 3): then p=3.If p equiv 1(bmod 3): p+2 equiv 0(bmod 3) and thus 3 mid p+2 which is prime i.e. p+2=3: impossible.If p equiv 2(bmod 3): p+4 equiv 0(bmod 3) and thus 3 mid p+4 which is prime i.e. p+4=3: impossible.Conversely, p=3 works: 3, 5, and 7 are indeed prime."},{"problem":"4.18.

It is then x - y + 2sqrt{2}z = 2.Write the equation of the lines and substitute to find that the other two points of intersection on overline{BE}, overline{DE} are left(frac{pm 3}{2},frac{pm 3}{2},frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right). To find the area of the pentagon, break it up into pieces (an [isosceles triangle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Isosceles_triangle) on the top, an [isosceles trapezoid](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Isosceles_trapezoid) on the bottom). Using the [distance formula](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Distance_formula) (sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}), it is possible to find that the area of the triangle is frac{1}{2}bh Longrightarrow frac{1}{2} 3sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{frac 52} = frac{3sqrt{5}}{2}. The trapezoid has area frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2) Longrightarrow frac 12sqrt{frac 52}left(2sqrt{2} + 3sqrt{2}right) = frac{5sqrt{5}}{2}. In total, the area is 4sqrt{5} = sqrt{80}, and the solution is boxed{080}.Solution 2Use the same coordinate system as above, and let the plane determined by triangle PQR intersect overline{BE} at X and overline{DE} at Y. Then the line overline{XY} is the intersection of the planes determined by triangle PQR and triangle BDE.Note that the plane determined by triangle BDE has the equation x=y, and overline{PQ} can be described by x=2(1-t)-t, y=t, z=tsqrt{2}. It intersects the plane when 2(1-t)-t=t, or t=frac{1}{2}. This intersection point has z=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Similarly, the intersection between overline{PR} and triangle BDE has z=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. So overline{XY} lies on the plane z=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, from which we obtain X=left( frac{3}{2},frac{3}{2},frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) and Y=left( -frac{3}{2},-frac{3}{2},frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right). The area of the pentagon EXQRY can be computed in the same way as above.Solution 3Extend overline{RQ} and overline{AB}. The point of intersection is H. Connect overline{PH}. overline{EB} intersects overline{PH} at X. Do the same for overline{QR} and overline{AD}, and let the intersections be I and YBecause Q is the midpoint of overline{BC}, and overline{AB}paralleloverline{DC}, so triangle{RQC}congtriangle{HQB}. overline{BH}=2. Because overline{BH}=2, we can use mass point geometry to get that overline{PX}=overline{XH}. |triangle{XHQ}|=frac{overline{XH}}{overline{PH}}cdotfrac{overline{QH}}{overline{HI}}cdot|triangle{PHI}|=frac{1}{6}cdot|triangle{PHI}|Using the same principle, we can get that |triangle{IYR}|=frac{1}{6}|triangle{PHI}|Therefore, the area of PYRQX is frac{2}{3}cdot|triangle{PHI}|overline{RQ}=2sqrt{2}, so overline{IH}=6sqrt{2}. Using the law of cosines, overline{PH}=sqrt{28}. The area of triangle{PHI}=frac{1}{2}cdotsqrt{28-18}cdot6sqrt{2}=6sqrt{5}Using this, we can get the area of PYRQX = sqrt{80} so the answer is fbox{080}."},{"problem":"[b]i.)[/b] Calculate x if [ x = frac{(11 + 6 cdot sqrt{2}) cdot sqrt{11 - 6 cdot sqrt{2}} - (11 - 6 cdot sqrt{2}) cdot sqrt{11 + 6 cdot sqrt{2}}}{(sqrt{sqrt{5} + 2} + sqrt{sqrt{5} - 2}) - (sqrt{sqrt{5}+1})}  ]\\r\\r[b]ii.)[/b] For each positive number x, let [ k = frac{left( x + frac{1}{x} right)^6 - left( x^6 + frac{1}{x^6} right) - 2}{left( x + frac{1}{x} right)^3 - left( x^3 + frac{1}{x^3} right)}  ] Calculate the minimum value of k.","solution":"i.)

First, we simplify the expressions inside the numerator. Note that:[ 11 + 6 sqrt{2} = (3 + sqrt{2})^2 ][ 11 - 6 sqrt{2} = (3 - sqrt{2})^2 ]2. Therefore, we can rewrite the numerator as:[ (3 + sqrt{2})^2 cdot sqrt{(3 - sqrt{2})^2} - (3 - sqrt{2})^2 cdot sqrt{(3 + sqrt{2})^2} ]3. Simplify the square roots:[ sqrt{(3 - sqrt{2})^2} = |3 - sqrt{2}| = 3 - sqrt{2} ][ sqrt{(3 + sqrt{2})^2} = |3 + sqrt{2}| = 3 + sqrt{2} ]4. Substitute back into the expression:[ (3 + sqrt{2})^2 cdot (3 - sqrt{2}) - (3 - sqrt{2})^2 cdot (3 + sqrt{2}) ]5. Expand the terms:[ (3 + sqrt{2})^2 (3 - sqrt{2}) = (9 + 6sqrt{2} + 2)(3 - sqrt{2}) = (11 + 6sqrt{2})(3 - sqrt{2}) ][ (3 - sqrt{2})^2 (3 + sqrt{2}) = (9 - 6sqrt{2} + 2)(3 + sqrt{2}) = (11 - 6sqrt{2})(3 + sqrt{2}) ]6. Simplify the products:[ (11 + 6sqrt{2})(3 - sqrt{2}) = 33 - 11sqrt{2} + 18sqrt{2} - 12 = 21 + 7sqrt{2} ][ (11 - 6sqrt{2})(3 + sqrt{2}) = 33 + 11sqrt{2} - 18sqrt{2} - 12 = 21 - 7sqrt{2} ]7. Therefore, the numerator becomes:[ (21 + 7sqrt{2}) - (21 - 7sqrt{2}) = 14sqrt{2} ]8. Now, simplify the denominator:[ sqrt{sqrt{5} + 2} + sqrt{sqrt{5} - 2} - sqrt{sqrt{5} + 1} ]9. Note that:[ sqrt{sqrt{5} + 2} + sqrt{sqrt{5} - 2} = sqrt{2(sqrt{5} + 1)} = sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{sqrt{5} + 1} ]10. Therefore, the denominator becomes:[ sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{sqrt{5} + 1} - sqrt{sqrt{5} + 1} = (sqrt{2} - 1) cdot sqrt{sqrt{5} + 1} ]11. Finally, the expression for ( x ) is:[ x = frac{14sqrt{2}}{(sqrt{2} - 1) cdot sqrt{sqrt{5} + 1}} ]12. Simplify further:[ x = frac{14sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2} - 1} ]13. Rationalize the denominator:[ x = frac{14sqrt{2} cdot (sqrt{2} + 1)}{(sqrt{2} - 1)(sqrt{2} + 1)} = frac{14sqrt{2} cdot (sqrt{2} + 1)}{2 - 1} = 14sqrt{2} cdot (sqrt{2} + 1) = 14 cdot 2 + 14sqrt{2} = 28 + 14sqrt{2} ]The final answer is ( boxed{10} )"},{"problem":"Given cosleft(theta - frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{3}{5}, where theta in left(-frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{4}right), find costheta =  ______.","solution":"Since theta in left(-frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{4}right),  it follows that theta - frac{pi}{4} in left(-frac{pi}{2}, 0right),  Given cosleft(theta - frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{3}{5},  it implies sinleft(theta - frac{pi}{4}right) = -frac{4}{5},  Therefore, costheta = cosleft(theta - frac{pi}{4} + frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} times frac{3}{5} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} times left(-frac{4}{5}right) = frac{7sqrt{2}}{10},  Hence, the answer is: boxed{frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}}.

Thus, 10^{n-k-ell} is a power of 10 strictly less than 100 and strictly greater than 1. We deduce that 10^{n-k-ell} = 10. Since a^{2} leqslant 81, we have:a^{2} times 10^{k+ell} leqslant 81 times 10^{k+ell} < 100 times 10^{k+ell} = 10^{k+ell+2}The idea of this solution is to look at the product left(a times 10^{k} + xright)left(a times 10^{ell} + yright) = 2^{n} times 5^{n} = 10^{n} and control the carry generated by x and y. We indeed have:10^{n} = a^{2} times 10^{k+ell} + x times a times 10^{ell} + y times a times 10^{k} + x yWe are interested in the first digit of the right-hand side. This digit is 1 on the one hand since the right-hand side is a power of 10. On the other hand, since 1 leqslant a leqslant 9, we have x times a times 10^{ell} < 10 times 9 times 10^{ell} = 90 times 10^{ell} and y times a times 10^{k} < 10 times 9 times 10^{k} = 90 times 10^{k}. Therefore, the first digit of the right-hand side is determined by a^{2} times 10^{k+ell}, which must be 1. This implies that a^{2} = 1 or a^{2} = 9. Since a leqslant 9, the only possible value for a is 3.The interval llbracket 10^{k+ell} + 1, 28 times 10^{k+ell+1} rrbracket contains a unique power of 10, namely 10^{k+ell+1}. But if a in {1, 2}, then10^{k+ell+1} = left(a times 10^{k} + xright)left(a times 10^{ell} + yright) < a^{2} times 10^{k+ell} + 2 x times 10^{ell} + 2 y times 10^{k} + x y < 4 times 10^{k+ell} + 5 times 10^{k+ell} = 9 times 10^{k+ell}which is absurd. Therefore, a = 3 as required.Comment from the graders: Many students had the right intuition for this problem: to look at the product of the two numbers and hope that the product of the first digits corresponds to the first digit of the product. We expected students to quantify this reasoning and make it rigorous. Those who made an effort in this direction were rewarded. A significant number of students who understood the problem also lost points for being too quick in the case where the first common digit of 2^{n} and 5^{n} is 1. Finally, a large number of students were content to note that the statement is verified for n=5. While it is a good idea to look at small cases, it does not constitute a relevant argument for treating the general case."},{"problem":"9.

So, A cap (complement_U B) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.Now, we know that set A includes all the elements in A cap (complement_U B) since this represents the part of A that does not overlap with B. Therefore, A must include the odd numbers from 1 to 9.Since U = A cup B and A contains all the odd numbers from 1 to 9, the set B must contain all the even numbers in U to ensure that the union of A and B covers all elements in U.Therefore, the set B must be comprised of the even numbers from 1 to 9, which are boxed{{2, 4, 6, 8}}."},{"problem":"Which of the following statements is correct?

The total number of possible outcomes is 10, as there are 10 digits to choose from for the last digit. If the person can press a digit up to 2 times, they have 2 chances to get it right out of 10 possible digits. Therefore, the probability of pressing the correct digit in no more than 2 attempts is frac{2}{10} = frac{1}{5}. Part (II)If the person remembers that the last digit of the PIN is an even number, then the possible digits for the last digit are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's choose x such that by driving around distances x from the center, we would definitely catch the gangster if he does not pass through the center. For this, it is sufficient to satisfy the inequality frac{6 a}{n}+frac{7 x}{n} leqslant x, from which x geqslant frac{6 a}{n-7}. Thus, each time the length of the corridor that needs to be driven around is multiplied by frac{6}{n-7}. In our case, a=1000, and frac{6}{n-7}<frac{1}{2}.

First Scenario (Drawing a Red Ball from Bag A):   - The probability of drawing a red ball from bag A is frac{m}{m+n}.   - After placing a red ball into bag B, the number of red balls in bag B becomes 3+1=4 and the total number of balls in bag B becomes 7+1=8.   - Thus, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B in this scenario is frac{4}{8}.   - Therefore, the combined probability for this scenario is frac{m}{m+n} times frac{4}{8} = frac{4m}{8(m+n)}.2. Second Scenario (Drawing a White Ball from Bag A):   - The probability of drawing a white ball from bag A is frac{n}{m+n}.   - After placing a white ball into bag B, the number of red balls in bag B remains 3 but the total number of balls becomes 7+1=8.   - Thus, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B in this scenario is frac{3}{8}.   - Therefore, the combined probability for this scenario is frac{n}{m+n} times frac{3}{8} = frac{3n}{8(m+n)}.3. Overall Probability of Drawing a Red Ball:   - Adding the probabilities from both scenarios gives the overall probability: frac{4m}{8(m+n)} + frac{3n}{8(m+n)} = frac{15}{32}.   - Simplifying this equation gives: frac{4m + 3n}{8(m+n)} = frac{15}{32}.4.

The points O, M, E, C lie on one circle. Find the length of AB if BE = AM =3.","solution":"1. Claim 1: If two medians of a triangle are equal, then it is an isosceles triangle.   Given that (AM) and (BE) are medians of (triangle ABC) and they intersect at (O), the centroid. Since (AM = BE = 3), we can use the properties of medians and centroids to deduce that (triangle ABC) is isosceles.2. Centroid Properties:   The centroid (O) divides each median into a ratio of (2:1). Therefore, (AO = frac{2}{3}AM) and (BO = frac{2}{3}BE). Since (AM = BE), it follows that (AO = BO).3. Congruence of Triangles:   By the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence Theorem, (triangle AOM cong triangle BOM) because:   - (AO = BO)   - (OM) is common   - (angle AOM = angle BOM) (since (O) is the centroid and divides the medians equally)   Hence, (triangle AOM cong triangle BOM).4. Isosceles Triangle:   Since (triangle AOM cong triangle BOM), it follows that (AM = BM). Therefore, (triangle ABC) is isosceles with (AC = BC).5. Cyclic Quadrilateral:   Given that points (O, M, E, C) lie on one circle, we can use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Specifically, opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to (180^circ).6. Angle Chasing:   Let (angle A = angle B = angle CEM = angle CME).

Identify the Condition for Infinitely Many Solutions: For the system to have infinitely many solutions, the two equations must represent the same line. This means the ratios of the coefficients of x, y, and the constant terms must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the proportion:[frac{1}{m} = frac{m}{16} = frac{2}{8}]2.

Each of these equations has 3 solutions (since (x^3 = 1) has three complex solutions: (1, omega, omega^2) where (omega) is a primitive cube root of unity). Therefore, there are (3^2 = 9) solutions for each sub-case, giving a total of (18) solutions in this case.   - Case 2: None of (a, b, c, d) is zero.     - Dividing the equations (a^2b = -c^2d) and (ab^2 = -cd^2) gives:       [       frac{a}{b} = frac{c}{d} = k quad text{for some nonzero } k       ]     - This implies (a = kb) and (c = kd).

Let's denote this maximum number by ( f(n) ).1.

General Case ( n > 4 ):   - Consider a slightly deformed regular polygon with ( n ) vertices. In such a configuration, each point can be the nearest to the line formed by any two other points. This gives us ( f(n) = n ) for ( n > 4 ).3. Special Cases ( n = 4 ):   - For ( n = 4 ), we need to show that ( f(4) = 3 ). Suppose we have four points ( A, B, C, D ). Without loss of generality, assume that the triangle ( triangle ABC ) has the smallest area among the four possible triangles formed by any three of the four points. Since the distances from a line to points are unique, the smallest area triangle is also unique. Therefore, point ( D ) cannot be the nearest to any line formed by the points ( A, B, C ). Hence, ( f(4) = 3 ).4. Constructive Approach for ( n = 3k, 3k+1, 3k+2 ):   - For ( n = 3k ), we can consider ( k ) isolated triangles, each contributing 3 marked points, giving us ( f(3k) = 3k ).   - For ( n = 3k+1 ), we can take ( k ) isolated triangles and one extra point very close to the joining line of two vertices from different triangles, giving us ( f(3k+1) = 3k+1 ).   - For ( n = 3k+2 ), we can take ( k ) isolated triangles and two extra points forming a very small angle with one of the triangle vertices, giving us ( f(3k+2) = 3k+2 ).Thus, the maximum number of marked points for each given ( n ) is ( f(n) = n ) for ( n > 4 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(n) = n } ) for ( n > 4 ), ( f(4) = 3 ), and ( f(3) = 3 )."},{"problem":"underline{text { Problem } A .}A natural number is written on the board.

It is worth noting that being coprime in a group does not necessarily mean they are pairwise coprime. For example, gcd(6, 9, 10) = 1, but gcd(6, 9) = 3. An important condition in this problem is that initially, all the lights are off, and then for each number, we factorize it into its prime factors. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding that a light bulb will change its state (from off to on, or from on to off) each time its number is a multiple of the student's number. This means that the number of times a light bulb's switch is pulled is equal to the number of its divisors. Initially, all light bulbs are off, so a light bulb will be on at the end if and only if it has an odd number of divisors. A number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square.

Any of them fights each other only once. Several boxers form a plot. In one of their matches, they hide in their glove a horse shoe. If in a fight, only one of the boxers has a horse shoe hidden, he wins the fight; otherwise, the stronger boxer wins. It is known that there are three boxers who obtained (strictly) more wins than the strongest three boxers. What is the minimum number of plotters ?[i]Proposed by N. Kalinin[/i]","solution":"1. Define the problem and variables:   - Let ( p ) be the number of plotters.   - Let ( u ) be the number of usual boxers (those who are neither the three strongest nor plotters).   - The three strongest boxers are denoted as ( s_1, s_2, ) and ( s_3 ) in decreasing order of strength.   - The plotters are denoted as ( s_4, s_5, ldots, s_{p+3} ).2. Assumptions and initial conditions:   - The plotters should not use horseshoes against usual boxers since it does not affect the number of wins of the strongest boxers.   - Each plotter is stronger than the usual boxers, so they win all their matches against them.   - The three strongest boxers ( s_1, s_2, s_3 ) will have a certain number of wins among themselves:     - ( s_1 ) wins against ( s_2 ) and ( s_3 ), so ( s_1 ) has 2 wins.     - ( s_2 ) wins against ( s_3 ), so ( s_2 ) has 1 win.     - ( s_3 ) has 0 wins.3. Wins calculation for plotters:   - Each plotter ( s_i ) (for ( i = 4, 5, ldots, p+3 )) will win against all usual boxers and other plotters weaker than themselves.   - ( s_4 ) will have ( p-1 ) wins among the plotters.   - ( s_5 ) will have ( p-2 ) wins among the plotters.   - ( s_6 ) will have ( p-3 ) wins among the plotters.4. Using horseshoes:   - Each plotter ( s_4, s_5, s_6 ) should use a horseshoe against one of ( s_1, s_2, s_3 ) to maximize their wins.   - Therefore, ( s_4 ) will have ( u + (p-1) + 1 ) wins.   - ( s_5 ) will have ( u + (p-2) + 1 ) wins.   - ( s_6 ) will have ( u + (p-3) + 1 ) wins.5. Minimizing the wins of ( s_1, s_2, s_3 ):   - To minimize the wins of ( s_1, s_2, s_3 ), plotters should use horseshoes against them.   - Let ( frac{p}{3} + 1 ) plotters use horseshoes against ( s_1 ).   - Let ( frac{p}{3} ) plotters use horseshoes against ( s_2 ).   - Let ( frac{p}{3} - 1 ) plotters use horseshoes against ( s_3 ).6. Calculating the total wins:   - The total number of wins for ( s_1 ) is ( u + 1 + frac{2p}{3} ).   - The total number of wins for ( s_2 ) is ( u + 1 + frac{2p}{3} ).   - The total number of wins for ( s_3 ) is ( u + 1 + frac{2p}{3} ).7. Inequality for wins:   - We need the minimum number of wins obtained by ( s_4, s_5, s_6 ) to be greater than the maximum number of wins obtained by ( s_1, s_2, s_3 ):     [     u + (p-3) + 1 > u + 1 + frac{2p}{3}     ]     Simplifying the inequality:     [     p - 2 > 1 + frac{2p}{3}     ]     [     3(p - 2) > 3 + 2p     ]     [     3p - 6 > 3 + 2p     ]     [     p > 9     ]8. Finding the minimum ( p ):   - Taking ( p = 10 ), we cannot reach the desired result.   - Taking ( p = 11 ), we cannot reach the desired result.   - Finally, ( p = 12 ) works:     - 5 plotters use horseshoes on ( s_1 ).     - 4 plotters use horseshoes on ( s_2 ).     - 3 plotters use horseshoes on ( s_3 ).Conclusion:[boxed{12}]"},{"problem":"Given two moving points P1 (x1, y1), P2 (x2, y2) are respectively on the lines l1: x-y-5=0, l2: x-y-15=0, then the minimum distance from the midpoint P of P1P2 to the origin is (　　)A:  frac {5 sqrt {2}}{2}  B: 5 sqrt {2}  C:  frac {15 sqrt {2}}{2}  D: 15 sqrt {2}","solution":"Since points P1 (x1, y1), P2 (x2, y2) are respectively on the two parallel lines l1: x-y-5=0, l2: x-y-15=0,  the equation of the line on which the midpoint P of P1P2 lies is x-y-10=0.

Let's look at how the colored points are arranged when no new moves are possible. If there are two adjacent uncolored points, one of them can be colored.

If one group ends with a blue (red) point, the next group begins with a red (respectively blue) point, otherwise the point between the indicated groups can be colored. Therefore, if we remove the uncolored points, we get an alternation of red and blue points - meaning there are an equal number of red and blue points, and the total number of colored points is even.

Therefore, statement A is correct.Statement B: Two lines perpendicular to the same plane are parallel. This follows from the fact that if two lines are both perpendicular to the same plane, they run in the same direction relative to the plane and do not intersect each other. Thus, by definition, they are parallel. Hence, statement B is correct.Statement C: a, b are two lines in space. If abot c and bbot c, then a is parallel to b. This statement requires a bit more scrutiny. While it's true that a and b are both perpendicular to line c, this condition alone does not guarantee that a and b are parallel.

This is based on the property of equality that if a=b, then a+c=b+c for any c. Therefore, statement A is correctly applying the property of equations.- Statement B: Starting with a=b, and applying the operation of multiplying both sides by -2, we get -2a=-2b. Following this, by adding 1 to both sides, we obtain 1-2a=1-2b. This demonstrates the application of two properties: multiplying both sides of an equation by the same number and adding the same number to both sides of an equation. Thus, statement B is also correct.- Statement C: Given frac{a}{c}=frac{b}{c}, and multiplying both sides by c, we arrive at a=b, assuming c neq 0 to avoid division by zero. This manipulation is based on the property that multiplying both sides of an equation by the same non-zero number does not change the equality. Hence, statement C is correct.- Statement D: From the equation ab=a, if we attempt to isolate b by dividing both sides by a, we must consider two cases: when a neq 0 and when a = 0. If a neq 0, dividing both sides by a yields b=1. However, if a=0, the equation 0 cdot b = 0 is true for any value of b, not just b=1.

One way: since sqrt{2}>1.4, the mass is greater than 18.72. Since sqrt{2}<1.415 (proven by squaring), the mass is less than 19.422. Therefore, the nearest whole number is 19 kg.

Identify the Relationship Between the Square Roots of x:   Given that the two distinct square roots of x are a+3 and 2a-15, we can set up an equation based on the fact that these roots are related to the value of x. However, the correct approach is to recognize that these are not directly the roots of x but rather values that when squared would give x. The equation provided in the solution seems to mistakenly attempt to sum these roots and set them equal to zero, which is not the correct approach for finding x. The correct step here would be to equate the squares of these expressions since they both equal x:   [   (a+3)^2 = (2a-15)^2   ]   However, this step is not correctly represented in the provided solution. The correct approach to find a would involve solving this equation, which is not what the solution does. Instead, it incorrectly adds a+3 and 2a-15 and sets them equal to zero.2.

Thus, we multiply the numerator and the denominator of the second fraction by (a+4) to obtain a common denominator:[frac{2a}{(a+4)(a-4)} - frac{1 cdot (a+4)}{(a-4) cdot (a+4)} = frac{2a}{(a+4)(a-4)} - frac{a+4}{(a+4)(a-4)}]Now, with a common denominator, we can subtract the numerators directly:[frac{2a - (a+4)}{(a+4)(a-4)} = frac{2a - a - 4}{(a+4)(a-4)}]Simplifying the numerator gives us:[frac{a - 4}{(a+4)(a-4)}]Finally, we observe that the (a-4) terms in the numerator and the denominator cancel out, leaving us with:[frac{1}{a+4}]Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is boxed{frac{1}{a+4}}."},{"problem":"Analogize the properties of real number operations to conjecture the properties of complex number operations:① \\"mn=nm\\" is analogized to \\"z1z2=z2z1\\";② \\"|m•n|=|m|•|n|\\" is analogized to \\"|z1•z2|=|z1|•|z2|\\";③ \\"|x|=1⇒x=±1\\" is analogized to \\"|z|=1⇒z=±1\\";④ \\"|x|2=x2\\" is analogized to \\"|z|2=z2\\";Among the above statements, the number of correct conclusions drawn by analogy is (　　)A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 0","solution":"Let z1=a+bi, z2=c+di, z=x+yi,① \\"mn=nm\\" is analogized to \\"z1z2=z2z1\\"; correct, because z1z2=(a+bi)(c+di)=ac-bd+(ad+bc)i, z2z1=ac-bd+(ad+bc)i, therefore z1z2=z2z1 holds;② \\"|m•n|=|m|•|n|\\" is analogized to \\"|z1•z2|=|z1|•|z2|\\"; correct, because z1z2=(a+bi)(c+di)=ac-bd+(ad+bc)i,then |z1z2|= sqrt{(ac-bd)^{2}+(ad+bc)^{2}}= sqrt{a^{2}c^{2}+b^{2}d^{2}+a^{2}d^{2}+b^{2}c^{2}}, |z1|•|z2|= sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}• sqrt{c^{2}+d^{2}}= sqrt{a^{2}c^{2}+b^{2}d^{2}+a^{2}d^{2}+b^{2}c^{2}}, thus \\"|z1•z2|=|z1|•|z2|\\" holds;③ \\"|x|=1⇒x=±1\\" is analogized to \\"|z|=1⇒z=±1\\" is incorrect, when z=cosθ+isinθ, it also satisfies |z|=1, hence ③ is incorrect;④ \\"|x|2=x2\\" is analogized to \\"|z|2=z2\\" is incorrect, for example when x=i, it does not hold,Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{B}.By analyzing the properties of complex numbers and their basic operations, we can judge the truth of each statement.This question mainly tests the judgment of the truthfulness of propositions, involving the basic operations and properties of complex numbers and analogical reasoning, which is key to solving this question."},{"problem":"## Task 11/89We are looking for all pairs (n ; k) of natural numbers n and k for which the following holds: The sum of the squares of n and its k immediate predecessors is equal to the sum of the squares of the k immediate successors of n.","solution":"According to the text of the task, it should hold thatbegin{gathered}sum_{i=0}^{k}(n-i)^{2} sum_{i=1}^{k}(n+i)^{2} sum_{i=0}^{k} n^{2}-2 n sum_{i=0}^{k} i+sum_{i=0}^{k} i^{2}=sum_{i=1}^{k} n^{2}+2 n sum_{i=1}^{k} i+sum_{i=1}^{k} i^{2}end{gathered}due to sum_{i=0}^{k} n^{2}=n^{2}+sum_{i=1}^{k} n^{2}, sum_{i=0}^{k} i=sum_{i=1}^{k} i and sum_{i=0}^{k} i^{2}=sum_{i=1}^{k} i^{2}, it follows from this by equivalent transformation thatn^{2}=4 n sum_{i=1}^{k} i=4 n frac{k(k+1)}{2}=2 n k(k+1)Now, it is certain that n neq 0, as otherwise the immediate predecessors would not be natural numbers.

We start with the given system of equations:   [   xy + yz = 30   ]   [   yz + zx = 36   ]   [   zx + xy = 42   ]2. Add all three equations:   [   (xy + yz) + (yz + zx) + (zx + xy) = 30 + 36 + 42   ]   Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:   [   2(xy + yz + zx) = 108   ]   Divide both sides by 2:   [   xy + yz + zx = 54   ]3. Now we have the equation:   [   xy + yz + zx = 54   ]4. To find the individual products, we subtract each of the original equations from this sum:   [   zx = 54 - (xy + yz) = 54 - 30 = 24   ]   [   xy = 54 - (yz + zx) = 54 - 36 = 18   ]   [   yz = 54 - (zx + xy) = 54 - 42 = 12   ]5. We now have:   [   zx = 24, quad xy = 18, quad yz = 12   ]6. To find (x, y, z), we multiply these three equations:   [   (zx)(xy)(yz) = 24 cdot 18 cdot 12   ]   Simplifying the right-hand side:   [   (xyz)^2 = 24 cdot 18 cdot 12   ]   Calculate the product:   [   24 cdot 18 = 432   ]   [   432 cdot 12 = 5184   ]   Thus:   [   (xyz)^2 = 5184   ]   Taking the square root of both sides:   [   xyz = sqrt{5184} = 72   ]7. Now we solve for (x, y, z) using the individual products:   [   yz = 12 implies z = frac{12}{y}   ]   [   zx = 24 implies x = frac{24}{z}   ]   [   xy = 18 implies y = frac{18}{x}   ]8. Substitute (z = frac{12}{y}) into (x = frac{24}{z}):   [   x = frac{24}{frac{12}{y}} = frac{24y}{12} = 2y   ]9. Substitute (x = 2y) into (y = frac{18}{x}):   [   y = frac{18}{2y} implies y^2 = 9 implies y = 3   ]10.

Finally, the third one came and also divided the remainder into three equal parts, and again one fruit was left over, which he gave to the monkey, and ate his share.The next morning, all three came to the storeroom and divided the remaining fruits equally among themselves, and again one fruit was left over, which they gave to the monkey.Determine the smallest number of fruits that satisfies the above conditions of distribution.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_926f0bb262c8f9569516g-029.jpg?height=268&width=394&top_left_y=1491&top_left_x=837)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_926f0bb262c8f9569516g-030.jpg?height=297&width=1307&top_left_y=248&top_left_x=383)## Problem from the tractate \\"Bava Batra\\".Talmud.","solution":"145. This problem was proposed by an Indian professor to Delbo.Solution: Let x be the number of fruits each received in the morning. Then 3x + 1 is what remained in the morning. The third one took frac{1}{2}(3x + 1), so he found frac{3}{2}(3x + 1) + 1. The second one took frac{1}{2}left[frac{3}{2}(3x + 1) + 1right], and found frac{3}{2}left[frac{3}{2}(3x + 1) + 1right] + 1; the first one took frac{3}{4}left[frac{3}{2}(3x + 1) + 1right] + frac{1}{2}, or frac{27x + 19}{8} = 3x + 2 + frac{3(x + 1)}{8}, which must be an integer. The smallest value of x that satisfies this condition is 7. Therefore, the first one took 26 fruits and gave 1 to the monkey, the second one took 17 fruits and gave 1 to the monkey. The third one took 11 fruits and gave 1 to the monkey. In the morning, each received 7 fruits, i.e., a total of 21, and one was given to the monkey.

Initial geometric knowledge was of a narrowly practical nature, such as measuring fields, determining the capacity of vessels, etc. Arithmetic knowledge was necessary for keeping household accounts. The main monument of rabbinical writing is the \\"Talmud\\" (i.e., teaching, explanation), which was created between 300 BC and 500 AD. This is a kind of huge encyclopedia, where a number of treatises contain a lot of information on astronomy, mathematics, and metrology. A significant number of scholars, translators, and commentators in the field of exact knowledge worked at the courts of caliphs during the later periods of the flourishing of Arab rule, with many Jews becoming Arabized. The Middle Ages also produced several names. In modern times, when mathematical creativity became a common human heritage, Jewish mathematical thought usually merged into the sphere of the nationality with which the Jews were territorially connected. Astronomical and calendar research and works dedicated to the study of ancient written monuments stood apart."},{"problem":"Given the ellipse C: frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a>b>0) with eccentricity e= frac { sqrt {3}}{3}, and a circle centered at the origin with the radius equal to the semi-minor axis of the ellipse is tangent to the line x-y+2=0.

We have three keys to consider: A, B, and C. Let's analyze the effect of each key:1. Key A: Increases the number by 3.2. Key B: Multiplies the number by (-2).3. Key C: Divides the number by 4.To maximize the number, we should first consider multiplying or adding to increase its value. Since we're starting with a negative number (-1), multiplying by a negative (Key B) will turn it positive, which is beneficial for maximizing. - First Press (Key B): -1 times (-2) = 2.- Second Press (Key A): After turning the number positive, adding will further increase its value. So, 2 + 3 = 5.Thus, the sequence to maximize the number displayed on the screen after pressing two keys in a row is B rightarrow A.

Given 2023 presses, we find how many complete cycles there are and what remains:- 2023 divided by 3 gives 674 complete cycles with a remainder of 1. This means after completing 674 cycles, we have pressed the keys 2022 times, and the screen shows -1. The next key press (the 2023^text{rd} press) is Key A:- Pressing A: -1 + 3 = 2.Therefore, after pressing the keys 2023 times following the given pattern, the number displayed on the screen is 2.Hence, the answers are: boxed{B rightarrow A} for the first part and boxed{2} for the second part."},{"problem":"A group of numbers 1, 3, 7, 15, 31ldots are grouped as follows.

We start by identifying the fixed point P through which all graphs of the given function pass. 1. Identifying the fixed point P: Given the function y=a^{x+4}+2 with a > 1, we determine the coordinates of point P by analyzing the function. We set x+4=0 to find the specific value of x that makes the exponent zero, which simplifies the function. - Solving x+4=0 gives x=-4.Substituting x=-4 into the function, we get:- y=a^{(-4)+4}+2 = a^{0}+2 = 1+2 = 3.This calculation shows that the fixed point P through which all graphs of the given function pass is P(-4,3).2. Determining |OP| and sin alpha:To find sin alpha, we need to consider the triangle formed by the origin O, point P, and the projection of P on the x-axis. The distance |OP| represents the hypotenuse of this right-angled triangle, and the y-coordinate of P represents the opposite side to angle alpha. - The coordinates of P are (-4, 3), which means the horizontal distance from O to the projection of P on the x-axis is 4 units, and the vertical distance from the x-axis to P is 3 units. Therefore, using the Pythagorean theorem, |OP| = sqrt{(-4)^2 + 3^2} = sqrt{16 + 9} = sqrt{25} = 5.- Now, sin alpha = frac{text{opposite side to } alpha}{|OP|} = frac{3}{5}.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}, which is sin alpha = frac{3}{5}."},{"problem":"The equation of the circle with center at point left(3,4right) and passing through the origin is ____.","solution":"To find the equation of the circle with center at point left(3,4right) and passing through the origin, we first determine the radius of the circle. The radius can be found using the distance formula between the center of the circle and a point on the circle. In this case, the point on the circle is the origin left(0,0right). The distance formula is given by r=sqrt{left(x_2-x_1right)^2+left(y_2-y_1right)^2}, where left(x_1,y_1right) is the center of the circle and left(x_2,y_2right) is a point on the circle.Substituting the given points into the distance formula, we get:[r = sqrt{left(0-3right)^2+left(0-4right)^2}][= sqrt{(-3)^2+(-4)^2}][= sqrt{9+16}][= sqrt{25}][= 5]Now that we have the radius, we can write the equation of the circle.

This suggests that each term is a sum of distinct powers of 8. If N is any positive integer, then N is a sum of distinct powers of 2: x = b 0 + b 1 2 + b 2 2 2 + b 3 2 2 + ... , where b i = 0 or 1. Grouping every third term, we get: N = (b 0 + b 3 8 + b 6 8 2 + ... ) + 2(b 1 + b 4 8 + b 7 8 2 + ... ) + 4(b 2 + b 5 8 + b 8 8 2 + ... ) = a + 2b + 4c (*), where a, b, c are each sums of distinct powers of 8. But (*) is evidently unique, because we may write a, b, c as indicated as a sum of powers of 8 and then get the binary expression for N. That is unique, so (*) is unique. Could there be a different sequence A n with the same property? We obviously require A 0 = 0, A 1 = 1. Suppose A n is not the same as a n . Then take m to be the first n at which they disagree. Suppose a m < A m . Then a m must have an expression A i + 2A j + 4A k with i, j and k all < m. But that means that a m has two different expressions using the sequence a n . Contradiction. How do we order the sums of distinct powers of 8? Suppose C = c 0 + c 1 8 + c 2 8 2 + ... + c n 8 n , and D = d 0 + d 1 8 + ... + d n 8 n , where all c i and d i are 0 or 1. Then evidently C < D iff the binary number c 0 c 1 ... c n < d 0 ... d n . So to find the (n+1)th member of the sequence a n we write n in binary and then read it back in base 8.

At the initial moment of time, the carp and the minnow are at points M_{0}(-1 ; 2 sqrt{2}) and N_{0}(2 ;-4 sqrt{2}) respectively. The speed of the carp is two and a half times the speed of the minnow, and both are moving clockwise.

Let the points where the carp and the minnow are located be M(alpha) and N(beta), respectively, where alpha and beta are the angles formed by the radius vectors of points M and N with the positive direction of the x-axis. Note that the angle between overrightarrow{A M_{0}} and overrightarrow{A N_{0}} is pi, and at this point frac{pi}{2}<alpha_{0}<pi, -frac{pi}{2}<beta_{0}<0, where alpha_{0}, beta_{0} are the angles corresponding to the initial positions of the fish.The distance between the carp and the minnow will be the smallest when the angle between the vectors overrightarrow{A M} and overrightarrow{A N} is zero. Since left|A M_{0}right|=3 and left|A N_{0}right|=6 are the radii of the circles, and left|A N_{0}right|=2left|A M_{0}right|, the angular velocity of the carp is 5 times the angular velocity of the minnow.Let at the moment of the vectors overrightarrow{A M} and overrightarrow{A N} aligning, the minnow has moved by an angle omega clockwise. Then alpha-5 omega=beta-omega-2 pi n, where n=0,1, ldots Therefore, omega=frac{alpha-beta}{4}+frac{pi n}{2}=frac{pi}{4}+frac{pi n}{2}, where n=0,1, ldotsThere will be four different points (for n=0,1,2,3).

Define the Generating Function:   We start by considering the generating function for the set ( T = {1, 2, 3, dots, 15} ):   [   f(x) = (1 + x)(1 + x^2)(1 + x^3) cdots (1 + x^{15}).   ]   Each factor ( (1 + x^k) ) represents the inclusion or exclusion of the element ( k ) in a subset.2. Roots of Unity Filter:   We are interested in the sum of the coefficients of the terms whose degrees are multiples of 5. This can be efficiently computed using the Roots of Unity Filter. Specifically, we use the fact that:   [   a_0 + a_5 + a_{10} + ldots = frac{1}{5} sum_{k=0}^4 f(e^{2pi i k / 5}).   ]   Here, ( e^{2pi i k / 5} ) are the 5th roots of unity.3.

Let ( omega = e^{2pi i / 5} ). Then, ( omega, omega^2, omega^3, omega^4 ) are the other roots of unity. We need to evaluate ( f(omega), f(omega^2), f(omega^3), f(omega^4) ).4. Simplify Using Symmetry:   Notice that for any 5th root of unity ( omega neq 1 ):   [   (1 + omega)(1 + omega^2)(1 + omega^3)(1 + omega^4) = 1.   ]   This is because the product of all non-trivial 5th roots of unity is 1. Therefore:   [   f(omega) = (1 + omega)(1 + omega^2) cdots (1 + omega^{15}).   ]   Since ( omega^5 = 1 ), the terms cycle every 5 steps:   [   f(omega) = (1 + omega)(1 + omega^2)(1 + omega^3)(1 + omega^4) cdots (1 + omega^0) = (1 + omega)(1 + omega^2)(1 + omega^3)(1 + omega^4) cdots (1 + 1).   ]   Each cycle of 5 terms contributes a factor of 1, and there are 3 such cycles (since ( 15 / 5 = 3 )):   [   f(omega) = 1^3 = 1.   ]   Similarly, ( f(omega^2) = f(omega^3) = f(omega^4) = 1 ).5.

To simplify the problem, we introduce a new variable ( y_i = log_2 x_i ). This transformation helps us work with logarithms, which can simplify multiplicative relationships.3. Substituting ( x_i = 2^{y_i} ) into the recurrence relation, we get:   [   2^{y_{i-1}} + frac{2}{2^{y_{i-1}}} = 2 cdot 2^{y_i} + frac{1}{2^{y_i}}   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   2^{y_{i-1}} + 2^{1-y_{i-1}} = 2^{y_i+1} + 2^{-y_i}   ]4. To find the maximum value of ( x_0 ), we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence ( y_i ). Notice that the equation can be rewritten as:   [   2^{y_{i-1}} + 2^{1-y_{i-1}} = 2^{y_i+1} + 2^{-y_i}   ]5. We claim that the maximum value of ( x_0 ) is ( 2^{997} ). To verify this, consider the sequence ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{1995}) = (2^{996}, 2^{995}, ldots, 2, 1, frac{1}{2}, ldots, frac{1}{2^{996}}, frac{1}{2^{997}}, 2^{997}) ).6. Assume ( x_0 > 2^{997} ).

The recurrence relation in terms of ( y_i ) becomes:   [   (y_{i+1} - y_i + 1)(y_{i+1} + y_i) = 0   ]   or equivalently:   [   y_{i+1}^2 + y_{i+1} = y_i^2 - y_i   ]8. Summing this equation cyclically over all ( i ) from 1 to 1995, we get:   [   sum_{i=1}^{1995} (y_{i+1}^2 + y_{i+1}) = sum_{i=1}^{1995} (y_i^2 - y_i)   ]   Since ( y_0 = y_{1995} ), the sums on both sides must be equal, implying:   [   y_1 + y_2 + cdots + y_{1995} = 0   ]9. We claim that ( 0 in { y_1, ldots, y_{1995} } ). To prove this, note that since ( y_0 = y_{1995} ), there must exist some ( j in { 1, ldots, 1995 } ) such that ( y_{j+1} = -y_j ).10. Considering all possibilities for ( (y_{j-1}, y_{j+2}) ):    [    (y_i + 1, y_i), (y_i + 1, -y_i - 1), (-y_i, y_i), (-y_i, -y_i - 1)    ]    In all cases, we generate a new sequence of ( y )'s with the condition ( y_i in { y_{i-1} - 1, -y_{i-1} } ) and sum 0, but with 1993 elements.11. By induction, we reach a point where the last ( y_z ) remains, and it must be 0 since the sum is invariant.12. Therefore, ( y_z = 0 ) for some ( z in { 1, ldots, 1995 } ). Since the absolute values of consecutive ( y )'s differ by at most 1, ( | |y_z| - |y_0| | > 997 ) and ( | |y_z| - |y_{1995}| | > 997 ) must imply that ( |z - 0| > 997 ) and ( |z - 1995| > 997 ), which leads to ( 998 > z > 997 ), a contradiction.13.

The point symmetric to C with respect to the line MN lies on the hypotenuse, so since the circle is symmetric with respect to the diameter MN, we conclude that this point lies on the circle. Therefore, it is one of the intersection points of the hypotenuse and the circle, say point P. Due to the symmetry, the segment CP is perpendicular to MN, and thus to AB. Therefore, measuredangle CPQ = 90^circ. From this, it follows that the segment CQ is a diameter of the circle, and its length is 50 , text{cm}. For the area of triangle ABC, we have P = frac{60 cdot 80}{2} = 2400 and P = frac{AB cdot CP}{2} = 50 cdot CP, so 50 cdot CP = 2400, i.e., CP = 48 , text{cm}.Now, from the right triangle CPQ, we getPQ = sqrt{CQ^2 - CP^2} = sqrt{50^2 - 48^2} = sqrt{196} = 14 , text{cm}which is what we needed to determine."},{"problem":"Catarina has 210 numbered cards from 1 to 210.a) How many of these cards have a number that is a multiple of 3?b) How many of these cards have an even number that is not a multiple of 3?c) What is the smallest number of cards Catarina must pick at random to be sure that at least two of them have the number 2 or the number 3 as a common divisor?","solution":"Solutiona) Since 210 div 3=70, there are 70 cards whose numbers are multiples of 3.

On the other hand, the even numbers between 1 and 210 that are multiples of 3 are 2 times 3, 4 times 3, 6 times 3, ldots, 68 times 3, and 70 times 3, totaling 35. Therefore, there are 105-35=70 cards with even numbers that are not multiples of 3.2^{nd} solution: There are 105 even cards. On the other hand, among the 70 multiples of 3, there are 70 div 2=35 even numbers; thus 105-35=70 are even but not multiples of 3.3^{rd} solution: Removing the 70 cards whose numbers are multiples of 3 leaves 210-70 = 140 cards. Of these, half are even, as between two consecutive multiples of 3, one number is even and the other is odd; thus among them there are 140-70=70 cards that are neither even nor multiples of 3.4^{th} solution: We observe that, between 1 and 6, there are two even numbers that are not multiples of 3, namely, 2 and 4. Similarly, between 7 and 13, there are two even numbers that are not multiples of 3, namely, 8 and 10. This pattern repeats every block of six consecutive numbers up to the block of 205 to 210. In this last block, the numbers that are not multiples of 3 are 206 and 208.

Let's denote this number by ( d cdot frac{10^t - 1}{9} ) for some ( d in {1, 2, ldots, 9} ) and ( t in mathbb{N} ).1. Expression for ( n^5 + 79 ):   [   n^5 + 79 = d cdot frac{10^t - 1}{9}   ]   This implies:   [   9(n^5 + 79) = d(10^t - 1)   ]2. Considering ( t ) even:   If ( t ) is even, then ( 10^t - 1 ) is divisible by 11. Therefore, ( 11 mid n^5 + 79 ). This implies:   [   n^5 + 79 equiv 0 pmod{11} implies n^5 equiv -79 equiv -2 pmod{11}   ]   By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( n^{10} equiv 1 pmod{11} ). However, ( n^5 equiv -2 pmod{11} ) does not satisfy this condition, leading to a contradiction. Thus, ( t ) cannot be even.3. Considering ( t ) odd:   If ( t ) is odd, then:   [   d cdot frac{10^t - 1}{9} equiv d pmod{11}   ]   Since ( n^5 + 79 equiv d pmod{11} ), we have:   [   n^5 + 79 in {1, 2, 3} pmod{11}   ]   This leaves us with ( d = 1, 2, 3 ).4. Case ( d = 1 ):   [   n^5 + 79 = 111 implies n^5 = 32   ]   Since ( n ) must be an integer, ( n = 2 ) works:   [   2^5 + 79 = 32 + 79 = 111   ]   Assume the number has more than three digits.

Then:   [   2 cdot 10^t - 23 cdot 31 equiv 200 - 23 cdot 31 equiv 20 pmod{41}   ]   This implies:   [   n^5 equiv 20/9 equiv -180 equiv -16 pmod{41}   ]   Hence:   [   n^5 equiv -2^4 implies n^{40} equiv 2^{32} equiv 1 pmod{41}   ]   By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( 2^{40} equiv 1 pmod{41} ).

This results in a circle with residues modulo 2N+1 arranged starting from 1 in a clockwise direction.2. Restating the Game Rules:   When we reach a vertex initially labeled -t, instead of moving t steps counter-clockwise, we move 2N+1-t steps clockwise.

This implies that the sequence of residues t, 2t, 4t, ldots must cover all residues modulo 2N+1 before repeating.

(Armenia)","solution":"We show two strategies, one for Horst to place at least 100 knights, and another strategy for Queenie that prevents Horst from putting more than 100 knights on the board. A strategy for Horst: Put knights only on black squares, until all black squares get occupied. Colour the squares of the board black and white in the usual way, such that the white and black squares alternate, and let Horst put his knights on black squares as long as it is possible. Two knights on squares of the same colour never attack each other. The number of black squares is (20^2 / 2 = 200). The two players occupy the squares in turn, so Horst will surely find empty black squares in his first 100 steps.A strategy for Queenie: Group the squares into cycles of length 4, and after each step of Horst, occupy the opposite square in the same cycle. Consider the squares of the board as vertices of a graph; let two squares be connected if two knights on those squares would attack each other. Notice that in a (4 times 4) board the squares can be grouped into 4 cycles of length 4, as shown in Figure 1. Divide the board into parts of size (4 times 4), and perform the same grouping in every part; this way we arrange the 400 squares of the board into 100 cycles (Figure 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_6da854f21230b13cd732g-27.jpg?height=360&width=351&top_left_y=1579&top_left_x=310)Figure 1![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_6da854f21230b13cd732g-27.jpg?height=362&width=420&top_left_y=1578&top_left_x=772)Figure 2![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_6da854f21230b13cd732g-27.jpg?height=357&width=463&top_left_y=1578&top_left_x=1296)Figure 3The strategy of Queenie can be as follows: Whenever Horst puts a new knight to a certain square (A), which is part of some cycle (A-B-C-D-A), let Queenie put her queen on the opposite square (C) in that cycle (Figure 3). From this point, Horst cannot put any knight on (A) or (C) because those squares are already occupied, neither on (B) or (D) because those squares are attacked by the knight standing on (A). Hence, Horst can put at most one knight on each cycle, that is at most 100 knights in total.Comment 1. Queenie's strategy can be prescribed by a simple rule: divide the board into (4 times 4) parts; whenever Horst puts a knight in a part (P), Queenie reflects that square about the centre of (P) and puts her queen on the reflected square.Comment 2. The result remains the same if Queenie moves first. In the first turn, she may put her first queen arbitrarily. Later, if she has to put her next queen on a square that already contains a queen, she may move arbitrarily again."},{"problem":"Define A-B={x|xin A text{ and } xnotin B}.

Every previous point is the endpoint of two arcs, so each number appears exactly twice as an addend.

Initial Assumptions and Definitions:   - We are given a continuous function ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) such that (lim_{x rightarrow infty} f(x) = infty).   - For all ( x, y in mathbb{R} ) with ( |x - y| > varphi ), there exists ( n < varphi^{2023} ) such that ( f^n(x) + f^n(y) = x + y ).2. Claim: The only such continuous function is ( f(x) = x ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).3. Verification:   - Clearly, ( f(x) = x ) satisfies the given conditions. We need to show that this is the only function that satisfies these conditions.4. Fixed Point Argument:   - Suppose ( f ) has no fixed point. Then ( f(x) > x ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ) or ( f(x) < x ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ) due to continuity.   - Take any ( x, y ) with ( |x - y| > varphi ). There exists ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( f^n(x) + f^n(y) = x + y ).   - This implies ( f^n(x) - x = -(f^n(y) - y) ). By continuity, there exists ( r in [x, y] ) such that ( f^n(r) = r ).5. Contradiction:   - If ( f(x) > x ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ) or ( f(x) < x ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), then ( f^n(r) = r ) is impossible. Hence, ( f ) must have a fixed point, say ( a ).6. Interval Analysis:   - Consider the interval ( [a - varphi, a + varphi] ). Any ( r ) outside this interval satisfies ( |r - a| > varphi ) and thus has some ( n ) such that ( f^n(r) + f^n(a) = r + a ), implying ( f^n(r) = r ).7. Monotonicity and Injectivity:   - If ( f(x) = f(y) ) for some ( x, y ) not in the interval ( I = [a - varphi, a + varphi] ), then ( x = y ) because ( f^N(x) = x ) and ( f^N(y) = y ).   - Since ( f ) is injective and continuous over ( (a + varphi, infty) ), it follows that ( f ) is monotonous over it. Similarly, ( f ) is monotonous over ( (-infty, a - varphi) ).8. Behavior at Infinity:   - Since ( lim_{k rightarrow infty} f(k) = infty ), ( f ) is increasing over ( (a + varphi, infty) ).   - If ( f(x) > x ) for some ( x in (a + varphi, infty) ), then the sequence ( {f^i(x)}_{i geq 1} ) is unbounded, contradicting ( f^N(x) = x ). So ( f(x) leq x ) over this interval.9. Upper Bound Argument:   - Let ( M ) be an upper bound over all ( f(x) ) with ( x < a + varphi ). Pick ( x > M ) and consider ( {f^i(x)}_{i geq 1} ). Each term of this sequence is always less than ( x ), unless ( f(x) = x ). Since ( f^N(x) = x ), it must hold that ( f(x) = x ).10. Conclusion:    - By extending the argument, we see that ( f(x) = x ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = x } )."},{"problem":"If the function f(x)=2ln x+x^{2}-5x+c is a decreasing function in the interval (m,m+1), then the range of values for m is ______.","solution":"Given the function f(x)=2ln x+x^{2}-5x+c,We find its derivative: f'(x)= frac {2}{x}+2x-5,Since the function f(x) is decreasing in the interval (m,m+1),We have the following system of inequalities:begin{cases}frac {2}{m}+2m-5 leqslant 0  frac {2}{m+1}+2(m+1)-5 leqslant 0end{cases}Solving these inequalities, we get:frac {1}{2}leqslant mleqslant 1Therefore, the answer is:boxed{m in left[frac {1}{2},1right]}To solve this problem, we first find the derivative of the given function.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of permutations of the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2022}) such that for each number (k) in the permutation, the number of numbers less than (k) that follow (k) is even.2. Base Case:   Let's start with a smaller example to understand the pattern. For (n = 4), the set (S) of permutations is given as:   [   S = {[3, 4, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3]}   ]   We observe that each permutation satisfies the condition that for each (k), the number of numbers less than (k) that follow (k) is even.3. Inductive Step:   Assume that for (n = p), the number of such permutations is ((leftlceil frac{p}{2} rightrceil!)^2). We need to show that for (n = p + 1), the number of such permutations is ((leftlceil frac{p+1}{2} rightrceil!)^2).4. Inserting (p+1):   For all such permutations of ({1, 2, ldots, p}), we can insert (p+1) in (leftlceil frac{p+1}{2} rightrceil) places. This is because (1, 2, ldots, p) are all less than (p+1), and we need to maintain the condition that the number of numbers less than (k) that follow (k) is even.5. Counting the Permutations:   For (n = 2022), we can insert each number in (leftlceil frac{2022}{2} rightrceil = 1011) places. Therefore, the number of such permutations is:   [   1 times 1 times 2 times 2 times cdots times 1011 times 1011 = (1011!)^2   ]6. Finding (a) and (b):   Given (|S| = (a!)^b), we identify (a = 1011) and (b = 2).7. Calculating the Product (ab):   [   ab = 1011 times 2 = 2022   ]The final answer is (boxed{2022})."},{"problem":"13.

However, recognizing an error in transcription and correctly applying the ellipse properties, we see that b = 2 directly due to the given distance to the short axis endpoint. This doesn't immediately lead to c^2 + b^2 = 4; instead, it defines b directly.Given the distance from the right focus to the left vertex is 3, we express this as a + c = 3. This is because a is the semi-major axis, and c is the distance from the center to a focus, so their sum gives the distance from a focus to a vertex along the major axis.From a + c = 3, and knowing the relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse, which is a^2 = b^2 + c^2, we can solve for a and c.Given b = 2, we mistakenly deduced a^2 = 4 directly from the wrong application of the distance from the focus to the short axis endpoint.

Let x and y be the digits we will add to the numerator and denominator of the first fraction, respectively.

Since the number 9 x-4 y is at most two-digit, while the number N is twelve-digit, the order of the numerator C will depend on whether the factor (7-y+x) is zero or not. Therefore, we will consider these two possibilities separately.A. Case 7-y+x=0. Then y=x+7 and the numerator C is of the formC=|5 cdot 0 cdot N+(9 x-4 y)|=|9 x-4(x+7)|=|5 x-28| .Since the digit y (equal to x+7) is at most 9, the digit x is 0, 1, or 2, so the expression |5 x-28| equals 28, 23, or 18.

From the inequality 7-y+x neq 0 it follows that |7-y+x| geqq 1 (the number 7-y+x is an integer), so we haveC=|5 cdot(7-y+x) cdot N+9 x-4 y| geqq 5 cdot|7-y+x| cdot N-|9 x-4 y| geqq 5 N-|9 x-4 y| .Since x and y are digits, it is clear that |9 x-4 y| leqq 81. From the last estimate of C and the maximum value of D, it follows thatfrac{C}{D} geqq frac{5 N-81}{(7 N+9)(5 N+9)}The last fraction is \\"many times\\" larger than the fraction at the end of case A, because both fractions have the same denominator, while comparing the numerators clearly results in: 5 N-81 gg 18 (the inequality 5 N-81>18 holds for values of N geq 20).Conclusion: We will add the digit x=2 to the numerator and the digit y=9 to the denominator.GUIDING PROBLEMS:"},{"problem":"If the maximum value of the function f(x) = |asin x + bcos x - 1| + |bsin x - acos x| is 11, then a^{2} + b^{2} = ____.","solution":"To solve for a^{2} + b^{2} given the maximum value of the function f(x) = |asin x + bcos x - 1| + |bsin x - acos x| = 11, we proceed as follows:First, we express asin x + bcos x and bsin x - acos x in terms of sqrt{a^{2} + b^{2}} to simplify the expression of f(x).1.

The medians of the triangle A B C together with the segments K T, M T, and O T divide the hexagon K L M N O P into six congruent isosceles triangles. To justify this claim, it suffices to recognize the congruence of the corresponding sides of these triangles.Furthermore, the remaining parts of the triangle A B C can also be divided into six triangles congruent to the previous six triangles. As a possible justification for this claim, we can prove the congruence of triangles P K O and P K A using the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) theorem: Both triangles share the side P K. The sides K O and K A have the same length because they are the midline of the equilateral triangle A B C and half of its side. The angle P K O is one-fourth of the internal angle P K L of the regular hexagon K L M N O P, and thus measures 30^{circ}. The angle P K A is the complement of the angle L K B to a right angle, and thus also measures 30^{circ}.Thanks to the division of the triangle A B C into these twelve congruent triangles, we see that the ratio of the areas of the hexagon K L M N O P and the triangle A B C is 6: 12 = 1: 2, so the area of the hexagon K L M N O P isS = frac{1}{2} cdot 60 = 30 left(mathrm{~cm}^{2}right)Evaluation. 1 point for dividing the hexagon into the above-mentioned triangles and justifying their congruence; 3 points for any justification that the remaining triangles forming the triangle A B C are congruent to the previous ones; 1 point for comparing the areas of both given figures; 1 point for the result.Another solution.

From the diagram, we see that the regular hexagon K L M N O P consists of six congruent triangles, and the remaining part of the triangle A B C consists of six other congruent triangles. We will prove that these triangles have the same area as the previous ones, for example, by considering triangles N T O and C N O:The segment K C is a median of the triangle A B C. From the properties of the centroid and medians, it follows that |T C| = 2 cdot |K T|. Furthermore, in the regular hexagon K L M N O P, |N T| = |K T|. It is now clear that |C N| = |N T|. Triangles N T O and C N O thus have the same lengths of sides N T and C N and also the same corresponding height, so they must have the same area.Thanks to the division of the triangle A B C into twelve triangles of the same area, we see that the ratio of the areas of the hexagon K L M N O P and the triangle A B C is 6: 12 = 1: 2, so the area of the hexagon K L M N O P isS = frac{1}{2} cdot 60 = 30 left(mathrm{~cm}^{2}right)Evaluation. 2 points for explaining that |C N| = |N T|; 2 points for explaining that triangles N T O and C N O have the same areas; 1 point for comparing the areas of both given figures; 1 point for the result.Yet another solution.

The segment K C is a median of the triangle A B C and K T is one-third of it. Let b be the length of the side of the triangle A B C. From the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle K B C, we get|K T| = frac{1}{3} sqrt{b^{2} - frac{b^{2}}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{6} bSince the hexagon K L M N O P consists of six congruent equilateral triangles with side length |K T|, its area isS_{1} = 6 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{4} left(frac{sqrt{3}}{6} bright)^{2} = frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{3}{36} b^{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{8} b^{2}.The area of the triangle A B C is S_{2} = frac{1}{4} sqrt{3} b^{2}.

Here, ([ABC]) denotes the area of the triangle formed by points ( A, B, ) and ( C ).2. Using the Shoelace Theorem:   The area of a triangle with vertices at lattice points ( (x_1, y_1) ), ( (x_2, y_2) ), and ( (x_3, y_3) ) can be calculated using the Shoelace Theorem:   [   [ABC] = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right|   ]   For ( 2[ABC] ) to be an integer divisible by 5, the expression inside the absolute value must be divisible by 5.3.

When the table is completely filled, the final score is calculated as the difference O-X, where O is the total number of rows and columns containing more circles than crosses and X is the total number of rows and columns containing more crosses than circles.a) Prove that for a 2 times n table, the final score will always be 0.b) Determine the highest possible score achievable for a (2 n+1) times (2 n+1) table in dependence on n.","solution":"SOLUTION. a) In the entire part a), we will consider any described filling of a 2 times n table, which (considering the even number 2n of all cells) consists of n crosses and n circles. First, we will prove that in one of its two rows, crosses prevail if and only if in the other row, circles prevail. Both rows together thus contribute zero to the final score O-X.Let x_{1}, x_{2} be the number of crosses in the first and second row, respectively. According to the first sentence of our solution, we have x_{1} + x_{2} = n. Suppose that x_{1} > n / 2, meaning that crosses prevail in the first row. Then x_{2} = n - x_{1} < n / 2. Conversely, if x_{1} < n / 2, it follows that x_{2} > n / 2. We have thus proven that if crosses prevail in one row, then circles prevail in the other row. Analogously, it can be shown that if circles prevail in one row, then crosses prevail in the other row.Now we will prove that all n columns of the table (each with two cells) collectively contribute zero to the final score O-X. To do this, let x, r, o be the number of columns that contain two crosses (and no circles), one cross (and one circle), and two circles (and no crosses), respectively. As we know, the table contains a total of n crosses and n circles, so we have n = 2x + r and simultaneously n = r + 2o. By comparing these, we get the equality x = o, which tells us that the number of columns where crosses prevail is equal to the number of columns where circles prevail. Thus, the columns also collectively contribute zero to the final score O-X of the 2 times n table, and the solution to part a) is complete.b) For a given n, consider any filled 2n+1 times 2n+1 table. Since the number 2n+1 of cells in each row and column is an odd number, in each of them, one of the two symbols will prevail. The total number (2n+1)^2 of cells in the entire table is also an odd number, so there is one more cross than there are circles, making the number of circles frac{1}{2}((2n+1)^2 - 1) = 2n(n+1). Therefore, the number of rows where circles prevail (i.e., there are at least n+1 of them) is at most 2n(n+1) / (n+1) = 2n, and thus crosses prevail in at least one row. Similarly, we can explain that circles prevail in at most 2n columns, and crosses prevail in at least one column. Together, this means that O leq 2n + 2n = 4n and X geq 1 + 1 = 2, so the final score O-X cannot be greater than 4n - 2.Now we will prove that the score 4n - 2 can be achieved (for any n). From the reasoning in the previous paragraph, it follows that when a 2n(n+1)-element subset M of the cells of the (2n+1) times (2n+1) table is filled with circles, it will be an example of the desired filling: in 2n rows and 2n columns, there will be n+1 cells from M, and the remaining row and column will have no cells from M. Clearly, it is sufficient to find one such set M, as by appropriately writing crosses and circles, we can achieve that the cells with circles form the given 2n(n+1)-element set M - it is sufficient to write crosses outside M and circles inside M in any order.A suitable example for a 7 times 7 table (when n=3) is shown in Fig. 1. For a general n, the construction of the 2n(n+1)-element set M looks like this: In the last row and the last column of the (2n+1) times (2n+1) table, we do not select any cells for M; in the rows and columns of the remaining 2n times 2n square in the upper left \\"corner\\" of the original table, we select n+1 cells as follows: in the first row, the first n+1 cells, which in each subsequent row we shift one position to the right compared to the previous row, and cells from the last column of this sub-table are moved to the first column. This rule will apply even for the transition from the last row to the first row, so n+1 cells will be selected not only in each row but also in each column (a more general procedure is described in the guiding problem N1).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_bd202734538ab0b74df6g-02.jpg?height=500&width=508&top_left_y=909&top_left_x=774)Fig. 1Finally, note that the proven equality max (O-X) = 4n - 2 also holds for n=0, as the 1 times 1 table has only one filling (with one cross) with values O=0 and X=2.GUIDING AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROBLEMS:N1. Prove that for any two positive integers k leq n, all cells of an n times n table can be colored black and white such that in each row and each column, there are exactly k black cells. [Select a group of k black cells in the first row of the table arbitrarily. In each subsequent row, shift the black cells one position to the right compared to the current row, and move the cells from the last column to the first column. This will result in a suitable coloring, as if we label the black cells in the first row with numbers 1 to k and maintain them during the shifts in the subsequent rows, from the reasoning about the number of shifts between any two rows, it follows that in each column of the table, there will be exactly one cell with numbers 1 to k.]D1.

We need to find the value of frac{S_{4}}{S_{3}}.2. Let's denote the common difference of the arithmetic sequence as d. This means that each term in the sequence is d more than the previous term.3. Using the given S_{3} = a_{3}, we can write the sum of the first three terms as a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} = a_{3}. This simplifies to a_{1} + a_{2} = 0 because we subtract a_{3} from both sides.4. Expressing a_{2} in terms of a_{1} and d, we know that a_{2} = a_{1} + d. Substituting this into the equation a_{1} + a_{2} = 0, we get a_{1} + (a_{1} + d) = 0, which simplifies to 2a_{1} + d = 0. Solving for d, we find d = -2a_{1}.5. Calculating S_{3} in terms of a_{1}, we know that S_{3} = a_{1} + (a_{1} + d) + (a_{1} + 2d). Substituting d = -2a_{1} into this equation, we get S_{3} = a_{1} + (a_{1} - 2a_{1}) + (a_{1} - 4a_{1}) = a_{1} - a_{1} - 3a_{1} = -3a_{1}.6.

Take A={2 k mid k=505,506, mathrm{~L}, 1008} which satisfies the requirements. The following proves that 504 is the maximum value of n. Suppose A is a coalition subset with the maximum number of elements, A=left{a_{1}, a_{2}, mathrm{~L}, a_{n}right}. If a_{j} is the smallest number in set A, it is clear that a_{j}>1.

Now, replace a_{j} in A with 2 a_{j}, keeping the other elements unchanged, to form the subset A^{prime}. Then A^{prime} is still a coalition subset, because for any element a_{i} in A different from a_{j}, since a_{j} and a_{i} are not coprime, 2 a_{j} and a_{i} are also not coprime; further, 2 a_{j} and a_{i} do not have a divisibility relationship: since a_{j} square a_{i}, then 2 a_{j} square a_{i}; and if a_{i} mid 2 a_{j}, let 2 a_{j}=k a_{i} (clearly k neq 1,2, otherwise a_{i}, a_{j} have a divisibility relationship), then k>2, thus a_{i}<a_{j}, which contradicts the minimality of a_{j}!

First, when n=90, as shown in Figure 7, let AB be the diameter of odot O. Take 45 points near points A and B, respectively. At this time, there are only 2 mathrm{C}_{45}^{2}=45 times 44=1980 angles that do not exceed 120^{circ}. Therefore, n=90 does not satisfy the problem's requirements.Second, when n=91, we will prove that there are at least 2007 angles that do not exceed 120^{circ}.For 91 points A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{91} on the circumference, if angle A_{i} O A_{j}>120^{circ}, then connect A_{i} A_{j}, thus forming a graph G.

Suppose the polynomial can be factored asx(x+4)+aleft(y^{2}-1right)+2 b y=(A x+B y+C)(D x+E y+F)where A, B, C, D, E and F are real numbers. Since two polynomials are identical if and only if their corresponding coefficients are equal, and the coefficient of x^{2} in the original polynomial is 1, we have A D=1. Dividing the first linear factor by A and the second by D, we still get the factorization of the original polynomial into two first-degree polynomials, so it is sufficient to give the condition for the factorization into the formx(x+4)+aleft(y^{2}-1right)+2 b y=(x+u y+v)(x+p y+q)By comparing the corresponding coefficients, we get the following equations:begin{aligned}& y^{2}: a=u p & x y: 0=u+p & x: 4=v+q & y: 2 b=u q+v pend{aligned}text { constant: }-a=v qIf a=0, then from (1) and (2) we have u=p=0, and from (4) it follows that the factorization is only possible if b=0 (in this case, however, the original polynomial is not bivariate). If a neq 0, then from (1) we have u neq 0. From (2) we get p=-u, substituting this into (1) and (4) we get a=-u^{2} and 2 b=u(q-v). From the latter, q-v=2 b / u follows, and from (3) we have q=2+b / u and v=2-b / u. Finally, substituting these into (5) we get-a=left(2-frac{b}{u}right)left(2+frac{b}{u}right)=4-frac{b^{2}}{u^{2}}=4-frac{b^{2}}{-a}that is, a^{2}=-4 a-b^{2}, or (a+2)^{2}+b^{2}=4. This is the equation of a circle k with center (-2,0) and radius 2. Therefore, if the polynomial can be factored, then the point (a ; b) lies on k.Conversely, if we take any point (c ; d) on k, then c leq 0 holds. If c=0, then d=0 also holds. The pair (0 ; 0) corresponds to the obviously factorable polynomial x(x+4).

Using coordinate geometric methods, the necessary condition given in the first solution can also be shown with slightly less calculation. However, with the following reasoning, we cannot prove the sufficiency of the condition.Apply the linear substitution x=w-2, y=z+1. ThenP(x, y)=x(x+4)+aleft(y^{2}-1right)+2 b y=w^{2}+a z^{2}+2(a+b) z+2 b-4=Q(w, z)Since a first-degree polynomial is obtained from a first-degree polynomial by a linear substitution, P(x, y) can be factored into the product of two first-degree polynomials if and only if Q(w, z) can be factored.Consider the points in the plane that satisfy the equation Q(w, z)=0. IfQ(w, z)=(A w+B z+C)(D w+E z+F)then these points form the linesA w+B z+C=0 quad text { and } quad D w+E z+F=0Since the coefficient of w^{2} in Q(w, z) is 1, we have A D=1 for the coefficients in the factorization, so neither of the lines is parallel to the w coordinate axis.If a=0 and b neq 0, thenz=-frac{1}{2 b} w^{2}-1+frac{2}{b}which is the equation of a parabola, so in this case the polynomial cannot be factored into linear factors. If, however, a=b=0, then Q(w, z)=w^{2}, which can clearly be factored, for example, as w cdot w. In this case, the two lines coincide.If a neq 0, then Q(w, z) contains a z^{2} term, so both linear factors must contain a term of the form c z where c neq 0 is a real number. This means that neither of the lines corresponding to the factors is parallel to the z coordinate axis, so for every real number d, the line z=d intersects the set of points defined by Q(w, z)=0. Rearranging the equation Q(w, z)=0, we getw^{2}=-a z^{2}-2(a+b) z-2 b+4Since w^{2} geq 0, the quadratic polynomial on the right-hand side (since a neq 0) cannot take a negative value for any z=d, because that would mean that the line z=d does not intersect the set of points defined by Q(w, z)=0. On the other hand, the line w=0 is not parallel to the lines forming the set of points, so it intersects the set of points, i.e., the equation-a z^{2}-2(a+b) z-2 b+4=0has a root. These two conditions are satisfied simultaneously if and only if the discriminant of equation (6) is 0. Therefore, if Q(w, z) can be factored into linear factors, then(-2(a+b))^{2}-4(-a)(-2 b+4)=0, quad text { i.e., } quad(a+2)^{2}+b^{2}=4Remark. The sufficiency of the condition can also be obtained from the second solution, but for this, a deeper knowledge of conic sections given by quadratic equations is necessary. Write the polynomial P(x, y) in matrix form as follows:(x+4)+aleft(y^{2}-1right)+2 b y=(x, y, 1) M(x, y, 1)^{T}whereM=left(begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 2 0 & a & b 2 & b & -aend{array}right)It is a known theorem that the polynomial can be factored over the complex numbers if and only if det M=0.
