I would like to know what could be the reasons behind my chronic lightheaded-ness (whole day), unbalanced feeling, feeling faint, cold feet, and fatigiue. I am taking Stugeron for the motion sickness, Nexium and gasmotin for my GERD and Multivitamins.. A couple of months back, I was rushed to the hospital a couple of times due to a holiday heart syndrome. I was woken up a couple of times from my sleep due to numbness in both of my hands. Sometimes its just my pinky, at times my whole hands, either or both of my hands. I have been feeling detached from my body, which gives me a sense of blankness in my body. I feel as if I don't have full control of my body. I am very scared that I may have cancer or some sort of terminal disease. I also do have lumps in my neck. One in about 1 cm under my chin, and another one under the right side of my jaw, 2 cm. Both are wiggly, but are fixed. My EENT told me that it is nothing to be worried about. Should I see a neuro for this? or a cancer specialist? cardio? All of my test came back normal. CBC, Holter, Stress test, abdomen ultrasound. I am happy that they're all okay, but none of these test are invasive or aggressive enough to have an in depth look on my body.

It happens due to inflammation of the plantar fascia.It hurts the most with the first few steps in the morning because the plantar fascia is tight and has not stretched out yet, and throughout the day it loosens up. The best thing you can do is when you wake up in the morning, before getting out of bed and taking a step, give yourself a little foot rub.There are many things you can try to help your foot get better:Give your feet a rest. Cut back on activities that make your feet hurt. Try not to walk or run on hard surfaces.Use shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole.take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), naproxen (such asAleve), or aspirin.Do toe stretches, calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day, especially when you first get up in the morningI do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hello Sir, I am an epileptic patient from the age of 3 years.

They removed a section of the right temporal lobe, the hippocampus, and amygdala. I've been on anti-depressant's and anti-anxiety meds since. After many anti-depressants did not help, I was put on Amitriptyline. I take Diazepam for anxiety. With my depression, I had severe insomnia. My Psychiatrist slowly increased Amitriptyline dose and tried adding several meds with it to help sleep and depression. I cannot take Ambien or Lunesta. She tried Trazidone, Ritalin, & when they didn't help, she raised my Amitriptyline all the way up to 200 mg. So I was at 200 mg Amitriptyline and 20 mg of Diazepam at night. I started having uncontrollable muscle spasms when I sat or tried to lay down. She added 3 mg Requip, & then had to up it to 6 mg at bedtime. After concerns over the high dose of Amitriptyline, she lowered it to 150 mg at night and added 10 mg of Celexa. About a week after being put on medicine, I started having problems. Raised BP, cold & shivering, etc. My Psych wouldn't return a call for 3 days in a row, so my pharmacist sent me to the ER where I was diagnosed with drug toxicity. The ER dr had me stop Celexa for 3 days, and then take it every other night until my neurologist could see me. I had to cancel first appt. with my neurologist because I was too sick to drive. I have lowered my Amitriptyline to 100 mg and take the 10 mg of Celexa everyday now, & 20 mg of Diazepam at night. I stopped the Requip. For several weeks I've had problems with dizziness & falling, especially if I bend over and stand up, or kneel down & stand up. It doesn't matter how slow I move. If I take the meds, I sleep anywhere from 3 to 5 hrs a night. skipped meds one night so I could try taking them in the day. I slept for 15 hours. Tried this a few times, same results.

I went to ER, x-ray & CT scan were clean. I saw my neurologist, he did an MRI and EEG. Both were normal. After being put on Requip, I went back to him.

Baby was brought on day 4 of life with convulsions and hypoglycaemia and seizures. He was given ventilator support, Fluid boluses was given , followed by maintainace IV fluids with which blood glucose came under control. Baby had increased CRP with decreased platelet count and deranged coagulation profile. Sepsis was suspected. IV antibiotics was given. Baby was also given platelets and FFP transfusion. In V/o Hypocalcaemia, IC calcium was given. Baby had decreased urine output and increased S. Creatinine on admission which improved with IV fluids. With the above management, baby improved and was extubated on day 4 of stay. He required supplemental oxygen for the next few days. In v/o episodes of seizures followed by decreased activity, EEG done, which showed parieto-occipetal discharges. Phenobarbitone was given as per advice of Neurologist, Dr. Shekhar Patil. USG cranium was normal. CSF analysis done after platelet count and coagulopathy normalised, showed increased protein. MRI brain was done which showed bilateral cortical fronto parietal and temporal cortical hyperdeintensities with underlying mild diffuse oedema. There is restricted diffusion seen in the bilateral fronto parietal white matter with restricted diffusion in the corpus callosum. This could represent acute brain injury with cytotoxic oedema. Dr. Shekhar Patil opinion taken, he suggested leukoencephalopathy due to sepsis? Hypoxia? Metabolism. To repeat MRI brain at 6 weeks of Age (01/02/2014). IV antibiotics given for 21 days.

She was under different medications at different times(tegretol,mazetol, diazepam and eptoin) along with deworming and vitamins. Medications were apparently stopped by the parents for reasons known to them. My questions are 1. Did the seizure happen because of the medicines being abruptly stopped?2. What are the side effects of long term usage of the medicines ?3. Will the calcification disappear eventually?4. What are the potential dangers for future life?","Doctor":"Hi,1. Seizures are often precipitated on stopping antiepileptics. So theanswer is yes2. Long list of side effects like liver,bone,blood problems, skinrash, gum swelling . But dangers of the disease eclipse the sideeffects. And blood levels should be measured so that she does not getexcess drugs.3. Calcification is unlikely to disappear.4. If seizures are effectively controlled and she has regular checkupsfuture will not be a problem. But she will have to be careful inpregnancy and take extra folate. And she will not be able to drive orhandle dangerous machinery.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi , my son is 16and 5ft 9 . Normally fit and well. Not anxious. For 3 weeks has been feeling nauseous , sometimes vomited. He's had  full blood count , urine test and all clear. In the past he's had absence seizures and cluster headaches that he's grown out of. Paediatrician thought they could have been related to brain growth / hormones. In between his episodes of nausea ( 2/3 a day ) he feels well. Could this be due to growth spurt again / testosterone surge ?

One doctor said I would be on the medication for the rest of my life. What should I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for query.generally discontinuation of medication is considered  after a person has been seizure free for typically 2-5 years, neurologists use the risk factors for new-onset seizures to assess patients for discontinuation of anticonvulsants. Normal findings on an electroencephalogram (EEG) and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan lower the risk of relapse after drug discontinuation.so consult a neurologist as your doctor advised.as you mention you seizures were acquired due to diet pill your EEG and MRI would probably  be normal and he may ask to taper and stop  the drugs.regards"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis in 2010.

I will try my best to answer your queryWhat happens is that the nervous system is usually an enclosed organ system, for its protection, and it is quite snugly fit. so there is not much space in the region around the nervous system.Now when there is something extra in this space, like fluid or mass, the space remains limited and the substance in the limited space increases. I hope you are with me in this so far.Now when the contents increase and the space remains limited the pressure will increase. Imagine a box full of water bottles. If you try to stuff in one more bottle, the possibility is that the added bottle will pressurize and possibly damage the existing bottles in the box. This is what is happening. The idea is to put a shunt. A shunt is a tube between the brain, and usually the stomach cavity. Now with this shunt in place, the fluid keeps draining and so the pressure does not increase.I would like to know the exact report of the mriI hope this helps you.

The granuloma usually shrinks in size, but it may not resolve completely.Another possibility is of a neurocysticersosis. This is treated with albendazole and steroids for a period of 14 to 21 days.

The most common cause of a seizure postpartum is related to preeclampsia.  She was certainly at risk for this related to pregnancy and twins.  There should be a workup to determine that there are no other causes of the seizures.  If the cause is felt to be clearly related to preeclampsia, then typically there is not treatment beyond following her until the preeclampsia has resolved.  Her recovery is otherwise the same as for others who have delivered, perhaps slightly longer given that she had twins and was still having problems 1-2 weeks after delivery.  I strongly recommend that she discuss this specifically with her doctor as this is a complicated situation.

He might have a slow moving disease that acts like ALS but you can live up to 10-15 years instead of the 2-5 years with onset of ALS. I was trying to find the disease that he might have.

Part of it was removed last spring and then radiation over the summer.  He is also on Paxil for depression.  In the past few months, he has been experiencing some strange side effects.  Among these:  strange dreams, confusing dreams with reality, confusion, memory lapses, increased interest in religion and overwhelming thoughts of the past (childhood memories, teenage years, his 20s, memories of his parents, etc.).  We are wondering if these symptoms are more likely to be from the Paxil (I've read a great deal of negative info regarding this drug) or the brain tumour.  Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi,In my opinion, the symptoms that you have described are not due to Paxil but are due to the brain tumour and the treatment he received for it. It appears that he is developing cognitive impairment due to the radiation he received for the tumour as well as the surgery. The cognitive impairment can gradually progress to dementia and is common in people treated with radiation for brain tumours. Symptoms usually improve with anticholinesterase medicines like donepezil.

One sunday after coming home from church I just collapsed in our bedroom.  It was as if I was in a trance.  Sat that way for several hours.   Then went into a type of siesure.   Arms moving in all directions ,   eyes going to the back of my head.  Head drawing back.  Legs acting if I was a string doll.  Lasted for 2 to 3 hours.  In a little while it started over again.  Next day arrived at the emergency room .  They didn't know what to do with me so sent me home.  Told me to go to a physicologist.   I did.  Went to several of them.  They said it was not a mental problem that it was physical.     Visit 3 Neurologist,   they said nothing showed up.  And all the while they could see the episodes for themselves.  MRI'S   Several Scans,   Blood work tested for everythink you can imagine.  After 4 months of visiting Ga Doctors  My parents decided to take me to the Mayo Clinic in Fla.  We stayed a week.  One test, One Dr.  after another.   2 visits to the emergency room with severe  episodes.  2weeks later returned for results of the test.   ...    Nothing showed up.  They had no answers for me.   Had to get around in a wheel chair and a walker.  Came home very discouraged and still having the siesures.  2 or 3 a day.  Many times my husband had to call the EMT's out because I would pass out.Finally went to a Physocologist and he prescribe a nerve pill for me to help with the strong hold the episodes had on me when I was drawing for hours.   He said all he could do was to treat the symptoms.  Thank God for such a kind man.  I had been going to Dr. for months and they had given me nothing to help get me through this horrible.By now my family leave had ran out and I lost my job.   I cannot drive a car, and have not since that first episode.I cannot walk around the block.   knowing I could pass out.

The prognosis is best for those who maintain close monitoring with the treating doctors and who incorporate physical activities designed to maintain mobility.

First, what can a nephrologist do to help my 87 year old mother with an unexplained low sodium problem? Her GP wants her to see one and the appointment is set for next Tuesday. I understand that a nephrologist deals with acute kidney problems which has not been a problem for my mother. And second, is there any reason why I can t use salt tablets to help keep the sodium up until we see this doctor? Previously, my mother s GP and neurologist have looked at the medicines she s taking to no avail. Her neurologist has said that the low sodium led to a few of her seizures. My mother is a heart patient with an irregular heart beat. She had a pacemaker put in several years ago and had surgery to put in a stint in 2001. In addition to this, she s a Type II diabetic, has significant arthritis in her shoulders, knees, and hands, and - in the past 2 years- has had 4 seizures with 2 prior seizures that were misdiagnosed as TIAs by her former doctor. She has frequent headaches in the area where the seizures have a occurred. The medicine she takes is as follows: Omeprazole DR- 1 tab (40 mg) taken - AM Digoxin- 1/2 of a 250 mcg tab taken - AM Isosorbide DN- 10 mg 2x per day Metoprolol Tartrate- 1/2 of a 25 mg tab 2x per day Pradaxa - 150 mg tab 2x per day Levetiracetem (Keppra) - 750 mg 2x per day Loperamide (Immodium over-the-counter) - 250 mg as needed for diaahrea I ve been able to keep her blood sugar down but she has sudden bouts of diaahrea, which we know can cause sodium and dehydration problems. We had a renal panel done yesterday and the results came back today saying her sodium was down to 128. She has seizures at 126. I wanted to give her sodium tablets but her GP said not to do that until she sees the nephrologist. In the meantime her GP knows that I am concerned that she will have another seizure. Any information or advice you could give me would be very helpful. Thank you, in advance, for your time. K. Dennison","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query regarding your mother.I agree that nephrologist deals with kidney problems, but he also deals with abnormalities in sodium or potassium levels (as these abnormalities are common in patients with kidney problems).I also agree with you that there is no harm in increasing the salt in her diet to improve her sodium level. However, we have to cautious as giving her more sodium can also worsen her heart status.Her current medications seem to be fine and can be continued. I hope my answer helps.

I am 67 years old, but am diabetic from an acute case of pancreatitis, take high blood pressure pills and cholestral meds.  My blood work was good low blood pressure from meds.  My MRI said:\\"Brain parenchyma:  Numerous small foci and some patchy confluent areas of hyperintense T2/FLAIR signal are present thout the cerebral hemispheric white matter with relative sparing of the temporal lobes and infratentorial brain panchenchyma in a pattern most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.

The underlying risk factors for these lesions in your case are blood sugar, high BP and cholesterol.

The more likely cause is that you may have both the conditions together.This is because both migraine and seizure have common underlying mechanisms and frequently co-exist in the same individual.The best medicine for seizure control in your case would be divalproex or sodium valproate tablets, as they have anti-seizure as well as anti-migraine properties.

Recently I have been experiencing neurological symptoms such as memory problems, difficulty multitasking, trouble with word recall, difficult processing information, widespread pain (neck, back, hips, eyes, knees), insomnia, feelings of pins jagging me, itching, tingling in my extremities, severe motion sickness and many others.  I have had testing by a urologist for incontinence.  The physical exam, urodynamics test, urinalysis, and bladder exam with scope have all come back normal.  These symptoms have progressed over the past 15 months so much that I have requested a sick leave from my job.  I am seeing a neurologist and having an EEG in 3 days.  I have stopped taking Cymbalta, which is prescribed to treat anxiety and depression, because I am wondering if the drug is treating an undiagnosed medical condition such as Fibromyalgia or MS.

They are varied symptoms and would suggest to me that you need some general investigations including bloods and an ECG to start with. A healthy diet should contain enough vitamins so that you do not need to take vitamin pills.

Welcome to HCM. Spinal tap also called a lumbar puncture, a procedure in which the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (called the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) is withdrawn through a needle and examined in a lab. Approximately 10% to 20% of people develop a spinal headache (one that worsens when sitting or standing). Avoid strenuous or vigorous exercise for a day or so following the lumbar puncture. If you have a headache, lay down as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids. Headaches usually lasts for 3-4 days. In some cases it might take a long time to subside.I suggest u to consult your treating doctor if its worsening. Dont forget to drink lots of fluids (also consume caffiene products like coffe, tea).

I've been having a really challenging time with a slew of symptoms that are getting progressively worse, but come in waves. MY family doctor refuses to take me seriously, saying it's all in my head and I'm too young to be really ill. I know these aren't psychosomatic, and it is really affecting my quality of life, as I am a very happy, energetic woman but am being brought down physically. Here is a chronological lsit wof what's been going on (I know it's long, but it's all relevant):  - Migraines from early teens, increasing in frequency to about monthly, slight headaches almost daily (advil)- Had CT for these in ’10 & ’11 as they were extreme, non-contrast and nothing showed- Recently starting to get random spasms with them- Low platelets and hgb/always cold and easy bruising for the past 5+ years- Periods of near-constant dizziness (not vertigo) started in ’09, lasting for weeks/month+. Goes away and comes back- Recently dizzy periods worsening and accompanied by unexplained, daily nausea- Inner-ear problem ruled out but ENT and audiology- ’09 started getting sharp pains down neck and back, especially during dizzy times- Numbness, stiffness esp. on left side. Very easy to lose feeling/circulation- Often get sensation of skin being very sore to touch, tender like I’ve been beaten up- Feel very fatigued, increasingly. Very happy and energetic mentally but body stopping me- Started getting wobbly at work and in school clinical- Camping 2012- was very dizzy and tired/nauseated and woke up one morning constantly vomiting, whole body slowly went numb up to my face- undiagnosed- Summer 2013- first time working hard out of school. Really noticed an increase in wobbly/weakness/dizziness. Collapsed one day from sheer weakness/exhaustion. Muscles all cramped and spasmed again. Cardiology found two murmurs and bedside echo showed leaky valves.- Formal echo showed nothing indicating a reason for symptoms. Carotid bruit to be investigated. Was told to see neurologist but cardiology did not give referral- Started thinking heart palpitations and chest pain may be nerve pain (considering left-sided issue)- Recently strength has decreased and mild tremor. Severe migraines over Christmas with even worse nausea and dizziness than before, pain and difficulty lifting left arm (weakness/pain)-extreme fatigue, no matter how well I sleep!- Feel cognitively “foggy” when symptoms exacerbate, difficulty concentrating and mild memory lapses (will repeat myself or not notice what someone is saying)- Jerky movements, just slight, in hands/face/feet (keep dropping things, flinging a pen)- About three years now, noted mild stress urinary incontinence when symptoms flare up- Eyesight is depleting rapidly, not as sharp-the sharp nerve pains are increasing and making it hard to do my job.- Decrease in symptoms for several months but still fatigued and weak with random shooting pains, dizziness does not entirely go away.- Over Christmas, increasing extreme dizziness with constant whooshing sound in head. Couldn’t lay flat as it felt terrible. Accompanied by string of migraines.Again I apologize for the length. I don't have an appointment with a neurologist for four months, and just want to have an idea of what COULD be going on, if anything. Even if to take some OTC meds prior. /all sources are directing me towards a neuro-degenerative disorder, such as MS, which honestly, I don't care WHAT it is, I jsut want someone to help :( Thank you so much for your time!","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.It is unfortunate that you are suffering from so many problems at such a young age, and no diagnosis has been made so far.I have noted your symptoms in detail, and I agree with you that they are not psychosomatic in nature.

I have a long history of an anxiety disorder, and severe migraines. I have a history of breast cancer, and a CT scan came back negative for tumor. The first time I thought I had a severe anxiety attack because at the time I was home along, but I still do not know what happened that caused me to cause an ambulance for myself. Very untypical of me as I would never go to the hospital for myself unless absolutely necessary. On a 1/2 of this past week it happened in front of my boyfriend and what he described was not passing out, not anxiety, it was a seizure. One minute I was sitting up at my desk talking to him, and the next thing I knew I was sitting on an ottoman in my house and he had called an ambulance. He said I was dead....I went into convulsions, I curled my hands and moaned, my body became rigid/almost hard, foam came from my mouth and my face was contorted, then I got very quiet. That is when he thought I had quit breathing. The ER person on the phone with him told him to feel my chest and check if I was breathing and he may need to begin CPR if I wasn t. He said they would talk him through it. Just when he went to check me I flew up off the floor and against the wall. He put me on the ottoman, which is flat, and sat there with me until the ambulance arrived. He said I was moving his fingers apart and pulling on them in a strange manner. I remember nothing....all I remember is he was trying to talk to me but I did not understand what he was telling me, what had happened, and why it seemed we were going somewhere but I couldn t figure out why. He held the picture of my niece/nephews up to my face (a picture I fell up against and hit with my head), and I had no idea who they were. I knew my name, but I did not know my boyfriend s name - and we have been together for 7 years. I didn t know where I was. I used to take medication for chronic pain management for something like 10 years (started with severe migraines in my early 30 s as well, then degenerative disc disease in my c-spine and l-spine. My Oncologist (who had treated me for breast cancer in 1995 and dealt in palliative medicine, was all too willing to write my pain medications until they started cracking down on them....now it is a lot more difficult and I have had to take Tramadol instead. Now I wonder if the Tramadol is causing this.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.The description of the episodes seem like convulsions or seizures.Tramadol increases the risk of getting seizures.

However the primary refused to consult him and then told my father that plavix is not an antiplatelet. A neurosurgeon was consulted in and he recommended no blood thinners, repeat CT in one month ( after the 2nd one showed an increase in the bleed and another small area of bleed).

They are both contraindicated in patients with recent bleeding in the brain.On the other hand, if we do not start the anti-platelets, then, there is a risk of getting heart attack.So, the benefit of using plavix should be weighed against the risk of bleeding.In patients with recent bleeding in the brain, it is generally safe to start plavix or any other anti platelet agent after two weeks.

I have had a MRI which showed no pinched nerves, nor narrowing of the spine......any suggestions.   Medications don't seem to assist in alleviating the pain.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.Generally, sudden and  sharp pain from the spine suggests that it is originating from the soft tissue structures like muscles or  ligaments. Propably, your sudden sharp pain may be attributed to an abnormal stretching of the paraspinal muscles or ligaments owing to an odd posture of your spine while sitting or sleeping.Use of analgesic medications and ocassional muscle relaxants will help in alleviating your pain. Gentle local massaging of the painful area with a painkiller cream will provide good symptomatic relief.Apply ice to the painful area and after any activity. Ice will help calm the inflammatory response and stimulate blood flow to the area.Before activities, gentle heating can help loosen the muscle. Apply a heat pack to the painful area prior to stretching or exercising. As a general rule of thumb, remember to heat before an activity and ice afterwards.Therapeutic modalities such as Ultrasound, Massaging and specific exercises will be helpful.Hope this information is helpful.

Not sure what shot it will be.. but little nervous it may have same ingredients or similar to the epinephrine injection.","Doctor":"Anaphylactic / Allergic shock is caused whenever the heart is unable to pump enough blood throughout the body due to an allergic reaction, weakening of the heart muscle, or shrinking of the veins (vasodilation).  Injection of epinephrine into the blood stream will cause an increase of blood flow throughout the body.  While epinephrine/ adrenaline does increase aortic, cerebral, and carotid circulation pressure, it lowers carotid blood flow and end-tidal CO2 or ETCO2 levels which may lower seizure threshold. Its one of the reason many video games and action movies have seizure warning because when we are excited adrenaline is released from Adrenal grands that results lower seizure threshold. Strong emotions such as fear or anger cause epinephrine to be released into the bloodstream, which causes an increase in heart rate, muscle strength, blood pressure, and sugar metabolism.  This reaction, known as the “Flight or Fight Response” prepares the body for strenuous activity.  Many patients had adverse reaction which which have warranted action by the FDA to attempt to ban this drug."},{"Patient":"I am having a sciatic pain for the las 3 Months i went to a chiropractic  and i was told a disc in my back pinched a nervs and i had a lot inflamtion i had taken inflamation medicine is got better but it does not go awy and i can not live with this pain anymore i have not had a good nite sleep in 3 months please help do not what to do","Doctor":"Dear Sir , Well looking into your problem it is advisable to you to consider surgical option for decompressing the nerve. .

When it happened, it was during the night in my sleep(I remember feeling very unusual during my sleep). When I woke up, I couldn't see out of my left eye(it was like a white-grey covering was over it), my left side of my face was droopy, I felt extremely agitated without having an emotional cause for it and my speech was slurred. After they ran tests at the hospital, they couldn't find anything like a blood clot but thought I could have had a \\"mini-stroke\\". The doctor at that time asked me if I had ever been checked for MS because I was a seemingly healthy 35 year old. I said no, and they scheduled me for a specialist. After going to the specialist, they didn't see lesions in my brain, but they did find the proteins in my spinal fluid. I was placed on prednisone at that time. A month later, they did another spinal tap and it didn't show anything. I was having side effects from the prednisone that seemed to make the symptoms worse so I went off of it. The doctor started treating me symptom specific with cortisone shots in my feet to help the pain that would cause balance issues. I was also placed on a pain medication related to feet that caused temporal seizures during my sleep( I can't remember the name). I went off of this and started taking biofeedback and pain management classes with meditation and yoga that seemed to help and also lost 50 pounds. This seemed to help me keep it under control for about 5 years until I started having tremoring in my left hand(my middle finger seems to be especially affected), strange, severe pains in my knees and elbows, tingling in the elbows and knees but also in my big toe joints, but also this weird tremoring feeling during the night that seemed to start from my trunk/abdomen area and radiate out to my extremities. I got checked for MS, Lupus, and Rheumatoid arthritis. Nothing was found. I still have this off and on but now over the last year on my left leg it swells by the ankle and I have this burning topical pain when I touch it. I will also get this pain in the front of my neck and radiating with both arms.

Since it has appeared, he has pain, pressure (on the superficial surface of the ear, as well as deep inside the ear), headaches, dizziness, pain in his jaw and -- worst of all -- seizures. A quick look in his ear + CT scan + MRI (no contrast) and EEG all showed nothing. An ENT and neurologist could not figure it out. A dermatologist injected medication into the lump (blindly guessing that would work). At first, it made things worse, but then the lump went down and the pain, pressure and seizures stopped for about 6 weeks. Then the lump grew again and the symptoms, including seizures, all came back. The neurologist suggested yet another ENT visit, but my fiance has become despondent and resigned to certain death, not believing anyone can find, identify and/or cure what's in his head. I see him holding his head in his sleep and pulling on his ear and I witness the seizures. The neurologist he saw believes they are seizures but has no idea why or what the ear connection could be. Or why nothing showed up on the MRI or CT scan. Have you ever heard of anything like this? What could it be and what tests might be able to see what's going on where MRI and CT scan have failed??","Doctor":"HI Thank for asking to HCMThe symptoms stated here and the lesion or lump are not at all related with each other the seizure could be hysteric attack and having functional elements instead of going to have advise from surgeon he should be taken to psychiatrist, there he will get alright, take care of him and have good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a 90 yr old friend who had congestive heart failure a year ago in November.

However, since your daughter has never had any problems in the past after blood donation, two episodes of seizure-like fainting attacks, followed by prolonged headache (could have be post-ictal headache) warrants a neurologist's opinion.An MRI of the brain along with EEG-if required- may be done to rule out an underlying, asymptomatic seizure disorder. Seizure disorder would be ruled out conclusively if both : MRI and EEG are negative.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion.

Sadly I cannot pay for this, I ll just go back to my GP on NHS Thank you for your time","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM!I have  read the question carefully and from my clinical experince I can say that almost all problems - hair fall, wrist weakness, iron deficiency, and depression , are related to thyroid deficiency in your case.It is well established fact that hypo thyroidism, I.e.,  high TSH, and low T 3 & T4 levels, are related to hair fall, weight gain, increase lipid, lethargy, low mood, weakness, calcium loss, and low iron. the wrist problem or any bony problem. can occur in you as parathyroid gland are also removed when thyroid is removed. Get calcium & phosphorus levels done, along with TSH regularly.I think you need to increase the thyroxine supplement and use more of iodised foods , like- salt. Avoid vegetables like- cabbage, ect, as they increase the problem further.you have been taking iron supplement, along with that you may get help by eating jaggery, more of green leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, nuts, to increase formation of iron and blood. Iton is absorbed more when taken with citrus fruits or water, in empty stomach, never with milk.You may start calcium suppleamt for wrist weakness. Continue with antidepressant, as this will help you.For your hair, you may start a good multivitamin, vitamin A, and most important is thyroid supplement.So, meet your doctor and get adequate thyroid medicines for your self, this is the most important drug for all your problems.Hope the reply is useful for youget well soon!Dr. Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"Hi, i m worried about my boyfriend.

From all data provided, it is evident that your boyfriend has some psychotic illness, may be due to excessive use of drugs.Diagnosing schizophrenia needs more detail information from patients or attendant. like if he mutters / smiles to self, etc. Schizophrenia is also a type of psychosis. you have not mentioned about treatment , so I assume he is not taking any medicine regularly for any problem.There is mentioning of suspiciousness, sudden unprovoked anger outbursts, along with short attention span-- reflect the deteriorating mental health. I have seen such cases showing good improvement with medicines. Stopping cannabis completely will also be very helpful for him. Cannabis is notorious to cause variety of psychiatric disorders.If it is possible, take him to a psychiatrist, and start medicines, also get some basic tests done- lipid profile  sugar, liver tests, kidney test. You may also take help of some common friend and his family to persuade him initially , with time and with medicines his aggression, suspiciousness will go down and he will start accepting medicines wilfully.There is provision of depot antispychotics for uncooperative patients in psychiatry.

I am writing to inquire about a hard, cyst like bump on the back of my neck. I have adhesive arachnoiditis (L-4 to S-1) and am pretty used to putting up with pain, however, I recently noticed this lump while brushing my hair and became concerned. I have night sweats (I also have arach related hyperhydrosis) and brushed it off because of my age (47). My vision has become horrible, and I am now getting headaches I also get quite dizzy when I touch it. Prior to arach, I was so healthy I didn t even have a family physician, and very rarely get a headache, so I am wondering if there is cause for concern. Thank you in advance! Chrisitne P","Doctor":"Hi,There are many causes of lumps on the scalp and most of then are not serious. You need to have the lump examined to make a diagnosis. Therefore, I suggest you see your doctor for this. I think it is unlikely to be related to your vision disturbances or your adhesive arachnoiditis.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB  FRCA"},{"Patient":"I am a 24 year old female.

I suggest you see a physiotherapist who will be able to examine your back and posture to assess whether there are any abnormalities. The physio may be able to suggest appropriate exercise to help improve your posture. Spinal surgery is a major operation and not useful for correction of minor abnormalities or the spine.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB  FRCA"},{"Patient":"I had a c section 8 weeks ago due to placenta praevia and very risky complications.

I have an enlarged lymph node on the right side of the nape of my neck.  It is painful and the size of a marble.  This is the third time this exact spot has swollen caused pain and I've taken some form of antibiotic.  The first two times (in 2012) it went away before I was even finished taking the prescription.  Now I'm on the last day of the prescription and it still hurts and I think the swelling has increased.

I've been to the doctor about the chest pain but they are baffled because everything tests out ok.

The coiling shifted a bit and there was another aneurysm in the same area so the stent protected the artery for both aneurysms and no coiling was needed.

I know (in advance) that you cannot give medical advice or make decisions for a faceless individual contacting you online, but i've reached (what I believe to be) a serious stage. Over the past year and a half, i've suffered from... 1. random, intermittent sharp (sometimes dull) pains in my head, in the same areas: A.top center left and /or left temple near eye B. and the same on the right side C. some occasional sharp pains behind the eyes D. and rear right sharp pain (rear head). E. Strangest of all, random \\"cool\\" spots in the skin surface (or maybe just beneath it) at a couple places on the head. I also have three conditions: Multiple Sclerosis, a occasional regurgitating bicuspid heart valve (my cardiologist says it is not life threatening) and high blood pressure. HBP was dignosed in 2001, MS in 1999. HBP is treated with Atenolol (25mg) and Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg). MS is treated with Rebif. My BP is rarely elevated and is considered managed. I take daily vitamins, and do not eat wheat, sugars or junk food (including sweetened sports drinks). I only drink water. Oops, by the way, I am a 44 year old male, a LIFELONG NON-smoker/NON-drug user/NON-consumer of alcohol, and stopped eating red meat and pork in the early 1990s. I do have weight to lose (roughly 40 or so pounds according to my cardiologist), and i'm working on it with diet and what exercise I can do. My mother had HBP. My MS neurologist--as of six months ago--would not make a hard diagnosis, but thought the pain coupld be MS-related neuropathy. Of note, i've had a brain and cervical MRI this year (April, 2013), but no bleeding or tumors were seen--and at the time of the test, I had been suffering from the pains since 2012. In September of this year (2013), I went to the ER for the pains, as they are just alarming--I have to say NOT the so-called \\"worst headache ever felt,\\" but alarming in any case. All seem to be right under the skin of the scalp--perhaps a few millimeters deeper. I'm no expert, but no one has told me if the level is in the brain, or OUTSIDE of the skull, or what it might mean if it was outside of the skull. The ER doctor performed blood work (normal), pulse OX (100%), BP (after settling down, it was below the 120/80 range, and a CT of the head. He saw no signs of tumor, or bleeding, BUT suggested I see a specialist, as it COULD be \\"vasculitis\\" (which I am not familiar with). My cardiologist insists that the head pains are not related to my heart issue, and thinks a vascular specialist or neurologist should be seen. I contacted one vascular doctor, and after seeing my GP's fax of my relevant files, he said (paraphrasing) \\"This is not something for a vasucular specialist.\\" Really? The headaches--so far--have NOT been accompanied by nausea, vomiting, vision issues, stiff neck, etc. At times of high emotional stress, i've felt my heart race, but the head pains NEVER accompanied that at all. I HAVE had incidents where brief physical exertion seemed to exacerbate a hard throbbing at the top of my head (lasting only seconds), but it--from memory--is usually happening when i'm dealing with head pressure (sinus). So, my question--if you can offer advice--is am I a candidate for Brain Aneurysm? I'm currently trying to get my GP to refer me to another neurologist, but i live in fear, as the sharp pains have increased in frequency in the past few weeks. There are periods of relief, where minutes or hours go by and I feel nothing, but I do not want to be caught off gaurd. Any advice (aside from pursuing a referral to another neurologist) about what I may be going through? Thanks in advance.

Effectiveness of both modalities are same.So,physiotherpay should be tried first. It causes strengthening of Para spinal muscles and it prevents further changes. Surgery should be the last option. There are also medicines like capsule pregabalin available for pain relief. Other pain relieving modalities are Ozone ablation,Radiofrequency ablation,percutaneous disectomy etc.Treatment can be planned after consultation with neurosurgeon.You should also modify your life style like don't abruptly bend forward and avoid standing for long time.Don't lift heavy objects.Get well soon.

Not like the other - compared to images of my brain - post EPS cases I ve seen on line, report read: There has been interval development of multiple foci of extra-axial susceptibility effect involving the posterior fossa, left sylvian fissure and interhemispheric fissure. These areas correspond to T1 hypointense, T2 hypointense foci, suggesting air bubbles or calcification… Once I saw this, I then recalled, on the evening after my 1st ESI: 1st epidural, I was laying down in bed, turned over and suddenly heard a crazy sound from within the right side of my head, like manic crickets, had pain shooting upward behind right ear, from jaw to top of head. My jaw wrenched itself open (from the right), and it and the right side of my face stiffened, and I could not move it, like suddenly half my face was made of concrete. Felt like I would pass out.

The doctors discovered an old brain injury behind my left eye. I have since been getting Auras some very close to grand maul, but I get a physical heads up when they start to come unlike my younger brother who is a severe epileptic. And since I also suffer from severe ptsd my family doc started me on 150 mg one daily of Welbutrin for depression. We discovered through a friend that the reason I had begun to have more frequent Auras was most likely due to the new med Welbutrin . So, I contacted my doc and now he is prescribing 50mg one daily of Zoloft. Are you aware of any anti-depressants that will not cause seizures?","Doctor":"welcome to HCM!I have gone through your query carefully and see that you have history of epilepsy and now have increased complain of aura after you were been started on Wellbutrin for PTSD. you also have a family history of seizure disorder in your brother. Due to increase in aura you were shifted to Zoloft by your treating doctor. now you are looking for some better alternative for PTSD which is safe for seizure patients.I can say from my experince that Wellbutrin , I.e., bupropion is not a drug of choice when the patients has ever had an episode of seizure, as it can increase the risk of the same. Even a normal person who never had a seizure may develop one when put on any dose of Wellbutrin, espically dosage above 300 mg. So, it can be directly related to increased complained of aura you had after starting this medicine.As now you have been shifted to Zoloft, which is a very safe medicine , and is not known to be associated with any significant potential to increase to cause seizure, I think you can proceed with it.If I have any such patient in my clinic I usually go for escitalopram or sertraline ( Zoloft). both are ok in cases similar to yours.

Recent elevation in SGPT may suggests that either you had re exposure to Hepatitis C virus, or other viral infection like hepatitis A, Hepatitis B or HIV etc , or other agents, like Alcohol or medicines has affected your liver cells. I think your GP is waiting for assessment by hepatologist to do either biopsy or Scan to rule out fibrosis and other signs, which will indicate the need for antiviral medication. it is not life threatening, but surely you need to be assessed for justification of treatment, and proper management without unnecessary delay. Meanwhile i would suggest that if you are not vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B virus, get immunized. If you are having any high risk factors, like smoking, Alcohol, Drugs etc, avoid it. Do not take any  medications without asking your Doctor. You are a carrier for others also, so avoid sharing objects of personal use with others. It may transmit to your spouse also , so use protection. I would suggest that, once again you try to consult your Doctor, and clear any questions and worry, you have.

Twice or 3 times a year I am going to see a chiroprator for 6-7 sessions, I have some exercices that I do home, but still sometimes I am blocked with horrible pain. And since 2 years I found that the situation is getting worse and worse, I am constantly with pain and left foot sciatica 24/24hrs and strange feeling in my left toes (it s starting with my right foot now) and I feel like having a constant dizziness. It is difficult at night. This year I was completely blocked 3 times ... I am now working 6hrs per day and the other half I try and rest the more I can (I have an orthopedic mattress).

At level C4-C5 small cental ospeophytic dic complex with bilateral O.A. changes of the unco-vertebral joints noted, causing bilateral foraminal stenosis . At C5-C6 (R) para-central osteophytic-dis complex noted and causing (R) foraminal and central canal stenosis. The A.P. diameter of the cervical canal is measured at 10 mm at this level.

The most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe upper abdominal burning pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting that is worsened with eating.Diagnosing pancreatitis requires two of the following:    Characteristic abdominal pain    Blood amylase or lipase will be 4-6 times higher than the normal variations, but this will be dependent on the laboratory that is testing the blood.    Abdominal ultrasound is generally performed first, which is advantageous for the diagnosis of the causes of the pancreas, for example, detecting gallstones, diagnosing alcoholic fatty liver (combined with history of alcohol consumption). They are both the main causes of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasound also shows an inflamed pancreas clearly.

I also suffer from major depression and GAD.  I have been to countless doctors, both general medical doctors, specialists and psychiatrists since 2005.  Although I have seen so many doctors and have received so much testing (including blood work for almost everything and two MRIs on my back), no one knows what is causing my back pain.  About two years ago, I developed another chronic problem.  I now suffer from continuous nerve twinges (it feels like the sensations you get when your foot, for example falls asleep) that started out in my feet and arms and eventually spread throughout my entire body.  The tingling, pins and needles, nerves vibrating out of my body sensations nearly drove me to the point of suicide.  I had to make an emergency call to my psychiatrist, who reluctantly prescribed me Xanax, which luckily has been the only drug able to alleviate these symptoms.  Unfortunately, my doctor was  forced to close her practice due to illness and now I can not find a doctor that will prescribe the Xanax to me or help me with my situation (I am currently unemployed and living with my mom and have no money or insurance).  What could possibly be causing my horrible CNS symptoms?

In addition, neurological diagnosis is most often a clinical diagnosis. There is no \\"test\\" (blood test or scan) that can \\"confirm\\" the diagnosis. This is unlike say a kidney failure, which can be diagnosed by high creatinine or a heart failure that can be diagnosed by echocardiogram. This is one of the reasons because of which different neurologists would not agree on one diagnosis. Also, the neurological symptoms may not remain same at all times, they are different at different times.

Now, two days later, I have excruciating pain all over my body, especially my legs. There is also pain in right flank at diaphragm, and hurts when I breath. Upon puncturing the lumbar area, I experienced an electric strong pain in my right sciatic nerve that shot down radiating to my right foot causing my leg to kick once uncontrollably. I said oh I think you hit my sciatic nerve! When the Dr pulled back on the needle, the pain stopped, but the leg felt numb. The pain was not this bad yesterday, but now even with my very potent meds for chronic back pain, the pain is very bad. I am stuck in bed and starting to get head and neck pain too. I have some arachnoiditis in the lumbar area from four spinal surgeries at L5 - S1. The radiology Dr said my cord area is very narrow as it was very difficult to obtain CSF. The puncture was done prone for the xray and then I had to roll onto left side for collection of CSF. It was barely dripping out. It took about 30 min. to get 6 cc. Is this pain normal?? I see many people on the site talking about the needle hitting the sciatic nerve, and the xray tech said it happened a lot at the facility I went to....Is it common that the sciatic nerve is hit upon needle entry? I would appreciate any advise as it is Sunday..... everything closed but ER.","Doctor":"Hi,Your symptoms suggest that you have experienced two side-effects of the lumbar puncture. Firstly, you have experienced some nerve irritation or damage during the procedure. This is likely to recover but may take a few days to show an improvement. It is a recognised occurrence during a lumbar puncture. Secondly, the head, neck and body pain that has started is also due to the puncture but is not nerve damage. It is due to leakage of CSF through the hole made by the needle and, again, is a recognised problem with a lumbar puncture. My suggestion is that you continue to take your pain meds. Lie down and rest as this may relieve the head and neck ache to some degree. Keep well hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Caffeinated drinks will also help with the pain. These measures are likely to ease the pains.If you do not feel significantly better in 24 hours, I suggest you contact the clinic where you had the procedure done for further advice. I hope you feel better soon.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB  FRCA"},{"Patient":"i am on cipralex 10mg a day. three months ago i shifted to 2.5mg a day with some miising doses in between. i wasnot trying to stop but rather to lower the dose as i thought the drug have long t1/2 and i am already loaded to a therapeutic level. after 28 days i had a symptoms of n&v sweating dizziness , vertigo lasted about 2-3 hrs dr said it might be virus....etc . i was kind of down little for a week then the symptoms was there but very light for a month then i had anthor attack of sever n&v dizz, vertigo. n&v lsted for an hour but dizz, ver/ lasted till a week ago. during the second episode i visited ent doc and diagnosed it as Meniere s disease. actually i didnot tell him about the cipralex at all because i ve never thought of withdrawal symptoms might happen. but last week itook a 10mg of cipralex daily for three days because of thought of missing dose(s). i want to emphesize that i am good in taking my med . interestingly i felt fine and kind of normal and every thing seems to be back to normal no more s&s of n&v no ver no dizz no sppinning.. now my question was it s&s of cipralex withdrawal or Meniere s disease by the way i have tinnitus in my left ear for more than 7 yrs","Doctor":"Hi,The withdrawal of Cipralex does not occur after 28 days. The discontinuation symptoms occur within a couple of days of dose change and do not last for just a couple of hours. In my opinion, your episodes of vertigo are not related to Cipralex but are a manifestation of inner ear disease. The vestibular system present in the inner ear is responsible for maintaining the balance of the body and any disturbance usually manifests as vertigo and dizziness. I think you should continue with your ENT doctor's advice.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I have a slight hand tremor noticed moreso when I am holding a telephone receiver to my left ear.

Hence, get a thorough cardiac and lungs' evaluation done AT THE EARLIEST.The possible causes of sudden sleep, night terrors, transient numbness of limbs and catatonic attacks are:- either a type of epilepsy (called Absence seizures in Adults) or; constant anxiety with acute Panic reactions. An MRI of brain + EEG should be done at the earliest. If both : MRI and EEG reports are normal, a regular course of anti-anxiety+ anti-depressant drugs will be of great help. Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion.

However the areas superior to the neck is not innervated by the nerves in the neck area but if the neck problem also affects the large vessel supplying the head from the heart through the neck then it would explain the symptoms.

Afterwards he said since the tests I had last year came out negative (MRI and EEG) he said he didn't see a need for anymore tests.  He said maybe I should see someone for stress management because stress manifest itself in different ways.  I left confused because I am a happy, blessed, laid back person.  Is he right?  What happened to me is that called a seizure?  Should I continue trying to find out what makes me lose my balance?","Doctor":"Hello there!  Thank you for asking.

When the blood pressure is too low, not enough oxygen-rich blood is being delivered to the brain, and its function can be affected. Low blood pressure may be the result of an underlying illness or disease, or it may be a normal physiologic condition may be due to sleep deprivation.Good sleep of at least 6 hrs is required for a person to feel fresh and healthy. Some common reasons for low blood pressure include the following:Anemia ,dehydration, Fever also can cause a significant amount of water loss due to increased metabolic rate and excessive sweating as the body tries to cool itself.Anxiety can also cause dizziness and blurred vision.so be relaxed! hope this helps you!take care"},{"Patient":"Yes I am a 63 yr, old woman and my  husband and I were at dinner, when all of sudden i felt real strange feeling came over me and I felt a little dizzy and everything looked real blurry and then I felt like I was going to blackoutt I sitting down, but I feel real real tired, and real weak, in 1992 I had an anurisyn sorryI don't know how to spell it, any way I was wondering what some of the symptoms for a stroke are, because I feel like I am extremely weak and really tired, and I am afraid to go to sleep, so what is your suggestions?

The fact that she can not walk and that she has pain indicates that the problem can be related with muscles, articulations or inervation.The most common is artritis in my opinion that is an inflamation of the articulation that is very frequent in persons having infections in adenoid gland. Bacteria that are commonly found to cause septic arthritis are: Staphylococcus aureus - the most common cause in adults    Streptococci - the second most common causeMicro-organisms must reach the synovial membrane of a joint. This can happen in any of the following ways:    dissemination of pathogens via the blood, from abscesses or wound infections, or from an unknown focus    dissemination from an acute osteomyelitic focus,    dissemination from adjacent soft tissue infection,    entry via penetrating trauma    entry via iatrogenic means.A number of factors should increase one's suspicion of the presence of an infection.

A week later, my leg and foot was tingling and went semi numb. That turned to horrific burning and pain from my lower back, hip and down outer thigh to my foot and toes. I took the medrol dose pack two months after suffering with this severe pain. The pain returned four days after I finished the pack. I had physical therapy in the meantime and two months into that had an epidural steroid in my lower back. That dulled the pain a bit for about a month. Then it gradually increased again. I had an MRI of my lumbar and cervical spine that showed a small left later extraforaminal l bulge and protrusion at l4 l5 that the doctors say cannot be causing all my pain. I have been diagnosed with nerve root inflammation at l4 l5 by one orthopedic doctor and muscle strain by other orthopedic and nuerologists. Eight months later, I still cannot sit, bend, lift, reach or walk without pain in my back, hip and down my leg. I am taking mobic now. It just dulls the pain a little bit.

This means they have many causes : emotional, muscular, articular, bones and inervation.If your MRI didn't show any problem with your bone and articulations they can be caused by the torsion of all the muscles in that area. A big part of it can be caused by the herniatic disc that was shown in MRI. Doctors might have said you that it can't be responseble for all your pain, especially if it is a small herniatic disc. I belive that the pain also has his emotional components. In 2 patients having the same problem, the perceptation of the pain can be different and also in the same patient having a problem the perceptation of the pain can be different in different times. What I suggest are Anti inflammatory non steroidal drugs against your pain, but this is not a final solution for a herniatic disc problem.

Right shoulder blade pain (deep inside around trigger point), spinal pain (deep), neck pain (sharp like nerves and strained muscles/pings). Pain occasionally wraps around my right ribs and around incisions. Pain in upper back is terrible. Doctors are not listening since I had an MRI which which reveled a reverse Lordis curve and a bulge at c5 c6, also some minor bone spurs in Thoracic. I have been to many doctors, Neuro who said to take Gabapitin, which I do an night, physical therapy , Ortho doctor who said that the MRI in writing was not accurate to what he saw when I brought him the images. Acupuncturist (who is also a former gallbladder and liver surgeon) thinks that the doctors need to listen to me because he thinks something is wrong that no one is looking at.

It is so bad now to start and getting worse. I feel like my back is breaking, my neck and ribs are in the wrong place, and now my lower back is hurting and shooting pain goes into my right leg and right arm. I have to say that I was (besides the gallbladder issue) normal before, five months ago. I am not being taken seriously because they cannot find anything wrong in my blood (with the exception of a Vitamin D- low- which may be because of the diarrhea or the Colestid, or both) and the MRI.

I am very sick (in pain) now and I need someone to help me that will listen, that is all I ask.

Numbness and tingling along with pain can radiate to the thumb side of the hand.

You have not mentioned if your husband is aware of this symptoms himself while having it or not? but still I think it wil be wise  to get a CAT scan head done to check if everything is right in brain. The symptom you have described can be in case of high blood pressure or may be due to some kind of minor seizure like activity in brain....One can be sure of anything only after examining him and getting some investigations.I will suggest you that you should not ignore it.  It doesn't appear to be dangerous at present, so please do. it panic but certainly warrants investigation.Hope you find the reply helpfulfeel free to ask more queriesDr. Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, my sister has leison in the brain, they found 2 ring like leison in the left frontal lobe.

I have been experiencing certain symptoms whenever I get tensed / excited such as sensation of heart beat (pounding feel on the chest), fleeting breathlessness, chest pain,etc. The symptoms usually dissappear once I relax myself and do not usually last for more than 2 - 3 minutes. I have also experienced panic attacks and palpitations occassionally (3 - 4 times in the last 4 years or so). I recently met a doctor who asked me to get my ECG done. I got my ECG done and the doctor said I was having sinus tachycardia. But for the fast heart rate, he said my ECG was otherwise normal. I was asked to get my echocardiogram done (to rule out other complications like MVP,etc.) and also to undergo a thyroid test. In the mean time, I was prescribed Inderal 40 and Clonotril tablets. I am getting my echo and thyroid tests done shortly. But I am a little concerned as to whether I really need to take the medication he prescribed (Inderal 40 and Clonotril). The symptoms I have described above do not really bother me since they occur only occassionally when I get involved in a tense situation or so. Moreover, they don t last for more than a few minutes and as long they don t point to any serious trouble, the symptom itself is not a problem. I am worried if the above medication could cause side effects and would like to avoid them if possible. Can you please advise?","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM!I have gone through your problem and there is a possibility of anxiety and panic attack. It is less likely related to heart disease. Your ECG was normal apart from sinus tachycardia, which is just a finding when one is anxious. I don't think that ECHO and other tests will have anything abnormal in it. The doctor had given you right medicine, they will be very helpful. From my clinical experince I can say that these symptoms are more likely to increase if not given proper treatment and may lead to severe anxiety, which may require long term managment. you are not worried about these symptoms doesn't undermine their significance....they reflect some kind of chemical disturbance, getting such attacks more frequently can pose stress to heart, may lead to increase in Blood pressure. I'm not trying to scare you but one should not unnecesesray increase/ neglect it. taking medication will help you and later you can stop them.I don't know if you have any stressor currently which is leading to this problem... inderal may cause some lowering in blood pressure , sometimes anxiety /palpitation also, but largely is helpful. clonotril is good anti anxiety medicine but may lead to sedation to some people even in low dosees. Clonotril may cause addiction if taken for long time, especially without prescription. I have seen paroxetine 25 mg alone working very nicely in such problem, with clonotril 0.25 mg when there is panic attack. If still you want to avoid medicine then please do breathing / relaxation exercises regularly, three to five times a day, this will help in reducing / stopping the anxiety.

Is there any chance that these changes are due to the side effects of these drugs.?","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM!I have  gone through your question and it says that your father is on nexito forte and resperidone. you have not mentioned the dosage of any any of them. Nexito forte is safe in this age, except when thee is severe liver dysfunction, it has least interaction with other medicines, but, may cause reduction in soduim levels , espically in old age. This happens more when there is already existing liver or kidney problems. One needs to get sodium and other electrolytes checked to see if that is causing disorientation/ other deteriorating symptoms . You should have mentioned the deteriorating symptoms, this would rally have helped in telling the possible cause... Resperidone is also usually safe in low dose, and actually an effective medicine. In some patients it may cause disorientation, delirium, and rigidity ( tightening of limbs), increase in salivation and slurring of speech...So, whatever it is, please talk to his doctor, after evaluation and looking at the patient one can tell what is happening.I know it is troublesome, but sometimes even the right medicine may cause distress in few patients.  These drugs are for psychiatric problems. His doctor may go for some other safe and low potency medicine  or education the dosage of these only.I hope your father gets well soonFeel free to ask more questionsDr. Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"I have just read your information about calcium buildup inthe body.

Medicine will help you a lot, within few days you will start felling much better.So, see a doctor and get blood test done!In any case, it is not a serious problem, but needs attention.Take carePlease ask if you have any other queryDr.  Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"hi there, this incident took place today and i am really confused, i am 21 and work out everyday, today while i was taking a nap in the day my heart started pounding hard and slow, (slowing down) and i had a tingly rush through my whole body and i started shaking, more like vibrating, i was half awake but coudnt stop this no matter how hard i tried, it lasted for 20-30 seconds and was really scary, what could it be ? do i need to see a doctor ?

In mania also patient can have comorbid anxiety... I think you are on some antidepressant/ anti anxiety for your past symptoms, and now it is likely that they made you go into mania.. I'm not sure , but it is a very common cause of switch to mania from depression episode ( due to use of antidepressants ) . Had you mentioned the treatment you are currently on, it would have helped in giving you a correct reply. But one thing is certain that you should not ignore this symptoms and discuss it with your psychiatrist.

As you mentioned he has calcifications seen on MRI. The cause of these calcifications could be an intrauterine infection or some other perinatal insult. But what is alarming in this case is that such a young child is on 3 drugs (levipil,gardinal,valparin) to control fits. All these drugs have their share of side effects and using them together without proper titration of doses can cause more harm than good to the child. Secondly nootropil is not prescribed for fits. I strongly recommend to take the child to a paediatric neurologist (if one is available in your area) or a paediatrician who is experienced in managing childhood epilepsy cases.               Regarding your second question, it is difficult to comment at this stage regarding the prognosis/chances of improvement. Detailed history, examination and investigations can give a clue. But at such a young age it is very difficult to predict the outcome. It is only on follow up and depending on how well the fits are controlled can a doctor give an opinion regarding the prognosis.          Hope that helps.

My recovery is going well for the most part, however, I am continuing to experience quite a bit of pain in my left abdominal region.

It was clear that something was happening; I called 911 and an ambulance met us near Rt. 95 S at Ashland, VA and took him to Mem. Regional Med Ctr in Mechanicsville, near Richmond.

The night sweats, fever, apetite loss, weight loss.. These symptoms occur in tuberculosis or lymphoma. However, the occipital lymph nodes are not a common presentation, but who knows that you have other lymphnodes too which a doctor can find on examination.It is also possible that you simply have a bacterial abscess on your occipital area.I would advise you to take it seriously and meet a physician.

They operated and gave me a new knee made out of the Metal-Titanium type back in 2010. In the 5th month of Recovery, I had a very bad fall, Black Ice, and was told that everything would get back to normal, just bad Bruising, and now 3.5 years later it hurts constantly and developed Poly-Neruoarthpy in both lower legs and in my Feet mainly less than a year after the operation. My feet hurt extremely bad, and I really have better luck with my shoes on 24/7. I have had 2 major slips in Bathtub Showers, and now my neck and back, shoulder hurt and I now spend most of my time in Bed. These Dr s. just said that I would just have to live with it and this is only the latest of many Traumas that plague me and they have had me on Methadone for 7 years plus 160 Oxycodone 5mgs. every 2 weeks after promising me to put me on MS-Contin after I lowered my dose of Methadone to 40to 60mgs./day then Re-Nigged and kept me on this Methadone which has never helped with all the symptoms that I endure daily. I also suffer from Diverticulitis, and my Appendix Ruptured some time ago and almost died from Peritonitis.

Well I didn t just pass out. My blood pressure was low, I was blue ,cold, stiff and I was disoriented and my daughters called the ambulance it took all three to wake me up and when they did wake me I started coughing, The peramedics asked if I wanted to go to the hospital I refused. they also said I had low blood pressure and they asked to see my meds which I keep in a safe. They also asked if I took a second dose without noticing. I said no because its a forced habit already 2 ys same time. Well @ 5:30 that night I asked my daughter to take me to the ER. I stayed in the Hospital for 3 days and the doctors asked me if I tried to kill myself, since I have a pain mgmt. doctor and receive pain meds and epidaural injections in my cervical spine and my lumbar. I have 2 disks in my cervical that are cessation disks and 4 in my lumbar that are also cessation disks (I don t think I spelled those correctly but without fluid is how it was described to me), When asked where does the fluid that was in the disks go? no one could give me an answer that was satisfactory.

I have episodes of being drunk disoriented my neck right at the base of my head is tender to the touch I have a burning sensation in the upper left quadrant above the base of my skull, I usually get headaches on the right side behind my eye and above my right ear towards the back of my skull. (My opthomologist insists I have glaucoma and that I have nerve damage along with it) I added this part incase it was a factor. well the base of my skull at the back of my neck is tender to touch and my eyes were swollen the first and second (tues and wed) night in the hospital. I do take Pain meds, Im going to give you a list just so we are on the same page. Nueronten 800 mg 4 times a day, Flexeril 15mg 4 times a day, Tramadol 50mg 4 times a day, Oxycodone 10mg/325 acetaminaphine, 4 times a day, Morphine 15mg 3 times a day, Xanax 0.5mg 4 times a day, amitriptyline 25mg only at bedtime, and phentermine 37.5mg only in the morning.

ER took blood and said that I didn t have enough of those medications in my system at 6:00pm for it to have been an overdose so they gave me the MRI.

She hasn t had a eye injection in three weeks now. When she arrived there she did not have an appointment they called an ambulance because she wasn t making any sense! She knew something was wrong and drove to the eye doctor with her hazards lights on. She arrived at the hospital ER and they immediately performed a cat scan and MRI which showed no signs of stroke . She arrived at hospital at 2:00 in afternoon. While in ER with her she did not know her name or any of childrens name! She didn t understand anything! She was so confused and complained of headache. She never slurred speach, she just was making sense. At 11:30 Tuesday night they put her in ICU and performed an EKG which confirmed AFIB heart rate. They gave her medicine to slow heart rate down. At 1:00 A.M. she still didn t know her name or her children s name. At 6:00 A.m. Wednesday she regained the ability to express her name and she knew who her children were.

Even if now you want to confirm that wether you have GTCS, then get an EEG or serum prolactin levels, they rise in a true seizure and come to normal limits within next 24hrs, an EEg will come abnormal when you have true seizure. in mixed seizures, patient is given antiepileptics and medicines for stress , which take care of both the things.I think that you must see a psychiatrist, even if you have true seizures, as, you have significant depression, hopelessness and worthlessness, which is harmful for you.

So, her BP needs to be kept under good control to prevent any recurrence of bleeding in the brain.Second problem is the ischemia- lack of blood flow to the brain. This is often due to high sugar, cholesterol, in addition to high BP. So, if these risk factors are present, then, they need to be controlled.

It has a high probability of causing addiction, if used for long. So, I suspect you are developing an addiction to it. That is the reason, as soon as you stop it, symptoms recur.First of all, we need to determine the cause of your headaches. If it is migraine, then, we need to use preventive medications. Since you have seizures also, topiramate or divalproex would be a better option than keppra (levetiracetam), as they would help both seizures as well as migraines.For coming out of zapiz, you may take the help of a psychiatrist.I hope it helps.

During 2012 I noticed the pain increasing in strength and coming on earlier and earlier in the day.   I had a colonoscopy last June 2013 a tumor was cut out in the anle area and tested positive for carcinoid.  It seems since this procedure my L5-4 pain has increased significantly.  I had an MRI in August 2013 with significant progression of the L5-4 and L5 sitting on the root nerve.  From June to now almost November the pain is unbearable.  Could the change be from the colonoscopy ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.The pain is neurogenic in nature and is related to the nerve compression due to disc prolapse at L4-5 level. The nerve compression can lead to pain in the back as well as radiating pain in the legs. This pan can get worse on exertion, walking, coughing, etc.Colonoscopy is unlikely to have aggravated this disc prolapse. In my opinion, the worsening of symptoms noted after the colonoscopy is coincidental. You would benefit from medications such as pregabalin or gabapentin capsules in relieving pain.

This can be done by doing an MRI of the cervical spine. A condition called syringomyelia (where a cavity is formed in the spinal cord) needs to be excluded. Another condition to exclude would be anterior horn cell disease. This can be done by doing an EMG study.

The symptoms of my vertigo include spinning sensation, palpitations, sweating and balance disorder i.e i can t stand nor lie down nor sitdown and this happens may be once every couple of months.....the spinning sensation continues even when i close my eyes and it may last from few minutes to couple of hours and when i use cinnarizine tablets the dizziness subsides over the course of time i.e in few hours. But almost every single day i have this slight jittery movements occuring when i m in my office working infront of my computer and also occur at home when i m in a idle position. The dizziness also start when i sit in a moving car and try to read something or may be triggered if i make my head move continuosly for some required job. I have consulted a ENT and also a neuro surgeon but they were not sure as all the reports were normal. Let me make it more detailed for you, with the ENT the doctor asked me to take a temporal lobe CT or MRI( i m not sure) but it was normal then audiometry was also normal. Then i took a BRAIN MRI FOR THE NEUROLOGIST which he saw and said everything was normal. But the ENT said since the neurologist ruled out any brain related problems you may be more likely to have BPPV . I m confused with how to proceed from here and would be grateful if any specialist could suggest me what to do and i stay in Chennai, India , if any specialist for my kind of problem i would glad to visit him. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.I have read your medical reports above and my opinion is that you have BPPV-benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. In this condition, the problem lies in the ear, and routine tests would not confirm the diagnosis.The history is suggestive of the diagnosis, that is, the symptoms worsen with head or neck movements and they resolve on own in a few days, only to recur later.A routine ENT or Neurology consultation may not help sometimes. You need to see a VERTIGO SPECIALIST. Certain maneuvers such as Epley's maneuver done by the vertigo specialist can cure you of this problem.

If not, then, the weight tends to increase.In addition, the medications used for SLE such as steroids also lead to weight gain.

The right one is worse than the left. I have had this going on since May, and it betters and worsens at times. It is hard for me to read, but it isn't blurry, it just strains my eyes. I have been to numerous doctors, none of which have any idea what this could be. The black circle is not completely solid, but close to it. I researched and found a disease called Retinitis Pigmentosa, which in turn led me to read about Multiple Scleroses. As I read about MS, I came to realize that I do have other symptoms of MS, such as shaking of my hands, weakness in arms and legs, slow reaction time. Do you have any suggestions as to what this might be? Could my age of 14 years old have anything to do with this?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.Common causes of dark circles around eye are stress, overwork, vitamin deficiency, poor sleep and dehydration. It is very less likely due to MS in your case. MS diagnosis is not very simple to make. It will need examination from neurologist and imaging studies like MRI brain to confirm it. Your other symptoms (shaking of hands, weakness in arms and legs, slow reaction time) can also occur due to stress/anxiety and vitamins deficiency. So evaluation by general physician and psychiatrist will help you.Wish you good health and all the best.Regards,Dr Ashish Kumar Mittalwww.99doctor.com"},{"Patient":"My son is autistic.

I have a syrinx within my spinal cord from C5-6 - T1, currently 8cm in size. It was believed to be originated from Arnold Chiari 0 due to the protrusion level of my cerebellum tonsils. As it turns out, my surgeon is now convinced that the syrinx developed as a result of a spinal injury I received in an auto accident at the age of 16 where I sustained a severe case of whip lash. I had a Suboccipitial Craniectomy done in December 2011 to decompress the spinal cord with the hope of decreasing; if not, diminishing my syrinx. One year later, it s time to do an MRI to see the progress...it shrank a little. I became somewhat optimistic but, frustrated at the slow progress and the symptoms and problems that I had prior to surgery have gotten worse. Nearly two years later, I ve already had an MRI done and the syrinx has not changed at all!! I m beyond frustrated and now I have carpal tunnel syndrome & De Quervain s Tenosynovitis in my right wrist/thumb; in need of both surgeries AND I have 2 herniated discs, L3-4 & L4-5, that I need to have surgery on as well. The neurosurgeon that I was seeing, who had me go through multiple tests; including a lumbar discogram w/no sedation, to reach his diagnosis (not the same neurosurgeon who performed my suboccipitial craniectomy, he dealt strictly with syrinx). He told me that he believed that the symptoms that I have been having with my arms, hands & wrist issues, muscle, & shoulder weakness was due to the pressure within the syinx and it had to be drained. So, his course of action was (3) SURGIES and it started as follows: 1) carpal tunnel & De Quervain s, three weeks later... 2) Syringo-Subarachnoid-Peritoneal Shunt ....3) Lumbar Disc Fusion I told him that I did not want to have the Syrinx Shunt surgery done and he now refuses to do the other 2 surgeries. He said that I can go to an Orthopaedic Surgeon for my wrists but that he believed I would still have complications resulting from the syrinx. As far as the lumbar surgery, he said that, With the narrow space around the syrinx in your spinal cord and you lying on your stomach for 2 - 2 1/2 hours with your blood pressure lowered while under sedation; you have to keep in mind, Mrs. ......., your blood pressure needs to stay elevated when dealing with a syrinx. ....it s just not safe to do the surgery and I just can t do it.

The swelling in the node is either due to a bacterial infection or malignancy.

I had a recent MRI that showed severe thoracic spinal stenosis on C7-T1 to T2 levels. MRI also shows bone spurs on these areas. I've had cervical fusions done on C5-C6-C7 five yrs ago also due to stenosis and disc bulging. My left side is mostly affected. More than a year ago, I started feeling sharp pain on my left chest, sharp pain inside the breast area and to the side towards the armpit. I also have pain on my left elbow, heaviness feeling on my wrist and numbness on my 3 fingers from the pinky to middle finger. My primary doctor sent me to a cardiologist but all the cardio tests I did showed normal. I read that thoracic spine stenosis also affects the chest area. Are those pains I'm feeling on the chest area symptoms of the thoracic spine stenosis?  I also still have burning pain on my left shoulder closer to the neck and spasms and pain on the upper back despite having surgery done on the cervical spine.  I don't want anymore surgery but if severe thoracic stenosis is left untreated could I become paralyzed? I read that surgery on thoracic stenosis has higher morbidity and mortality rate than cervical and lumbar surgeries that's why I'm hesitant to do surgery. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.Yes, it is possible for thoracic spine stenosis to cause pain and tingling in the chest area. The symptoms that could occur due to thoracic spine stenosis depends on the degree of stenosis. If it is severe, it may result in weakness of both legs. Severe paralysis is uncommon.I agree with you that it is not worthwhile considering second surgery on cervical spine, as it is technically more challenging and there are higher risk of complications due to surgery.For symptom relief, you could take pregabalin capsules and undergo physiotherapy.I hope it helps.

He did an Exam and was very concerned so he had an MRI done, the findings were as followed: Technique: MRI of the cervical spine was performed at 1.5 Tesla per routine protocol.Comparison (s) none available. Findings: Images are markedly degraded by patients motion. Several imaging sequences were repeated without significant improvement in image quality. There is advanced degenerative disc disease throughout the cervical spine, most noted at C3/4, C5/6, and C6/7. Modic type degenerative endplate changes are noted within the C5, C6, and C7 vertebral bodies. There is focal increased T2 signal within the spinal cord at C3/4 and C4/5 levels. C2/3: Broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex without significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.  C3/4: Advanced degenerative disc disease with complete loss of disc space. Large broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex resulting in severe bilateral C4 neuro foraminal  narrowing. There is flattening along the ventral margin of the thecal sac and the AP diameter spinal canal is narrowed to 8 mm. C4/5: Degenerative disc disease. Central posterior disc herniation/protrusion with mass effect along the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord. AP diameter of the spinal canal is near the 5-6 mm. C5/6: Advanced degenerative disc disease. Broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex. Short pedicles. There is flattening of the thecal sac and spinal cord. AP diameter of the spinal canal is narrowed to 8 mm at this level. There is severe bilateral C6 neural foraminal stenosis. C6/7 Advanced degenerative disc disease. Broad-based posterior osteophyte complex. The diameter of the spinal canal measures 9 mm . There is mild to moderate bilateral C7 neural foraminal stenosis. C7/T1: No significant stenosis. Impression: There is multifactorial spinal stenosis and moderate or severe bilateral neural foramial stenosis from the C3/4 through C6/7 levels. There is abnormal signal within the cervical spinal cord at the C3/4 and C4/5 levels, probably representing mylomalacia secondary to chronic compression.","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMIn the beginning of report it said that image quality is not good due to the movement of patient, If I would be a your doctor then I would ask for another imaging report with strict instruction not to move your head at all during the procedure, because such movement can not give good quality image and bad images greatly effect the interpretation, which may not be taken in to consideration, but still it can be said that the above report is suggestive of cervical spine degenerative disease may required medical attention  better go for another MRI have nice day."},{"Patient":"Had a hemmoragic stroke on my right side and at the time while still bleeding rushed to have it drained out, fortunately the bleeding had stopped by the time of arrival to the neurologist so their was no surgery.

Vertigo can be caused by a problem with the balance mechanisms of the inner ear, a problem with the brain or a problem with the nerves that connect the brain to the middle ear. Labyrinthitis ,Vestibular neuritis , Dehydration,Migraine,Chronic otitis media and some medications may cause vertigo. Most common is Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)  that most commonly occurs in elderly patients. A blow to the head can cause BBPV; even a minor blow. BBPV can also be caused by disorders that damage the inner ear, infection, ear surgery damage, or if the patient has been lying on his/her back for too long. Most BBPV attacks clear up within a few days. The condition generally goes away within a few weeks or months, but can sometimes recur. Meniere's disease  is dysfunction of the semi-circular canals (endolymphatic sac) in the inner ear. Patients experience recurrent vertigo Acoustic neuroma is a  benign  tumor that develops on the acoustic nerve of the inner ear; this nerve is involved in helping us balance. Patients who do experience vertigo usually have mild symptoms.

Some people are simply dazed or confused. Sometimes whiplash can cause a concussion.Because the brain is very complex, every brain injury is different. Some symptoms may appear right away, while others may not show up for days or weeks after the concussion. Sometimes the injury makes it hard for people to recognize or to admit that they are having problems.The signs of mild brain injury and concussion can be subtle. Early on, problems may be missed by patients, family members, and doctors. People may look fine even thought they’re acting or feeling differently.

This is provided the surgery is performed by an experienced surgeon.If there is fluid in sphenoid sinus cavity, then medical treatment alone would suffice and surgery would not be needed.However, in case of polyp, surgery may be needed. The decision can be taken on the basis of symptoms, as surgery is optional and not mandatory in this condition.I hope it helps.

Here's why I'm here: On Sunday, I took some lsd (it was my second time. I took two sheets. The first time i took one.) The first time was fine, But the second time.... I had a seizure. And now because of that, i can't drive for 6 months. In about a month, I'm going back to the doctor to get my brain scanned. There is no history of seizures in my family. and I'm not epileptic (that was confirmed after my first scan). So I was wondering, Can my license suspension be undone? (assuming that they say I'm all clear and nothing is wrong with my brain)or can it at least be shortened? or maybe even have them allow me to drive locally?","Doctor":"Hi,No brain imaging study can confirm or disprove that you have epilepsy or not. Even an electroencephalography (EEG) report is not conclusive. That you had a drug induced seizure simply indicates that you are vulnerable to having seizures in the presence of factors that lower seizure threshold. So other drug related conditions like alcohol withdrawal or opioid intoxication can also induce seizures in you. A normal brain imaging study just suggests that there is no lesion or tumor which could have caused the seizure. A normal EEG report also does not rule out seizure disorder. Therefore I do not expect that a repeat normal brain scan would in anyway increase your chances of overturning the ban on driving.Hope this helps you.

We have watched his health decline at a severe rate and are very worried they have miss a stroke. They are doing nothing to treat the brain bleed as they say it will go away on it's on. He has had a severe weight lose and states to us that \\"food doesn't taste right\\". Anytime he tries to stand, with or without help, he passes out. He has moments of being not lucid.","Doctor":"Hi there.I am sure your grandfather had a hemorrhagic stroke. The bells palsy and the weakness is due to it. The orthostatic hypertension does develop during recovery.If i were your doctor i would have checked his CT scan. Normally in Neurosurgery evacuation is done only for hemorrhages greater than 70-100 cm3 and it has to be compressing the brain matterIf it is less than that and there are no signs of compression then it is left as such. Surgery is not indicated in that case.The clot resolves followed by fibrosis and ultimately normally leads to a full recovery.I believe if your doctor has not proceeded to surgery then it is because it doesnot meet the criteria for surgery. In this case it might not be beneficial to perform a surgery.I hope you find my response helpfulregardsDr. Ammar bin Ahsan"},{"Patient":"i have been on oxycotine30 mgs and hydrocodone 10/325 for about 6 yrs due to a forklift ran over me and the damage it did was the L4 L5 S1 & disk bulge.

Iv had two eegs an both clean and two mris and both clean. I have neruoligist but hes not knowing. The other thisng tho is i have a spot in the top of my neck at my scole line that hurts all the time and also before my seizures i had a major headach for two days prier. My second question if not from lack of sleep could the seizures be due to a pinch nurve or injury in my neck?   I dont want to say i dnt like my doctor but i dont feel they are really trying to find the cause   Thank u for letting people ask their questions just for more advice","Doctor":"Dear AmandaFirst of all I need you to relax and understand that according to a research every 100th person on this planet is prone to having at last 1 seizure in his or her life span. It is a big number. secondly if your MRI and EEGs are normal then the cause of your seizures is at neuron level. Sometimes some part of our brain produce enhanced neurological activity that can lead to a seizure. Now that as your seizure is Grand Mal type, it is most likely that it originates in the cerebral cortex of your brain. If i was your doctor I would recommend you take some anti epileptic medication. I would also recommend you to get enough sleep. There is a more chance of having an epileptic fit if your brain is fatigued so yes it is related to less sleep.As for the injury to your neck; There are a lot of seizures that can develop post traumatic to head injury but mostly these seizures are focal because a certain part of brain is damaged. The pain you have prior to an epileptic fit could be an aura. Auras are very common in grand mal epilepsy. But you should get it checked from a good neurologist/ neurosurgeon.I hope this answer was helpful.

But now he is normal,however, when consulted the doctor they have asked him to take all the tests related to it. He is so worried, as his father also had paralysis & now he is no more. My family & his family initiated the marriage talks between us. Not sure if there would be any problem arising if we get married. Not sure as to how long does he need to wait to get married.","Doctor":"Hi, Please see aneurologist to evaluate the extent of paralysis. Check if it can be improved and the cause for paralysis. If there is blood pressure, the severity of blood pressure. Check if paralysis has affected his erections which may impair sexlife. Regards"},{"Patient":"since last 7 years slowly my father who is 78 years old slowly started forgetting to remember. sometime he calles his wife as sister or mother or aunt but some time he recognize as wife. he remember his date of birth and all. we tested for Dimentia and he was fine with report. CT scan report is fine also. I went to meet him but he didnt recognize me. When I talk to him over tel. he talks fine. He can talk properly but goes out of topic and will talk anything. I dont understand what it is?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.Based on the symptoms, your father has dementia, and the most likely cause of his dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). You should note that there is no test or scan that can diagnose dementia or AD, and the CT scsn may be normal in cases of dementia.The diagnosis of dementia is a clinical one, and can be confirmed by detailed neuropsychological testing, which can be done by a neurologist or psychologist. Regarding scans, functional MRI or PET scan of the brain may be able to diagnose the problems of dementia, as the problem in dementia is a functional abnormality of the brain and the brain structure may be normal.He should also undergo tests for vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid problems, as that could also cause dementia.AD can also be treated with medications.I hope it helps.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"For no apparent reason, my husband has suddenly felt as if the room is slowly spinning around... not fast but in slow motion. This is the third time it's happened; just now/ for a little yesterday and for about ten minutes two weeks ago. Approx. 5 minutes this time. What could cause this, its never happened before & he is fairly fit?","Doctor":"Hi,From history it seems that he might be having Vertigo.There are many causes of having vertigo.Go for eye, ear check up.Go for blood pressure check up.Consult your doctor and get examined.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend was punched a few times in the stomach about 3 days ago during a fight and he began having severe upper stomach pains 2 days later. He describes the pain as 2 knives stabbing him. He refuses to go to the E.R. so, I gave him a couple of Tylenol and he went to bed. The pain comes and goes in a 1-2 minute intervals and only lasts less than a minute. Is this pain a sign of internal damage and is there anything, other than Tylenol, that I can do for him at home?","Doctor":"Hi. Do nothing at home. The blunt injury causing such pain can very well indicate an internal problem with organs or bleeding or tear or so. Give him nothing orally. He needs to be investigated urgently to rule out serious problem."},{"Patient":"Hi. I was wondering if u can find out whats wrong with my head or brain. i have tingleing in the middle of my brain, which i can hear and knid of feel i also have grinding in the back of my head and am having problems with my memory. i dont remember as much now as i used to. i got tested for lime disease by a doctor, but dont have it and i also had a CT Scan, but nothing was found and its worrying me. i regurarly get the tingling and grinding, but its mostly my memory im worried about and one time i was driving and i got disoriantated and didnt know were i was for a few seconds on a road i always drive on and somtimes i feel like i have internal bleeding in my brain and i hear ringing especially in my ear somtimes, my vission has gotten blury a few times, but it hasnt happent for ages and a few months ago i nearly completly lost my vission for a few seconds, im 20 years Help Please.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.I can understand your concern about memory loss at a very young age. However, the good news is that your CT scan of brain is normal, which rules out any major brain disease, including internal bleeding.As of now, we need to exclude vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid hormone deficiency as possible causes for your symptoms. Both of these can be diagnosed by blood tests.In addition, anxiety and stress could also produce similar symptoms. So, if you are stressed or anxious, get treated and reduce them.If the symptoms persist, MRI of brain may be required after consulting a neurologist.I hope it helps.

My father is 88 years old , 9 months ago he had CVA , hemiplegic and ventilator dependent. He had tracheostomy PEG CVLINE FULY CATETER , He has had seazure from 2 months ago. We use depakine 500 mg TDS to remove his seazure but he has seazure still now and for removing his seazure attack we use midazolam and diazepam iv and by this he has hypotention and for removing hypotention we use dopamin infution.We used digoxin (anti arrytmy) 2 months ago but now he has generalize edema , alb (seruma) :3/7 What should we do for removing his generalize edema?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.It is unfortunate that your father has had recurrent seizures along with multiple other comorbid illnesses, including generalized edema, hypotension, etc.The cause of generalized edema is likely to be low serum albumin and poor nutritional status. His dietary protein intake can be increased through the Ryle's tube feeds. For short term improvement, albumin infusions may be given.For nursing, his legs can be elevated while he is sleeping or lying down. This would also help reduce his edema in the legs.If his seizures are not adequately controlled with depakine, then, other anti-seizure medications such as tegrital (carbamepine) or levetiracetam (keppra) may be added.I hope it helps.
