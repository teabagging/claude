For stomach to have a proper function the abdominal muscles need to be strong to support the stomach. Now stomach muscles are soft tissue muscle and abdominal are skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are controlled by human desire and soft tissue are by the autonomous nervous system. The exercise which you need to do it - straight crunches for the upper abdomen. Later crunches for the side muscles of the abdomen. The procedure is simple. Lye down on the mat with crook lying position. Then lift the head and shoulder 2-4 inches off the floor and try going towards the knee. And the other one you should do later bending.

Am experiencing numbness at base of skull when I lie down for bed, neck pain, infrequent dizziness, a tingling in left forearm and hand, along with lower back pain mostly on the right side. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, The degenerative disc disease is a condition where the water is lost from the intervertebral disc. Due to which there is degeneration, herniation, prolapse etc. During this , there will be a adjacent nerve root compression and the symptoms follow the course of the nerve. It occurs due to weakness of the paraspinal muscles of the spinal column. The disc degeneration can occur at any level from cervical to lumber. As you were diagnosed with Cervical disc degeneration at 4 levels I would like to know what are the services of them? Are they entering the canal and leading to parasis or paralysis of the muscles below the levels of injury. If not then it can still be treated conservatively. Using soft cervical collar and hot water fermentation will help reduce the spasm of the muscles and also will help stabilize the spinal column. Once the pain level falls below 6-7 in visual analogue pain scale of 0-10 then exercise can begin. Also physiotherapy modalities like Therapeutic ultrasound and TENS therapy will help reduce pain and inflammation. Once the muscles of the neck becomes strong the compression over the nerve can be released and the symptoms will reduce. Same has to be followed for the lower back. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most cases with degenerative disc disease respond well to conservative therapy under a physiotherapist and combination of pain killers.

Did a Life Line screening last month and everything was very good. But in the last 3 weeks I would walk 1 block and the back of my left calf in the middle would knot up and be pretty painful to walk. I stop and stretch it out and would help a little but would still hurt. I jog for at least a minute at night at 5 mph and do a 100 reps on a exerciser.","Doctor":"Hello, As your age is 75 we can expect some physiological changes in the body. Due to aging, there will be a reduction in the endurance of the muscular system along with other systems. Having done a regular exercise in low intensity will improve the overall physical ability of the muscle to function and also will improve the endurance and delay the fatigue. What you are facing is fatigue, and fatigue can be handled by improving endurance. You are doing sit and stand exercise in a chair for about 1 minute, which is not enough. So try doing sit and stand exercise 45 times. I know it sounds a little stupid but just tries it out. If you can withstand for 1 minute and continuously do 45 repetitions of sit and stand, then you will get the best outcome score. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, I always take this part of the exercise to improve the endurance in geriatrics. In fact, results achieved are 60 seconds 45 sit & stand, which is a big number. But really good outcome scores. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

For this, we need an MRI to confirm it as we can't see inside the human body with naked eyes. As the physician has mentioned about the ligament tear I think it will still be a ligament sprain I mean to say grade 1 injury, which will heal with hot water fermentation, crepe bandage or ankle brace, rest and elevation. Post which balance board training will help improve the strength in the muscles around the ankle and supporting the ankle joints. There is no surgical intervention so be relaxed. It is an ankle sprain and will heal within 3 weeks of time. Post which you can start exercising. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Now, this is not related to the knee. As you never mentioned about the injury so I suspect that you haven't had any. This burning sensation is related to the nerve root. due to weakness in the spinal region, the nerve root gets impingement. As the nerve has the function of carrying the sensory and motor, any impingement of the nerve will cause the dysfunction in the normal functions of the nerve.

In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most cases reported are delayed and takes time to correction with balance board rehabilitation.

Usually, when people don't have the habit of doing certain work and when they tend to do it leads to DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). So you should do less work and make it a habit. Regarding the shoulder pain, I will advise you to do shoulder exercises by which you develop some endurance which can help you to the job with ease.

My rheumatologist has done extensive blood testing, as well as an X-ray that show arthritis, but nothing much more. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello, If it's gout which is diagnosed these symptoms are common. You need to undergo proper Physiotherapy exercises for the core, and lower limbs as a whole.

What is your age? And what other conditions you facing with like - hypertension, OA, ligament injury, diabetes etc. As you haven't mentioned about all this I would like to say that taking an analgesic should help relieve the pain. For reducing swelling I understand what you did was right - compression, elevation, contrast bath etc. But for stiffness to come down you need to mobilize the knee. Stiffness can occur due to muscle tightness if there are any injuries within the joint - could be a ligament or bony. We need to assess this and work behind it. For now, on conservative management, you can start doing static hamstring and static quadriceps so this will elevate the pressure over the knee joint internal structures and thereby the neurophysiological system will release the stiffness of the knee. I will advise doing the above-mentioned exercise. Also, an x-ray will be good to see if any bony injuries are there and led to swelling and stiffness. If x-ray turns nil then an MRI will be good to understand the ligament injuries. Left untreated any ligament injuries will damage the bones of the joint and lead to early degenerative changes.

Once the pain falls below the level 5 in Visual analogue scale of 0-10 then exercise should be initiated with lower intensity. Initially focussing on the core stability and later on the lower limb muscles as whole.

I am worried are these related? I have survived thyroid cancer and it hasen t been returned for 6 years. Can it be cancer again?","Doctor":"Hello, I don't think this will be thyroid cancer. Usually, when the pain and tingling are radiating in nature, we look out for the changes in the cervical spine curvature changes. So we advice initially for an x-ray or the MRI later on. Based on the reports of the radiology we correlate that with clinical symptoms, if it is indicative the treatment will follow the guidelines. You should look for differential diagnosis too of your doubt with thyroid cancer. So a simple blood routine should be fine to look ahead for further test. Increase in WBC will indicate the infection and tests will be taken further. Also, for reducing the symptoms, like pain, tingling, needles etc, using a cervical soft collar for making the cervical spine stable, exercise for the neck muscles and upper limb muscles as a whole, TENS therapy and Ultrasound therapy under a physiotherapy guided program should help. In case the WBC turns out to be on a higher side than look forward with the cancer management part. But as I mentioned in the beginning, it won't be the one you are thinking.

As post diagnosed with spondylitis there will be some small degenerative changes in the intervertebral disc.

With the MRI with can figure out if due to the disc degeneration if any spinal nerve root is getting compressed. because your symptoms are indicative of C5-C6 levels disc degeneration.

My son took it for 4 days and has had severe pain in tendons, muscles, anxiety, depression and so on caused by the cipro. So far doctors have offered nothing in the way of treatment options. Help.","Doctor":"Hello, As the question is about the tendonitis caused by ciprofloxacin let me put my comments here. As Ciprofloxacin cannot lead to tendonitis, so be assured that the drug has not given any side effects which may lead to tendonitis, and that was the reason doctors have not offered anything for tendonitis. Muscle pain, tendon pain, anxiety, depression cannot be caused by ciprofloxacin. The major side effects it can cause it - nausea, vomiting, dizziness, rashes, diarrhea, stomach upset etc. It might be something else, so figure out this we need some part of the past medical history. Also, you can observe the symptoms for 2-3 days and give him paracetamol as a supplement, if the symptoms subside it won't be a drug reaction. In case after 3-4 days the symptoms still persist, then I think you need to get the blood routine. Also, anxiety and depression are common in kids as they cannot bear the pain and they actually don't understand what they are going through. So this can be psychological. My advice will be to wait for 2-3 days and keep the kid happy by diverting his mind by either foody stuff or toys. I think he should be fine and this is surely not a drug reaction.

Usually this symptoms might have caused due to either of the reasons. Ligament injury or the muscle weakness. Since it's bothering you from 6 months I think you should opt for an MRI. Usually any ignored knee injury in later stages develops major issues, so it's better to he cautious. Also, the pain you mentioned is behind the patella, I will advise you to do water fermentation and then static hamstring and static Quadriceps as the form of exercises. Which should help the knee muscles to have enough strength to avoid the knee cap bone to rub against the thigh bone and thereby relieving the inflammation.

As you may be off late consuming too much of the pain killers and this may have troubled the kidneys. Why don't you look for the creatine test.

Usually this is common with people taking pain killers in excess in fibromyalgia and arthritis.

I had no surgery,pyhsio or followup i went straight back to work 2days fter cast off any answers or is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello, As you had a fracture of the fibula, which is a year old now we need to know first which location the bone got fracture and what was the fracture like - hairline? As it's a year old now, there might be malunion of the fibula and that must be leading to the changes in the biomechanics of the bone for the bearing of the stress and strain over the shaft. Also this must have made the muscles of the lower limb weak and Imbalance. What I would suggest is take an x-ray to see if it's a malunion. If not confirmed in the x-ray then you can proceed to the exercise plan. Use the stocking for lower limbs. Strengthen the core muscles along with the hip and lower limb on both sides. Post this use the balance board training which will help to improve the joint biomechanics and correct the muscle imbalances. In my clinical practice of 12 years, most cases with old fracture have similar complains of the lower limbs. With the above mentioned exercise they are able to get good outcome score.

I can walk on it but want to know when I can get back to playing soccer. I have been elevating and icing for two days now and rapping it.","Doctor":"Hello, As you are a sports candidate we need to go with a sports rehab program than the conventional used for normal people. The mechanism of the injury is directly over the shin of the tibia. Now to elaborate, shin of the tibia has muscles less and fascia more. So inflammation of the fascia is the one leading to swelling. Good, you are using the RICE protocol as it's good to do in the initial stages. Using the leg brace or lower limb compression brace will be useful to control swelling for longer. Try strengthening the core, lower limb muscles and post all this, ankle rehabilitation using the balance board training which is used in SL maximum number of sports to correct the muscle imbalances and provide good strength equivalently to all muscles. You should get good results if started from slow to moderate to high intensity sports Rehabilitation program. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Thing is i also have pain on my lateral side of my left knee too which couldn t be explained from the mri, it could be from somewhere else i don t know but I have had a tight IT band and I also have mild patellar bursitis. I,ve had pain now for over a year, and the pattern is very unusual, sometimes I get pain when I,m just walking or even lying down and very rarely I would have training and no pain but it would usually appear after. Ive had physio which was focused on my tight IT band and a steroid injection into knee to see its affect after a month, it helped a little but it went back to what it was before. Im wondering what the next step in treatment would be? im 15, female, plays soccer,hockey,boxing.","Doctor":"Hello, Now since you have tried all, let me put in this way which can make a better understanding. As you have this patellofemoral syndrome along with knee joint space narrowing and later side pain, due to all this there will be changes in the biomechanics of the joints for lower limbs as well the spine. Need a proper examination and correction of the muscular Imbalance would provide efficient results. Since you are a sports candidate, testing you with basic exercise prescription might not work great, so we need to look with a different angle for the sports Rehabilitation. I can figure out some of the possible causes you are having with - Patello-femoral syndrome, Reduce joint space, Pain in the lateral aspect of knee joint (lateral collateral ligament sprain), Meniscus tear. So what I analyze is, pain is not reducing due to certain factors - Change in the biomechanics of the knee, hip, ankle and spine joints. Looking forward to the sports Rehabilitation program should go step by step. Strengthening the core muscles first: Using the knee braces, Hip muscles and the lower limb muscles strengthening, IT band stretching, VMO exercise, Balance board training. If followed with low to high intensity should provide good results. In case you have any other doubts please feel free to ask me. Hope I have answered your query.

The pain was localized over T12. It seemed to be aggravated and hurt to touch over that area. Activity or sitting for long periods in a car aggravated it and caused a raidiating burning sensation that woul go away with rest. However the bruised feeling over T12 remained constant and consistent. I went to a spine Dr. and he gave me a Prednisone shot, which helped for a month. Now the bruise like ache has returned. I have had x-rays and nothing seems out of alignment. Could this be a Spinousw Process fracture? Could it be an injury from lifting leg wieghts? What do you suggest to prevent me having to endure this the rest of my life? Please HELP. Thank You, Desperately Needing Answers","Doctor":"Hello, With history, it appears the pain is localized in the T12 region. That is the junction which gets more muscle weakness due to abnormal posture. During the time having weak muscles any exercise done for the lower limbs will provide a strain there. As this is the biomechanics of the spine. Leg goes up and spine goes down. If any weakness present there will be inflammation. Also, while sitting in the wrong posture, usually the relaxed position where the spine bends forward there will be over stretching of the paraspinal muscles which over a period of time goes weak and any strain applied to lower limb exercises will lead to pain there. As the X-ray turned out to be normal I do not suspect any kind of bone fracture there. If it was a fracture the symptoms would have been different. Now there is burning sensation which is radiating in nature taking an MRI will be on a safer side to know any soft tissue injury. Now coming to the stabilizing part of the spinal column. Why don't you try doing spinal extension and core stability exercise initially. Using ice packs over the painful area will reduce the pain as well. Having good stability of the spine will consist of the stability and strength of the para spinal muscles along with the posture correction will help with great benefits. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most cases have been reported with the same complaints. Having doing correction of posture and core stability exercises have provided good outcome score.

I have not been outside or near anything that could contain bugs that could do harm and ultimately, bite me. I did recently come back from a visit to the midwest and back that was 10 hours each way. I have been to two doctors, in which they took blood and did an ultra sound but I have only received news from one doctor that my blood work is normal (Kidney, Liver, Glucose levels). They did indicate that I did have a slightly higher-then-usual blood pressure which may be an indicator or may be due to my stress and anxiety from this entire situation. I also have been having moments where my ears have been ringing along with lightheadedness. I don t know what it is but I am wondering if its allergy related. Any insight would be fantastic!","Doctor":"Hello, As you have done the blood routine and things are fine there is no infection suspected by the physician. I think that this swelling is related to your travel. As sitting in continuously for long hours in abnormal posture can lead to changes in the spinal column leading to radiating pain. also, due to long hours of sitting there will be less venous drainage so the ankle swelling. Do hot water fermentation and keep the leg elevated over the pillow. This will help reduce swelling. Doing some core strengthening exercises is good for the spine to attain the stability of the same. so the alignment is achieved.

Also, have a small digital pulse oximeter at home to keep checking the oxygen saturation levels. Usually it's between 94-99% which is claimed to be good. Anything below 85 might be asking for the oxygen supply. Also in history, the missing part was the lobes arrested in the fibrosis of the lung. So which side it is and which lobe it is to understand much better. To provide advice for it, I will say sleeping on the side of the lung which is not fibrosis. Also, having an oxygen saturation supply machine at home will be good for the patient is there is no sleep apnea. If there is sleep apnea than a BiPAP machine will be advised for having good respiration. Having a good pulmonary rehabilitation team working behind the patient's recovery plan will be helpful for avoiding fatigue and aches and pains. Since respiratory system consumes maximum amount of human body energy a good oxygen supply will be of help. Also, fibrosis is an irreversible process. The more the supply of oxygen therapy along with pulmonary physiotherapy will be helpful for patient. Checking of oxygen saturation, pulse and blood pressure is of utmost importance in patients with fibrosis of lungs. Hope you take the wise decision for the patient. In my clinical practice of 12 years, seen cases with pulmonary fibrosis and the use of oxygen saturation machine with physical therapy or BiPAP with physical therapy have been helpful to avoid fatigue to set in.

If i run my finger down the bone it indents slightly, was wondering if it was fractured or just bruised? there is some bruising starting to come out now","Doctor":"Hello, Usually in football game fracture is most uncommon unless and until you have been hit by something hard over the shin. Also tibia is a strong bone of the body due to it's function of weight bearing and having a fracture easily is most uncommon. Maximum the injury can be expected with related to fracture can be hairline. Also, the shin of the tibia is having less bulky muscles in the anterior compartment and only the fascia will be the one to get more troubled. Due to inflammation of the facia there will be chances of pain and swelling. Using hot water fermentation and keeping the leg elevated over a pillow should give results of reduced pain and swelling. In the later stages, as the muscles might land up into weakness, rehabilitation of the lower limbs using balance board training will be a good choice to opt for.

We need to check out for thing like - medial collateral ligament injury, bursitis, varicose veins etc. Having a physical examination of the same can provide more insights. As the history do not mention any kind of injury mechanism this cannot be a ligament injury. But the doubt will follow to the bursitis or varicose veins. In both of the conditions, there is a possibility of swelling below the knee region. Allowing the rest for the knee and avoiding any forceful movement's of the knee joint like flexion and extension should avoid the trauma. Also getting it checked will be of good decision.

Since tibia is one of the strongest bone of the body as it has to carry the weight of the whole body chances of any major injuries are less common. But for a safer side, an x-ray will be good if any difficulty is faced because hairline fracture can happen but not a major one. Also, the leg muscles in the anterior compartment are less bulk compared to the posterior compartment so any direct impact happens it's majorly to the bone and fascia. This will heal with hot water fermentation and rest. Incase if any visual abnormalities are noticed an x-ray will be guided. For the pulled muscle in the upper limb, allowing it to rest and doing hot water fermentation initially should help reduce pain.

As due to the tightness in the Trapezius muscle there might be a chance of having deviation in the normal cervical curvature. Having it assessed by a sports Rehabilitation team which will include the orthopedist and a physiotherapist to help you. Usually due to Trapezius muscle spasm, there might be changes in the curvature of the spine and a change in the position of the intervertebral disc.

Now, this can be a bony hurt, as while having a bony hurt there might be a pain while sneezing, coughing, deep breathing etc. There won't be any torn cartilage, because if it was the pain must be even while doing normal breathing. Your second doctor is right, as when there is no fracture noted in CT, there is no point doing an MRI for now. CT scan are good for bone scanning and MRI for the soft tissues. Your need to wait for week or two for pain to come down. If the pain comes down it will be bony or muscular hurt, using hot water fermentation and doing slow deep breathing will be useful in such cases. In case, if the pain does not come down, then you can opt for an MRI to look out for any soft tissue injury like the intervertebral disc.

Is this what is causing me the pain in my neck and shoulder? does this mean that that shoulder is weak? Dont really understand what underdeveloped means.","Doctor":"Hello, Well, I don't think there is something called as an underdeveloped shoulder as terminology in medicine if it does exist I really don't know. First time listening something like this. Also, maybe the attending physician has meant, that there is a weakness of the muscles of one shoulder when compared to another, apart from that I do not understand what is an underdeveloped shoulder. Not when you mention the pain in the neck and shoulder, I think this should be related to the cervical radiculopathy. If you can take an MRI of the cervical spine we can understand some of the things better. Because the pain in the neck and shoulder can be due to two reasons, one it might be inflammation of the trapezius muscle or might be the nerve entrapment.

Having good milk and milk products in a day and taking sunbath will be useful. As both calcium and vitamin D is needed for bones to become stronger post-surgery.

As the foot is one of the important parts of the body since it has to bear the whole body weight I would not recommend taking this lightly. Any abnormal bio-mechanical changes will not be good and may lead to other abnormal bio-mechanical functions of the joints like - ankle, knee, hip and lumbar spine.

Rest assured. if you are once done with full weight bearing then later after 3 months if x-ray reveals full healing then an ankle rehabilitation program will be started. Which can help to improve the surgical procedure to maximum output. In my clinical practice of over 12 years usually people underwent such procedure have responded well to post surgical rehabilitation plan. Hope I have answered your query.

As the pain coming back to back is indicative of having inflammation at the bone leading to recurrence of pain. Taking painkillers for short duration is not harmful but taking it for long run may damage the kidneys leading to other complications. With the tail bone pain mentioned in the history, I suspect you have weakness or the hip muscles which is leading to excessive pressure over the bone and causing inflammation. Also I suspect there will be a week spinal muscles due to week the load is becoming excessive which shouldn't happen. Doing exercises for hip muscles and core stability exercise should help you in long run. If your job is designed to sit and work for longer hours I will advice you to buy one piles pillow and sit over it when working. This will discard the excessive weight transferring to bone and make it more into momentum. In my clinical practice of over 12 years most cases who have tail bone pain have responded well to exercise and precautionary measures. Hope I have answered your query.

I get stiffness in the juncture of head and neck and feel imbalance very frequently. If i take zapiz tablet i get relief from stiffness and imbalance. I have been taking zapiz 0.25 intermittently whenever i have the symptom beyond tolerance. Can you please advice?","Doctor":"Hi, As you have Spondylitis I would recommend you to take an MRI of the cervical spine so we understand what are the soft tissue changes happening in the cervical spine. We need to check what are the disk getting trouble due to degenerative changes in the cervical spine. on and off neck stiffness is due to any compression happening with the spinal nerve root or maybe the spinal cord by the intervertebral disc. Due to this there might be you and stiffness or maybe inflammation of the trapezius muscle so I would advise you to first start using the neck collar we should be a soft neck collar. post applied the soft neck collar maximum number of times or minutes or hours a day I would like to advise you to take hot water fomentation to the neck and upper back. As the pain symptoms comes down I will advise you to start doing mech static strengthening exercises which may help to avoid applying pressure of the intervertebral disc to the spinal nerve root or the spinal cord by which you can avoid the frequent neck stiffness. In my clinical practice of over 12 years I have always seen people complaining of the neck stiffness and heaviness in the head this happens at the craniovertebral junction so we recommend them to take an MRI and come back so we find there are changes in the cervical spine and the intervertebral disc causing compression and changes. most cases recover with soft collar hot water fermentation and neck exercises.

You headache the way you mentioned is also indicative of Same degenerative changes I would recommend you to take an MRI of lumbar and cervical spine as it will provide more insight to your complaints. For sciatica there is a set of exercises available but keeping into consideration of your blood pressure we need to go slow and steady so recovery follows. Exercise include - core stability, spinal extensor muscle strengthening, static Quadriceps, static hamstring and straight leg raise. This exercise has been found effective in research for people having acute sciatica. For your headache, I will recommend to use hot water fermentation over the neck region, then using a neck collar for a week and check out if the headache comes down. If so then we can conclude this headache to be cervicogenic headache. Some exercises to strengthen the muscles of the neck, like the static Neck exercises, should be of help Do abundant of deep breathing exercises on a regular basis to have a good pulmonary system so that the fatigue is delayed while performing the exercises.

Finally had rod inserted from my hip to ankle, so i cannot bend leg at all. I am in extreme pain all the time, the next step is to amputate leg from knee down, at least i could walk. I am 62 y/o male who used to be active","Doctor":"Hello, Firstly, sorry to hear about the 3 knee replacements then now amputation. It's a big pain I can understand that. Coming to the query, well below knee amputation might work if you having gangrene or necrosis of the limb due to uncontrolled sugar levels. Also before you undergo amputation of the below knee I would recommend that you first need to strengthen the other joints of the body leaving the amputation limb. Because post amputation your upper limbs and the other lower limb will be supposed to take the whole body weight and if you are weak in that state it will be difficult to make you back on feet. To overcome the helplessness situation I will recommend getting the strength in the upper limbs and the other lower limb so that the recovery post surgery will happen faster with less pain. In my clinical practice of over 12 years most cases seen by me of amputation I have always advised and worked on the other limbs and joints to make them stronger. In about 90% of cases the post surgery recovery is excellent with 10% who were not taking the exercise as that important as the surgery.

Since with the history I do not find much serious but a physical examination and assessment might provide some insights to your complain. Since you are a software professional I do not expect any major iniruy with your knee. But on a safer side it's always good to get it examined under a orthopedist or a physical therapist. Because both can assist in examination of the knee and diagnosis. For the complain you mentioned I feel there is weakness of the quadriceps muscles due to your profession.

This kind of tickling sensation can happen due to alteration in the function of the Nerve. So this indicates to me that there might be some nerve root entrapment leading to alterations in the function of the nerve. So I would advise you to take an MRI of the lumbar spine and get back. In my clinical experience of 12 years most patients have complaints similar to what your husband is providing. We do it for assessment examination and take help of the MRI scan to confirm the degenerative changes in lumbar spine leading to the alteration of the sensory system and altered feeling sensation from knee to feet.

In most cases it is ligament injury but to always stay on a safer side an x-ray is always recommend to see any hairline fracture has occured. As untreated fracture leads to future trouble unnecessarily. Coming back to you query, it is appearing as it is a sprained ligament but still x-ray is needed for a safer side. Next apply the ice and keep the ankle joint immobilised in crepe bandage and don't put much weight till 2-3 weeks of time. Once the pain levels comes down while applying weight, start the ankle toe movements along with static Quadriceps and static hamstring. Later after 5-6 weeks onto the balance board training for having a muscle Imbalance correction and also the stabilizing of the ankle joint to avoid future ligament injuries. In my clinical practice of over 12 years most patients with ankle sprains are treated with sports injury management for best outcome scores and we are able to achieve it.

As this might be due to either ligament sprain at the hip joint or nerve entrapment at the lumbar level. Due to which the motor movements of the muscles have been compromised. Since there was burning sensation I suspect a nerve pull. this needs rest initially and later a guided exercise program to retain the muscle strength. As joints are supported by muscular system it is always good to get a diagnosis under a physical examination and assessment by a orthopedist and take the call for MRI for hip or lower back.

But resolved with hot water fermentation and gentle massage. Coming to the actual cause, your shoulder, why do they hurt. I feel you should take an MRI of the cervical spine as I understand from the history that you have Trapezitis. And this occurs due to multiple factors but still, an MRI is suggested to find is any cervical disc is leading troubling. Trapezitis is some time a protective inflammation of the muscles to safeguard the spinal cord in the cervical region.  What I would advice is to follow the therapeutic plan which should help you. 1. Hot water fermentation 2. Neck collar for a week (only when not exercising) 3. Static neck exercises 4.

Otherwise I am a healthy 56 year old woman, 5 6 tall and weigh 126 lbs.","Doctor":"Hello, As I understand from the history there is a lack of muscle balance and muscle strength post the surgical procedure. It would have been good if you had taken a fill THR program. Well they say, its never late. As you are having less confidence in walking this is a common thing in most people who have underwent THR. Now since you have a hip joint replaced the joint proprioceptive system is fused out. I mean to say, every joint in the human body has joint receptors and these receptors tell the brain the joint position to keep it and stable too. Now post THR, the joint receptors are not there and the muscle has the complete role to work behind the holding the joint in position. Now you mentioned you doing find stability I will recommend you to undergo a physical therapy session of exercises to help stabilize the joint by making the muscle stronger and balances while in action. Since my 12 years of practice has experienced cases who have similar issues. But exercises they have improved and now can move around easily. We have always made assure we focus on not only behind the knee but even the core and the knee muscles to get maximum output.

Now my right knee is swollen and bruises are popping out all around it. I am resting today with my leg elevated, ice on my knee, and I ve taken some ibuprofen. I ve rubbed ICY HOT on my knee and later some arnica. Am I doing enough or is this more serious than I realize?","Doctor":"Hello, As per the question you asked, I would say it is right thing to do which you are doing. Icing and keeping the leg elevated over a pillow. what is missed out is stabilizing the joint, so use crepe bandage for stabilizing the knee joint initially now itself. Coming to what would have caused this. I feel by the history that you lifted a heavy weight and this must have given excessive pressure to the ligaments of the knee joint. For now now we have to see if bending and straightening the knee is painful or any ligament laxity leading to later rotation of the knee joint. If so then we may need an MRI to see if any soft tissue damage has occured. On the therapy front. Since you are doing icing, elevation please add on crepe bandage so stabilizing of the joint allows no more trauma to soft tissues. After a week or so, I would advice to follow the set of exercise. 1. Ankle toe movements 2. Static hamstring 3. Static Quadriceps 4. Straight leg raise 5. Internal and external rotation of hip while straight leg is raised 6. Lying on stomach - lifting the leg backwards without bending knee 7. Lying on stomach and speaking the leg out with 2 ft distance in between them and flexing the knee. Once you get good in this exercise take it to the next level by indulging into weight bearing exercise. Here weight bearing exercise is about your own body weight with not adding any additional ones.

No history of cancer in my family, but history of IBS and stress related symptoms. I have diabetes, diagnosed less than a year ago (have had tendency to it since a kid - 5.7 and 5.4 where my last A1C readings from 2 days ago and mid March, respectively; 5.7 was the reading that triggered the glucose intolerance test upon which diabetes was confirmed). I'm on 250mg a day of metformin (500mg when I eat more during the weekend). I take enalapril for high blood pressure (which runs in the family). Since starting these medications I have been limiting carbs a lot, eating lots of steamed, boiled vegetables. I have never been eating a lot of meat or fish my whole life. I am a very anxious person and tend to worry about any symptoms. Before feeling this abdominal discomfort I have had symptoms of anxiety attacks (mild chest pain in no specific area, feeling of panic building up, tingling of upper body, arms, etc).

Coming straight to pinterest, what would have made a big help to us was that the MRI reports was explained here.  But well since it's not there we have to look other options to workout. Since you mentioned you get pain while straightening the knee just behind the cap I suspect it to be patellofemoral arthritis or chondromalacia patella. For finding if it is chondromalacia patella, we need to take the x-ray in the aeroplane view in knee flexed position. This will help us determine that there is maltracking of patella. For chondromalacia patella the exercise is directed towards the correction of the patella track using vmo exercise. Also the exercise for other leg too along with the adjacent joints of the injured led - like the hip and ankle. Most of the cases recover if the diagnosis is made and then treated rather treating in general as static Quadriceps and static hamstring with SLR. If it turns out to the patello-femoral arthritis than we need to look for a set of exercise which makes the equal distribution of the weight when walking. As without having a gait analysis it will be difficult to figure out the muscles involved or the ones which are weaker. In many a times without a diagnosis also there are symptomatic treatment available at most times but when they fail its duty of every medical professional to find the cause and then treat. In my clinical practice of 12 years most patients have walked with similar complains. But never made a decision in general to treat but more precise to problem oriented and with considering all the parameters a therapy plan is made to get the maximum outcome score and fortunately we were able to achieve till now. I was wondering that what physical therapy have you been? Was it TENS therapy along with Ultrasound therapy? And the exercise like static Quadriceps and static hamstring? It would have been good if you had mentioned in detail so we could have got more insights. In your case I will offer a set of exercise to try out and please do let me know if that has helped you over a period of time. 1. Icing the tender point ( only it you are non diabetic) 2. Internal rotation of hip and both legs up holding for 10 counts each 3. Lying on back with legs apart of 2 ft and doing knee flexion and extension. Where during flexion the feet is still 1 ft apart. 4. Lying on the stomach and lift the leg up and getting to other side. This is called as a leg cross over exercise. 5. Balance board training. 6. Reverse walking. I am sure this set of exercise if done properly should help you to avoid pain while extending the knee joint.

There won't be any fracture so be assured. This must be a soft tissue injury leading to the healing process to occur. Some sort of internal bleeding but it will heal so nothing to worry. Kindly do hot water fermentation then keep the leg over the pillow in the lying position and perform ankle toe movements this will help the muscles to become stronger and remove excessive metabolic waste. In my clinical practice of 12 years, such cases recover faster and back to sports. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I have added plavix and metformin to my medicines recently and wonder if they are causing the problem?","Doctor":"Hello, What appears to me is the slipping is not caused due to the medications you are taking. This slipping might be due to non-gripping of the foot skin texture. What I would suggest is to dip the feet in the normal room temperature water and then clean it nicely with a towel so the dead skin comes out by rubbing the towel harder. The new skin texture will form and you will get a good grip. Also, try picking up petals or marbles with the help of the toes so you start getting good holding grip. Hope I have answered your query.

This might be acidity but still on a safer side taking an ECG or ECHO should be on a precaution basis to rule out the cardiac pathology. The only reason to mention this is because you mentioned about ankle swelling. ankle swelling occurs due to lack of venous return and this only happens when there is weakness of the cardiac muscle to pump out the excess metabolic waste. It might not be the case as well but an assessment of the same can make us tension free. Taking to bowel and constipation I will tell you that this may even lead trouble for the venous return and one needs to get rid of it. Having castor oil or having any acidity medication should help ease of the system. As you mentioned the symptoms I feel you are entering the 40th year and menopause can be anywhere close by. Having a lack of bone mineralisation is also common. Doing some regular blood and urine routine should be of great help. Also, try doing regular slow weight-bearing exercise and this should help to manage the metabolic functions to stay optimum. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

However, what concerns me is that a couple of days after the fall, my shin became red and the leg below the knee is swollen. Could that be from the fall as well? I never injured the shin.","Doctor":"Hello, Yes, you are right. This is due to the injury to the knee. It is nowhere related to the shin. As you had a fall and this injury must have diatribes the internal structures of the knee leading to sprain and swelling. Taking up an x-ray will be always good for a safer side to figure out if you have any fracture. In most cases, it turns out negative but we do have to understand that it is better to be cautious than ignorant. What I will suggest is to take up an x-ray if you can on a safe side. You can take hot water fermentation and keep the leg elevated over a pillow & perform ankle toe movements. This will help to allow a good venous return which will help to reduce the swelling and redness. Post this you can do some static Quadriceps and static hamstring along with straight leg raise to regain muscle strength to avoid muscle wasting. Using a knee brace will be of benefit for stabilizing the joint to avoid excessive pressure falling over the ligaments due to injury. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most patients have responded well when precautions are taken and exercise is implemented with an intention to not allow muscle wasting and drain the metabolic waste.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, I don't think this is cancer so please be relaxed. Because cancer cannot be just predicted by all such soft lumps. For now, I will advise you to do icing and simple exercises for the lower limbs to have a balancing strength on both sides. Usually, you get pain and aches if there is any ligament injury like a sprain in the knee and the swelling of the adjacent joints as they take maximum stress for the weight bearing. Your pain should be fine after icing and simple exercises.

As you mentioned about having weakness in the arm and unable to lift, I feel this should be related to the nerve impingement. As nerve has a function of motor and sensory any disturbance in the nerve functioning can lead to such symptom. As it is occurring only in the lying position I think this should be due to pressure falling over the nerve in the cervical region leading to dysfunction of the nerve and leading to symptoms.

The mass in the posterior aspects of the knee can be either due to the ligament sprain within the knee joint leading to a formation of cysts called as bakers cyst in the popliteal fossa.

The use of icing is mentioned in the RICE protocol is just because when we take an x-ray we can see the injury if a present can be visible.

Because your knee is giving pain from 2 years and also there are gait changes, which according to you is funny walking then I suspect some soft tissue damage and maybe early degenerative changes. This isn't a good thing to hear as well. Because any injury to the knee if ignored will land into major soft tissue damages and early osteoarthritis of the knee. To avoid the early ageing of the knee joint it is advised to take an MRI and treat accordingly so we can avoid major damages at an early age. For now, I will recommend you to try meeting up a physiotherapist so you can get the muscles of the lower limb strengthened which may avoid further injury to the internal structures of the knee. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, the early detection of the knee injury with clinical examination and with the help of MRI most cases have avoided early osteoarthritis of the knee.

Now for knee pain, you should start slow and gradual strengthening exercise. like pressing the knee down and lifting the leg up. We need to consider that you have heart complications too. So anything we try as an exercise we need to keep monitoring the pulse and blood pressure to avoid any added complications. Now coming to sciatica. first choice will be rest along with physical therapy like TENS therapy, therapeutic ultrasound therapy and mobilization of the lumbar vertebrae. Post which some exercise should begin but we need to go slow as we have your cardiac issue to consider. Use hot water fermentation for lower back and knee as well. this should help improve the vascular supply and reduce the muscle spasm. Avoid using icing due to a cardiac issue.

It would have been really good if you had mentioned the details of the MRI reports as we could have understood something from it. If you have any issue with the intervertebral disc and nerve entrapment. Now since you are mentioning about pain in the hip, thigh, leg and back, I would like to know if the pain symptom is radiating in nature? Also how is the back pain? Is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. If dull aching then it will be related to muscle but if sharpshooting than it will be for nerve. Now coming to an analysis of you, you mentioned your age is 38 so we can look for some Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Due to which there might be changes of back pain and nerve getting trapped. for this I will recommend you to try out the exercise for the core, back and lower limbs on both sides. It is mandatory to do exercise in any back pains or radiating pains as due to pain there is a muscle weakness which gets build up over a period of time and once the muscles are weak there is instability of the spinal column. I wish you check for your blood glucose levels along with uric acid too so we can have a differential diagnosis made to rule out the possibility because. If you can still mention in detail about the MRI it will be really kind of you. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, many back cases associated with leg pain are doing well with conservative management. Like - exercise, physical therapy and yoga. Outcome score is almost as desired to be. Please start the exercise and you will get a difference in the overall physical well being. Hope I have answered your query.

Nerve has got two functions - motor and sensory. Motor functions are related to muscle movements and sensory functions are related to - pain, touch, tingling, numbness, temperature. In your case, it's the sensory and motor both are getting disturbed. Taking up and MRI should help understand the extent and level of soft tissue injuries in the cervical spine.

Piriformis syndrome or Nerve impingement. In Piriformis syndrome, the Piriformis muscle gets a spasm and the nerve get pressure leading to symptoms. Applying hot water or icing over the Piriformis muscle should provide relief. In case if this fails then we should look for other things. In nerve impingement, the never coming out of the lumbar spine from the spinal cord get trapped either by the intervertebral disc or muscles of the spinal column. Applying heat pad or icing should stop the symptoms. If it does stop the symptoms then its nerve impingement in the lumbar region. Taking an MRI will be of good to understand that what is the level of damage to the soft tissues. Looking out for McKenzie maneuver should help centralize the pain. You can check this online.

But surely we will provide some inputs which can help you analyze what exactly the thing is and measures should be taken. Firstly, what is your age? are you diabetic? any other systemic disorders? when you mention all this in history it becomes easy for us to give you an opinion to be considered. Tingling, numbness and muscle spasms can be due to nerve entrapment and need a physical examination for the same. You mentioned about pain, is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. If sharp shooting then it might be related to nerve pathology and if dull aching that may be related to muscle injury. Also, have you checked your uric acid levels? if not please do it so we can figure out if it is due to increased uric acid levels. do you feel burning sensation in the urine? What I will suggest is, first use hot water fermentation and do ankle movements in hot water. Post that please keep the leg elevated over a pillow in lying position. this should help firstly the swelling to come down. In case you are diabetic, you need to get your blood glucose levels to get checked and also if never checked for high blood pressure it is advised to get it checked once.

Get and abdominal scan done so we can figure if any organ is involved. Along with this do routine blood and urine tests so we correlate and provide some inputs. In case the above ones turn out to be normal than we may need an MRI scan of the lumbar spine to rule out any pathology of the spinal nerve roots. as sometimes there is the possibility of nerve getting entrapped and less to symptoms.

I ve have numbness in my hip, left leg and foot. Well today my left calf and foot are cold. I have a heating pad on it and it s still cold. Is this a symptom of a center herniated disc?","Doctor":"Hello, Sorry to hear about the disc injury you are having. Coming to the disc injury, any disc injury is not Mandatory that it will lead to the motor, sensory, motor sensory both or no symptoms. The symptoms are totally individual based. In your case, the nerve is getting pinched by the disc prolapse which will be a small fragment troubling the nerve on its nerve root where it is coming out of the spinal cord. Nerve has got two major functions - one is motor and other is sensory. The motor includes movement and sensory included the pain, temperature, numbness, tingling etc. In your case it is sensory and by this, the motor functions are reduced. As you have tried to put hot water bag over the calf which was cold, I would recommend trying keeping it over the lower back, as that is where the nerve root is. Once the nerve root gets the warmth the nerve supplying the muscles will get warm sensation back. Also with this, the pain will come down. Now coming to the therapy part, if you have unbearable pain then medication might be looked for. But most cases are ceased from medication after a 7 days. I will recommend you to first try out the McKenzie maneuver of lying on the stomach and making an extension of the spine with the help of the upper limb. You can check this out online. As this maneuver is kind of at its best to centralize the pain only in the back region. Once you get the pain centralized in the lower back you can use hot water bag over it to provide the soothing effect. Once there is centralization and soothing of pain you can start slowly the core stability exercise and also the lower limb strengthening while lying on the mat. In my clinical practice of 12 years, a maximum number of cases have responded well with the McKenzie maneuver and exercises. You can take the help of a physical therapist if you wish to.

Suddenly he has been experiencing leg pain while deep asleep at night, which wakes him up a several times at night. He is diabetic too. His sugar is high and is on insulin. Anything that can help him with the pain.","Doctor":"Hello, Sorry to hear about your father. Coming to the point. What is the age of your father? Is the TB is of the Lungs? because it can even be off the bone too? If it's for lungs or bones I will recommend to take an oxygen saturation machine on rent at home so that the gets a constant supply of oxygen. The basic principle of this oxygen is that it acts as a fuel to the cells and allow the healing process to occur by reducing the pain. Next, Since you mentioned he is diabetic I will request you to ask him to do as much as a breathing exercise. The reason is, the respiratory system burns a maximum amount of calories when used. The respiratory system is the only system which uses 80% of the human body energy. For example, when one suffers from cold or cough, he/she is too tired the reason is the lungs are consuming maximum energy from the body. So anyone can go to work with back pain and knee pain, but with cold and cough, they feel miserable. Next, you asked a suggestion for leg pain. I would say why don't you approach a physical therapist. They will use TENS therapy which will help your father to have a reduction in the leg pain. TENS therapy has been graded effective in most types of pains. since your father diabetic, I feel TENS therapy is the right thing to do. Also, some passive movement of the legs to drain the metabolic waste and also keeping the leg elevated over the pillow should help. In my clinical practice of 12 years, most diabetic cases even without TB complain of leg pain a lot. But with a sensible approach, most have responded well to TENS therapy and Exercises.

If it is prone to lead to fracture the orthopedist may advice for surgery and the orthopedist call should be the final decision.

Last week it came back and I kept cleaning my down stairs and now the pain in my thigh on the other leg is so bad I can barely walk I guess from favoring the other side.","Doctor":"Hi, What I understand from the history is you have weak muscles of the foot. This is one of the reason you are getting pain again and again. Also when you buy the shoe next time make it assure it is 360° flexible, because that is how the shoe should be selected. I don't know if the podiatrist have given some insights in buying the shoe. Let's come to the pain in the thigh. this pain is due to excessive load happened on the muscle while performing the Physical activity. As it's a central nervous system who decides where to put weight and where to not. So by default the weight is transferred more on the other side of the leg. This is just time being and it's called DOMS (Delayed onset muscle soreness) which will be alright in 2-3 days of time. Coming back to your actual problem. Pain in foot. I think there is muscle weakness which needs a correction now. I will advice you few exercise and I hope it should work well with you. Since the same I have been trying with people having calcaneal spur, plantar fasciitis, etc. and it has done well and from the last 12 years I been working on with different patients for similar complaints. Keep your feet in the room temperature water. Use some pellets or some marbles inside the water. try to grip them and remove it out of the water with the toes. Next try walking bare feet on the ground. Forward and reverse both. but do slow walking. I think this will help you to regain the strength in the muscles of the foot.

I have also been very tired for the past couple of weeks.","Doctor":"Hello, Sometimes autoimmune diseases (and there are many different types), can cause joint pain as well as fatigue and rashes. Thankfully, there are many very good drugs to treat these, if you happen to have one. I would see your PCP or a rheumatologist where they will order specific labs looking for autoimmune diseases.

Movement is coming back it s the 4th day today my thumb is still stiff and on occasions my wrist still hurts but I m more worried that I can t physically make my wrist turn so that my palm is facing upwards! Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello, It is very normal to be stiff after being treated in a cast. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months to resolve. However, with non-operatively treated wrist fractures, there is a risk of rupturing the thumb extensor tendon, meaning that you would loose the ability to straighten out your thumb. This risk is low, but it does happen, but if you are able to straighten out your thumb then there is nothing to worry about. The loss of turning your wrist upwards, also known as supination is normal, but you might not ever get it all back, it just depends on how bad your break was, and your natural individual body response.

He might have suffered a quadriceps contusion, which is treated strangely enough by wrapping the shin to the thigh to get about 120 degrees for the first 24 hours to lessen the hematoma. Then ice and Advil, like you guys are doing. Likely the bruising will continue to develop, and he will be fine in a few weeks. Hope I have answered your query.

I do sit most of the day at my desk....I try to get a walk in during the day, but don t always manage to.","Doctor":"Hello, There is a nerve that supplies feeling to the back inner corner of the heel called the medial calcaneal nerve. This nerve is sensory only and does not power any muscles. It's possible that if the workouts you were doing were new, and your shoes didn't fit quite right, that you could have irritated this nerve. This nerve isn't commonly irritated, or at least it doesn't bother people enough to come to the doctor. Perhaps you want to make sure you have good fitting exercise shoes, but I wouldn't worry either way because it will probably go away on its own. Hope I have answered your query.

Although it may be a pilon cyst what about the possibility of it being a bone growth on the scalp and is there anyway of telling in advance before an incision is made?","Doctor":"Hello, A pilonidal cyst is a cystic structure that develops along the tailbone (coccyx) near the cleft of the buttocks, approximately 4 cm-5 cm from the anus. These cysts usually contain hair and skin debris. Individuals with a pilonidal cyst may not have any symptoms at all (termed asymptomatic), whereas others may develop an infection of the cyst with associated pain and inflammation. Although some patients may experience a recurrence of pilonidal disease, in general, the long-term prognosis is excellent. In the rare case of squamous cell carcinoma development, the prognosis will vary according to different factors and should be discussed with your physician. Mortality (death) from pilonidal disease is extremely rare. There won't be any trouble and things will be fine with conservative management post surgery if already done. Also, it can not occur on the scalp maybe it will be something else. Need a general surgeon physical examination and assessment for the same. Hope I have answered your query.

So it would have been good if you had provided some more information in the past medical history. As any spasm over the facial region will have an HMF involved and needs a briefing for anyone to undergo in the depth if the case. For now, I will recommend for facial massage, facial massage, MFR of the facial muscles and some basic exercise like holding water in the mouth and making the water blown in each direction. Regarding homeopathy and acupressure I am quite unsure it may be helpful to you because any chronic cases needs a proper allopathic attention initially and later change over to homeopathic or ayurvedic medicine. Also, trying out botox is actually good, since its having no side effects at all so you can go for botox for a quick solution. This is totally my personal opinion about botox rather going to homeopathic and acupressure and making wastage of money. Infact people with facial palsy, bells palsy and HMF involved have responded well to botox for facial muscles. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

If the bump found to be superficial it can be drained by a needle under a neuro surgeons guidance. But beforehand an MRI will be taken to rrule out any spinal cord involved.

Please explain !!","Doctor":"Hello, Usually, with the MRI scan, we can analyze the soft tissue of the body but the bone scan is for assessing the construction of the bones if they are strong enough with proper deposits. As there is no mention about the clinical symptoms it will become wrong on our part to comment over the orthopedist decision. The bone scan is only referred to post-MRI if the Orthopedist finds clinical complaints different from what actually it is shown in the MRI. Also, spondylitis is a common thing we find every now and then in every 3 Rd individual. In my practice of 12 years, I have seen almost a bunch of cases for spondylitis and most of them have responded well to medication and Physical therapy.

Now neck sprain can be get associated with trapezius muscle spasm, paraspinal muscle spasm or intervertebral disc degenerative changes. We say in general about neck sprain but it is sometimes not the case. Having a good physical examination and if you are aged above 25 then MRI can help assess much better the overall complaint of why the cause is. Coming to the treatment part. First foremost this you should do is taking hot water fermentation and use the cervical collar. Both of this helps to reduce the pain and stabilize the neck. Post a week you can slowly start free neck exercises and later on strengthening exercise.

After 10 minutes or so I seem to work through the worst of it. I have had surgery twice for ruptured discs in my neck at age 39 and 40, my neck is always tight and I do exercises to loosen it up. I have a little trouble occasionally swallowing during meals, particularly grainy foods. I also had asthma from about 5 years old till I was 17 which may play into the breathing issues. I am now 62 years old. Your thoughts would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello, As you had issues with the neck and surgery was performed I think any strenuous shot played by you using the muscles of the neck and shoulder girdle gives a direct pull to the nerve root leading to tightness which is not a good thing to hear as it may go on to damage it more and more. You need to be careful with it. Coming to your breathing issue, as you are asthmatic there are possibilities of you to forget doing breathing exercise which is most important in asthmatic cases. As some time in their life asthma cases do develop asthmatic attack and that can be a painful situation. Also please have a self assessment or ask someone to notice you, most of the times your breathing pattern will be from mouth to mouth. inspiration also through mouth and expiration too. In this case, the ability of the alveolar tissue to function can be reduced and may lead to additional symptoms which are not expected by asthmatic patients. Tennis is an aerobic game. it demands lot of energy. Since you are asthmatic the overall functional ability of the lung to cope up with this becomes less. Its always good to undergo a good pulmonary rehabilitation so the overall functional ability of the lungs improve. Also, will recommend you yo buy a respirator which is a small machine and can be used by asthmatic patients to assess their FEV1 values from time to time to assess the ability of their lung tissue. Please take a piece of advice from the Surgeon who operated you for the neck disc, before indulging in the sports. As the pull of the shot is directly hitting the nerve root to get trouble and muscles are trying to get stiff to avoid any major injuries to occur. In my practice of 12 years, I have seen both cases with discectomy and asthma and have responded well to physical therapy and precautions on when necessary to be followed.

Using how water fermentation and allowing it to rest will help reduce the inflammation. Also using knee brace should be of additional support to the knee joint to get less pressure. As it is a weight bearing joint it needs to be treated well. Doing some strengthening exercise for the knee muscles like static quadriceps which can be performed by pressing the knee down and static hamstrings which can be performed by pressing the heel down. Along with this you can try doing straight leg raise as well. Please continue the exercises for 10 days and let me know if you find any changes.

I will ask you a few questions - are you diabetic or have any signs of High blood pressure? if not checked please check it once. As you mentioned you are heavily built and also having injuries to the ligaments of the knee this must be a disturbance occurred to the normal vasculature due to fall. As the whole body weight might have gone through it. You need to allow the healing process to occur as there will be microvasculature trauma to the small capillaries. If you aren't diabetic I would ask you for quick icing technique as it will create a stimulation to cold effect to the sensory system leading to the closure of the capillaries. Which may help to reduce the swelling and pain. Also, you can request the physician about the medicinal ointment for the healing as brand name varies from country to country I would not be able to guess which is available in your country.

Try taking water in mouth and hold in the mouth and do cheek movement's. Try to do for as long as 1 minute. Jaw pain - for this the above one will help as there will be good amount of strength developing which will help ease the pain over the jaw as the ligament will get release of pressure.

Please keep the leg elevated over the pillow while lying position. Opt for lose clothing as well. Perform ankle toe movement's and some basic knee pressing down. Any movement in the muscle will help drain the metabolic waste and reduce the swelling.

This injury occurs due to sudden thrust to the head and leading to an impression of damage to the spinal cord at the cervical region. I will advise the first foremost thing to do is taking up an MRI. because that will provide more light to the injury by revealing the internal structures of the cervical spine and spinal cord. Its good that you have not developed any major injury. because in whiplash injury things can go otherwise. Thank god that you are all fine and there is only pain. Once MRI is done you will be able to notice the extent of soft tissue involved in whiplash injury. Based on the soft tissue injury, painkillers along with physical therapy will be advised. As with physical therapy like Ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the pain will reduce and muscle spasm will be reduced too leading to less pain. Any muscles which have gone wasting during the resting phase may need to regain some strength. Please use the cervical collar for time being to avoid more compression of the soft tissue.

In 2003 i had an xray showed my lower back was normal. Are these present problems job related?","Doctor":"Hello, Due to your job profile, there will be an additional weakness of the muscles of the spinal column leading to compression over the disc which is in between the two vertebral bodies. To avoid more compression the body had taken the new position of the spinal column leading to scoliosis. At most times the disc which is situated in between the vertebral bodies loses the water content in that leading to reduced intervertebral disc place. I can say this is functional scoliosis and needs a correction to avoid more trouble to the intervertebral disc. The first thing to do is meeting up an orthopedist to get it physically examined and also an MRI will be advised. Later taking medication for pain will be recommended. Also, physical therapy will be helpful to correct functional scoliosis and also improving muscle strength with some exercise of correcting the spinal column. Hope I have answered your query.

If you have diabetes than avoid icing and use hot water fermentation. Also, check for may signs of vascular insufficiency like varicose veins. if absent than then soreness is just a muscle strain.

Also, this can occur due to lack of usage of the hand to its efficiency. You mentioned about the plate in the wrist, that means you had a displaced fracture which may have disturbed the normal muscle tissue which has now been giving a lot of cramps. Thumb movement is restricted, means it's a radial bone fracture to be assumed. And the plate is restricting the thumb joint to be flexible. Of course, physiotherapy will be advised to achieve the maximum outcome of the thumb joint, because of mobility to its close to normal physiological movements can lead to muscle cramps.

Usually this doesn't happen but if any kind of changes in blood is found than it will be directed accordingly towards the treatment part. Talking about your asthma, you should be serious about this one thing. Because people with asthma in later stages of their life have many difficulties in breathing through the nose and they do more gasping of air through the mouth. I will recommend you to buy one pulse oximeter which will help you analyze the SpO2 levels. Usually the normal range is in between 94-99. Also buy one respirometer - digital or spirometer to see the FEV1 readings. Most people with asthma have difficulties with doing forced expiration. In my clinical practice even at the age of 70+ responds well to individual designed pulmonary rehabilitation. In a recent case which I have seen is 75 years male with SpO2 levels around 70 and asthmatic. With the designed pulmonary rehabilitation plan of using the oxygen saturation machine and physical therapy for especially focused respiratory muscles has made avoiding the asthmatic attacks which are so bad that the person literally feels out of breath.

This is one of the most common problems people face when they have flat feet. Using orthotics is only when there is walking. When a person is trying for sport the orthotics need to be avoided as it will apply high pressure over the joints of the lower limbs. The pain must have caused due to changing in the biomechanical forces in the joints due to this.

I have read it and understand your concerns.Answer: There are different types of treatment options available for a trigger finger. As you know that in this condition a sheath around a tendon gets inflamed and constricted which then doesn’t allow the free sliding/movement of the tendon and at times gets stuck.     The conservative or noninvasive approach includes;      1. Pain killers such Ibuprofen etc.      2. Rest to the affected hand, avoid repetitive movements.     3. Use of a splint for maybe 6 weeks      4. PhysiotherapyIf the above treatment/s do not help, then your doctor may decide to give a steroid injection into the affected tendon area. Most patients get relief after the injection. Even if the injection doesn’t help then the last option is surgery where the constricting sheath around the tendon is released. Before surgery, your doctor may attempt to release it by using a needle.   It’s important to keep your blood sugar levels in the normal range to avoid complications associated with diabetes.

For at least three to four weeks, avoid activities that require repetitive gripping, repeated grasping or the prolonged use of vibrating hand-held machinery.2.Ice or heat. Some people experience improvement by icing the palm several times a day. Others see more benefit with warm-water soaks, particularly first thing in the morning.3.A splint. Your doctor may have you wear a splint at night to keep the affected finger in an extended position for up to six weeks. The splint helps rest the tendon. Splinting also helps prevent you from curling your fingers into a fist while sleeping, which can make it painful to move your fingers in the morning.4.Stretching exercises. Your doctor may also suggest gentle exercises to help maintain mobility in your finger.5.nsaids like naprosyn and ibuprofen helpful. If your symptoms are severe or if conservative treatments haven't helped, you can go for1.Steroid injection. An injection of a steroid medication near or into the tendon sheath may reduce inflammation and allow the tendon to glide freely again. 2.Percutaneous release.3.Surgery.

MS has different symptoms and lot or their difficulties even for a physician to come to a conclusion that it is MS. We definitely don't want anyone to be diagnosed as MS. The difficulty of walking is due to other factors and we need to assess the cervical as well as the lumbar spine for the same. there is a possibility of weakness in muscles due to other factors.

It is not a conditional that people who undergo meniscus or any other ligament surgery of knee lands up in the OA knee. I have seen cases with Meniscus or ACL surgeries and all are doing perfectly well. None of them are having any signs of ageing. I made a continuous follow-up for the last 12 years and none have issues. the only thing they ask is - long to do exercise? well I only advice them to keep doing as much as they can. N no signs of any pains in the knee or any adjacent joints. Coming back to your case. The pain in the knee is due to the lack of strength in the muscles of the knee. Which needs an definite attention. I would advice you to start taking sessions under a competitive physiotherapist so that the required strength is achieved. Also, I will recommend you to do reverse walking to strengthen the quadriceps and lift the leg up in the lying position for strengthening the gluteus muscle. Rest you can try out with pilates, balance board training and resistance band training. I am sure you can do well and may not need TKR. As you must have heard that most sports person gets ligament injuries. how many of then have undergone knee replacement. I think the ratio is too low because they take the best training so I do provide my clients the best service so future complications don't arise.

Symptoms include: severe weakness, spasticity, rolling, hyperreflex, etc","Doctor":"Hello, As mentioned you been facing issues with weakness and spasticity of the ankle I think it's not the case you mentioned in the history. Clonus - it's a higher motor function controlling and just by the ligament of the ankle this can not happen. Spasticity - this is also a higher motor function controlling and not the ligament connection. Hyper reflex - I think you meant by this is that the plantar reflex is having hyper tone. So this is also the Higher motor function and nothing to do with the ligament. Did you mention about scans in history? Were you talking about the MRI? Have you taken the MRI of ankle or the brain? If of brain than what did it reveal in the higher centres of brain? and if ankle than what did it reveal about the internal structures of the ankle? you even mentioned about the test? what tests have been done? blood? urine? I don't think surgery of ligament makes any sense over here with respect to the symptoms you mentioned. The symptoms you mentioned are of higher motor functions in the higher centres of the brain.

If you have taken a scan of the neck than it will spread some light over the complaints you are providing. Why don't you meet up a neurologist for these symptoms for a physical examination? I would have recommended the orthopedist for this but since you said there is slight pain behind the eye I thought better to meet the neurologist. You should now differentiate that there is a pain in the neck or there is a headache? If you can differentiate this we can guide you better. Let's assume you have neck pain - in this case, we can suspect some injury to the cervical spine which needs an MRI to be performed. Post which the treatment will be planned accordingly in a combination of medicine and physical therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What is his job profile? is he having job-related to more usage of wrist and finger? If the RA factor has turned negative in the reports that it is a big relief that one of the differential diagnosis has turned out negative. What is my provisional impression to the history is there can be two possible factors which need a thorough examination. One either this could be a repetitive stress injury or two it could be nerve entrapment. But as I said this is just my provisional impression and without having a thorough examination of the job profile and more details about the history I cannot conclude it which can make you panic. What I would suggest it please check this two things online or consult a doctor and see if either of one fits into the category if not then we have to re-examine the history and restart the process of diagnosis. On time being with related to treatment part, I would say try dipping hand in hot water and do wrist and finger movements.

Trying out wearing a knee brace in the night before sleeping should help avoid any unwanted pressure on the internal structures of the knee.

Is it require a complete bed rest for months.","Doctor":"Hello, Is it a disc prolapse or is it the procedure done over your friend. Because PIVD is a procedure done over the cervical spine where there is fusion done to avoid having compression of the spinal nerves passing through that region. Once the pressure is released the symptoms reduce or either subside completely. Post which some simple physical therapy session for strengthening the weaker group of muscles will be advised. Avoiding chiropractors will be of utmost importance as it may lead to damage to the procedure done already in a similar region. In the initial stages, there needs a bed rest so that the body's physiological mechanism allows the healing to take place without leading to any other symptoms. In bed, simple ankle toe movements and knee flexion-extension can be performed without having any additional pressure on the cervical spine. Hope I have answered your query.

What is happening/what is the problem other than over working the muscles? Can I do anything to help stop or ease it other than resting hands?","Doctor":"Hello, What I understand with the symptoms is they are neuropathic in nature. Here are the two possibilities which I feel on a provisional basis. One it could be carpal tunnel syndrome or it could be nerve entrapment anywhere in its course. Having checked by an orthopedist should provide some insights to the history in a more precise manner as it needs a physical examination. Since human hand has 3 different nerve supplying the hand muscles for different functions we need to assess that first. Also, the nerve has the role of motor and sensory functions. out of which the numbness tingling pain is one the function under a sensory system of the nerve. Any disturbances to the nerve may alter the functions and aggravate the symptoms. For now, I would say start basic static neck exercises which you can find online and also dipping the hand in hot water up to the mid-forearm so the wrist is completely inside the water and perform wrist flexion and extension. Why this two exercise is because if the nerve is getting trapped in the neck region the neck exercises should help release the pressure and why hot water is to reduce the tightness over the flexor retinaculum so the nerve trapping can get released.

Also, what is your age? are you on any High blood pressure medication? are you diabetic? if the above one doesn't fit your category than this should be just having weakness of the body and nothing else.

Now the shin of the leg doesn't contain more muscle in the bulky form like the thighs. but its more of the thinner muscles and consists more of the fascia. The fascia must have got inflamed and had a direct impact. It will be nice if you get an X-ray done. since if any hairline fracture stays it will heal slowly.

Also, vitamin D deficiency is off late too common in many age groups having lack of exposure to sunlight.

Initial stages the pain will be there if there is no ligament or bony injury. You need to wait and see for 2-3 days if pain is subsiding. If pain subsides you need not to worry as it won't be a major issue.

Pain killers are for symptomatic relief. Usually pain killers are administered in night so person gets good sleep. Usually people take it the other way. Consume the pain killers and continue to use the limb. This act by the people leads to increase in the symptoms and injury to the soft tissue never heals and increase more. The first foremost thing to do is, when consumed pain killers please do not use the limb and allow it to rest overnight. Next thing is you haven't mentioned if you have undergone any physiotherapy.

This is actually normal in most cases having ankle injury due to sports. If there is a pain, then using an ankle brace along with hot water fermentation should help reduce one.

This is one of the common which most females face. As there is always a need of being hygienic before any sexual activity. Usually people are conscious about being hygienic but sometimes it doesn't happen and leads to UTI. The burning sensation is due to UTI. Also, there will be a weakness of the Pelvic floor muscles. Which is also common in most females. One needs to do simple exercise to the Pelvic floor muscles. There are a bunch of pelvic floor exercises which you can try out. But the most important ones will be the Kegels exercise. It's mainly used for urinary incontinence but it also has other benefits like strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. You mentioned about the blood test? But did you try to get the urinary test done once. As sometimes it gives more inputs. I wish you good luck for becoming mother soon.

Im thinking it might be from lifting weights especially weighted dips. I am a bit of a worrier so im thinking this is the worst and i have an HIV infection. Would love to know what you think?","Doctor":"Hi, Since you have other medical complications you need to take a guidance from your physician if you can really do strenous exercise like weight lifting. This kind of weight lifting exercises aren't advised to people without having any medical clearance. I feel you have sprained the Acromioclavicular ligament and that might be cause for the pain. For time being try to avoid lifting weights and focus more on breathing exercises along with hot water fermentation at the pain site. You should do well in 5-6 days. Also, will request you to consider your primary physicians advice before doing any heavy exercises. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I would advice you to be conscious first with the ankle. Because ankle bears the whole body weight and this leads the joint to undergo maximum amount of stress and load. First thing I will advice you to start exercising for the core. post which focus on the hip and knee region. Later look for calf / leg region. All this exercises will be induced in the lying posture so no stress is applied to the ankle. Which will help joint saved from stress and strain. Next once you are assessed by a physical therapist or orthopedist than you can switch to balance board training. This balance board training is of good outcome to most ankle injury cases. As the exercises will focus more on joint proprioception and also to correct the muscle imbalance. Once you start the exercises on balance board you will initially find difficult but as practice keeps moving you will find lot of relief from the stress applied over the ankle joint. You will even have good changes in your plantaris muscle. Rest assured. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Are you diabetic or do you have any high blood pressure? any chest infection etc? To come into a history conclusion I feel one should be able to differentiate between edema and wasting of muscles. As the upper limb is not moving much there might be wasting of muscles. Also, swelling can be caused due to poor venous return and using a stocking for it should be of choice initially and some simple exercise for upper limb should avoid swelling to persist longer. Also, will recommend you get it checked by a physician as edema in upper limb over the left side mostly which isn't mentioned in the history needs to taken with attention without wasting time as heart may get involved.

Regards Judy","Doctor":"Hello, As what I understand by history is that your husband is having a cardiac issue and low platelet count. So let's take this first. Unless and until the cardiac fitness certificate is obtained by the cardiologist no surgery can be performed. Next, we need to keep a gap between the stent surgery and orthopedic procedure. Platelet has a role in stopping the blood overflow. Less number of platelet in the blood can lead to massive danger to the patient by losing more blood and no healing. The situation can be dangerous so no surgeon would operate until the platelet is in normal values. Now doing operation late is not an issue if it's just a fixation.

Did the MRI reveal anything nerve entrapment in the cervical region? Or you took an MRI of shoulder? Well we need to know this because arthritis can be diagnosed in shoulder but not in the cervical spine usually. Also, may be you have undergone some physical therapy like - TENS therapy and ultrasound therapy? is that so? did it help in you in anyway like 20-30%? What where the application location? the shoulder, arm, or cervical region? Lot of things you missed to mention in the history but that is okay.

Its been 2 weeks and although bruise is almost gone the areas that were hurt the most still feel hard, very sore even to the touch. Also it still swells and are gets hot and like itchy.

Healing will take little time based on the skin and varies from individual to individual. Now since it is getting swollen, hot and itchy I feel there is no proper venous return. You need to keep the limb elevated over a pillow and do some slow ankle toe movement which can help improve the venous return. Swelling is lack of venous return. Hot is because of acidic fluid inside which is mostly the metabolic waste. and itchy is because of dry skin. Hope you have understood why these symptoms are arising. Hope I have answered your query.

An MRI report can suggest many things but the actual decision depends upon the physical examination what is done in clinical basis.

What is your current knee ROM, example Knee bending? is it above 120° pain free? or 90-100° with pain? If your range of knee is painful then with the current MRI suggests of knee replacement.

Why don't you opt for some simple breathing exercises and gentle massage over the area. As you didn't mention about under which rib it is practically difficult to answer it. But then if it is the rib cage then you can take an x-ray to figure out the status of the ribs positioning and also the lungs tissue. If it is below the rib cage that is below the diaphragm level than you should definitely opt for Ultrasound scanning of the abdomen.

I cannot walk on that foot, though I do not see any bruising or major swelling. It is exceedingly painful and hard to bend on either side. It is especially painful on the left side of my foot. Is my foot broken?","Doctor":"Hello, As mentioned that in anger you have hit are your foot to the hard object, you forgot to mention which foot actually it is; the right or the left? As you mentioned on the left side of the foot it still makes unclear that which left the side of which foot right or the left? But to make it simple if you are getting pain at the ankle level then there will be a ligament sprain. Which will heal in 2-3 weeks of time provided you use a foot brace which is something like a hard socks. In case if the pain is in the phalanges then also you need to take the brace as with just hitting the foot on the hard object we never develop a fracture. As the intensity of the hit from outside is actually far less because we control the movements. In case if it was a non controlled movement than we could have expected a fracture. Use hot water fermentation and use the foot brace for 2-3 weeks. Later slowly follow ankle toe moments and try walking on the toes - forward and backwards. You should perform well. On a safety note, I would advise you to take up a quick x-ray to make sure you haven't made any big injury. In case you have any other questions please feel free to contact me.

What do you think it could be?","Doctor":"Hello, As you mentioned the indentation over the high region, is it on the anterior aspect of the posterior aspect. If it is on the anterior aspect, I mean over the waist bone front side then it may or may not be an iguinal hernial. We can rule this out by doing an ultrasound scan over the area and find out. If that indentation is troubling and giving pain while walking then it may need surgical removal. In case the indentation you mentioned is on the posterior aspect, I mean over the back side then it should be get examined first by a general physician that it is any lump or some notch.

He has complained about pain in his left arm and shoulder which seems to be getting worse. He is only able to lift his arm chest high without pain. The pain wakes him up at night. His cardiologist says it s most likely nerve damage from the way they positioned him during the long surgery or a pinched nerve.He never went to any physical rehab after surgery, they kept telling him he wasn t ready yet but then we moved from NY to Texas and the new cardiologist made it sound that after 6 mnths it wouldn t help him anyway. Should he see a neurologist for this ? Thank you for your reply. Joyce Fagan","Doctor":"Hello, My opinion is It's better late than never. Let's come to the discussion where we can find some possible solution for the patient. It is true that after any cardiac surgery one needs to undergo a proper cardiac rehabilitation program under an expert physiotherapist. Now, you are saying that the patient has Complaints in his left arm and is not able to lift the arm. Please make it assure that the cardiac routine diagnostic procedures are done before we come to a neurological point of view. Is the pain he felt is due to cardiac of not that is the first thing we have to keep in mind. If there is no cardiac issue and is ruled out that one needs to not worry and we can jump over the surgery part. Now, let us make it clear, that due to bypass surgery there will be shortening of the pectoral muscles and it needs a good stretching so the shoulder stays in a normal position wherein the biomechanics of the shoulder do not get disturbed and the functionality of the shoulder remains intact. Coming to the neurological point of view, I don't think he will have any nerve compression. Because if it is nerve compression then the symptoms will be like tingling, burning, numbness etc. Now, let's assume that he doesn't have any cardiac or neurological issue then it is straight the job of the physiotherapist to help him out. Undergoing a proper rehabilitation program should definitely help him lift his arm up. Also a good strength in the muscles of the arm is needed to acquire the optimum functional ability. Also breathing exercises should be made a part of the overall exercise program as it has got to do a lot with the overall well being of the patient. Please take the call based on the guidelines. First the heart needs to be assessed. then the surgical part if any muscle is shortened and leading to change in the posture which is changing the biomechanics of the joint. And lastly, the neurological point of view if we rule out step by step all things then definitely we can come to a proper diagnosis and help the patient to have a good lifestyle change.

First, you have to differentiate that is it a shock kind pain or tingling pain. Based on that we can come to some provisional diagnosis. If there is compression of the nerve beneath the flexor retinaculum at the wrist level then you may face one. the second is if the nerve is getting compressed in the elbow region due to muscle weakness or the third one is the nerve entrapment in the spinal column. We need to definitely assess this as this doesn't sound of the higher motor function issue at all. but a peripheral issue. Until we come to a conclusion giving you a diagnosis will be just like making you panic for no reason.

Also get a CT for abdomen.If it is simply pancreatitis, you can be cured by managing conservatively and with the help of anitbiotics.

Because angioedema is itself a different condition. You need to provide some more details like, what is his physical condition, did he ever had any kind of a pain in the chest, did he injured the limbs etc? As the doctor diagnosed with angioedema than has he checked the heart and the circulation of it? I think your son might need to get a thorough checkup of the cardio and also need to check for the other things like the rheumatic factor. But from history, both these conditions sound negative. You meet up a good physician and get the blood routine done along with the checkup of the heart to check the cardiac output. Along with this a rheumatic factor too can be checked in the blood routine. Until we have a diagnosis we cannot just say it's angioedema or RA. So time being I feel the treatment he is undergoing is just symptomatic and not specific. Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.

I will advice you first take rest. Because most time people will use ice to reduce swelling and ice is also acting in reducing pain by which most people feels that the injury is healed and they take up the call for movement. I feel you need to first immobilize the part involved in the injury. Dip feet in hot water and then elevate it using the pillow while lying down. After 3 days you can see if the pain and swelling is persisting, if so than an x-ray will be of good choice to rule out any fracture. If the fracture is not present then only it will be a muscular injury which will take about a week or so to heal.

Once I realized I d lost my footing, I twisted my body to keep her on the up side and I must have landed flat on my left side. I got up quickly and though the baby let out a little cry, it was from the shock of the fall and she seems to be fine. I m so thankful. Fairly quickly, my right waist band area, where I was cradling her, began to hurt. We sat in the rocker and rocked a little and the baby is fine. My right side started hurting and my daughter arrived home from work within 10 minutes or so. I left quickly and went to my chiropractors office. Once I waked to the car, I could feel something sharp on my right side hurting me. I can press on it and it s not the spine, but more soft tissue between my pelvis and my rib cage. The chiropractor massaged and adjusted me slightly then added ice and stems unit. He thought I may have bruised an area between the ribs as he says that is very painful. I was no better and when I got home, I could barely walk. Raising my left leg or using my right arm hurt the worst, so I scuffed along groaning in pain. It s definitely one spot along the waistband, but internally and not the skin or a bruised area. It s part of my core because when I lift my left leg, it hurt it or when I push with my right arm, it hurts it. Luckily, I just had surgery three weeks ago and had many hydrocodone left, so I took one and some ibuprofen and sat in my laz-y-boy for awhile and then went to bed. I slept well and when I woke up, was much better though I can tell the danger zone is still there. The pain last night was very sharp and definitely worsened by some movements. The pain today is better but I m just resting and taking it very easy. I would go to the ER, but we had 6 of snow, and there s no way I can shovel show. I ve asked my neighbor for help and he has a few houses ahead of me. I will just wait it out. Too bad... the satellite is covered in snow too and I can t get out there to brush it off. lol","Doctor":"Hello, As you had a fall, what I understand with the history is that there will be direct impact over the muscle which would have got swollen in the fiber region of the muscular system. Also during cold seasons, there is changes to have that area getting feeling some kind of knot at the pain region. I feel this should be just a muscle and bony hurt which will become better in 3-4 days or max by a week. You need to take a hot water fermentation and also do much rest.

First foremost you need to have a help from a talented physiotherapist who can make the other foot stronger and even work on the injured foot.

After about 2-3 weeks of rest and icing my right ankle, it felt pretty good. Good enough to start jogging again. I could walk and jog with no pain. On the forth week I tried to get back into soccer. Before the game I laced up my shoes and ankle brace then stood straight up to go for a jog. Immediately when I stood up I noticed a sharp ripping pain, across the bottom of my shin maybe near the top of the extensor tendons (if that s the right name for it, the tendon attached to the tibia), moving from the outside to the inside of my foot. I tried loosening the ankle brace but still the ripping pain continued when I stood up. I completely loosened the ankle brace and the ripping pain left and I could jog again. I decided not to play and started to examine the pain. The ripping pain only occurs when I over-extend my right leg or when I am standing/extending my leg and touch/grab my lower shin/upper ankle area. I had an X-Ray done on my lower leg/ankle but I haven t heard back from the doctor so I figured there wasn t any issues with my bones or ligaments. That leads me to believe it is a partial tear(s) in the muscle or tendon. Could you please give me a general idea if I need to have it surgically repaired or will I be able to continue resting and wait it out and eventually it will heal properly all on its own? Thanks Adam Cyr","Doctor":"Hello, What I understand from the history is there is a probable ligament Injury and to rule out this we need to do some special clinical test and maybe an MRI to understand the extent of the ligament injury around the ankle which is very common. Now x-rays are something which cannot reveal anything about the ligaments or muscles but only the bones. For soft tissues, we need to depend upon the CT or MRI scan. If this is the ligament injury then post knowing the extent of the ligament injury we have to decide either surgery is needed or not. In most cases no surgery is advised. With proper physical therapy and sports retraining of the ankle the player can go back to the game. This method takes some time but definitely provide excellent results. Being a Sports therapy specialist I have seen cases and they have recovered much better and still, in sports, they are now. Now you mentioned about using a brace and trying to wear sports shoes and pain started this is common as the muscle will be restricted that will the major cause of the pain. Coming to muscles of the foot, we need to understand that muscles undergo physiological and mechanical changes due to injury to a ligament.  Some are stronger and some are weaker. We need to figure out the weaker ones and find out the exercises which suit well for the entire group of muscles to equally function for stabilizing the ankle joint while in sports.

Now to stretch a little more, as your father will be ageing by now, his cardiac condition might have become weak and this swelling is a cause of loss of venous return, which is common in most paraplegic cases.

If you get tingling sensation in the first fingers that is the thumb, the index finger and the middle finger half than it will be related to a cervical disc nerve entrapment. In case if it is related to the last two fingers like the ring and little finger it could be ulnar  neuritis.

They told me I bruised it and nothing was broke but it s still hurting and I can t stretch my leg out all the way. Also it s making a popping and cracking sound almost everytime I walk or bend my leg. Could there be something torn?","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for using “Ask a doctor” to post your health query.I read carefully your question and I understand your concern.A fracture would make almost impossible to walk or bare weight on the leg. So if the doctors told you that there is no fracture, then most probably it is not the case.Knee injuries need more then 2 weeks to get well. You may have blood or fluids inside the knee cap so that is why you cannot bend it, and the cracking that you hear.To tell for sure if something is torn, would be if you do an MRI, which will indicate very specifically what is happening in your knee. But I would say give it some more time to heal, follow the doctors advice, do not overuse it so will allow it to heal. If not better in 4-6 weeks, or if you feel any instability, then consider seeing the doctor again so they can recommend the MRI or do another physical exam of the knee.

Paining is happening at a particular point and it happens only when I presses that particular point. I did not have any accident or any other thing. I play badminton daily. Is it some type of fracture or something else?","Doctor":"Hello, Pain in your right wrist is more likely related to playing badminton (if you play with your right hand). A lot of exertion is on the wrist joint and sometimes, it goes unnoticed, but the pain starts later. Most probably you got it due to injury to some internal structure of the wrist, like ligament / muscle / bone and that is leading to pain. Whenever a patient comes to me with similar complains and history, I suggest him to take Ibuprofen for pain relief and some ointment or spray for local application to get relief from pain. I advice the patient to take rest ( do not play any sports) for a week or two which will help in quick recovery. If it helps to recover in a week then there is no need to go for any imaging tests. If the pain persists for weeks then it is best to see a doctor and get an X-ray of the wrist joint done. After that follow the doctor’s advice for further management. Hope this helps.

The pain has been apparent for about 2 weeks. It does not hurt if I make a fist and bend it forward (toward the forearm). I play alot of guitar and the pain is very apparent when making barre chords-which puts my wrist in the same position as bending forward with my hand outstretched. Also there is sometimes a very minimal click or pop (no sound really, just a feeling) when bending. So the pain is on top primarily, but I did do some weight lifting last two weeks ago and it move the pain to the entire wrist top and bottom to where I could not move it much. After icing and limited motion, the pain subsided, but has returned to what I described above. I am thinking it could be tendonitis, because the pain is on top. Any ideas? How should I go about treating it? I am hoping to get back to playing guitar soon. Thank you for your help. Matt","Doctor":"Hello, It could be a carpel tunnel syndrome.

They commented that her muscle enzymes were very elevated and increasing. She had a transforminal epidural which relieved all of her pain and she went into a rehabilitation facility to try to regain her strength and to start walking again with a walker. In the rehab center I asked them to quit giving her pain medicine as she no longer it and was acting loopy. A wk after the epidural she started getting nauseated and was for 4 days. They put her in the hospital as they said her sodium levels were low. As soon as she went on the IV she stopped being nauseated. They said she did have a UTI which they had also treated her for on her prior hospital stay. Once they took her off the IV and were ready to discharge her, she started with the nausea again. I disagreed with discharging her so they said they would have a gastrointeroligist see her. He ordered an endoscopy and they said they didn t see anything major but she did have a.fungus in her esophogasand thrush on her tongue. They said they could not do any biopsies because she was on placix which she has been for 3 years since she had a stent put in, I have asked them to take her off it but have been unsuccessful thus far. So she has been back in the rehab and again has been nauseated for the last 2 days. The nausea usually starts in the afternoon. She has no appetite and is fearful of eating or drinking due to the nausea. She has always been very sharp mentally and lived on her own and showered by herself each day however over the last few years her walking has gotten worse and she used a walker and gave up driving. She has lost a lot of weight and is looking very frail ( losing 15-20 lbs.). I know something is not right and they are just giving her suppositories for nausea. I feel she is quickly failing in front of my eyes but can t get any answers. One thing I failed to mention is that in the rehab center they said her potassium was too high then they put her on a low potassium diet for that. Not that she is eating enough to matter. One sat thing ...she was taking simvisitation over the last 3 yrs and before that Lipitor. They stopped the simvisitation just before all of this started due to the severe leg and hip pain just before all of this started mid August. Any suggestions where we start.?
