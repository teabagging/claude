What is the smallest number of intermediate divisions that need to be made on the ruler so that segments of length 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, ..., 10 cm can be laid off, applying the ruler in each case only once.","solution":"Answer: 4Solution: First, let's prove that three divisions are not enough. There are a total of 10 segments with endpoints at five points. Therefore, if three divisions are made, each length from 1 to 10 should be obtained exactly once. If any division is made at a non-integer distance from the left end, there will be segments of non-integer length, meaning not all lengths from 1 to 10 can be obtained. Therefore, for each division, only nine options are possible. Thus, a segment of length 9 can only be obtained in one way: by making a division at a distance of 1 from one of the ends of the ruler. Without loss of generality, we can assume that this division is made at a distance of 1 from the left end, and denote this division as T. How can a segment of length 8 be obtained? Again, consider the fact that segments of non-integer length should not be formed. This means that a segment of length 8 can be obtained either by making a division at a distance of 2 from one of the ends, or from two divisions, each made at a distance of 1 from the left and right ends of the ruler. The second case is impossible, as it results in two identical segments (length 1). If the division is made at a distance of 2 from the left end, two segments of length 1 are again formed. Therefore, the only option left is to make the division at a distance of 2 from the right end. Denote this division as S. A segment of length 3 cannot be obtained using the ends of the ruler: it results in extra segments of length 1 or 2. Therefore, the third point N is such that either NT=3 or NS=4 (in each case, uniqueness follows from the fact that N lies on the ruler). Denote the left end of the ruler as A, and the right end as B. If NT=3, then AN=NS=4, leading to a contradiction. If SN=3, then AN=NB=5, again contradicting the fact that all segment lengths are different. Thus, we have proven that three divisions are not enough to complete the task.Four points are sufficient, as they can be arranged as follows: AC=1, AD=4, AE=5, AF=8, where A is the left end of the segment.Criteria:Only the answer without construction --- 0 points.Proving that all segments from 1 to 10 must be obtained exactly once --- 2 points.Proving that three points are not enough --- 6 points.Proving that four points are sufficient --- 1 point."},{"problem":"The domain of the function f(x) = log_{2}(x^{2} + 2x - 3) is ( )A: [-3, 1]B: (-3, 1)C: (-infty, -3] cup [1, +infty)D: (-infty, -3) cup (1, +infty)","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the properties of logarithmic functions and the domain of functions.

Thus, a=c+20, b=c+10. But c, c+10, c+20 give different remainders when divided by 3.Therefore, the only case that fits is (23,13,3).Case 2. Suppose a-b-8 is odd. Then a and b have different parities. Since a>b, then b=2. But b>c-8. Therefore, this case is impossible.Case 3. Suppose b-c-8 is odd. From similar reasoning, we get c=2. From the previous case, we know that a-b-8 can only be even, so a-b-8=2. Therefore, a=b+10. Thus, we have proven that the numbers b+10, b, b-10 are prime.

In triangle ABK, angles A and K are both 60^{circ}, so it is equilateral and thus AK = BK = c. Now, from the similarity of triangles BA_1K and AA_1C, we get frac{c - AA_1}{AA_1} = frac{c}{b}, from which it follows that AA_1 = frac{bc}{b+c}.Since the bisector of an internal angle of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides, we have frac{BA_1}{a - BA_1} = frac{c}{b}, from which BA_1 = frac{ac}{b+c}. Therefore, AA_1 : BA_1 = b : a. The base C_1 of the bisector CC_1 divides side BA in the same ratio. Hence, A_1C_1 is the bisector of angle A_1 in triangle BA_1A.

We need to determine the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{frac{p-1}{2}} left{ frac{k^2}{p} right} ), where ( {x} = x - lfloor x rfloor ) denotes the fractional part of ( x ).2. Lemma: If ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ), then for each ( 1 le n le frac{p-1}{2} ), there exists exactly one ( 1 le m le frac{p-1}{2} ) such that ( n^2 + m^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} ).   Proof of Lemma:   - Since ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ), (-1) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ). This means there exist integers ( a ) and (-a) such that ( a^2 equiv (-a)^2 equiv -1 pmod{p} ).   - Given ( m^2 + n^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} ), we can rewrite this as:     [     m^2 + n^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} implies m^2 equiv -n^2 pmod{p}     ]   - Dividing both sides by ( m^2 ) (since ( m neq 0 )):     [     1 + left( frac{n}{m} right)^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} implies left( frac{n}{m} right)^2 equiv -1 pmod{p}     ]   - This implies ( frac{n}{m} equiv a pmod{p} ) or ( frac{n}{m} equiv -a pmod{p} ), leading to:     [     n equiv am pmod{p} quad text{or} quad n equiv -am pmod{p}     ]   - Since ( 1 le n, m le frac{p-1}{2} ), exactly one of ( am ) or ( -am ) lies in the range ( 1 le n le frac{p-1}{2} ).3. Sum of Fractional Parts:   - If ( m^2 + n^2 = kp ) for some integer ( k ), then:     [     frac{m^2}{p} + frac{n^2}{p} = k     ]   - The sum of the fractional parts is:     [     left{ frac{m^2}{p} right} + left{ frac{n^2}{p} right} = 1     ]     because ( frac{m^2}{p} ) and ( frac{n^2}{p} ) are not integers, and their sum is an integer ( k ).4. Pairing and Summing:   - We have ( frac{p-1}{2} ) terms in the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{frac{p-1}{2}} left{ frac{k^2}{p} right} ).   - By pairing each ( left{ frac{m^2}{p} right} ) with ( left{ frac{n^2}{p} right} ) such that ( m^2 + n^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} ), we get ( frac{p-1}{4} ) pairs, each summing to 1.5.

Simplifying the Problem:   To simplify, assume ( a_1 = 0 ) (since decreasing all ( a_i ) by a constant amount decreases each fraction in the sum). Let ( a_1 ) be the smallest among ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2019} ).4. Defining Function ( f(i) ):   For ( i neq 1 ), define ( f(i) ) as the index among ( i+1 ) and ( i+2 ) for which ( a_{f(i)} ) is larger. Since ( a_i ) are distinct, ( f(i) ) is well-defined.5. Analyzing the Sequence:   Consider the sequence ( 2, f(2), f(f(2)), ldots ). Note that ( f(i) - i ) is either 1 or 2 for all ( i ). This implies that the sequence must eventually reach 2018 or 2019.6. Periodicity and Summation:   Since ( f(2019) = 2 ) and ( f(2018) = 2019 ), the sequence is periodic. The period ( p ) must be at least 1010 because the sequence increases by at most 2 each time and must cover a total of 2019 steps.7. Key Observation:   For all ( i ), we have:   [   frac{a_i}{|a_{i+1} - a_{i+2}|} geq frac{a_i}{a_{f(i)}}   ]   Summing this for ( i = 2, f(2), f(f(2)), ldots, f^{(p-1)}(2) ), we get:   [   sum_{i=1}^{2019} frac{a_i}{|a_{i+1} - a_{i+2}|} geq sum_{i=0}^{p-1} frac{a_{f^{(i)}(2)}}{a_{f^{(i+1)}(2)}} geq p   ]   The last inequality follows from the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality.8. Conclusion:   Since ( p geq 1010 ), the sum in question is at least 1010.

(2) If the first term of the sequence {a_n} is a_1 = 1, and it satisfies Delta^2 a_n - Delta a_{n+1} + a_n = -2^n (n in mathbb{N}), find the general term formula of the sequence {a_n}.  (3) (Theory) For the sequence {a_n} in (2), does there exist an arithmetic sequence {b_n} such that b_1 C_n^1 + b_2 C_n^2 + ldots + b_n C_n^n = a_n holds for all natural n in mathbb{N}?

Delta^2 a_n = 2(n+1) + 2 - (2n + 2) = 2,  ∴ {Delta^2 a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term of 2 and a common difference of 0;  It is also a geometric sequence with the first term of 2 and a common ratio of 1.  (2) Since Delta^2 a_n - Delta a_{n+1} + a_n = -2^n, i.e., Delta a_{n+1} - Delta a_n - Delta a_{n+1} + a_n = -2^n,  i.e., Delta a_n - a_n = 2^n, ∴ a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 2^n, Since a_1 = 1,  ∴ a_2 = 4 = 2 times 2^1, a_3 = 12 = 3 times 2^2, a_4 = 32 = 4 times 2^3, conjecture: a_n = n cdot 2^{n-1},  Proof: i) When n=1, a_1 = 1 = 1 times 2; ii) Assume when n=k, a_k = k cdot 2^{k-1};  When n=k+1, a_{k+1} = 2a_k + 2^k = k cdot 2^k + 2^k = (k+1) cdot 2^{(k+1)-1}, the conclusion also holds,  ∴ By i) and ii), we know a_n = n cdot 2^{n-1}.

Hence we get p=4 and the focus of the parabola is at (0,p)=(0,4). Since p=4, the directrix of the parabola is the line y=-p=y-4.Because the line y=2 intersects the parabola x^2=8y, we can substitute y=2 into the parabola's equation to find the points of intersection:x^2 = 8(2) x^2 = 16 x = pm 4So, the two intersection points are at (4,2) and (-4,2). To find the equation of the circle, we need the center and the radius. Since the circle goes through (4,2) and (-4,2) and is tangent to the directrix y=-4, the circle's center has the same y-coordinate as the points of intersection, which is y=2. The center is also equidistant from these points and lies on the y-axis (due to symmetry about the y-axis), hence the center is at (0,2).The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to either point of intersection. Since these points are 4 units away in the x-direction, the radius is 4.Thus, the equation of the circle is:(x-0)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 4^2 x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 16So the final answer is boxed{x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 16}."},{"problem":"In an isosceles triangle, the lengths of the two sides are 3 and 6 respectively.

The length of the segment (P_{1} Q) is exactly (tan angle P_{1} O Q = tan frac{pi}{2 n}), so the area of the tangential (2n)-sided polygon is exactly (2 n tan frac{pi}{2 n}), which, according to (4), is exactly (frac{1}{a_{n}}). This implies that the sequence (a_{n}) is monotonically increasing.Katalin Drávucz2. Write (a_{n}) in the following form:begin{aligned}a_{n} & = frac{1}{n} cdot frac{1}{n} sin frac{pi}{n} + frac{1}{n} cdot frac{2}{n} sin frac{2 pi}{n} + frac{1}{n} cdot frac{3}{n} sin frac{3 pi}{n} + ldots + & + frac{1}{n} cdot frac{n-1}{n} sin frac{(n-1) pi}{n} + frac{1}{n} cdot frac{n}{n} sin frac{n pi}{n}end{aligned}(The last term can be freely added to (a_{n}) because its value is 0.) From this form, it is immediately clear that (a_{n}) is an approximate sum of the integral of the function (y = x sin pi x) from 0 to 1, specifically the sum corresponding to the uniform partition (x_{1} = frac{1}{n}, x_{2} = frac{2}{n}, x_{3} = frac{3}{n}, ldots, x_{n-1} = frac{n-1}{n}, x_{n} = frac{n}{n} = 1). Therefore,lim _{a_{n} rightarrow infty} a_{n} = int_{0}^{1} x sin pi x , dx = frac{1}{pi}Gábor Megyesi (Szeged, Ságvári E. Practical Gymnasium, 1st grade)3. Similarly, from (3), it is immediately clear that (2 a_{n}) is the approximate sum of the integral of the function (y = sin pi x) from 0 to 1, corresponding to the same partition. Therefore,lim _{n rightarrow infty} a_{n} = int_{0}^{1} sin pi x , dx = frac{1}{pi}Gábor Hetyei (Pécs, Leövey K. Gymnasium, 3rd grade)4. Let (z) be the complex number (left(cos frac{pi}{n} + i sin frac{pi}{n}right)). Then, on the right-hand side of (3), the terms in the brackets are the imaginary parts of the complex numbers (z, z^{2}, z^{3}, ldots, z^{n-1}). Consequently, (a_{n}) is the (frac{1}{2n})-th part of the imaginary part of the sum (z + z^{2} + z^{3} + ldots + z^{n-1}). Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series and the fact that (z^{n} = -1), it follows that (a_{n}) is the (frac{1}{2n})-th part of the imaginary part of the complex number (frac{1+z}{1-z} = frac{2}{1-z} - 1). It is easy to verify that (frac{2}{1-z} = 1 + i cot frac{pi}{2 n}), from which (4) immediately follows."},{"problem":"5.

Solution: The original expression is transformed into sqrt{(x+3)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}}=|x-y+3|, which is sqrt{(x+3)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}}=sqrt{2} frac{|x-y+3|}{sqrt{2}}. Therefore, the ratio of the distance from the moving point (x, y) to the fixed point (-3,1) to its distance to the line x-y+3=0 is sqrt{2}. Hence, the locus of this moving point is a hyperbola with an eccentricity of sqrt{2}."},{"problem":"Among the following daily life phenomena, the one that belongs to translation is:A: The up and down movement of elevatorsB: Swinging on a swingC: Closing an open textbookD: The swinging of a pendulum","solution":"To analyze each option in terms of whether it represents a translation movement or not, we proceed as follows:- Option A: The up and down movement of elevators. Translation refers to a type of motion where an object moves from one point to another along a straight path, maintaining its orientation. The up and down movement of elevators fits this description perfectly as the elevator moves straight up or down without rotating or swinging. Therefore, this option belongs to translation.- Option B: Swinging on a swing. Swinging involves a to-and-fro motion around a fixed point. This motion is not a straight-line movement and involves changes in direction, which does not fit the definition of translation. Hence, this option does not belong to translation.- Option C: Closing an open textbook. Closing a textbook involves a rotational motion around the spine of the book. This is not a straight-line movement and does not maintain the same orientation throughout the motion, which means it does not qualify as translation.- Option D: The swinging of a pendulum. Similar to swinging on a swing, a pendulum's motion is back and forth around a fixed point, which is not a straight-line path and involves changes in direction. This motion is not considered translation.Given the analysis above, the only phenomenon that belongs to translation is the movement of elevators, making the correct option:boxed{text{A}}"},{"problem":"20.

Since f(x) is an odd function, we know that f(-x) = -f(x). Hence, f(x+2) = f(x-2).

For example, 3 is a stepstool number, as 3 has 2 divisors and 4 has 2 + 1 = 3 divisors. Find the sum of all stepstool numbers less than 300.[i]Proposed by [b]Th3Numb3rThr33[/b][/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find all positive integers ( n ) less than 300 such that ( n ) has one less positive divisor than ( n + 1 ). This means:   [   d(n) = d(n+1) - 1   ]   where ( d(x) ) denotes the number of positive divisors of ( x ).2. Analyzing the Divisors:   For ( d(n) ) to be one less than ( d(n+1) ), either ( n ) or ( n+1 ) must be a perfect square. This is because a perfect square has an odd number of divisors, while a non-perfect square has an even number of divisors.3. Case 1: ( n ) is a perfect square:   Let ( n = k^2 ). Then ( n+1 = k^2 + 1 ).   - ( d(n) = d(k^2) = 3 ) (since ( k^2 ) has an odd number of divisors).   - ( d(n+1) ) must be 4 (since ( d(n+1) = d(n) + 1 )).4. Case 2: ( n+1 ) is a perfect square:   Let ( n+1 = m^2 ). Then ( n = m^2 - 1 ).   - ( d(n+1) = d(m^2) = 3 ) (since ( m^2 ) has an odd number of divisors).   - ( d(n) ) must be 2 (since ( d(n) = d(n+1) - 1 )).5. Finding Stepstool Numbers:   We need to find all ( n ) such that either ( n ) or ( n+1 ) is a perfect square and ( n < 300 ).   - For ( n = k^2 ):     [     k^2 < 300 implies k < sqrt{300} approx 17.32 implies k leq 17     ]     So, ( k ) ranges from 1 to 17.

The corresponding ( n ) values are:     [     1^2 - 1, 2^2 - 1, 3^2 - 1, ldots, 17^2 - 1 = 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48, 63, 80, 99, 120, 143, 168, 195, 224, 255, 288     ]6. Combining and Summing Unique Stepstool Numbers:   Combining the two sets of ( n ) values and removing duplicates, we get:   [   {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 15, 16, 24, 25, 35, 36, 48, 49, 63, 64, 80, 81, 99, 100, 120, 121, 143, 144, 168, 169, 195, 196, 224, 225, 255, 256, 288, 289}   ]   Summing these values:   [   0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 9 + 15 + 16 + 24 + 25 + 35 + 36 + 48 + 49 + 63 + 64 + 80 + 81 + 99 + 100 + 120 + 121 + 143 + 144 + 168 + 169 + 195 + 196 + 224 + 225 + 255 + 256 + 288 + 289 = 687   ]The final answer is (boxed{687})."},{"problem":"On Monday, Mukesh travelled x mathrm{~km} at a constant speed of 90 mathrm{~km} / mathrm{h}.

The negative solution is invalid, so there were 16 people present.Let there be d ladies and h gentlemen present. Then, since each gentleman is to dance with each lady, the system of equations s+h=16 ; quad d cdot h=60 has the solutions h_{1}=10, d_{1}=6 and h_{2}=6, d_{2}=10. Since there are more gentlemen than ladies, there are thus 10 gentlemen and 6 ladies at the party.## Solution by B. Vetters:(Partial solution avoiding the solution method for quadratic equations)The number of people present can also be determined without solving a quadratic equation. The equationz(z-1)=240means that the product of two consecutive integers is 240. Therefore, form all possible products of integers that have the value 240: 2 cdot 120,3 cdot 80,4 cdot 60,5 cdot 48,6 cdot 40 etc., noting that the difference between the values of the two factors always gets closer to zero. Eventually, one arrives at the pair whose difference is 1, namely 15 cdot 16=240.Thus, mathrm{z}=16.Two further considerations can be added to this thought:1. It is not necessary to try all products with the value 240. From the equation, one can see that the value for z can only differ slightly from sqrt{240}. It must therefore be near 15.2. The method can also be applied, somewhat modified, to the second part of the problem. Here,x(16-x)=60 quad text { and } quad x>16-xThe inequality leads to 2 x>16 or x>8. Therefore, the following values are possible for the solution:x=10, quad 16-x=6, quad x=12, quad 16-x=4, quad x=15, quad 16-x=1The right column immediately allows the selection of x=10,16-x=y=6 as the only solution.## Solution by J. Schell:(Auxiliary means: combinatorics): Since everyone is to clink glasses with everyone else, the number of combinations of 2 from the unknown number of people x must be determined.From n elements, k elements can be selected in binom{n}{k} different ways. Therefore,binom{x}{2}=120 quad text { or } quad frac{x(x-1)}{1 cdot 2}=120thus s x^{2}-x=240 From this, x_{1}=+16, x_{2}=-15.The number of people present is 16, as x_{2}=-15 is an invalid negative solution and must be discarded.Now, 60 dance pairs are to be formed. Let there be x gentlemen (and thus 16-x ladies) present, and x>16-x.16 people can be grouped into pairs in binom{16}{2} different ways. However, the number of pairs consisting only of gentlemen and the number of pairs consisting only of ladies must be subtracted from this number. The first is binom{x}{2}, the second binom{16-x}{2}. Therefore,begin{aligned}binom{16}{2}-binom{x}{2}-binom{16-x}{2} & =60 frac{16 cdot 15}{1 cdot 2}-frac{x(x-1)}{1 cdot 2}-frac{(16-x)(15-x)}{1 cdot 2} & =60 x^{2}-16 x+60 & =0end{aligned}The solution to this equation is x_{1}=10, x_{2}=6.

What is the maximal length of a word if we know that any two consecutive letters a,b of the word are different and that the word cannot be reduced to a word of the kind abab with aneq b by removing letters.","solution":"1. Base Case:   For ( n = 2 ), consider the alphabet ({a, b}). The word \\"aba\\" has length 3, and it cannot be reduced to a word of the form (abab) by removing letters. Thus, the maximal length for ( n = 2 ) is ( 2 cdot 2 - 1 = 3 ).2. Induction Hypothesis:   Assume that for an alphabet of ( k ) letters, the maximal length of a word satisfying the given conditions is ( 2k - 1 ).3. Induction Step:   We need to show that for ( n = k + 1 ), the maximal length of a word is ( 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1 ).   - Assume that each letter in the word appears at least 3 times. Then, we can extract a subword using only the first ( n-1 ) letters (i.e., ( k ) letters) that satisfies the condition. This subword would have a length of at least ( 3(k) ), which is greater than ( 2k + 1 ) because ( k > 2 ). This contradicts the induction hypothesis that the maximal length for ( k ) letters is ( 2k - 1 ).   - Therefore, there must be a letter ( a ) that appears at most twice. If we disregard ( a ) from our word, we are left with a word using only ( k ) letters that satisfies the condition. By the induction hypothesis, this word has a length of at most ( 2k - 1 ).   - Adding back the letter ( a ) (which appears at most twice), the total length of the word is at most ( 2k - 1 + 2 = 2k + 1 ).4. Constructive Example:   To show that the length ( 2n - 1 ) is attainable, consider the word ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, a_{n-1}, ldots, a_1 ). This word has length ( 2n - 1 ) and satisfies the condition that no two consecutive letters are the same and it cannot be reduced to a word of the form ( abab ) by removing letters.Conclusion:By induction, we have shown that the maximal length of a word for an alphabet of ( n ) letters, where no two consecutive letters are the same and the word cannot be reduced to a word of the form ( abab ) by removing letters, is ( 2n - 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2n - 1 } )."},{"problem":"If the range of the function f(x) = 2^x is [4, +infty), then the range of the real number x is ______.","solution":"The function f(x) = 2^x is an increasing function within its domain.Thus, we have 2^x geq 4.Taking the logarithm base 2 on both sides, we get x geq log_2{4} = 2.Therefore, the range of the real number x is [2, +infty).So, the answer is boxed{[2, +infty)}.This can be found using the monotonicity of the exponential function.

Therefore, this expression is incorrect because it implies taking the square root of negative numbers directly.② For sqrt{frac{a}{b}}times sqrt{frac{b}{a}}=1, we can simplify this as follows:[sqrt{frac{a}{b}}times sqrt{frac{b}{a}} = sqrt{frac{a}{b} times frac{b}{a}} = sqrt{1} = 1.]This shows that expression ② is correct.③ For sqrt{ab}div sqrt{frac{a}{b}}=-b, we simplify it step by step:[sqrt{ab}div sqrt{frac{a}{b}} = frac{sqrt{ab}}{sqrt{frac{a}{b}}} = frac{sqrt{ab}}{frac{sqrt{ab}}{sqrt{b^2}}} = frac{sqrt{ab}}{frac{sqrt{ab}}{b}} = sqrt{ab} times frac{b}{sqrt{ab}} = b times frac{sqrt{ab}}{sqrt{ab}} = b times 1 = b.]However, since b is negative, and we are looking for a match with the expression given, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the simplification process. The correct process should acknowledge the negative value of b directly from the conditions, and the expression as given in the problem seems to be misinterpreted in the standard solution. The correct interpretation should maintain consistency with the conditions given, and the final expression should reflect the properties of a and b. Thus, the correct interpretation of ③ should consider the negative nature of b and how it affects the division and multiplication with square roots, leading to a conclusion that aligns with the given conditions and expressions.Given the analysis above, the correct choice, based on the corrected interpretation and the given conditions, is B: ②③.

With e=20, this results in l_{1}=32 and l_{2}=24.b) The equation of the ellipse can be written in the following form: x^{2} b^{2}+y^{2} a^{2}=a^{2} b^{2} (4). We replace b^{2} with the relation b^{2}=a^{2}-e^{2} and thus obtainx^{2}left(a^{2}-e^{2}right)+y^{2} a^{2}=a^{2}left(a^{2}-e^{2}right)To determine a, we calculate the coordinates of P_{8} and substitute them, along with e=20, into (4a). By decomposing y_{8}, we divide the triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{8} into two right-angled sub-triangles. Then, according to the Pythagorean theorem, l_{1}^{2}=y_{8}^{2}+left(e+x_{8}right)^{2} (5a) and l_{2}^{2}=y_{8}^{2}+left(e-x_{8}right)^{2} (5b).By subtracting one of these two equations from the other and solving for x^{2}, we get x_{s}=5.6 and thus y_{s}= pm 1.2. Substituting these values into (4a) results in solving the resulting biquadratic equationa 4-800 a^{2}+12544=0 rightarrow a_{1}^{2}=784 ; a_{1}=28 text { and } a_{2}^{2}=16 ; a_{2}=4From b^{2}=a^{2}-e^{2}, it follows further that b_{1}^{2}=384, so b_{1} approx 19.6 and b_{2}^{2}=-384, so b_{2} approx 19.6 i. Clearly, a_{2} and b_{2} are (in the real numbers) unusable, so the equation of the ellipse is384 x^{2}+784 y^{2}=301056 rightarrow frac{x^{2}}{784}+frac{y^{2}}{384}=1Analogously, from the hyperbola equation x^{2} b^{2}-y^{2} a^{2}=a^{2} b^{2} with b^{2}=e^{2}-a^{2}, we obtain the values a_{1}=28, a_{2}= 4 and b_{1} approx 19.6 i, b_{2} approx 19.6. It is evident that in this case, the values a_{1} and b_{1} must be discarded as unusable. The hyperbola equation thus takes the form384 x^{2}-16 y^{2}=6144 rightarrow frac{x^{2}}{16}-frac{y^{2}}{384}=1"},{"problem":"Translate the given mathematical problem from Chinese to English:\\"The gross domestic product (GDP) of our country in 2012 was approximately 7,298,000,000,000, ranking second in the world.

The absolute value of n corresponds to the number of decimal places moved.

Determine the meeting point of Aaron and Michael:   - Aaron starts at Acorn and bicycles east at 17 km/h.   - Michael starts at Midland and bicycles west at 7 km/h.   - The distance between Acorn and Midland is (60 + 60 = 120) km.   - The combined speed of Aaron and Michael is (17 + 7 = 24) km/h.   - The time it takes for them to meet is:     [     frac{120 text{ km}}{24 text{ km/h}} = 5 text{ hours}     ]2.

Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x)=-f(x). Combining these properties, we obtain f(2-x)=-f(-x), which is equivalent to f(2+x)=-f(x). Therefore, for any x, we find that f(4+x)=f(2+(2+x))=-f(2+x)=f(x). Thus, f(x) is a periodic function with period 4.(2) Knowing the expression for f(x) when xin[0,2], we can use the properties of the function to find f(x) for xin[-2,0]. Since f(x) is odd, f(-x) = -f(x), which implies that f(-x) when -x in [0,2] is just the negative of the expression for f(x) in this interval. Therefore, f(-x) = -(2(-x)-(-x)^2) = 2x - x^2 for x in [-2, 0]. Due to the periodicity with a period of 4, f(x+4) = f(x), the expression of f(x) for xin[2,4] is the same as the expression for xin[-2,0]. Therefore, we have f(x) = 2x - x^2 for x in [2, 4].(3) To calculate the sum f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+ldots+f(2013), we consider the periodicity and oddness of f(x). Since f(x) has a period of 4, we note that f(1)=f(5)=f(9)=ldots and similarly, f(3)=f(7)=ldots. Due to the function's oddness, f(2k)=-f(-2k) for any integer k, which will cancel out terms in pairs. Thus, the sum reduces to f(1) + f(3) + (function  values  that  cancel  out  in  pairs). Since the function values that occur in pairs of odd and even cancel out and the remaining terms occur in periods of 4, we only need to calculate f(1)+f(3) for one period and multiply that by the number of complete periods in 2013. For the incomplete period, we observe that 2013 is 1 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., 2012=4times 503). Therefore, the last term f(2013) is equivalent to f(1). Since f(1)+f(3) for one period is 2-1^2 + 2(3)-3^2 = 2-1 + 6-9 = -2, the sum over one complete period is zero (the other terms not included here cancel out because of the odd function property).As a result, the sum for all the complete periods (503 of them) is 0, and we only need to consider the last term, which is f(1) from the incomplete period. Thus, f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+ldots+f(2013) = f(1)=2(1)-1^2 = 2-1 = 1.boxed{1}"},{"problem":"Let mathcal E be an ellipse with foci F_1 and F_2.

Setup and Initial Conditions:   - Let ABC be an equilateral triangle with side length 1.   - Points A_1 and A_2 are chosen on side BC such that BA_1 < BA_2.   - Points B_1 and B_2 are chosen on side CA such that CB_1 < CB_2.   - Points C_1 and C_2 are chosen on side AB such that AC_1 < AC_2.   - The line segments B_1C_2, C_1A_2, and A_1B_2 are concurrent.   - The perimeters of triangles AB_2C_1, BC_2A_1, and CA_2B_1 are all equal.2. Trisection and Concurrency:   - To show that the common perimeter can be 1, we can trisect each side of the equilateral triangle.   - Let A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, and C_2 trisect the sides BC, CA, and AB respectively.   - This means BA_1 = A_1A_2 = A_2C = frac{1}{3}, and similarly for the other points.3. Calculation of Perimeters:   - The perimeter of triangle AB_2C_1 is:     [     AB_2 + B_2C_1 + C_1A = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3} = 1     ]   - Similarly, the perimeters of triangle BC_2A_1 and triangle CA_2B_1 are also 1.4. Concurrency at the Center:   - The line segments B_1C_2, C_1A_2, and A_1B_2 concur at the centroid of triangle ABC.   - This is because the points trisecting the sides of an equilateral triangle and the lines connecting these points to the opposite vertices will always meet at the centroid.5. Proof of Uniqueness:   - Assume p neq 1 and consider the excircles omega_A, omega_B, and omega_C of triangles AB_2C_1, BC_2A_1, and CA_2B_1 respectively.   - By tangent segments being equal, if p is the common perimeter:     [     AT_A + AS_A = AB_2 + B_2T_A + AC_1 + C_1S_A = AB_2 + AC_1 + B_2U_A + C_1U_A = AB_2 + AC_1 + B_2C_1 = p     ]   - By symmetry, we obtain AT_A + AS_A = BT_B + BS_B = CT_C + CS_C = p, so omega_A, omega_B, and omega_C are congruent.6. Contradiction for p neq 1:   - Define B_2', C_1', C_2', A_1', A_2', and B_1' such that B_2'C_1' is tangent to the incircle omega of triangle ABC and B_2'C_1' parallel B_2C_1.   - Consider the dilation of factor frac{1}{p} centered at A. This sends omega_A mapsto omega, B_2 mapsto B_2', and C_1 mapsto C_2'.   - Perform the same dilation at B and C.   - This implies C_1A_2 parallel C_1'A_2' and similar parallel lines.   - Let P be the concurrency point of B_1'C_2', C_1'A_2', and A_1'B_2' by Brianchon's theorem.   - If p < 1, then X lies on the strict interior of triangle PB_2'C_1', Y in triangle PC_2'A_1', and Z in triangle PA_2'B_1', leading to a contradiction.   - If p > 1, the same argument applies, leading to a contradiction.7.

Since the parabola opens downwards, we have a < 0.2. The axis of symmetry of the parabola is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}. Since point P and the origin are on opposite sides of the axis of symmetry, and P is in the third quadrant (implying x = -1 < 0), we have -frac{b}{2a} < 0. This leads to the conclusion that b < 0, because for -frac{b}{2a} to be negative while a < 0, b must also be negative.3. At x = -1, the y-coordinate of point P is given by m = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) = a - b. Since point P is in the third quadrant, we know m < 0. Therefore, a - b < 0, which implies m = a - b < 0.Given the information above, we analyze the graph of the linear function y = (a - b)x + b:- Since a < 0 and b < 0, the slope (a - b) and the y-intercept b are both negative.- This means the line descends from left to right and starts below the x-axis because the y-intercept is negative.Considering the characteristics of the line y = (a - b)x + b, it will intersect the x-axis at some point to the right of the y-axis (since it descends from left to right) and will not re-enter the first quadrant because both the slope and y-intercept are negative.

Determine the value ofoperatorname{arctg} u+operatorname{arctg} v+operatorname{arctg} w","solution":"Solution. Let alpha=operatorname{arctg} u, beta=operatorname{arctg} v and gamma=operatorname{arctg} w. Then the roots of the equation x^{3}-10 x+11=0 are operatorname{tg} alpha, operatorname{tg} beta and operatorname{tg} gamma, and our task is to determine the sum alpha+beta+gamma. The range of the function x rightarrow operatorname{arctg} x is the interval left(-frac{pi}{2} ; frac{pi}{2}right), so -frac{pi}{2}<alpha, beta, gamma<frac{pi}{2}.By repeatedly applying the addition theorem:operatorname{tg}(alpha+beta+gamma)=frac{operatorname{tg} alpha+operatorname{tg}(beta+gamma)}{1-operatorname{tg} alpha cdot operatorname{tg}(beta+gamma)}and from here, using the substitution operatorname{atg}(beta+gamma)=frac{operatorname{tg} beta+operatorname{tg} gamma}{1-operatorname{tg} beta cdot operatorname{tg} gamma}, we get after rearrangement:operatorname{tg}(alpha+beta+gamma)=frac{operatorname{tg} alpha+operatorname{tg} beta+operatorname{tg} gamma-operatorname{tg} alpha cdot operatorname{tg} beta cdot operatorname{tg} gamma}{1-(operatorname{tg} alpha cdot operatorname{tg} beta+operatorname{tg} beta cdot operatorname{tg} gamma+operatorname{tg} gamma cdot operatorname{tg} alpha)}Expressing the right-hand side of (1) in terms of the roots of the given equation, we get:operatorname{tg}(alpha+beta+gamma)=frac{u+v+w-u v w}{1-(u v+v w+w u)}The numerator and denominator of the fraction on the right-hand side of (1) are exactly the elementary symmetric polynomials of the roots of the equation x^{3}-10 x+11=0, which can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial according to Viète's formulas:u+v+w=0, quad u v+v w+w u=-10, quad u v w=-11From this, operatorname{tg}(alpha+beta+gamma)=frac{11}{1+10}=1, so alpha+beta+gamma=frac{pi}{4}+k pi, where k is an integer whose value we still need to determine.According to (2), the product of the roots is negative, so the number of negative roots is odd; the sum of the roots is zero, so it is not possible for all three roots to be negative: there is exactly one negative and two positive roots. Thus, one of alpha, beta and gamma lies in the interval left(-frac{pi}{2} ; 0right), and two lie in the interval left(0 ; frac{pi}{2}right), so only k=0 is possible.According to our results, operatorname{arctg} u+operatorname{arctg} v+operatorname{arctg} w=frac{pi}{4}.Remarks. 1. Many incomplete solutions were satisfied with the answer alpha+beta+gamma=frac{pi}{4}+k pi without specifying the value of k.2.

At that time, the length of chord AB is 2sqrt{R^2 - CP^2} = 4sqrt{2}, and the equation of line l satisfying this condition is x-2y+2=0.To elaborate, let us consider that the shortest chord through point P will be the chord that is perpendicular to the radius of the circle through point P. In this case, line l will pass through both P(2,2) and the closest point to P on the circle along the direction of the radius. That point can be found from the circle's equation to be C(0,4). Since the circle has a radius of 4, and using the fact that P lies inside the circle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the shortest distance from the center C to P, which will be CP=sqrt{(2-0)^2+(2-4)^2} = 2sqrt{2}.

Furthermore, 152 c is even, as is 6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}, so 9 c^{4}+3 must also be even, which means c must be odd. Therefore, the only possibility is c=1.

Define a sequence ( a_0 = R ) for some ( R in mathbb{N}_0 ), and ( a_{m+1} = f(a_m) ) for all ( m in mathbb{N}_0 ).2. From the given functional equation ( f(f(n)) + f(n) = 2n + 6 ), we can write the relation for the sequence:   [   a_{m+2} + a_{m+1} = 2a_m + 6   ]3. Also, we have:   [   a_{m+1} + a_m = 2a_{m-1} + 6   ]4. Let ( d_m = a_m - a_{m-1} ). Taking the difference between the above recursions yields:   [   d_{m+2} + d_{m+1} = 2d_m   ]5. The characteristic polynomial of this recursion is:   [   lambda^2 + lambda - 2 = 0   ]   Solving this quadratic equation, we get the roots:   [   lambda = -2 quad text{and} quad lambda = 1   ]6. Thus, the general solution for ( d_m ) is:   [   d_m = P(-2)^m + Q(1)^m = P(-2)^m + Q   ]   for some constants ( P, Q in mathbb{R} ).7. Therefore, the sequence ( a_m ) can be written as:   [   a_m = sum_{k=1}^m d_k + a_0 = sum_{k=1}^m (P(-2)^k + Q) + a_0   ]8. Simplifying the sum, we get:   [   a_m = P sum_{k=1}^m (-2)^k + Qm + a_0   ]   The sum of the geometric series ( sum_{k=1}^m (-2)^k ) is:   [   sum_{k=1}^m (-2)^k = -2 frac{(-2)^m - 1}{-2 - 1} = frac{2^{m+1} - 2}{3}   ]   Therefore:   [   a_m = P left( frac{2^{m+1} - 2}{3} right) + Qm + a_0   ]9. If ( P neq 0 ), then there exists some ( M in mathbb{N}_0 ) such that ( a_M < 0 ). This is a contradiction since ( f: mathbb{N}_0 rightarrow mathbb{N}_0 ).10. Thus, ( P = 0 ), and:    [    a_m = Qm + a_0    ]11. So, ( a_{m+1} = Q(m+1) + a_0 ) and ( a_{m+2} = Q(m+2) + a_0 ). Substituting these into the original relation:    [    Q(m+2) + a_0 + Q(m+1) + a_0 = 2(Qm + a_0) + 6    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    Qm + 2Q + a_0 + Qm + Q + a_0 = 2Qm + 2a_0 + 6    ]    [    2Qm + 3Q + 2a_0 = 2Qm + 2a_0 + 6    ]    [    3Q = 6 implies Q = 2    ]12.

Calculate the volume of the tetrahedron formed by these planes.","solution":"To make it easier to find a solution, let's first consider an analogous problem on the plane:Let's draw through each vertex of the triangle ABC a line parallel to the opposite side of the triangle. These lines form a triangle A_1B_1C_1 similar to triangle ABC (Fig. 46). The center of similarity is the point S, where the lines AA_1, BB_1, CC_1 intersect; point S is the centroid of triangle ABC, as well as of triangle A_1B_1C_1. The similarity is inverse, because corresponding points, e.g., A and A_1, lie on the rays SA and SA_1 in opposite directions. The ratio of similarity isSince the ratio of the areas of similar figures equals the square of the ratio of similarity, the area of triangle A_1B_1C_1 is 4 times larger than the area of triangle ABC, which is also directly visible.Returning to the main topic, let's briefly recall the properties of similar figures in space. Let a figure F be given in space, whose points are A, B, C, ldots Choose any point S and a positive number k. When we measure segments SA, SB, SC, ldots on the rays SA, SB, SC, ldots, the points A form a figure F directly similar to figure F relative to point S in the ratio k. If, however, we measure the same segments SA_1 = k cdot SA, SB_1 = k cdot SB, SC_1 = k cdot SC, ldots on the extensions of the rays SA, SB, SC, ldots, we obtain a figure F_1 inversely similar to figure F relative to point S in the ratio k (Fig. 47). From this definition, it easily follows that the figure similar to the segment AB is the segment A_1B_1, with the lines AB and A_1B_1 being parallel (or coinciding, which happens when the line AB passes through point S). The figure similar to the triangle ABC is, therefore, the triangle A_1B_1C_1, with the planes of the triangles being parallel (or coinciding in the case where the plane ABC contains point S). The figure similar to the tetrahedron ABCD is the tetrahedron A_1B_1C_1D_1. The ratio of similar segments equals the ratio of similarity, the ratio of the areas of similar triangles (or generally: planar figures) equals the square of the ratio of similarity, and the ratio of the volumes of similar tetrahedra (or generally: solids) equals the cube of the ratio of similarity.To solve the problem, we will also need the following theorem:The segments connecting the vertices of a tetrahedron with the centroids of the opposite faces intersect at one point, which divides each of these segments in the ratio 3 colon 1.The proof of this theorem is simple; it suffices to prove it for one pair of such segments. Let M be the centroid of the face BCD, and N be the centroid of the face ACD of the tetrahedron ABCD (Fig. 47). The lines BM and AN intersect at the midpoint P of the edge CD.The segments AM and BN connecting the vertices A and B of the triangle ABP with the points M and N of the sides BP and AP intersect at a point S inside this triangle. Since AP = 3 cdot NP and BP = 3 cdot MP, it follows that MN parallel AB and AB = 3 MN; hence, AS = 3 cdot SM and BS = 3 cdot SN, which is what we had to prove. The point S is the centroid of the tetrahedron.Applying the above knowledge, we can briefly state the solution to the problem: We construct the figure inversely similar in the ratio 3 to the tetrahedron ABCD relative to its centroid S. This figure is the tetrahedron A_1B_1C_1D_1, whose vertices lie on the extensions of the rays SA, SB, SC, SD, with SA_1 = 3 cdot SA, SB_1 = 3 cdot SB, SC_1 = 3 cdot SC, SD_1 = 3 cdot SD.The plane B_1C_1D_1 is parallel to the corresponding plane BCD, and it passes through the vertex A, since from the equality AS = 3 cdot SM it follows that point A is the point similar to point M of the face BCD. Therefore, the tetrahedron A_1B_1C_1D_1 is the tetrahedron mentioned in the problem. Since it is similar to the tetrahedron ABCD in the ratio 3, its volume is 3^3 cdot V, or 27 V."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} whose recursive formula is a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}-a_{n}, and a_{1}=2, a_{2}=3, let S_{n} be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n}.

Inductive Step:   - Assume the statement is true for a tournament with ( k ) players.   - Consider a tournament with ( k+1 ) players.   - Let ( A ) be the player who has won the maximum number of games.   - If ( A ) has defeated all the other ( k ) players, then by the inductive hypothesis, there exists a cycle among the ( k ) players.   - If there exists a player ( C ) who defeats ( A ), then:     - If there is no player ( B ) such that ( A ) defeated ( B ) and ( B ) defeated ( C ), then ( C ) would have defeated more players than ( A ), which contradicts the assumption that ( A ) has won the maximum number of games.   - Therefore, there must exist players ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) such that ( A ) beats ( B ), ( B ) beats ( C ), and ( C ) beats ( A ).Thus, by induction, the statement is true for any number of players ( n ).(blacksquare) Second Part:1. Definitions and Setup:   - Let the players be ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ).   - For each ( i ), let ( f(i) ) be the number of players ( P_i ) has defeated.   - A triple ( i )-*bad* is defined as a triple where ( P_i ) is the player who has defeated the other two players in the triple.2. Counting Bad Triples:   - The number of ( i )-bad triples is ( binom{f(i)}{2} ).   - The total number of bad triples is ( sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{f(i)}{2} ).3. Total Number of Cycles:   - The total number of triples is ( binom{n}{3} ).   - The number of cycles is ( binom{n}{3} ) minus the total number of bad triples.   - We need to minimize ( sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{f(i)}{2} ).4. Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:   - Note that ( sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i) = binom{n}{2} ) since both sides represent the total number of games.   - By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:     [     sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i)^2 geq frac{left( sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i) right)^2}{n} = frac{left( binom{n}{2} right)^2}{n} = frac{n(n-1)^2}{4}     ]   - Therefore:     [     sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{f(i)}{2} = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i)^2 - frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i) geq frac{1}{2} left( frac{n(n-1)^2}{4} - binom{n}{2} right)     ]     [     = frac{1}{2} left( frac{n(n-1)^2}{4} - frac{n(n-1)}{2} right) = frac{n(n-1)(n-3)}{24}     ]5. Number of Cycles:   - The total number of cycles is at least:     [     binom{n}{3} - frac{n(n-1)(n-3)}{24} = frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{24}     ]   - Equality holds when all players have won the same number of games, which implies ( n ) must be odd.The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{24} } )"},{"problem":"If the tangent line of the curve y=frac{xsinx}{{e}^{x}} at the origin is perpendicular to the line 3x-ay+1=0, then the value of the real number a is ( )A: 3B: -1C: 1D: 0","solution":"To find the value of the real number a for which the tangent line of the curve y=frac{xsin x}{{e}^{x}} at the origin is perpendicular to the line 3x-ay+1=0, we follow these steps:1.

Condition for perpendicularity:For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. However, since the slope of the tangent line is 0, and the product of 0 with any number cannot be -1, we infer that the line 3x-ay+1=0 must be vertical for it to be considered perpendicular to the horizontal tangent line at the origin. A vertical line has an undefined slope, which occurs when a = 0 (since dividing by 0 gives an undefined value).Therefore, the value of a for which the tangent line of the curve at the origin is perpendicular to the line 3x-ay+1=0 is 0.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Given the line x-y+3=0 intersects the circle (x+2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=2, find the length of the chord formed by their intersection.","solution":"First, find the coordinates of the circle's center and the radius.

By plugging y_P into the parabola's equation, we get:y_P^2 = 4x_PThe distance d from P to the line x = -3 is given by the absolute difference in the x-coordinates of P and the line, so we have:d = |x_P - (-3)| = |x_P + 3| = 5Since the distance is 5, there are two possible cases for x_P:Case 1: x_P + 3 = 5 which implies x_P = 2Case 2: x_P + 3 = -5 which implies x_P = -8For Case 1, where x_P = 2, we substitute into the parabola's equation to find y_P:y_P^2 = 4(2)y_P^2 = 8So, y_P = pmsqrt{8} = pm2sqrt{2}. However, since we have two possible values for y, there are actually two points on the parabola that are 5 units away from the line x = -3. Still, the distance from both points to the focus will be the same due to the symmetry of the parabola.For either value of y_P, let's calculate the distance from P to the focus (1, 0):PF = sqrt{(x_P - 1)^2 + (y_P - 0)^2}Substituting x_P = 2 and y_P = pm2sqrt{2} into this equation, we get:PF = sqrt{(2 - 1)^2 + (2sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{1 + 8} = sqrt{9} = 3For Case 2, where x_P = -8, let's substitute x_P into the parabola's equation to find y_P:y_P^2 = 4(-8)This would give us a negative value for y_P^2, which is not possible since y_P^2 must be non-negative for any real y-value.

Ilya's first move will be to take a stone from pile B. There are two possible cases.Case 1. Kostya takes a stone from a pile other than B on his first move. Then Ilya will always repeat Kostya's move, that is, take a stone from the same pile from which Kostya just took a stone. Note that, while Ilya follows this strategy, after each of his moves, there will be an even number of stones in each pile.Ilya will be able to make his second move because Kostya took his first stone from a pile other than B. After this, each move by Kostya will involve taking a stone from a pile X different from the pile Y from which Ilya just took a stone. Then in X there will be an odd number of stones, and Ilya will be able to take another stone from X. Therefore, by following this strategy, Ilya will always be able to make a move after Kostya's move. Since the game will eventually end, Kostya will lose.Case 2. Kostya takes a stone from pile B on his first move. In this case, Ilya will follow the following strategy. If before Ilya's current move, Kostya took a stone from pile C, then Ilya will take a stone from there as well. If Kostya took a stone from pile A or B, then Ilya will take a stone from pile B or A respectively. Note that, while Ilya follows this strategy, after each of his moves, there will be an even number of stones in C, and the number of stones in A and B will be equal.Again, we need to show that Ilya will always be able to make a move according to this strategy. Ilya will be able to make his second move (by taking a stone from A). If on a certain step he needs to take a stone from pile C, then Kostya must have taken a stone from there on the previous step, meaning that on the previous move, neither player took anything from C. At this point, after Kostya's move, there is an odd number of stones in C, so Ilya can take a stone from C. If Ilya needs to take a stone from pile A or B, say from A, then Kostya just took a stone from B (and there is still a stone in A). This means that on the previous step, Kostya could not have taken a stone from B, so Ilya did not take a stone from A, meaning he can take a stone from there on the current step.Remark. The strategy described in Case 2 also works if Kostya takes a stone from C on his first move."},{"problem":"On the second day of the Lunar New Year, Xiaoming was riding in a car driven by his father to visit his grandmother's house.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices and two integers ( n ) and ( k ) such that (frac{3}{2} leq frac{1}{2} n < k < n). The graph ( G ) satisfies two conditions:   - ( G ) does not contain a ((k+1))-clique.   - Adding any edge to ( G ) creates a ((k+1))-clique.      We need to find the least possible number of central vertices in ( G ).2. Initial Claim:   The solution claims that the answer is ( boxed{2k - n} ). This can be derived by considering the Turan graph ( T_{n, k} ).3. Turan's Theorem:   Turan's Theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a graph on ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ((k+1))-clique is given by the Turan graph ( T_{n, k} ), which is a ( k )-partite graph with parts as equal as possible.4. Minimal Number of Central Vertices:   Consider the graph with the minimal number of central vertices. We claim that there do not exist three vertices ( u, v, w ) in the graph such that ( v ) is adjacent to ( w ) and ( u ) is not adjacent to ( v ) and not adjacent to ( w ). Assume for the sake of contradiction that such vertices exist.5. Central Vertex ( a ):   Consider a central vertex ( a ). We claim that any ((k+1))-clique that exists after an edge is added between vertices ( u ) and ( v ) contains ( a ). Assume the contrary, then there is a ( k-1 )-clique all of whose vertices are connected to ( u ) and ( v ) and none of whose vertices are ( a ). But then the vertices of that ( k-1 )-clique and ( a ) and ( u ) form a ((k+1))-clique, which is a contradiction.6. Modifying the Graph:   Now, delete the edge between ( a ) and ( v ) and add an edge between ( v ) and ( u ). We claim that this new graph satisfies all the properties outlined in the problem and has fewer central vertices than the graph we started with. Since ( a ) is no longer a central vertex and since clearly no vertex became a new central vertex in the new graph, it suffices to check that the new graph contains no ((k+1))-clique and adding any edge to the new graph results in a graph with a ((k+1))-clique.7. Verification:   Since all ((k+1))-cliques formed by adding an edge between ( u ) and ( v ) contained ( a ) and we deleted the edge between ( a ) and ( v ), we know that the new graph contains no ((k+1))-clique. Also, if we add an edge between ( a ) and ( v ) in the new graph, we obtain the same graph as if we had added an edge between ( u ) and ( v ) in the original graph, which by definition yields a graph containing a ((k+1))-clique. Therefore, the new graph contradicts the minimality of our original graph.8.

The correct approach should directly evaluate the numbers 3, 4, 5 without squaring them again. So, let's correct this by considering the actual Pythagorean triple check for 3, 4, 5:- 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2This shows that the set (3, 4, 5) is indeed a Pythagorean triple, but the explanation was initially misleading.Option B: 3, 4, 7We check if these numbers form a Pythagorean triple:- 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 neq 7^2 = 49Thus, option B does not form a Pythagorean triple.Option C: 0.5, 1.2, 1.4These numbers do not form integers when squared and thus do not meet the typical definition of a Pythagorean triple which involves whole numbers.

Condition (b): For every two distinct ( b, c in A ), there exists an ( a in A ), distinct from ( b ) and ( c ), such that ( bc ) is divisible by ( a ).We will consider different cases based on the size of the set ( A ). Case 1: ( |A| = 3 )Let ( A = {a, b, c} ). We need to check if the set satisfies both conditions.- Condition (a): Since ( A ) has only three elements, we need (gcd(a, b, c) = 1). This means ( a, b, ) and ( c ) must be pairwise relatively prime.- Condition (b): For any two elements ( b ) and ( c ), there must be an element ( a ) such that ( a ) divides ( bc ). This implies that ( a ) must be a common divisor of ( b ) and ( c ).Given these conditions, one possible set is ( {a, b, ab} ) where ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ). This set satisfies both conditions:- (gcd(a, b, ab) = 1)- ( ab ) is divisible by both ( a ) and ( b ).Another possible set is ( {pq, qr, rp} ) where ( p, q, r ) are pairwise relatively prime integers. This set also satisfies both conditions:- (gcd(pq, qr, rp) = 1)- ( pq ) is divisible by ( p ) and ( q ), ( qr ) is divisible by ( q ) and ( r ), and ( rp ) is divisible by ( r ) and ( p ).

Then there's a permutation ( (j_2, dots, j_n) ) of ( (i_2, dots, i_n) ) such that ( a_{i_2} mid c^2 a_{j_2}, dots, a_{i_n} mid c^2 a_{j_n} ).- If for all ( 2 leq i leq n ), any prime ( q mid a_i ) divides ( c ), then since there are ( a_i, a_j ) with ( gcd(a_i, a_j) > 1 ), we can find a prime ( q mid a_i, a_j, c ), which is absurd.Thus, no set ( A ) with ( |A| geq 4 ) can satisfy both conditions.

Finally, since z' = frac{2}{9} z must be an even number, the hundreds digit of z must be even, so the numbers 594 and 792 are also excluded.

The symmetry axis of a quadratic function given by y=ax^2+bx+c (or in this case, with |b| instead of b) is located at x=-frac{b}{2a}. Since the absolute value does not affect the location of the symmetry axis but its steepness, we can still use this formula. Therefore, for our function, the symmetry axis being at x=-1 implies:   [ -frac{|b|}{2a} = -1 ]2. From the equation above, we can conclude that a > 0. This is because for the symmetry axis to be at x=-1, a and |b| must have the same sign, and since a is in the denominator, for the fraction to be negative, a must be positive (as the absolute value of b is always non-negative). This means the parabola opens upwards.3. To determine the relationship between {y}_{1}, {y}_{2}, and {y}_{3}, we need to consider their distances from the symmetry axis. The distances from the symmetry axis for the given points are:   - For (-frac{14}{3},{y}_{1}): -1 - (-frac{14}{3}) = frac{11}{3}   - For (frac{5}{2},{y}_{2}): frac{5}{2} - (-1) = frac{7}{2}   - For (3,{y}_{3}): 3 - (-1) = 44.

Understanding the Problem: We need to divide an (m times n) rectangle into smaller squares such that the sides of each square are parallel to the sides of the rectangle, and the length of each side is an integer. We aim to find the minimum sum of the sides of these squares.2. Using Euclid's Algorithm: The key insight is to use Euclid's algorithm to iteratively cut the largest possible square from the rectangle until the entire rectangle is divided into squares. This process is optimal and minimizes the sum of the sides of the squares.3. Algorithm Explanation:   - Start with an (m times n) rectangle.   - Without loss of generality, assume (m geq n).   - Cut out an (n times n) square from the rectangle. This leaves a ((m-n) times n) rectangle.   - Repeat the process with the remaining rectangle until the entire area is covered by squares.4. Sum of Sides Calculation:   - Each time we cut out a square, we add the side length of the square to our sum.   - The process continues until the dimensions of the remaining rectangle are both equal to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (m) and (n).5. Final Sum of Sides:   - The sum of the sides of the squares is given by (m + n - gcd(m, n)).   - This is because the total number of cuts made is (frac{m}{gcd(m, n)} + frac{n}{gcd(m, n)} - 1), and each cut adds the side length of the square to the sum.6. Proof of Optimality:   - Suppose no square contains two corners of the rectangle. We claim that the sum of the sides is already (m + n).   - Consider every square adjacent to the boundary of the original rectangle. We count one side for every such square.   - We can count either all the sides adjacent to the left side of the rectangle or all sides adjacent to the right side of the rectangle. Then, we count all the sides adjacent to the bottom and all the sides adjacent to the top, except for some two corner squares.   - This counting ensures that we have at least (m + n) as the sum of the sides.7. Conclusion:   - The minimum sum of the sides of the squares is (m + n - gcd(m, n)).The final answer is (boxed{m + n - gcd(m, n)})."},{"problem":"[ Orthocenter and orthic triangle ]  [ [ median line of a triangle ]Segments connecting the feet of the altitudes of an acute-angled triangle are 8, 15, and 17.

Transform the Inequality: The given inequality can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and the denominator, leading to (m^{2}x-1)(mx+1) lt 0.2. Find Critical Points: Since mneq 0, setting the expression equal to zero gives us the critical points x=frac{1}{m^2} and x=-frac{1}{m}.3. Analyze for m gt 0:   - For m gt 0, the critical points are -frac{1}{m}＜frac{1}{m^2}.

Let (O) be the full circle containing the arc omega. Let O_1 and O_2 be the centers of omega_1 and omega_2, respectively. omega_1 is tangent to (O) at C, and omega_2 is tangent to (O) at D. 3. The point R equiv AB cap O_1O_2 is the external similarity center of omega_1 and omega_2. By Monge's theorem, the points C, D, and R are collinear.4. Let X and Y be the midpoints of the two arcs AB of (O), with X on the opposite side of AB from omega_1 and omega_2. The circle (X) has center X and radius XA = XB.5. Inversion in (X) takes (O) to AB, and it takes the circles omega_1 and omega_2 and their tangency point I to themselves. Therefore, omega_1 and omega_2 are orthogonal to (X), and O_1IO_2 is tangent to (X) at I.6. Moreover, XI is the single common internal tangent of omega_1 and omega_2, cutting AB and omega at U and V, respectively. Thus, I is the incenter of triangle ABV, and UP = UI = UQ.7. The power of point X with respect to the circles omega_1 and omega_2 gives us the relation XP cdot XC = XI^2 = XQ cdot XD. Therefore, the quadrilateral PQDC is cyclic with circumcircle (S) orthogonal to (X), cutting it at points E and F.8. The radical axes CD and AB of (O) and (S), and (O) and (X) meet at their radical center R. Therefore, the radical axis EF of (S) and (X) also passes through R.9.

Identify the sum of all coefficients: The sum of all coefficients of the binomial expansion ({2{x^2}-frac{1}{x}})^n is given as 128.

When we draw these 6 complex numbers out on the complex plane, we get a crystal-looking thing. Note that the total number of ways to choose 12 complex numbers is 6^{12}. Now we count the number of good combinations.We first consider the lengths. When we multiply 12 complex numbers together, their magnitudes multiply. Suppose we have n of the numbers pm sqrt{2}i; then we must have left(sqrt{2}right)^ncdotleft(frac{1}{2}right)^{12-n}=1 Longrightarrow n=8. Having n=8 will take care of the length of the product; now we need to deal with the angle.We require sumthetaequivpi mod 2pi. Letting z be e^{ipi/4}, we see that the angles we have available are {z^1,z^2,z^3,z^5,z^6,z^7}, where we must choose exactly 8 angles from the set {z^2,z^6} and exactly 4 from the set {z^1,z^3,z^5,z^7}.

Note that if we reduced the powers of x mod 8 and fished out the coefficient of x^4 and plugged in t_i=1 forall,i (and then multiplied by binom{12}{4,8}) then we would be done. Since plugging in t_i=1 doesn't affect the x's, we do that right away.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a regular 2012-gon with vertices labeled ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2012} ). The problem states that if ( k + ell ) and ( m + n ) leave the same remainder when divided by 2012, then the chords ( A_kA_ell ) and ( A_mA_n ) do not intersect. We know the first two vertices are labeled ( A_1 ) and ( A_4 ). We need to determine the label of the tenth vertex.2. Analyzing the Condition:   Consider three consecutive vertices labeled ( A_k, A_m, A_ell ). We need to find a unique ( 1 leq n leq 2012 ) such that ( n equiv (k + ell) - m pmod{2012} ). Since the chords ( A_kA_ell ) and ( A_mA_n ) would intersect if ( n neq m ), the only possibility is ( n = m ). This forces ( k + ell ) to be even, and ( ell equiv 2m - k pmod{2012} ).3. Interpreting the Labeling:   This condition implies that the labels follow an arithmetic progression with a common difference. Given ( k = 1 ) and ( m = 4 ), the common difference is ( 4 - 1 = 3 ). Therefore, the ( t )-th vertex is labeled ( A_{1 + 3(t - 1) pmod{2012}} ).4. Finding the Tenth Vertex:   To find the label of the tenth vertex, we substitute ( t = 10 ) into the formula:   [   1 + 3(10 - 1) pmod{2012} = 1 + 3 times 9 pmod{2012} = 1 + 27 pmod{2012} = 28   ]   Thus, the tenth vertex is labeled ( A_{28} ).5. Verification:   We need to ensure that this labeling satisfies the given condition. Since ( 3 nmid 2012 ), the values ( 1 + 3(t - 1) pmod{2012} ) cover all indices ( {1, 2, ldots, 2012} ). For two vertices labeled ( 1 + 3(k - 1) pmod{2012} ) and ( 1 + 3(ell - 1) pmod{2012} ), the vertex labeled ( 1 + 3(m - 1) pmod{2012} ) corresponds to ( n = (k + ell) - m ), ensuring ( k < n < ell ) and the chords do not intersect. Therefore, the labeling is consistent with the problem's conditions.The final answer is ( boxed{A_{28}} )."},{"problem":"18.

The reversal of this number is (100c + 10b + a).4. Adding the number and its reversal, we get:   [   (100a + 10b + c) + (100c + 10b + a) = 1211   ]5.

Consider the identity function:   Let ( f(n) = n ). Then,   [ f(f(n)) = f(n) = n ]   and   [ frac{n + f(n)}{2} = frac{n + n}{2} = n. ]   Therefore,   [ f(f(n)) = n le n, ]   which satisfies the given inequality. Hence, the identity function ( f(n) = n ) is a solution.2. Assume ( f ) is not the identity function:   If ( f ) is not the identity function, there exists some ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( f(n) neq n ). We consider two cases: ( f(n) > n ) and ( f(n) < n ).3. Case 1: ( f(n) > n ):   If ( f(n) > n ), then   [ f(f(n)) le frac{n + f(n)}{2} < f(n). ]   This implies that ( f(f(n)) < f(n) ). Since ( f ) is injective, ( f(n) ) must be distinct for different ( n ), and thus ( f(f(n)) ) must be less than ( f(n) ).4. Case 2: ( f(n) < n ):   If ( f(n) < n ), then   [ f(f(n)) le frac{n + f(n)}{2} < n. ]   This implies that ( f(f(n)) < n ). By induction, if ( f^k(n) < n ) for any ( 1 le k le m ), then   [ f^{m+1}(n) le frac{f^m(n) + f^{m-1}(n)}{2} < n. ]   This means all iterations of ( f ) applied to ( n ) will be less than ( n ).5. Cycle formation:   Since ( n ) is finite, the iterations will either form a cycle or stop at some point. Suppose they form a cycle of the form ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_t ) where ( f(a_i) = a_{i+1} ) and ( f(a_t) = a_1 ). Consider the greatest ( a_i ), say ( a_M ). Then,   [ a_{M+1} = f(a_M) le frac{a_M + a_{M-1}}{2}. ]   Since ( a_{M-1} neq a_M ) and ( a_{M-1} < a_M ), it follows that ( a_{M+1} < a_M ). Repeating this process, we find that all iterations of ( f(a_i) ) for ( i neq M ) will be strictly less than ( a_M ), and therefore will not return to ( a_M ).6. Contradiction:   If the iterations stop at some point, let the last term be ( a_m ). Then ( f(a_{m-1}) = a_m ) and ( f(a_m) = a_m ). Since ( f ) is injective, ( a_{m-1} neq a_m ) is impossible. Therefore, ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n ).Conclusion:The only injective function ( f : mathbb{N} to mathbb{N} ) that satisfies the given inequality is the identity function.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ f(n) = n } ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} )."},{"problem":"2.

Suppose the formula is true for n, then for a_{n+1} we have by the condition a_{n+1}=frac{n(n+1)}{2}+sqrt{frac{n(n+1)}{2}+a_{n+1}}, which means a_{n+1}^{2}-left(n^{2}+n+1right) a_{n+1}+frac{n^{4}+2 n^{3}-n^{2}-2 n}{4}=0 and a_{n+1}>frac{n(n+1)}{2}.

This makes them coplanar.Option B: {overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{b}-overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}}- Similar to Option A, overrightarrow{b} is present, and the other two vectors are linear combinations of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, making them coplanar.Option C: {overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{b}-overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{c}}- Here, overrightarrow{c} is not a linear combination of overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{b}-overrightarrow{a}. Given that overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, and overrightarrow{c} are not coplanar by the problem's statement, adding overrightarrow{c} to the mix ensures that these vectors cannot all lie in the same plane. Therefore, they can span a three-dimensional space, making them a valid basis for the space.Option D: {overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}+overrightarrow{c}, overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c}}- The vectors in this set are related through linear combinations, where overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}+overrightarrow{c} can be seen as a combination of overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{c}. This indicates that they are coplanar.Based on the analysis, only the vectors in Option C are not coplanar and can serve as a basis for space.

Given Information: The equation of a hyperbola centered at the origin is frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 with a, b > 0. The distance from the center to a focus is c=2, so we have c^2 = a^2 + b^2.2. Substituting c=2 into the relation: We get a^2 + b^2 = 4.3. Substituting y=x-1 into the hyperbola equation: This gives us (b^2-a^2)x^2 + 2a^2x - a^2 - a^2b^2 = 0.4. Using the midpoint's horizontal coordinate: The midpoint formula gives us frac{x_A + x_B}{2} = -frac{1}{2}. Since x_A + x_B = frac{2a^2}{a^2 - b^2}, we equate this to -1 to find the relationship between a^2 and b^2.5. Solving for a^2 and b^2: We find that 3a^2 = b^2 and b^2 = 4 - a^2.

If k is odd, then n+1 is even, hence k+n-1 is odd, and S_n cannot be a perfect square. Hence k must be even. In particular, as n<1000, we have five choices for k, namely k=0,2,4,6,8.If k=0, then n+1 is odd, so k+n-1 is odd, hence the largest power of 2 dividing S_n has an odd exponent, so S_n is not a perfect square.In the other cases, note that k+n-1 is even, so the highest power of 2 dividing S_n will be a perfect square.

Therefore, the equation of the line passing through B(2,1) and perpendicular to x-y-1=0 is y-1=-(x-2), which simplifies to x+y=3.Since the circle passes through A(4,1), its center must also lie on the line x+y=3. Let the center of the circle be (3,y_0). Since A(4,1) lies on the circle, the distance from A to the center (3,y_0) is the radius of the circle.

Checking if f(x) can be an odd function:    - Consider a = -frac{1}{2}. Then, we have fleft(xright) = frac{1}{1+{2}^{x}} - frac{1}{2} = frac{1-{2}^{x}}{2(1+{2}^{x})}.    - For f(-x), substitute -x for x: fleft(-xright) = frac{1-{2}^{-x}}{2(1+{2}^{-x})} = frac{{2}^{x}-1}{2(1+{2}^{x})}.    - Notice that f(-x) = -f(x), which means f(x) can be an odd function for a specific value of a.    - Therefore, option boxed{A} is correct.2. Checking if f(x) can be an even function:    - For f(x) to be even, we need f(-x) = f(x).    - Equating the two forms, we have frac{1}{1+{2}^{-x}}+a = frac{1}{1+{2}^{x}}+a.    - Simplifying gives us frac{{2}^{x}}{1+{2}^{x}} + a = frac{1}{1+{2}^{x}} + a, which cannot hold for all x as it implies an incorrect equivalence.    - Therefore, option boxed{B} is incorrect.3. Checking if f(x)+f(-x) is an even function:    - We compute f(x)+f(-x) = frac{1}{{2}^{x}+1} + a + frac{1}{1+{2}^{-x}} + a = 1 + 2a.    - Since a constant term or a term that does not depend on x is always even, f(x)+f(-x) is an even function.    - Therefore, option boxed{C} is correct.4. Checking if f(x)-f(-x) is a decreasing function:    - We compute f(x)-f(-x) = frac{1}{1+{2}^{x}} - frac{1}{1+{2}^{-x}} = frac{1-{2}^{x}}{1+{2}^{x}} = -1 + frac{2}{1+{2}^{x}}.    - Since frac{2}{1+{2}^{x}} decreases as x increases, f(x)-f(-x) is a decreasing function.    - Therefore, option boxed{D} is correct.In conclusion, the correct options are boxed{ACD}."},{"problem":"6.

Since a and b are negative and a < b, raising them to the third power preserves the inequality, resulting in a^{3} < b^{3}.

Start with the given function:f(x) = cos^2x - sin^2x + 12. Notice that we can rewrite 1 as cos^2x + sin^2x (since cos^2x + sin^2x = 1 for any x):= cos^2x - sin^2x + cos^2x + sin^2x3. Combine like terms:= 2cos^2x4. Recall the double angle formula for cosine, which states cos 2x = 2cos^2x - 1. Rearranging this formula gives 2cos^2x = cos 2x + 1. Therefore, we can rewrite our function as:= cos 2x + 1Since the function simplifies to cos 2x + 1, the period of cos 2x is frac{2pi}{2} = pi.

Proving the vertices of a regular pentagon are concyclic:   A regular pentagon is a polygon with all sides and angles equal. To show that the vertices of a regular pentagon are concyclic, we need to show that there exists a single circle that passes through all five vertices.   Consider a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. Let the vertices of the pentagon be ( A, B, C, D, E ). Since the pentagon is regular, each interior angle is ( 108^circ ) and each central angle subtended by a side is ( 72^circ ).   The central angles subtended by the sides ( AB, BC, CD, DE, ) and ( EA ) are all equal to ( 72^circ ). This implies that the points ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ) are equidistant from the center of the circle, which means they lie on the circumference of the same circle.   Therefore, the vertices of a regular pentagon are concyclic.2. Finding the radius of the circumcircle:   Let the side length of the pentagon be ( x ).

Since overrightarrow{AM}=2overrightarrow{MC}, we can express overrightarrow{MC} as overrightarrow{MC}=frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{AC} because overrightarrow{AM} + overrightarrow{MC} = overrightarrow{AC}, and if overrightarrow{AM}=2overrightarrow{MC}, then overrightarrow{MC} is one third of overrightarrow{AC}.2. Similarly, given overrightarrow{BN}=3overrightarrow{NC}, we can derive overrightarrow{CN}=frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{BC} by the same logic that overrightarrow{BN} + overrightarrow{NC} = overrightarrow{BC} and if overrightarrow{BN}=3overrightarrow{NC}, then overrightarrow{CN} is one fourth of overrightarrow{BC}.3.

Substituting the expressions from steps 1 and 2, we get overrightarrow{MN}=frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{AC}+frac{1}{4}(-overrightarrow{AC}+overrightarrow{AB}). The negative sign in front of overrightarrow{AC} is because when moving from C to N along overrightarrow{CN}, we're essentially going in the opposite direction compared to overrightarrow{AC}.4. Simplifying the expression for overrightarrow{MN}, we find overrightarrow{MN}=frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{AC}-frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AC}+frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AB}.

The divisors of 2260 are:   [   1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 113, 226, 453, 565, 1130, 2260   ]   Hence, the possible values for (1 + c) are:   [   2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 113, 226, 453, 565, 1130, 2260   ]   This implies the possible values for (c) are:   [   1, 3, 4, 9, 19, 112, 225, 452, 564, 1129, 2259   ]3. Next, we subtract the second equation from the first:   [   a + bc - (b + ca) = 2010 - 250   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   a - b + bc - ca = 1760   ]   Factoring, we have:   [   (b - a)(c - 1) = 1760   ]   Therefore, (c - 1) must be a divisor of 1760. The divisors of 1760 are:   [   1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 16, 20, 22, 32, 40, 44, 55, 80, 88, 110, 160, 176, 220, 352, 440, 880, 1760   ]   Hence, the possible values for (c - 1) are:   [   1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 16, 20, 22, 32, 40, 44, 55, 80, 88, 110, 160, 176, 220, 352, 440, 880, 1760   ]   This implies the possible values for (c) are:   [   2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 17, 21, 23, 33, 41, 45, 56, 81, 89, 111, 161, 177, 221, 353, 441, 881, 1761   ]4. We now look for common values of (c) from both sets of possible values:   [   1, 3, 4, 9, 19, 112, 225, 452, 564, 1129, 2259   ]   and   [   2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 17, 21, 23, 33, 41, 45, 56, 81, 89, 111, 161, 177, 221, 353, 441, 881, 1761   ]   The common values are:   [   3, 9   ]5. We test (c = 9):   [   (a + b)(1 + 9) = 2260 implies (a + b) cdot 10 = 2260 implies a + b = 226   ]   [   (b - a)(9 - 1) = 1760 implies (b - a) cdot 8 = 1760 implies b - a = 220   ]6. Solving the system:   [   begin{cases}   a + b = 226    b - a = 220   end{cases}   ]   Adding these equations, we get:   [   2b = 446 implies b = 223   ]   Subtracting the second from the first, we get:   [   2a = 6 implies a = 3   ]7. Therefore, the solution is:   [   (a, b, c) = (3, 223, 9)   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ (3, 223, 9) } )"},{"problem":"2.

This last equation may be rearranged as x^{2}-x-2=0 and then factorized as (x+1)(x-2)=0. So its solutions are -1 and 2. For x=-1, we have y=1 and for x=2 we have y=4. Therefore the parabola meets the line at the points with coordinates (-1,1) and (2,4) as shown in the figure on the right.These two points remain where they are when they are reflected in the line. Therefore the reflected parabola also goes through these two points.We can now test each equation given as an option to see if it is the equation of a curve which goes through the points (-1,1) and (2,4).For example, because -1 neq 1^{2}+4 times 1+2 the coordinates of the point (-1,1) do not satisfy the equation x=y^{2}+4 y+2. It follows that x=y^{2}+4 y+2 is not the equation of a curve which goes through (-1,1). Therefore it is not the equation of the reflected parabola.Because -1=1^{2}-4 times 1+2 and 2=4^{2}-4 times 4+2, it follows that both the points (-1,1) and (2,4) lie on the curve with the equation x=y^{2}-4 y+2. It can be checked that these points do not lie on the curves given by any of the other equations.Therefore, in the context of the SMC, we can conclude that the equation of the reflected parabola is x=y^{2}-4 y+2.If we were not given the equations in the options we would need to calculate the equation of the reflected parabola. We adopt this approach in the second method.Meтноd 2We leave it to the reader to check that when the point P with coordinates (x, y) is reflected in the line with equation y=x+2, its image point P^{prime} has the coordinates (y-2, x+2).We put x^{prime}=y-2 and y^{prime}=x+2, so that x=y^{prime}-2 and y=x^{prime}+2The point with coordinates left(x^{prime}, y^{prime}right) lies on the image under reflection of the parabola if, and only if, the point (x, y) lies on the parabola, that is, if, and only if, y=x^{2}. Therefore the condition that the point left(x^{prime}, y^{prime}right) lies on the image of the parabola is expressed by the equation left(x^{prime}+2right)=left(y^{prime}-2right)^{2}.On expansion this equation may be written as x^{prime}+2=y^{prime 2}-4 y^{prime}+4.

The lines K L and M N are coplanar, but since they lie on two parallel faces of the cube, one on A B F E and the other on D C G H, they cannot intersect. Therefore, the two lines are parallel. Similarly, we can show that the lines L M and K N are also parallel. Thus, the quadrilateral K L M N is a parallelogram because its opposite sides are parallel. Then, however, its diagonals bisect each other. Let the intersection point of the diagonals of K L M N be P. Then P is also the midpoint of the body diagonal K M of the right prism mathcal{H}_{3}, which is the center of symmetry of the prism, because the midpoints of the four body diagonals of the prism coincide. The central reflection about P therefore maps mathcal{H}_{3} onto itself, swapping the point pairs (K, M) and (L, N). Thus, it swaps the parts of mathcal{H}_{3} below and above the plane K L M N. Therefore, the two parts are congruent, and thus each part has a volume of frac{V_{3}}{2}=frac{1}{15}.The volume of the part of the cube below the plane K L M N is thereforeV_{1}+frac{V_{3}}{2}=frac{1}{5}+frac{1}{15}=frac{4}{15}and the volume of the part above the plane K L M N isV_{2}+frac{V_{3}}{2}=frac{2}{3}+frac{1}{15}=frac{11}{15}Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two parts is 4: 11."},{"problem":"Given a geometric sequence with positive terms {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n.

Initially, there are three piles of 100, 101, and 102 stones on the table, respectively. Ilya and Kostya are playing the following game. On each turn, each of them can take one stone from any pile except the one from which they took a stone on their previous turn (on their first turn, each player can take a stone from any pile). The players take turns, with Ilya starting. The player who cannot make a move loses. Who among the players can win, regardless of how the opponent plays?(D. Belov, I. Bogdanov, K. Knop)","solution":"Answer. Ilya.Solution. We will show how Ilya can move to guarantee a win. Let A, B, and C denote the piles that initially contain 100, 101, and 102 stones, respectively. Ilya's first move will be to take a stone from pile B. There are two possible cases.Case 1. Kostya takes a stone from a pile other than B on his first move. Then Ilya will always repeat Kostya's move, that is, take a stone from the same pile from which Kostya just took a stone. Note that, while Ilya follows this strategy, after each of his moves, there will be an even number of stones in each pile.Ilya will be able to make his second move because Kostya took his first stone from a pile other than B. After this, each move by Kostya will involve taking a stone from a pile X different from the pile Y from which Ilya just took a stone. Then in X there will be an odd number of stones, and Ilya will be able to take another stone from X. Therefore, by following this strategy, Ilya will always be able to make a move after Kostya's move. Since the game will eventually end, Kostya will lose.Case 2. Kostya takes a stone from pile B on his first move. In this case, Ilya will follow the following strategy. If before Ilya's current move, Kostya took a stone from pile C, then Ilya will take a stone from there as well. If Kostya took a stone from pile A or B, then Ilya will take a stone from pile B or A respectively. Note that, while Ilya follows this strategy, after each of his moves, there will be an even number of stones in C, and the number of stones in A and B will be equal.Again, we need to show that Ilya will always be able to make a move according to this strategy. Ilya will be able to make his second move (by taking a stone from A). If on a certain step he needs to take a stone from pile C, then Kostya must have taken a stone from there on the previous step, meaning that on the previous move, neither player took anything from C. At this point, after Kostya's move, there is an odd number of stones in C, so Ilya can take a stone from C. If Ilya needs to take a stone from pile A or B, say from A, then Kostya just took a stone from B (and there is still a stone in A). This means that on the previous step, Kostya could not have taken a stone from B, so Ilya did not take a stone from A, meaning he can take a stone from there on the current step.Remark. The strategy described in Case 2 also works if Kostya takes a stone from C on his first move."},{"problem":"1. Let [x] denote the greatest integer not greater than x.

Determine the normal forces exerted by the smaller cubes on the larger block:   - For the cube on the left side, the normal force exerted by the larger block on the cube is ( N_1 = mg cos alpha ).   - For the cube on the right side, the normal force exerted by the larger block on the cube is ( N_2 = mg cos beta ).3. Calculate the vertical components of these normal forces:   - The vertical component of the normal force from the left cube is ( N_{1y} = N_1 cos alpha = mg cos^2 alpha ).   - The vertical component of the normal force from the right cube is ( N_{2y} = N_2 cos beta = mg cos^2 beta ).4. Sum the vertical forces acting on the system:   - The total weight of the system is the sum of the weights of the larger block and the two smaller cubes: ( Mg + 2mg ).   - The normal force from the table must balance this total weight.5.

To find another solution, we take the complex conjugate of both sides of the equation.

Taking the conjugate of the entire polynomial equation:   [   overline{c_4z^4 + ic_3z^3 + c_2z^2 + ic_1z + c_0} = 0   ]   Using the properties of conjugates, we get:   [   c_4 overline{z^4} + overline{i} c_3 overline{z^3} + c_2 overline{z^2} + overline{i} c_1 overline{z} + c_0 = 0   ]   Since ( overline{i} = -i ), this simplifies to:   [   c_4 overline{z}^4 - i c_3 overline{z}^3 + c_2 overline{z}^2 - i c_1 overline{z} + c_0 = 0   ]4.

This fold results in two creases CF and CG, respectively, where F lies on AB and G lies on AD. Compute the length of FG.","solution":"1. Understanding the problem: We start with a square sheet of paper (ABCD) with side length 1. Andrew folds the paper such that corners (B) and (D) meet at a point (E) on the diagonal (AC). This creates two creases (CF) and (CG), where (F) lies on (AB) and (G) lies on (AD). We need to find the length of (FG).2. Analyzing the fold: Since (B) and (D) are folded to meet at (E), (E) must lie on the diagonal (AC). The creases (CF) and (CG) bisect the angles (angle ACB) and (angle ACD) respectively, making (angle ECF = angle ECG = 22.5^circ) (since (angle ACB = angle ACD = 45^circ)).3. Using trigonometry: Let (EF = EG = x). Since (angle ECF = 22.5^circ), we can use the tangent function:   [   tan(22.5^circ) = frac{x}{1} = x   ]   Using the tangent half-angle formula, we know:   [   tan(22.5^circ) = sqrt{2} - 1   ]   Therefore:   [   x = sqrt{2} - 1   ]4. Finding (FG): Since (F) and (G) are reflections of each other across (E), the length (FG) is twice the length of (EF):   [   FG = 2x = 2(sqrt{2} - 1) = 2sqrt{2} - 2   ]5. Verification with another approach: Let (x) be the length of (FG). Notice that side (AB) has been reflected onto line segment (AE) after the folds, hence (AE = 1). Furthermore, because (triangle FGC) is a (45^circ-45^circ-90^circ) triangle, we get that (EC = EF = frac{FG}{2} = frac{x}{2}). Since (AE + EC) is the diagonal of the square, we get the equation:   [   1 + frac{x}{2} = sqrt{2}   ]   Solving for (x):   [   1 + frac{x}{2} = sqrt{2} implies frac{x}{2} = sqrt{2} - 1 implies x = 2(sqrt{2} - 1) = 2sqrt{2} - 2   ]Conclusion:[FG = 2sqrt{2} - 2]The final answer is (boxed{2sqrt{2} - 2})"},{"problem":"3.

These planes also form a regular tetrahedron. It follows that the sum of the distances from any internal point (X) of the tetrahedron (ABCD) to these planes is constant (Problem 8.1, a). The distance from point (X) to such a plane does not exceed the distance from point (X) to the corresponding vertex of the tetrahedron, and the sum of the distances from point (X) to the vertices of the tetrahedron equals the sum of the distances from point (X) to these planes only if (X) is the center of the tetrahedron.b) Let in the tetrahedron (ABCD) the edges (AB) and (CD) be equal to (b) and (c), and the other edges be equal to (a). If (M) and (N) are the midpoints of the edges (AB) and (CD), then the line (MN) is the axis of symmetry of the tetrahedron (ABCD).

Then (XA + XB = XA + YA geq 2KA = KA + KB). Similarly, (XC + XD geq KC + KD).

For points on this line, the sum of distances to the vertices of the tetrahedron (ABCD) will not change if the segment (AB) is rotated around it so that it becomes parallel to (CD). In this case, we obtain an isosceles trapezoid (ABCD) with bases (b) and (c) and height (MN = sqrt{a^2 - (b^2 + c^2) / 4}). For any convex quadrilateral, the sum of distances to the vertices reaches its minimum value at the point of intersection of the diagonals; in this case, it is equal to the sum of the lengths of the diagonals.

The quadratic equation q^{2}+q-6=0 factors to (q-2)(q+3)=0, yielding q=2 or q=-3. Since the sequence is positive, q=2.  Given that a_{5}=32, we have a_{1}q^{4}=32, which leads to a_{1} cdot 2^{4}=32.

For ( n = 2 ), ( n = 3 ), and ( n = 4 ), the matrices are:   [   A_2 = begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1    1 & 2   end{bmatrix}   ]   [   A_3 = begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3    1 & 3 & 6   end{bmatrix}   ]   [   A_4 = begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    1 & 3 & 6 & 10    1 & 4 & 10 & 20   end{bmatrix}   ]2. We observe that the entries of the matrix ( A_n ) are given by the binomial coefficients:   [   a_{ij} = binom{i+j-2}{j-1}   ]   This is a well-known binomial coefficient identity.3. We notice a pattern in the entries of the matrices. Specifically, we observe that:   [   a_{ij} + a_{i+1,j-1} = a_{i+1,j}   ]   This is Pascal's Identity:   [   binom{i+j-2}{j-1} + binom{i+j-2}{j-2} = binom{i+j-1}{j-1}   ]4. To simplify the determinant calculation, we will perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular form. We start by subtracting the ( i )-th row from the ( (i+1) )-th row, starting from ( i = n-1 ) and moving upwards.5. For ( n = 4 ), the row operations are as follows:   [   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    1 & 3 & 6 & 10    1 & 4 & 10 & 20   end{bmatrix}   rightarrow   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    1 & 3 & 6 & 10    0 & 1 & 4 & 10   end{bmatrix}   rightarrow   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    0 & 1 & 3 & 6    0 & 1 & 4 & 10   end{bmatrix}   rightarrow   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    0 & 1 & 2 & 3    0 & 1 & 3 & 6    0 & 1 & 4 & 10   end{bmatrix}   ]6. Continuing this process, we can transform the matrix into an upper triangular form with 1's on the diagonal and 0's below the diagonal. This is justified by the Pascal's Identity pattern found earlier.7. Once the matrix is in upper triangular form, the determinant of the matrix is the product of the diagonal entries.

Since the line also passes through the origin, substituting (0, 0) into the equation gives 0=0 + b, which implies b=0.Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y=alpha x. Since it passes through (1, 2), substituting these values into the equation gives 2=alpha cdot 1.

Moreover, because AC bot BD, where bot represents perpendicularity, we conclude that ABCD is not just a parallelogram but specifically a rhombus, as all sides are equal and it has a right angle.Given |overrightarrow{AC}| = 6 and knowing that AC forms the diagonal of the rhombus, we can view AC and BD as diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. This divides the rhombus into four right-angled triangles, each with sides related by the Pythagorean theorem.By Pythagoras, if we split the diagonals into halves, we have the right triangle with legs of length frac{|overrightarrow{AC}|}{2} = 3 (half of 6) and frac{|overrightarrow{BD}|}{2} = 4 (half of 8).

The number of solutions to e^x = log_{frac{1}{2}}x is the same as the number of zeros of f(x).1. Monotonicity of f(x):    - The function y=e^x is monotonically increasing for all x in mathbb{R}.   - The function y=log_{frac{1}{2}}x is monotonically decreasing for x > 0.      Therefore, f(x) = e^x - log_{frac{1}{2}}x is monotonically increasing for x > 0.2. Finding sign changes of f(x):   - Evaluate f(frac{1}{4}) = e^{frac{1}{4}} - log_{frac{1}{2}}frac{1}{4} = e^{frac{1}{4}} - 2. Since e^{frac{1}{4}}  0, we have f(1) > 0.Given that f(x) is monotonically increasing and changes sign from negative to positive as x increases from frac{1}{4} to 1, it follows that f(x) has exactly one zero in the interval (0, +infty).Therefore, the curves y=e^x and y=log_{frac{1}{2}}x intersect at exactly one point.
