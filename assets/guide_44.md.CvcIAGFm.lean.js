I have seen all the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) of your parents. Your mother is diabetic and she is controlling her diabetes good. She has a mild increase in her leukocyte count, it is due to infection. Did she get any fever in past weeks? Or did she have a sore throat? Is she taking any thyroid medication? If yes, which one and what is the dosage? Her TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is high which means there is thyroid disorder, but to be hundred percent sure you need to do TPO (thyroid peroxidase antibody test) it will tell us what exactly the problem is. Your father probably does not have diabetes as you have done HB1AC (glycated hemoglobin) and FBS (fasting blood sugar) test first time on him. But I think he is a little obese. He should go for a walk for 30 minutes and reduce the fat and oil from his diet."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, When I started my workout today, I noticed that my back is not in proportion and not developed properly. I am wondering, why is it so? Do I have to see a chiropractor? Or do I need to adjust my workout forum? Kindly guide.","Doctor":"Hi. Are you right-handed? Is your left arm weaker? Or vice-versa? Normally, we all tend to use one side of our body more frequently and comfortably than the other, making us left or right-handed. We spend most of our life performing endless daily tasks with one side of our body at a much higher frequency than the other side. Hence, more developed and stronger muscles on that side. But, it is more visible in some individuals than others. You can spend more time building muscles on the weaker side and forcing yourself to use your uncomfortable side. You will strengthen and develop those muscles at least close enough so that you cannot tell visually that you are uneven. I advise you to do more of dumbbell exercises like bent over lateral raises, one arm dumbbell row and pushing your weaker side, left as per picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), to take more weight."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My brother is 34 years old. He was diagnosed to have high blood pressure in his 20 years of age. He feels palpitations and sweats at night while sleeping even in cold weather. Many times the sole of his feet get swollen. He remains in haste, cannot wait for long, and gets anxious many times. He forgets things easily that is things where he had kept earlier like taking mobile or purse or identity card with him while going to office. He dislikes delay in anything because he cannot wait much. He gets angry and irritated if the person before him works slowly or not able to understand what he said. He does not have patience and has little tolerance for delays and imperfection. He used to talk more negative about girls. He knew that is wrong but by saying so he feels relaxed. Though he accepts his faults, he is impulsive about scolding others for their imperfection, shortfalls, weakness and sluggishness. He lost his father at the age of 12. His father died of heart attack and his mother is suffering from chronic schizophrenia.","Doctor":"Hi. First, regarding his mental condition, it seems that he is suffering and there is a definite need for treatment. The problem becomes more acute considering positive family history of schizophrenia in mother. Most of his symptoms indicate mood disorder which includes both bipolar disorders as well as depression. Now regarding his physical condition, I feel there is a definiteneed to evaluate for pheochromocytoma. It is a condition where high secretion of brain chemicals (noradrenaline) resulting in high blood pressure, irritability, instability, and swelling of feet. Even his psychiatric condition can be explained by the same disorder. Considering all these, please take to him to a doctor for physical evaluation about the possibility of pheochromocytoma. He will take a more detailed history and will suggest some investigations which include vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) level."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

DDH was suspected at 3.5 months when there was slightly limited hip abduction and the ultrasound showed signs of physiologically immature hip, Graf type IIa on both sides. In right side, the alpha angle is 57 degrees and beta angle is 59 degrees. Left side, the alpha angle is 58 degrees and beta angle is 57 degrees. We were recommended massage and exercise. At 5 months of age, no frejka splint or pavlik harness was given to control DDH. Our orthopedist said that hip abduction is still slightly limited, but after an x-ray, he reassured us that everything is fine. He advised avoiding sitting until 6-7 months and standing until 12 months. He advised to just do exercises and massage but nothing else. Currently, I am giving her calcium and vitamin D3 supplements. X-ray was taken. I am attaching it for your reference. My questions are, is there DDH and how serious it is? What consequences it will give in her later life? What do you recommend right now? Please help us. We do not have good specialists in my area to consult. We are waiting for your answers with hope. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, there is DDH - developmental dysplasia of hip but of a mild variety, as suggested by the ultrasound, which suggests an immature hip. X-ray (attachment removed to protect patient identity) features show that the hip is not dislocated, but since it is an immature hip. The recommended treatment given by your doctor is proper, and you should follow that. You should follow up with the doctor every month until one year of age for clinical examination, and at one year another x-ray should be taken and compared. Thereafter, if there is no dislocation, then follow up should be every year until skeletal maturity. You should also do a triple-diaper technique (a technique in which three diapers are put together to keep the thighs apart in newborn) at night only for another six to eight weeks. Complications associated with DDH are epiphyseal dysplasia of the proximal femur and avascular necrosis. The chance of which is very less in this case and these complications are more related to treatment with braces."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, One of my testicles is not descended completely to the sac. I am 31 years old and not married yet. I have few queries regarding this. Do I need surgery? Does it affect fertility? Does it have any adverse effect on my sex life?","Doctor":"Hello. This condition is known as cryptorchidism (absence of one or both testes in the scrotum). If one of the testes has not descended as yet, then ideally it may have become dysfunctional already depending on the location of the testis, if it is still intra-abdominal or in the inguinal canal. There are high chances in such cases that the undescended testis may form a seminoma which is a tumor of the testis. If the other testis has descended, then it would be functional, and the chance of infertility is not there. Get an MRI pelvis done and most likely it would have to be removed. Also, get a semen culture done to check the sperm count and quality as well.Please meet your surgeon soon as undescended testis is not recommended to be kept to sit this long."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just had my second urolift a week back. My doctor-surgeon pinned down the median lobe of the prostate and removed a bladder stone during that surgery. Had voiding trial two days back. Urinated out about 200 cc at urologist's office. I think she put in 300 cc if I recall correctly. Went home and had to come back and be recatheterized at 4:30 PM. Had 485 cc in. My bladder at that point was able to get a fairly good stream going for a while but then got spasms and just dribbling so the amount out was not good enough to handle the amount of liquid going into the bladder. The head of my penis had stopped bleeding from the surgery but the recatheterization has caused it to start bleeding again. PA wants another voiding trial next week. I am concerned that this is too soon and that the wound inside the head of my penis will never heal and the spasms which do not allow me to accomplish a successful voiding trial will never cease if I am not given enough time to heal. Your thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi. In urolift, there is no cutting and therefore no wound. The prostate tissue is pinned to its covering and this widens the urine tube. So one week's rest should be fine for whatever healing there has to occur. The spasms that occur with a catheter in place are due to bladder trying to push out the catheter and these go once the catheter is removed. I think another trial of catheter removal is fine. If it does not work, or you are not happy with the flow or symptoms, or if you have more than 100 to 150 cc residue, better to undergo a formal TURP or HoLEP surgery for the prostate. It is an endoscopically performed, under anesthesia and little side effects. In your case, the urolift is causing problems and this defeats the whole purpose of urolift being less invasive than prostate surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What is the normal blood sugar level for open heart surgery patient in the morning test before fasting and after fasting?","Doctor":"Hello. Normal fasting glucose levels are the same for all types of patients, persons of different age group. The range of fasting glucose is 70 to 100 mg/100 ml (earlier upper margin was allowed up to 110 mg). The usual levels measured are fasting (10 plus hours after dinner) and after food or PP level ( two hours after food). Your terminology is not correct (before fasting and after fasting). Normal PP (postprandial) level is less than 140 mg/100 ml for all persons including one going for any surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My teeth are orange in color since I was born.

In case, there is any sort of stains, plaque or calculus, you need to visit a periodontist and get oral prophylaxis done with post-bleaching.

So, please kindly attach pictures for that because treatment gets different."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother has a big-time issue with itching on all parts of her body. She is 66 years old and has blood pressure and thyroid. Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Itching can be due to dry skin (xerosis), eczema (dermatitis), psoriasis, scabies, liver disease, kidney failure, iron deficiency anemia, thyroid disease, lymphoma or medications. Please get comprehensive blood work done to rule out these causes. Please treat according to the cause. Symptomatic treatment includes using calamine lotion, Caladryl lotion, antihistaminics. Take oil whole body bath at least three days a week since you already have hypothyroidism it may be the cause. Hypothyroidism and high BP can be completely reversed without any medicines because they are lifestyle diseases. First, fix your hypothyroidism without medicines naturally with lifestyle and diet. Do the correct basic tests for thyroid function which is seven in number. If you have done only the total T4, total T3 and TSH, it is incorrect. These three tests are commonly done and these tests are incomplete. You are missing the autoimmune cause which should never be left out. Hypothyroidism does not require lifelong treatment unless you have got your thyroid removed by surgery or has been destroyed by radiation to neck. Thyronorm, Thyrox, Synthroid, Eltroxin which are synthetic T4 may or may not be the correct drug you need. T4 is an inactive hormone, T3 is the active hormone. T4 has to get converted to T3 in the presence of a healthy liver, healthy gut and adequate amounts of certain specific vitamins and minerals. T4 is useless unless it is converted to T3. Dose adjustment in hypothyroid based on normal standard laboratory TSH ranges is completely wrong. Your laboratory will be normal but you will still have symptoms like fatigue, constipation, hair loss, inability to lose weight, brain fog, etc. Triggers for hypothyroidism include chemicals in your food, water, cooking oils, toilet and kitchen cleaners, stress, infections, cosmetics, etc. Take a consultation and try to most probably reverse your hypothyroidism. Treat the triggers and taper your medicine and you may be able to stop medication eventually."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 46-year-old female who is dealing with perimenopause symptoms.

That is really sad to hear about your mother but I would like to add into your information that evidence suggests that HRT does not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. It is only contraindicated if the person taking HRT has breast cancer already. Secondly, yes other options (SSRI, SNRI, Clonidine, Primrose oil, Black cohosh, Red clover, etc.) are available for menopausal symptoms. But the choice of the treatment option depends on your symptoms. Many over-the-counter drugs like evening Primrose oil, etc., are available which are helpful to many women in relieving their symptoms.

I also feel that there is like a pressure or a wave inside my body that directs the way I feel dizzy. Sometimes I feel it in my legs and sometimes I feel it goes up to my head. I can literally feel it and feel how it is dropping from my head to the body. Every time I feel I will faint, however that has not happened yet, probably because I lay down straight away as soon as it happens. I have panic disorder and sometimes when I feel this I get anxious as I am scared that it may be something serious. Occasionally, I have a slight headache but is not severe at all. A few days ago, I tried smelling lavender and chamomile oil, which is something new to me and I do not know if it has anything to do with this dizziness. I also have dry mouth most days recently too. It has started controlling me as I always need to hold the door or the wall in order not to fall down. I saw my GP. He asked me to close my eyes tight. I was going to fall down if he did not hold me while I was standing. Please note that I used to feel like the floor is moving up and down at night before I sleep. However, now it has increased to the stage where I feel it since I wake up till the moment I sleep even if I am lying down sometimes. The more I am awake, the more I feel it. Finally, when I come to sleep. As soon as I close my eyes, I imagine spinning even though I know the room is not moving as well as sometimes pain is in one side of the head. Your advice would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to orthostatic hypotension or thyroid gland dysfunction. Anxiety can mimic this clinical situation too. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing some tests: 1. Complete blood count for anemia. 2. Thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction. 3. Blood electrolytes for possible imbalances. 4. Vitamin B12 and vitamin D plasma levels for a possible deficiency. A head-up tilt test would help investigate for possible orthostatic hypotension. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. If all the above tests result normal you should consider anxiety as the main cause underlying your complaints."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 61 year old and was lately diagnosed by a doctor as sick in fibromyalgia. In the last three years during the night time, I am suffering from aggressive involuntary movements while asleep. Those movements include kicking in the air and arching and bouncing my back and the whole body. At first those aggressive movements started as a physical response to a dream where I was being attacked which happened once in a while, lately, it happens more and more often without any noticeable reason. As a result of the movements, I suffer from strong pain in my back and knees which lasts for a long period of time and restrict me to my house. I am also very depressed of my physical condition which projects to anything I do in my private life, family life and job. I quit my last job a year ago due to my medical condition. Can you please advice on physical/neurological treatment that will improve my poor physical and emotional conditions? In addition, I am using Lamictal 200 mg which according to the medicine brochure might rarely cause involuntary limb movement. Therefore, I wish to replace it with equivalent medicine. Can you please advise on a possible replacement? I have already tried Seroxat, Depalept, Gabapentin, Lyrica, Teril, and Cymbalta which did not help.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, these involuntary movements do not sound normal at all. It looks more of chorea/hemiballismus (movement disorder). It can be drug-induced but at the same time considering your age, we should get an MRI scan for the brain done. If any problem there, we will have to treat it differently. I understand you have tried a lot of drugs. Tablet Lamictal (Lamotrigine) can cause involuntary movements but not to the extent you have. First, I suggest you consult a neurologist first and get your drugs sorted out. Secondly, you can try with Amitriptyline or Mirtazapine as the drugs for fibromyalgia. They do not have that many side effects and may give you improvement since the others have not responded. I would also recommend you to do meditation or yoga as it does play a big role in helping patients with fibromyalgia."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 24 year old and weigh 70 kg. My blood pressure is on a higher side with readings around 150/90 always. I have a history of depression and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). I am currently on medication for depression and blood pressure and have been prescribed Nexito Forte, Skizoril 12.5 mg for depression and Nexovas 10 mg and Nebimac 5 mg for BP by my psychiatrist. Now, I have been referred to a cardiologist by my psychiatrist for further investigations for high blood pressure. Could the high blood pressure be a side effect of my psychiatric medicines? Or is it something else? I have been under psychiatric medicines for the past 10-12 years. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. You are already on blood pressure (BP) medicines tablet Nexovas (Cilnidipine) and Nebimac (Nebivolol). Tablet Nebimac controls heart rate. Psychiatric medicines may affect heart rate, but not that significant to affect BP (BP=Cardiac output x heart rate). And the benefit of psychiatric drugs is more important than small side effects. Maybe your cardiologist will the increased dose of Nexovas or add some other drug. But at 24 years, the cause of high BP is not like high BP of old age which is mostly idiopathic (unknown cause due to aging). At a young age, there can be a secondary cause for high BP like renal hypertension. Go for regular jogging or brisk walk 20-30 minutes every day and avoid a sedentary lifestyle. To know that, I would suggest you get a few tests:"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering with hypothyroidism and polycystic ovaries. Over last three years, I have gained 15 kg of weight.

All was fine for six years and he could pass urine properly only via new exit route that is below the testicles. But, two months ago, he discovered a wound (peri-uretheral) near the place of new exit. For this doctors again did a surgery and recommended a biopsy as well.

I had two miscarriages around 9 and 8 years ago. My last 6-7 periods were heavy and had a lot of pain. A lot of my family members had fibroids. So, I thought the same in my case too. Two months back, I got my last period, and as usual, it lasts 5-7 days, 28-29 days cycle. Last month I missed my period, felt unwell, had very sore breast that got bigger noticeably. Most of the time I had a nauseous feeling and became moody (mostly sad and irritated), certain smells irritated me a lot, urinated a lot, started eating a lot, felt the need of eating sour things, weird taste in my mouth, my tummy felt full or bloated in a very uncomfortable way and I slept a lot. One month back, I had 2 pregnancy tests, and both were positive, but the positive pregnancy test was very dark. I used the double pack of ultra blue. After three days, I went to the doctor for a checkup, they withdrew the blood sample to check the hCG levels. I got a call from the hospital asking me to come to see the doctor because my hCG levels are very high. Next day the doctor examined me and then did a transvaginal ultrasound, the doctor told me that the placenta is empty and it is not a normal pregnancy, but it is in the uterus. The doctor told me that no baby would be a result of this pregnancy and he also told me that my only option was the surgery where they remove the cells or tissues like scrapping the uterus. My hCG before the surgery was 28,671. I had the surgery on the same day. The nurse inserted 4 Cytotec pills into my vagina a couple of hours before the surgery. They said it was successful and they removed all of the tissue. They sent the tissue to the laboratory to test it. They said they suspect a molar pregnancy. What is your opinion? They have not told me if it is a partial or a complete molar. It is 2 days after the surgery, and I am not bleeding a lot just spotting. Today I almost had no bleeding. I thought I am supposed to bleed more, should I be worried? I feel tired; I have this weird taste still. My breasts are less sore, but they are not back to normal. Are those good signs? I read that this condition might develop some sort of cancer. Since my hCG levels were quite high to start with, does that mean I have a higher risk of developing cancer? If there were complications and the levels did not lower down, in this case, how strong is the chemotherapy? Will it have strong side effects like losing hair?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and understand your concerns. I feel sorry about your loss. It is most likely a molar pregnancy (benign tumor developing in the uterus) because hCG levels are quite high (human chorionic gonadotropin) and it is inside the uterus. Most likely a complete mole if the placenta has also involved. No need to worry, bleeding decreases when products come out and they are considered to be good signs. Sometimes, it can turn into cancer called trophoblastic disease. In your case, we have to go for a biopsy of the tissue and checkup of hCG levels after six weeks. If the levels are persistently high, then it is suggestive of cancer. Chemotherapy is quite effective in your case but the side effects of the drug could be there."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter had a root canal yesterday and now has a strong post nasal drip that tastes like hypochlorite.

However, if you are experiencing sinus issues that have worsened, or have not gone away after 2 to 4 days after your root canal or you believe you may be developing a sinus infection or you feel serious and significant pain and discomfort around your sinus or there is a metallic taste in your mouth, nose, or throat or you notice any kind of bleeding or pus in your nose or mucus, you should visit your dentist immediately."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

For simple allergic conjunctivitis, you can use over-the-counter lubricants, like 0.5 % Carboxymethylcellulose acetate. They usually settle down on their own and will not cause any harm to the eyes.

Please tell me everything I need to know about the atrial septal aneurysm. I am a 31-year-old female, 5'4\\", 127 lbs.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are unlikely to be related to this. An isolated atrial septal aneurysm is a benign condition most of the times, but this may be associated with atrial septal defects which can cause symptoms. So, if you are just having an atrial septal aneurysm and since there is no history of stroke or TIAs in you, it is probably a benign condition. It is important that we look for ASD in you. If there is associated ASDs then it will need closure. So, further management depends on the presence or absence of ASD. So, try to contact the doctor and obtain a full report. However, in either case, it is not immediately life-threatening. So, nothing should happen to you due to this. So, just calm down and you can get some beta blockers like Metoprolol prescribed from the local physician for symptomatic relief. Also, it is better if you can attach your ECG if you have. So, your symptoms are may be due to associated ASD which is not mentioned in your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) or probably related to anxiety if no other abnormalities seen in echo.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old woman. My latest pelvic IRM imaging showed that I have a 4 cm subserosal fibroid that is undergoing myxoid necrobiosis. My question is: Does this type of fibroid need to be removed? If yes, does the surgery have any risks for the uterine? Is it fine to get pregnant while having this fibroid?","Doctor":"Hello. Fibroid in pregnancy may be increased in size and can hamper baby growth by occupying space. Subserosal fibroid does not affect conception but in your case, it is undergoing degeneration. This is a problematic part. Red degeneration is a fibroid degeneration in pregnancy which causes severe abdominal pain throughout pregnancy and surgery cannot be done.  So I would suggest getting it removed. Subserosal fibroid removal has generally no effect on the uterus. But if it is deeply situated then uterus wall may become weak."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had a yeast infection weeks ago and I am starting to get the symptoms all over again but now I have a blister and soreness along the labia minora. I have a burning itching sensation and my vagina is sore. It burns a little when I pee and it hurts to wipe. My vagina looks red like it is irritated. I am afraid that it could be herpes.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. Herpes may present like small vesicles with clear fluid. If they rupture and have a red base.

I noticed rashes on the left wall of the vaginal opening and seems to pain slightly while urinating. Please suggest the remedy. I have been consuming cital syrup on suggestions by a pharmacist. Please suggest remedies.","Doctor":"Hello. If there is no burning sensation while urination or there is an increased frequency of urine accompanied with red urine then unlikely that you have a urinary tract infection, instead you are likely to be suffering from vaginitis. Please get a high vaginal swab and a urine culture to rule out infection first. If diagnosed then you can be prescribed a course of antibiotics accordingly. The presence of painful rashes at the vaginal opening on one side could be herpes zoster lesions. Please send a picture of the lesions for a possible diagnosis. Are you a sexually active lady?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a question regarding my lower front tooth. It was luxated and I when I visited my dentist, he said he could save the tooth and he put a splint on my lower six front teeth. He said I should wear it for six months and that, in time, would heal. It has been four months now but I still cannot chew anything with my tooth because it hurts on pressure. Is this normal and how long do I need to wait for it to heal completely?","Doctor":"Hi. It would have become normal by the third month and in the next three months, it might become more firm. But, if you are still having pain and pressure then it indicates that it might not be saved and ultimately might go for extraction if luxation is grade 3. If luxation is minor grade 1 then you can get root canal treatment done of the tooth in question and get the bridge done in anterior teeth, then it might be covered under the bridge and will be saved in the arch. If mobility is greater then get it extracted. And yes, since the dentist has said for six months time period, do it. Meanwhile, keep doing saline water mouth rinses. Take a 1/4th teaspoon of salt in a cup of lukewarm water and do its rinses 3 to 4 times a day. It helps tooth to get firm in the gingiva. Keep doing it for the next two months. Miracle can definitely happen. If not, then I have told you already what should you opt for. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have noticed mole like spots in my eye and light colored yellow red patch. I do not have any problem in vision or itchiness.

I have gone through the picture you sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is totally normal. What you are mentioning as a mole is like spots. Those are normal melanin pigments deposited in the conjunctiva. They are not a tumor. You should be concerned only if you notice a sudden change in growth or color.

When burping or belching, I felt relieved and fine. But after a while, the above symptoms appear again. I am a 60-year-old female with hypertension and I am currently taking Twynsta 40/10, Bisoprolol 5 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. I guess you are on Twynsta 40/10 which is a combination of Telmisartan and Amlodipine and Bisoprolol 5 mg. So this is likely a gastric and reflux problem, however, sometimes symptoms of gastritis and heart disease overlap in elders with such symptoms. Electrocardiography (ECG) is recommended. Meanwhile, you should have antacids along with your current medications like tablet Pantoprazole DSR 40 mg or Rabeprazole DSR 20 mg before breakfast once daily for a week and later whenever needed. You should also avoid heavy meals. Have less oily, spicy and fatty foods. Have a walk for sometime after meals rather than resting immediately. Have light dinner. If you are having constipation then you should get it treated with laxatives like syrup Cremaffin plus. Regular sleep is also important. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have high BP from last night 160/110 but I am not feeling anything wrong. I am 60 years. I have taken Amlodipine 5 mg one tablet last night but I have a sleepless night. Should l take the same medicine 10 mg now?","Doctor":"Hello. Your blood pressure is high considering your age. Although you are asymptomatic you need to control blood pressure to avoid complications related to high blood pressure. If Amlodipine 5 mg cannot able to control blood pressure than combination antihypertensive medication or high dose of Amlodipine can be prescribed. For getting prescription, you need to consult a nearby physician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,What are my chances of getting pregnant after taking the emergency pill within 24 hours of having sex?","Doctor":"Hello.

Your period might get delayed or you might experience spotting with morning pill."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 20 years old, and since a couple of days, I am having difficulty passing stools as there is a subtle pain and when I checked there is a pea-sized, skin colored blister covering the anus.

Please tell me how to get rid of it or treat it as I am worried about what it can be.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This looks just like hemorrhoid typically that occurs with constipation and goes away on its own. The solution is to avoid constipation by drinking more than enough water and taking fiber-rich foods like raw leafy vegetables and green fruits. Also, avoid meats and non-vegetarian items currently as they aggravate this issue. You may continue the laxative that you are taking as well till your constipation is better but not more than two weeks.

I have anemia and when I started to take Ferrous sulfate, my stomach noises begin again. I remember that eventually, I started to feel pain along with it. So my doctor adviced me to stop taking the medicine for a month until my stomach calms down and start taking the tablets again. I also switched to Ferrous fumarate but that does not help. I began taking the tablets again, at first I felt pain which eventually disappeared although the noises are back again and it is getting worse. It is also bothering me because it is loud especially when I am in the middle of the lecture in the university. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Some people do have rumbling noise in the tummy. Is there any associated nausea or vomiting or abdominal distension? Have you lost weight? How is your appetite? You have not mentioned the reason for your taking Ferrous fumarate? What was the cause of your anemia? Was these cause related to any problem in your abdomen or intestines? Have you had any surgeries in the abdomen? If you are continuing to have symptoms and you think it is related to taking Ferrous fumarate, you can substitute it with parenteral Iron infusion, but that would need a new prescription and visit to the day-care hospital or GP surgery on regular intervals till your body iron stores are stable. If you have copies of any previous tests, please upload.

A few days back I was given an antibiotic for it. The problem I am dealing with apart from the cough is night sweats. I have performed multiple tests today, results are attached but the summary is that total WBC, neutrophils and ESR values are raised above normal whereas lymphocytes have declined. The radiologist's X-ray report says that the chest is clear but the maxillary sinuses are hazy. What do these numbers mean? Should I be concerned?

What I feel is that you are having sinusitis. So, in that infection of sinus people get similar symptoms that are what you have. So, coming to the management part, I would advise you to go for steam inhalation. You just have to inhale hot steam vapor from boiling water. I want you to take Fexofenadine 120 milligrams one side at night for five days and other medicines include Paracetamol 650 three times a day for five days, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 650 twice daily for five days and the final medicine is Pantocid 40 milligram twice daily for five days.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

It is necessary to take adequate water to eliminate those through urine. Avoid exercise when ketones are present. Try and maintain closer to normal glucose levels. Check glucose levels at home more often (every 3 to 4 hours). There is no mention of what is the treatment with the dosage of various drugs, PP glucose level, and HbA1c %.

The anaesthetician who also took a look at my face recommended Glytone PA chemical peel to help treat some discoloration that the acne had caused. I went in to see her today and the peel she did initially cause extreme burning. I left the office with a little edema under both my eyes and by the end of the night, now, my skin looks like I have 2nd to 3rd-degree burning. But, it does not hurt. When I reached out to her and sent pictures, she said it was normal. She said there was no need to and that my skin would peel and heal in about 7 days. I look horrible and I am so afraid that I have permanently damaged my skin. I made an appointment with a different doctor tomorrow. Your advice would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. She is right, and these are common post peel effect. By looking at your photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can tell that in your condition medicines are very unlikely to effect and chemical peeling and lasers are the only options. Glycolic acid is considered a very safe peel. Ask her to use it from very low concentration and gradually increase the concentration so that the tolerance could develop against that peel. It requires three to four sessions at least to get the visible result. Always take post peel precautions like avoid sun exposure, sunscreen, and emollients, in rare cases use Hydrocortisone if there is a frank injury. Exfoliation of skin is a normal event after the procedure; that is why it is known as peeling. So, I would advise you to stick to the same doctor and follow his or her advice."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a balancing problem. I have low blood pressure in change of posture. I am on Midodrine. During a neurological examination, I was asked to tap my toes. Every time when I did that my heel involuntarily tapped several times. What is the reason? I am being examined for possible MSA.","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I feel really sorry for the balance problems you have. I pray for the best of your health ahead.  Yes, you have many symptoms that point my finger too towards the diagnosis of MSA (multiple system atrophy) although definitive studies are needed. Your age, balance and gait issues and postural hypotension all that concludes initially towards MSA. Your physician was actually examining the signs of cerebellar dysfunction and myoclonus (muscle twitching. Let me explain you the pathological meanings of MSA to understand more about your neurologist's intentions and your heel's presentation in doctor's office.   MSA is a disease of old age. There is degeneration of neurons in brain that cause problem in relaying information passing to and from the brain and all those electrical circuits in brain's certain areas. Naming the areas of brain affected will be irrelevant here. But, it is worth mentioning that it is related to body's balance and gait controlling areas; areas that cause to keep our blood pressure normal in limits when we stand up and lie on the bed.  The way your doctor tested you, he was finding the involuntary muscle contractions (specifically a group of muscles). This is then called MSA-C where C means cerebellar predominant. It is to differentiate diagnosis from MSA-P where P stands for Parkinsonism predominant type.  You are taking Midodrine that is used to control postural hypotension. It means you have postural hypotension too, and this is also a feature of MSA.  I need to ask some questions to assist you and prepare you more regarding knowledge about your disease, so that you may not be blank when you visit your doctor next time. You can discuss some important things with him. Please spare some time to give me details about: 1. Do you have ever felt tapping in head, palpitation or racing heart when you lie in your bed? 2. Do you have diabetes? Are you on any medications? 3. Have you felt dizzy and lightheaded ever after taking a meal? 4. Have you ever felt tremors in hands, muscle rigidity and any change in your handwriting? 5. Do you have sleep apnea diagnosed ever? Or I may ask do you get up from deep sleep due to lack of respiration and shortness of breath? 6. Do you have observed hoarseness of voice along with these gait problems?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I finished my MBBS and attempting to get a PG seat. I have the below mentioned problems for more than eight years and hence I am unable to get a PG seat. I am taking tablet Venlafaxine 300 mg for past seven months. Three weeks back, as I have few clinical symptoms of hypothyroid my physician suggested me to take tablet Thyroxine 25 mg. I feel 40% happy and better after using the tablet Venlafaxine. But that is not enough to crack the PG seat. My first issue is mental fatigue. When I study more than 4 hours or a new topic I feel more tired and have difficulty to wake up. I cannot squat or keep the hand raised or lift moderate weight for few seconds above the shoulder for some time. Lack of concentration or difficulty to mingle for some days after this attack. Back muscle ache and always seeking support for sit and do work. Easy propensity to go for sleep in morning hours during OP times. Also, afraid of PG due to this problem as sleep may attack while reading also. I get sleep while read and jump to some other topic in few seconds after coming out from that nap . If I read when I am alone then more tendency to go to sleep. Finally, more waste of time as I do not get sleep. If I go without sleep, more tiredness and severe discomfort. This fear gradually decreases over some days and again I will study and same steps are repeating. During morning times I hesitate to stand for some time and avoid those situations. Sometimes this becomes a problem as emergency patient needs my standing attention. If I read aloud less sleepy than when read inside but study rate is slow. Morning times feeling 40% weakness or loss of interest or loss of energy or sleepiness. Also if I stay alone the work or study productivity is not increasing. Sometimes somebody should stay with me to finish my tasks. Is this a kind of dyslexia? The second issue is physical fatigue and myalgia. Sometimes the body will be ready to meet the demands and work for more time, and I demand more work from staff at that time and other time I am in town and cannot ask others to work even too. Regarding neck pain, if I do any work on a laptop in my lap within 30 minutes, I am getting neck pain (last 5 years). Also, the same with a gold chain around the neck and legs in sitting position. Legs feeling so tired. So the fatigue, neck muscle strain, leg muscle ache while semi-stand or squat can give us the best guess to diagnose the problem. Burning of eyes is also observed during studies or excess physical work or excess protein content taken. I am suffering from on and off Plantar fascists of left foot from last 7 months. Why is it not decreasing fully?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand what you are going through. First, keep calm and patience. Be positive in your approach. Keep all doors open for opportunity. Accept the fact that cracking PG (post graduation) seat is not only because of hard work but 90 % luck. I have gone through your problem and can guide you on experience. Please accept whatever and whichever branch you get because later you might not get this also. Understand the ratio of seats to students appearing. Look for other options like DNB, diploma, family medicine, hospital management, emergency medicine, etc. No branch is good or bad but the thinking makes it so. You can excel in any branch with hard work and dedication. In today's world with much exposure and vast health industry, any of the fields can get due respect and recognition. Get yourself investigated. Consult a doctor personally. Please do not take any medication like that unless and until the reports confirm the diagnosis. Take a second opinion of a specialist doctor. Do take out time from study schedule to relax your mind and body. Too much stress and exertion can only reduce the final outcome and result. Walk in the fresh air. Do regular exercise. Listen to music. Watch a movie once in a while. Catch up with friends for a coffee, movie, etc., that is, do whatever activities relax you from stress. It is more about retaining what you read rather than the number of pages of books completed. It is a blind game. You never know what comes and from where. Since there is no syllabus so it is dicey to rely on. Take a healthy balanced nutritional diet."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 13 months old and 8 kg weight.

Thanks in advance for your response.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child but do not worry. By what you quote it seems that your child has probably got lactose intolerance, resistant stomach infection or worm infestation. I think you should do stool routine microscopy test and stool culture test to look for any infection and stool for reducing the sugar for lactose intolerance. It is seen in children that when they develop loose stools, sometimes the lactose intolerance may persist for 2 weeks. Continue Similac formula milk and stop Amul milk. Continue Darolac (Lactic Acid) for three days and Zinc syrup for a total of 14 days to increase gut immunity. No need to stop other foods or giving special items like tapioca water. Also, give deworming syrup like Bandy plus (Albendazole) 10 ml once at night before sleep."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 60 female, having pain in both knee and ankle, swollen up, does not bend knee, the pain starts from upper thigh to knee.","Doctor":"Hi. I think you should get your blood test done for cholesterol, uric acid, and blood urea. Apart from this, you should always wear a knee cap. Put your feet in a bucket of warm water with salt and sit for half an hour daily. It will sooth down the pain and swelling. Please do the same exercises of the knees and legs so that the circulation does not stop. Take Shelcal 500 daily and Vitamin B12 also for boosting up the immunity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a lot of scar tissue on my cervix and I have really heavy periods. Tried birth control, had very serious side effects, stopped the birth control. I have tried Provera. My legs got swollen, stopped taking that. She tried an IUD and due to a lot of scar tissue, she could not insert it all the way. I was wondering since I have a lot of scar tissue, can I get the Novasure ablation done?","Doctor":"Hello. I have a feeling that your problem is of quite serious in nature as you are bleeding heavily and yes you can try for ablation but there is a chance of its failure as ablation devices may not enter into the scarred cervix and additionally associated with injuries like perforation and damage to other nearby organs. I would like to add into your knowledge that another option to control heavy bleeding is a hysterectomy (removal of womb) which is the definitive treatment and is suitable to those with other failed conservative measures. The latest technique is the use of uterine artery embolization to control heavy bleeding is becoming popular these days for those who do not want to undergo surgeries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Tell me the treatment of primary premature ejaculation. I am suffering from many years, facing from the beginning of sexual life. I did not consult with a doctor and did not take any medicine for this problem yet now. I have no other health or physical problems without this. No erectile dysfunction.","Doctor":"Hello. Premature ejaculation in most individuals occurs because of anxiety and psychological reasons. Lack of experience, less foreplay, stress, etc., result in rapid ejaculation. Relaxed mind helps to improve the time. Distraction during sexual intercourse helps to increase time. Try to divert mind away during sex and this will help.  Drugs like SSRIs are the mainstay treatment for premature ejaculation. Dapoxetine is used commonly. The drug can be used on SOS basis and help to improve the time. It is safe to use. Please talk with a psychiatrist for the prescription."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have some problems with my eye and need some assistance.

Adding to it, I have some headaches and can see a lot of eye floaters from a week now. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Here your symptoms look more in favor of allergic conjunctivitis. This may occur due to allergy to dust, grass, pollen, cosmetics, soap, etc. Allergic conjunctivitis may be seasonal type. Try to avoid the above allergens to get rid away from allergy. You may have frequent itching in your eyes. Please keep in mind not to rub your eyes by any means. Rubbing eye frequently may provoke developing allergic conjunctivitis which was once healed up. Dust, grass pollens, cosmetics, and soap. — Allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine 2% eye drops once a day (preferably at night), Loteprednol 0.5% eye drops three times a day. Put ice packs on closed lids which may give you instant relief. Use it minimum for 15 days. (Keep in mind you may get symptomatically relieved very soon but allergic conjunctivitis needs time to recover from the roots). 1. Stay away from the above mentioned allergens. 2. Try cooling goggles while going out. 3. Avoid rubbing eyes. After 15 days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I really feel a bad breath in my mouth when I wake up early in the morning.","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question. I can understand your concern. There are two main general reasons for halitosis (bad breath) related to oral cavity or teeth and the second one is related to the stomach. For oral cavity related you need to check for any cavity, accumulation of plaque and any gum problem. If there is any such issue visit a dentist and get scaling done.  If it does not help, you may need gastric consultation. Try to avoid smoking and do not keep your stomach empty for a longer period.

Do not know what to do. So please help me out of this situation.","Doctor":"Hi. The loose stools may be due to the antibiotics you took for the sore throat. So you may stop that antibiotic and milk too as it causes loose stools. Instead of that you may take tablet Vizilac twice daily for five days and tablet Metrogyl 400 mg twice daily for five days. Please apply Candid oral thrush ointment on the white part of the tongue. It may have happened due to the medicines.

There are two possibilities in you, first is of a spinal cause like spondylosis or compression of nerves and other is costochondritis. Does this pain increases on neck movement, or any neck trauma, these may be the associated symptoms. You should get X-ray cervical spine AP or lateral view. You need to visit physiotherapist after X-ray and also orthopedician. Does this pain increase on pressure over the area, if yes then it suggests the possibility of costochondritis? You will need a Naproxen then."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 17 months old daughter booked in for grommets and adenoidectomy due to fluid in middle ear and recurrent ear infections. We are flying two weeks after the procedure. We will be visiting a place with bad air pollution. Will she be more at risk of respiratory infection with no adenoids?","Doctor":"Hello. At a place with bad air pollution, one's respiratory mucosa tends to get excoriated and irritated due to the harmful contents in the air. This can make the area supple and raw and more prone to bacteria and viruses in the surroundings. Having removed adenoids does not make your kid very susceptible to respiratory infections although theoretically adenoids are supposed to help contain infection by acting as a portal of immunity for harmful organisms entering through nose and throat. But at two weeks post surgery, the area will still be slightly raw and healing would not be complete. Hence, that can cause more susceptibility to environmental pathogens. I suggest you take a good course of antibiotics post surgery and during the hospital stay. Take a course of antibiotics for the baby with you and start when you feel she is developing an infection during your trip. Take decongestant nasal drops sprays and Tylenol for fever relief. Avoid areas of frank dust and pollution. Stay away from direct cold winds and Aircon air. If feasible put a face mask for the baby. The mother also should stay healthy as much as possible and follow all precautions to not develop an infection or allergy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 10-year-old daughter just found out she has grade 3 spondylolisthesis.

Spondylitis is not a disease. It is not curable. If she takes proper care and does some exercises she will definitely recover. You should also consult some physiotherapist for this problem. Also, she should take a good proper and balanced diet that is rich in Calcium, Proteins, Vitamins, and Minerals that provide adequate nutrition to the body and hence proper growth that can help in the curing of the problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a constipation problem. I think my constipation is due to calcigard retard 20 mg.

Drug-induced constipation? TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Blood sugar. Serum calcium.

If someone is having irregular periods then calculating the duration of pregnancy from the last date of the menstrual period is not correct. If ultrasound is showing six weeks then probably that is your right. Duration of pregnancy.

Send a picture of the area if possible and radiograph if you have. I feel the doctor must have taken precautions as you are on contraceptives which are likely to induce it. Send your details further. I think you should do one thing. Ask the dentist if it is a case of dry socket and place ZOE pack for three days. Home remedies will not help. People stop using mouth gargles. After reading your case history I feel your problem got created because of lack of instructions after tooth removal. It is a case of carelessness on your part as well.

In fact when I eat Dextrose, it gets better, my stomach deflate and I do not have a nasty taste in my mouth.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. I have noted your concerns. Having had treated similarly presenting patients at my practice, I want to tell you that it is not a cause of worry. Most often this condition is seen in individuals who have a geographical tongue, or as an early sign of jaundice or some other liver disorder. It has been noted at times due to the collection of skin cells that bind herbal pigments as in smokers. Most of such patients do not need any treatment except for good oral hygiene. You only need to have your serum bilirubin levels checked and be cautious if such discoloration extends to the white portion of the eyes or other skin areas. For proper restoration of normal color, one may use Hydrogen peroxide solution in diluted form for rinses and a good tongue cleaner.

The doctor said that it is fine if it is aligned more than 20 % in kids. I am attaching both the X-rays. Can you please check and confirm if it is fine? Also, since he is 4 years old, he is not keeping the sling all time and while playing (with toys inside the home), the sling is getting loosened. My worry is that will it delay the healing process. Does the kid always need to be in a sling while in the cast. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The reduction is not appropriate in this case, the bone might join in a 4-year-old child but this is certainly taking a risk. The child requires removal of the cast, reattempt at the closed reduction, application of slab for one week followed by checking of X-ray elbow with the forearm with wrist-anteroposterior and lateral view to confirm reduction is maintained or not. If the reduction is maintained, then to undergo cast immobilization. Children do not require sling at all times.

As per your history, swelling is temporary so do not worry. It may occur due to an allergy to condoms, vaginal douches, ragged intercourse, infections, and less lubrication but you said you do not have any problem with lubrication. Allergy to condoms , vaginal douches, ragged intercourse, infections, and less lubrication. Urine routine examination, pelvic examinations and check for STI’s. If it is only temporary swelling means no need of treatment but if persists then let me know. Maintain good personal hygiene, allergy free barrier contraception, avoid allergic products and lubricants."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please, I need help. My daughter is 10 years old. And she has ichthyosis hystrix in her body's left section, many doctors said that creams are the only treatment for whole life. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is ichthyosis hystrix. It is inherited condition and it is in her genes. Unfortunately, it cannot be reversed by any cream or oral medication. However, it can be improved with oral Retinoids and topical Emollients. The drug of choice is oral Acitretin. Apply Emollients like white soft Paraffin plus liquid Paraffin 4 to 5 times a day. The treatment is the same in all the countries. I can understand your concern."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18, and every year I have X-rays. I am in the 4 % that do not have wisdom teeth. Today, I was X-rayed and I suddenly have very small wisdom teeth. Every other X-ray, I did not have these teeth. I also have bone growths in my jaw. Is it normal to rapidly grow wisdom teeth?","Doctor":"Hi. Wisdom teeth can erupt little late than usual. It depends on many factors. In some people it takes up to the age of 24, these teeth also can never erupt and stay impacted or half impacted inside the jaw bones. So for now if you do not have any complaint or problem it is normal, but I recommend you to check up and get X-ray every one year as usual for follow up and see the condition of your wisdom teeth. Also, do not forget, keep on good oral hygiene. Panoramic X-ray."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a bloating for the past three days, I never had one. I had my period around this month beginning. Is there any possibility that I am pregnant? Is it any sign of pregnancy? I am having Sibelium 10 mg for migraine.","Doctor":"Hi. Bloating sensation can be related to any sort of diet changes. Check if you incorporated anything new in your food habits. Any increased coffee or tea intake, sometimes physical or emotional stress can lead to acidity and bloating. Rule out all such things. Morning sickness is commonly associated with pregnancy, but it is too early to say about pregnancy. If you had an episode of unprotected intercourse, you can perform pregnancy test two weeks following that specific date. For now, you can take tablet Pan D (Pantoprazole with Domperidone) twice a day before meals for three days to relieve the bloating sensation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, If you have an HIV test done and it is reactive but the antibodies test is negative, what does this mean?","Doctor":"Hello. It might be due to the HIV test detecting the HIV antigen (p24), and the antibody test might still be in the window period (meaning, the antibodies against HIV have not been formed in the body yet). In any infection, the infection produces its antigen, and later when antigens are processed by our immune system, the body produces antibodies against the infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Six weeks ago, I had tooth #2 pulled. The healing process has been normal as described by my dentist. I am now experiencing temperature sensitivity on tooth #4, which was previously asymptomatic. Even room-temperature liquid hurts. About eight weeks ago, I had the crown on tooth #4 replaced for cosmetic purposes. There was no pain with this and it did not hurt until this past week. Is there a chance my roots or nerves might be shifting due to the healing process of the extraction and causing the sensitivity? As a side note, tooth #3 in between the extraction and the one that hurts has had a root canal therapy years ago, which (I assume) is why I am not feeling pain in that one.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, your tooth might be sensitive due to the extraction process that happened in the surrounding area. Keep doing saline water mouth rinses. Take a 1/4th teaspoon of salt in a cup of lukewarm water and do its rinses 3 to 4 times a day for a week. If sensitivity goes away, well and good. If symptoms remain same, and sensitivity to air and liquid increases, it means your root is now sensitive and you might need removal of the crown, get a root canal done of this tooth and get back the same crown on it. Give me followup after a week. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My mother's ultrasound has been done. As the report says gall bladder is normally distended with normal wall thickness. Multiple tiny calculi are seen. CBD is of normal caliber. No intraluminal calculi noted. Impression: > Cholelithiasis > Hepatomegaly with moderate fatty changes in the liver. Can this problem be recovered with medicine? Or an operation has to be done? Please suggest me.","Doctor":"Hello. Cholelithiasis or gallstones are very common. It is something you should not lose sleep over. However, I would like to know why did your mother undergo an ultrasound? Did she have pain or post-meal dyspepsia? Whilst this condition cannot be treated with medicines, there is no reason to get it surgically removed immediately unless she is suffering from regular pain, is a known case of diabetes, or the stones have migrated to the CBD. That being said, it is always best to get it removed after discussing the risk Vs benefit of the surgery with your doctor. Kindly update about any other medical conditions your mother is suffering from and I will be happy to guide you further. Liver function test. Nonspicy, nongreasy meals."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father's heart rate was low and fainting, syncope occurs twice. The doctor suggested a permanent pacemaker for bradycardia. After pacemaker implantation, he was fine for 45 days but now his pulse rate increases and fluctuate from 70 to 100 rapidly and some chest pain for 1 or 2 minutes. The doctor has given Ivabradine and said he has some tachycardia. What could be the reason for these complications?","Doctor":"Hello. This is likely a part of the syndrome called as a tachy-brady syndrome. Here, patients sometimes develop slow heart rate while sometimes a fast heart rate. Slow heart rate is taken care of by pacemaker and for high heart rate needs medicines like Ivabradine. So, usually not a worrisome issue, but needs to be on medications. If he is having these frequently then should have Holter monitoring or ECG during high heart rate so as to optimize medicines. Also, considering his age and chest pain, it is better to take some test to look for blockages as well like stress thallium or CT coronary angiography."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been a diabetic for about 20 years. My recent A1c is 6.4. From last few days, I have been noticing that my fasting sugar readings are really high like 140-180. There have been no changes in the diet. Interestingly enough, within 1-2 hours it goes up by another 20 points without doing anything. Another strange thing is before I go to bed, it is in the range of 110-130, but in the morning it is always > 140. Please help me understand this strange phenomen. I am taking 1000mcg Metformin twice a day.","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query It’s good to see ur sugars are good with HBA1c 6.4. Blood sugars go up and down not only with meals but there are many other factors associated as well like other Harmon levels in the body. For example if ur stressed mentally or excited ur cortisol and catecholamines also increase and thus may lead to increase sugar levels as well Same way if u will do exercise it will decrease ur sugar as well as use of alcohol. May be ur eating habits didn’t change much but other factors have something to do with these levels.  Sleep is also important. Along with medications I always advise for intermittent fasting and low carbohydrates with least grains. Exercise even if it’s just walking 45 minutes daily is beneficial Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I want to use pills but I do not know to whom I should tell my problem. I am feeling nice when I masturbate but it is wrong so please show the right way to solve my problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I can figure out that the whole problem is love here. Let me tell you in this way. See people have a wrong belief that love is only once. Love is always alive within us because we first love our mother, then father, then toys, then games, then school, then friends, then girls, then the job, then money, etc. The list keeps moving but it is our inner block which does not allow us to move further. We need to understand that when time do not stop nothing stops. If we stop people will go ahead of us. Today's world is full of competition and if we are delayed we are at loss. Forget about movies. Movies are just a story. But I see that movies spoil our life and make us helpless. When celebrities can do love, sex and betrayal then we are fine we should also be one of them. That is human nature. Love is like a mobile. We buy one which is best, next year still the best come and it keeps following. Do we stick to depression? No, right? Then we need to move. everything updates even the android and iOS software for gadgets. Something like that our life we should take. Marriage is just a social show off. We do get married and have sex. Nothing else. Our life has been constantly changing. We finish studies, struggle for jobs, then salary, then buying house, then car, then marriage, then kids and much more. Nothing is easy. We should be hard rock internally. I should share my personal experience in the last 12 years. I was depressed once upon a time, I needed a psychiatrist for myself. But I understood that until I rise nothing can help me, no one can help me. I need to move I need to be strong and I need to be practical. I Will advice you to not masturbate because if you do then you lose your energy of the body and please understand that we are all with one time growing till 18 to 20 years of age. Then we are not going to grow but going to get aged. We will get blood pressure, diabetes, pain, and aches and we will forget anything about love. We will only wait when life will end. Things happen this way only. I will even request you to go for some old age home. Ask their experience with lives. You will really feel so relaxed that life is nothing but just to pass with time. I hope you will become positive and take the decision in life to accept challenges. Because if we accept challenges then we enjoy more and more. If there is no failure in life we will never know what success is. Let us keep the ego, attitude, and anger in us alive to achieve the best for us in life. Think over it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having an oral problem, most specifically teeth for over 10 years. I have faded gums, beneath my lower pre-molars, incisors and canines are yellow. I have two severe curved molars on my lower jaws which have lasted for 10 years. I resorted to removing but I was advised not to since it could lead to affect rest of the teeth and I would eventually find myself toothless. Minding my food consumption, they have not been itchy. Just for the past few weeks, one of the curved teeth started hurting me severely that I visited my doctor. I have convinced myself that it is the right time to eliminate them. Please advice on this as well how to permanently regain my white teeth. They are not very yellow but partially.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry too much about the color of the teeth. The color varies in each individual from bright white to pale yellow. There are many shades of teeth that can occur due to varied reasons. As long as the teeth and gums are healthy, nothing much to worry about the color. Regarding pain in one of the molar teeth, visit your dentist and get the suggested treatment done. (My advice is not to get the tooth removed). You can get a few sessions of teeth bleaching done to improve the teeth color to a few shades whiter. (This should be done under the supervision of a dentist)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have neck pain and back pain. Allopathy says I have disc prolapse and pinched nerve but Ayurvedic doctor said nothing. He has suggested Gorochanadi Guggulu tablet. I am afraid of taking this medicine.

In this condition needs Basti therapy along with oral medicines. Gorochanadi Gutika is mostly used in respiratory disorders. You can take Vatagajankusha Rasa one tablet with Vatavidhwansini Vati one tablet, Prawal Bhasma 500 mg, Bruhat Vata Chintamani Rasa one tablet twice a day with honey after meals.

No, you will not get HIV because of body massage or hand job, unless, you have an ulcer or cut injury or she should be positive and she should contact your ulcer or cut with her saliva or vaginal secretion or other body secretion. You may get a bacterial infection if the person giving hand job did not wash hands. So, no need to worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My anal area is always moist. What could be the reason? I am 26 years old, female.","Doctor":"Hello. This could be because of overactive sweat glands, oily skin with or without chronic low-grade infection. After bathing let the area dry completely, use pure cotton undergarments and use Myoderm-C dusting powder over your anal area as well as sprinkle some on the panty. I hope your bowels are fine and you are not constipated. If that is not the case, you need to be treated for the same."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a red color patch just below my neck.

Do you have any written report?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is 59 years old. She has gallstone and she was supposed to have cholecystectomy but was postponed due to quarantine. Last month was the supposed schedule and that time the size of the stone in her gall bladder was 3 cm. Now she is experiencing increased pain on her right shoulder. I would like to know if there is something she can do for the pain or should she have her gall bladder removed?","Doctor":"Hello. I will help you with your problem. Gall stone surgery is not emergency surgery. It should be done in an emergency if there is gall bladder perforation or malignancy. In your case, the stone size is large, and with the age of the patient malignancy is ruled out. I will advise to go for CT (computed tomography) scan if possible. If not at least USG (ultrasound) abdomen should be done. If everything is normal and only stones are there then you can wait for some time. Consult in an emergency if she developed jaundice any time. For pain, she may take any regular pain killers. Avoid fatty diet and get back to me after investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Intercourse should ideally be avoided till the 18th week of gestation to avoid such episodes of threatened miscarriage.

Problems with breathing during in summer seem to be related to allergy. Chest x-ray and allergy tests are advised to further together with stool examination for ova parasites. Changes in power lens often are due to hormonal changes or working too long in front of computer or cellphones. Should train your eyes when working with the computer.

I have not gotten my period this month. I am 7 to 10 days late. Took six different brands, etc. Pregnancy tests are all negative. What could be causing this late period? I am under a lot of stress also.","Doctor":"Hello. The fact that urine pregnancy test is negative, and as this is the first time that your menses have been delayed and there is a likely cause present- the throat infection and the stress factor during this month. So, stress as we know that it can easily cause hormonal imbalances which can delay menses, you are likely experiencing a stress delay. As you are already delayed by 10 days you can either opt for a withdrawal bleed with Progesterones now or wait for a week to allow menses to return naturally and if not, then use Progesterone pills for withdrawal bleed to initiate menses. Please maintain a menstrual calendar for the next three months to understand the pattern of your menses to ascertain the need for treatment for oligomenorrhoea."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My son is 3.5 years old. We live in a place which has a lot of dust along with cold weather. My son has been suffering from regular cold cough problems since he turned 1, on an average three times in a month. Sometimes, the gap is longer when we are too careful and maybe the weather is stable. Starts with a runny nose, then cough, coughing is too much when he lies down, at night and early morning. Many times he also gets fever.We have visited several doctors and have been told it is RAD, we still do not know what is he allergic to, could be dust. In the past 2.5 years, he has regularly (when suffering) taken Allegra/Cetrizine, Nasivion drops, finished several bottles of Beta2, Salbutamol, Asthaline syrups, Paracetamol, sometimes but less of Azithromycin when it is throat infection, once or twice taken Kidpred also, also he has taken Montelukast 4 mg for certain intervals like taken for a few months and stopped and again taken.Three weeks back he got cough, we went to pediatric pulmonologist and were advised to start Budecort 200 inhaler twice a day for a year. Also, Asthaline inhaler three times a day for a week but still has cough. Allegra for a week along with Montair 4 mg. We did not start Budecort but started with Asthaline inhaler, Montelukast and Allegra. It improved and third week again he has got cold and cough but intensity is little less.My question is should we start Budecort 200 inhaler for a year and stop Montelukast? Or should we not start Budecort right now and continue with Montelukast for some time and check if it works? Or should we give both Budecort and Montelukast? Also is it fine to start with Asthaline inhalers whenever he gets cough? Lastly is there any way which we can find out what things he is allergic to? Or a list of common allergies?","Doctor":"Hi. Please note that Budecort inhaler is the medicine to prevent or reduce these instances and Asthalin is the emergency medicine to control sudden bouts. Hence, without fail you should start and continue using Budecort along with Montelukast and use Asthalin on SOS basis. As far as the question regarding allergy to certain items goes, it is best to observe the child for the same rather than doing umpteen number of tests just for finding the causative allergens. Any which ways the chances of you preventing the child from coming in contact with such an allergen would be less only.

No need to get panicky over the dog bite. You are fine. Rabies testing on humans is performed on samples of saliva, serum. Saliva can be tested by virus isolation or reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum and spinal fluid are tested for antibodies to rabies virus.

A few days back, I suffered a trauma to the eye area and as a result, I have a lot of swelling and a subconjunctival hemorrhage and the doctor carried out the funduscopic exam and it was clear. Today hemorrhage has gotten bigger and feel like my eye is discharging or weeping. Eyesight is normal. Should I get it checked?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you suffered a trauma to the eye. When examined, the doctor said that you have a subconjunctival hemorrhage with no damage to the retina. As of now your vision is clear but the hemorrhage has increased for two days and you are on treatment for pigment dispersion, psoriasis or ankylosing spondylitis. With this scenario, I feel that a visit to an ophthalmologist is necessary. An appearance of increasing redness of your eyes could be due to both the congestion of the eye or due to an increasing hemorrhage. The fact that you have discharge from your eyes suggests that an infection could have developed. This is quite a common occurrence after an injury. I advise you to avoid rubbing your eyes, wash the discharge away with cold clean water and review with your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, One of my relatives is HIV positive.

Please help me on how can I be sure of his claims as truth in this relation is very important for me. 2. Also, can you please let me know the prognosis of this disease. As per him, he will live a normal life and there is no threat of developing AIDS as he is a special case. Please let me know if this is true and how can it be proved.","Doctor":"Hi. There is nothing like functional HIV infection. Confirm, whether he is HIV 1 or 2 because HIV 2 is less infectious and less violent than 1. If he is infected with 1, then there will be slow progressor or rapid progressor. If he is rapid, then he will have a low CD4 count below 350 by two years, and if he is slow progressor then it will take 4 to 5 years but inevitable to land in AIDS if he will not take medicines. 1. Get his viral load and CD4 report to know the current status to assess his claims. 2. Prognosis is very good at current age owing to very good use of HAART medication.

Try to understand that the breast is made up of muscles and fatty tissue. So, how can any oil or cream increase the fat over the breast!! Think. To increase the breast size you need to eat healthily and increase protein in the diet. The only thing that can help you out is a protein-rich diet and chest and breast muscle weight training.

Just heard of refeeding syndrome. Any other precautions?","Doctor":"Hi. It is not clear why you are undertaking water (only) fast for so long as 14 days. In case, you have decided to, I would advise you to do it under the expert supervision of an ayurveda or naturopathy physician who can monitor you closely. While fasting has obvious health benefits, prolonged fasting exceeding a week can have serious ramifications on one's health unless carried out under expert supervision. It is always safer and advisable to have shorter fasts of two to three days maximum, in regular intervals, than resorting to a long duration fast in a single go. Refeeding syndrome obviously is a potential threat with clinical complications because of impaired metabolism owing to severe vitamins and electrolyte imbalance. This can be fatal too.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Recently I went for a scan named targeted imaging for fetal anomalies (TIFFA). All the reports were normal except hypoplastic nasal bone and higher normal values of amniotic fluid.

Can I terminate the pregnancy in my 28th week of pregnancy? How much safe it is to go for amniocentesis test? Is there any alternate test to get better results? I decided not to have a baby who is mentally retarded. Please suggest me your valuable advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. We can better comment on the outcome after getting the results of the amniocentesis. Even if Down's syndrome, people usually go for keeping the fetus alive and they go for completion of pregnancy to the full term. 2. You may terminate anytime depending on where you opt in for this termination. I mean you need to have expert hands for that. 3. Amniocentesis is very widely done test all over the world and as for every diagnostic invasive procedure it has its own safety profile. 4. Risk of complications is always there as it is associated with invasive procedure. Again I want to add that if you opt in for the expert hands and a seasoned professional obstetricians and gynecologists and interventional radiologist then there is no to low risk for the baby and the mother. 5. Amniocentesis and karyotyping to rule out for genetic disorders that involve chromosomal anomalies is the best test universally. No other choice, as this is what we need to know next and this is the specific test available which may guide us about that. 6. It is your right to decide and it is solely you who can decide about your body as to what is better for you.

But even with mist, night gel, lid wipes, eye vitamins, drops, my eyes keep closing from the burning and discomfort like grit. No red eye or itching. Current medication: Parkinson Sinemet, Neupro patch, Equip, Doxycycline 100 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. Dry eyes which is this severe and resistant to treatment can be caused due to a number of factors. Doxycycline is usually a drug we reserve for extreme cases and it takes a few weeks before it can start to act. Firstly, the same mechanisms causing parkinsonism may be harming your lacrimal gland. The drugs used to treat parkinsonism are also known to cause dry eye. There could also be immunological causes for your parkinsonism, the same causative factors could also be causing dry eye. Secondly, you could be having a long-standing infection on your eyelids and eyelashes, this usually causes an itchy sensation making you rub your eyes and is mostly worse during the early morning. Here the infection causes the tear glands in your eyelids to get blocked and all their tear secretions are pent up within the eyelids. Although there is not much more to do with parkinsonism and its treatment, eyelash infection is still a treatable disease. For this: 1. Wash your eyelids with warm water or give hot fomentation for around 10 minutes every day. 2. Massage your eyelids in a circular pattern after hot fomentation so that all the pent up secretions get released. 3. Avoid dusty, windy, sunny environments, use sunglasses while going out. 4. Consciously make an effort to blink more, this activates your lacrimal pump and also forces more secretions out of your eyelids."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

I feel no doctor understands what is wrong with me. I have had epilepsy since around puberty around the age of 12 when I got my period. I had a lot of seizures until I was finally controlled on Tegratol 200 mg. Throughout my teenage years, they decreased. When I married and got pregnant, my doctor lowered my dose to one pill 200 mg only at night. This was because I had no seizures for at least six months. Then I had no seizures for five years. Now I am 24, suddenly I had three seizures in one day. I was taken to the hospital and given a Magnesium injection. This was two months after giving birth and not getting periods back due to breastfeeding. I made myself sick fearing to eat anything or stress myself as I never knew what triggered it. I visited a neurologist, he said my dose is too low. He said to take 200 mg at night and 300 mg at night because I mainly get seizures when I am awake. Anyways through all of this, I get symptoms of seizures throughout the afternoon and night and when I wake up. So I get a lot of auras but no seizures. I have had this problem since I have had epilepsy. How would I get rid of these auras? My doctor seems to be confused and says it is just anxiety but I know what I am feeling. And it is the same feeling before my seizures (electric shock feeling in my right thumb). He wanted to put me on Xanax. Do I need this much medication? When I used to have seizures I would have only one in a day but after having three in one day, I got worried. I have had multiple ECG and MRI and they never found anything. Please, if you can help me. I am sick of living life in fear. What would you advise me to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that the aura that you explain (electric shock feeling in the thumb) are not typical of epilepsy. So, considering the fact that you have been on 200 mg of Tegretol (which is a really non-effective dose) with no seizures, I do not think that these auras are related to the seizures. Besides all your repeated EEG are normal (which would not result in case of frequent seizures). They seem to be just anxiety, especially after giving birth (depression and anxiety are quite common after giving birth). For this reason, I agree with your doctor on the recommendation of trying Alprazolam. It is fine to increase the Tegretol dose to 600 mg daily. It can help against anxiety too. I would also recommend checking Tegretol (Carbamazepine) plasma levels in order to make the proper adjustments to the dose based on its plasma levels. If Alprazolam helps, I would recommend adding low dose Sertraline or Fluvoxamine to your therapy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 16 weeks pregnant and 4.3 internal OS closed but diagnosed with a low lying placenta.

It would be better if you would send me a detailed history and scan report. The placenta is still in developing stage that will grow and might change its position. For now, till it is low lying if within 2 cm of an internal OS then better to have rest and precautions. Avoid taking risky two-wheeler ride, over-exertion, weight lifting, stairs, sex or any other bleeding stimulating factor. Recheck placental location after a month and discuss with your obstetrician. Have regular antenatal follow-ups and scans. Have complete treatment of any health issue you have. Have a balanced diet. Report symptoms like spotting and bleeding immediately to treating obstetrician. Make sure your blood group is already checked. If negative, better to have the husband's blood group also checked.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Some days I only take one tablet, but never more than two tablets in a 24 hour period. Is this safe and fine to do? I was just wondering because someone told me that the Excedrin with Citalopram could cause internal bleeding and I never knew that and just want to know if that is correct or not? Current medications: Citalopram 20 mg, Excedrin as needed, Vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily, prenatal Vitamin, Proair inhaler as needed.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and agree with you on the fact that both Citalopram and Excedrin increase the risk of bleeding. But the main problem is that taking Excedrin so frequently may lead to drug-induced daily headaches. From the other hand, Citalopram does not seem to be really effective in preventing headaches. For this reason, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of switching to another medication for the prevention of headaches. In this regard, I would recommend switching to low dose Amitriptyline. I would like to know more about the description of your headaches in order to be able to suggest more treatment options."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had a migraine for seven days.

Currently, I am taking Adderall XR 15 mg, Celexa 20 mg, and Lamictal 100 15 mg per day. I have a history associated with depression, anxiety and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Unfortunately, I am one of those who risk losing my job and going into a bad depression if I try to get off. There is really not much data of risks on therapeutic levels, only abuse. I am seeing my doctor (OB) next week but would really like a pharmacologist opinion. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Tablet Adderall (combination of Dextroamphetamine and Amphetamine) affects a grown persons heart rate but you are already taking in a very low dose of 15 mg per day and usually it is prescribed in a dosage of 20-28 mg per day. Tablet Celexa (Citalopram) falls under \\"category C\\" which means these drugs are harmful to animal fetus but there are insufficient studies to prove there harmful effects on the human fetus. I would suggest you continue with your tablet Adderall 15mg per day, tablet Celexa 20 mg a day and tablet Lamotrigine (Lamictal) 100 mg which falls under \\"category c\\" in normal preparation and in \\"category D \\" in extended-release preparations. Just try half tablets of each drug for three times in two days in that way you will reduce 1/4 dosage of the drug. Be relaxed and cool in choosing any of the above options because that will affect your fetus more than any of the drug. Congrats on conceiving. Be a confident mother. Take half tablets of each drug twice a day on day one and half tablets of each drug once a day and then repeat until your next appointment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have bipolar 1.

The doctor is not available and the suicide hotline was no help, she did not know anything about bipolar. I take Latuda, Wellbutrin, Seroquel. Ativan and Atarax for anxiety. I was fine 2 to 3 hours ago. Now every time my son asks me a question I feel like screaming, so I am hiding in my room. I do not want to scare him. I do not know what to do. I have never felt like this, having so many thoughts so suddenly and without warning.","Doctor":"Hi. These symptoms are probably due to drugs side-effects called akathisia which includes almost all the symptoms you mentioned. This can occur without any warning and also change in any drug dose or schedule. Take Ativan one tablet (1 or 2 mg) now and can be repeated after one hour if symptoms persist. Propranolol is also helpful but you cannot get it without a prescription. If you have fever also then you need to rush to the emergency room."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, A few days back, a brown spot appeared halfway on my thigh. By the same night, it grew and it was black. In less than 24 hours. Small brown spot turned black and grew in just a few hours. It is flat. I am writing this a week later. The edges are flaky now. It has a slightly rough texture but the edges are peeling in not picking it. Do you think it could be melanoma? I am brown in complexion but had an aunt who died of skin cancer.","Doctor":"Hello. The bigger brown patch is cafe-au-lait macule and the small one is probably an atypical nevus (attachment removed to protect patient identity). That is not melanoma clinically to me. Melanoma is very rare at a young age like in your case and obviously very rare in brown skin color. You are doing good that you are doing skin biopsy for tissue diagnosis so that no confusion is left but it is less likely to be melanoma."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 41-year-old woman with low iron (just above being clinically anemic). I have always eaten lots of wild red meat (moose, bison, caribou, dall sheep) and I do not seem to be absorbing enough iron. I have been taking 300 mg elemental iron supplement per day for seven months with minimal improvement. I have cut back my dairy intake and started taking 150 mg Iron with 1000 mg Vitamin C with no noticeable change. I had a minera IUD put in six months back and the spotting finally stopped, but I still do not feel better. If I miss taking Iron for a day, I am dragging the next day and the brain fog comes back. I have restless legs, broken ridged nails and my hair is falling out. Is there other ways I can increase absorption? Other options for increasing my iron?","Doctor":"Hello. You have taken treatment for iron deficiency for seven months. It is enough time to raise your hemoglobin level and iron level. So now you have to check your hemoglobin level, serum ferritin level and TIBC level to rule out iron deficiency anemia. If these values are altered and iron deficiency anemia present than you should consider iron deficiency anemia as a cause for the brittle and broken nail. The different causes for iron deficiency anemia include chronic blood loss, impaired gastric absorption for which endoscopy is done to look for any ulcer if present, parasite infestation for which stool routine micro examination is done. As per my opinion, you need to consult the nearby physician for your detailed physical examination. For primary workup, you can investigate with an iron profile, routine CBC, serum TSH estimation, serum ANA estimation, and micronutrients estimation. According to the cause, specific treatment is given. Do not try self-treatment with Iron tablets."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had a cesarean 4.5 years back, after which I developed a sinus tract in the left lower abdominal wall (which was stated to be tubercular (though there was no discharge). Took ATT twice but when repeated USG was conducted, it stated the problem as panniculitis. An MRI revealed adhesions and b/l sacroiliitis. Saaz 500 mg and Pregabalin was given, but not availed much relief. I had a history of bronchial asthma for the past eight years and somewhere I felt Saaz did not suit me and increases my asthma problem. What should I do? If I do not take Saaz it increases my back problem a lot and overall tiredness and if I take I feel breathless.Got a recent ultrasound done. Can you please check and see if TB is still persisting or is it panniculitis? Completely tired of this diagnostic dilemma. Please help. I will be grateful. I am attaching all my reports of the past five years. I have bronchial asthma since last eight years. Viral keratitis in right eye post eye lasik surgery. LSCS four years back. Herpes zoster right arm three years back. I have dry eyes for which I am taking Systane Ultra, Flomax ointment and sometimes Cycloiimune 0.5 drops. For asthma, Budamate inhaler and Alerfix total. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. I will try to help you as much as possible. A few questions first: 1. Was there any tissue biopsy done for the abdomen wall or the panniculitis lesion? If yes, please share its details. 2. Did you have symptoms of low backache and early morning stiffness, and pain in any other joints? 3. Did you have any family history of arthritis? 4. Do you take anti-inflammatory medicines in addition to Saaz for pain? Now coming to your queries: USG and MRI reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are suggestive of abdomen wall panniculitis, which is a chronic inflammatory condition and is mostly caused by some autoimmune process. In your case, the associated sacroiliitis may point towards the presence of spondyloarthropathy. Tuberculosis is unlikely, as it would have resolved after ATT. Bronchial asthma diagnosis needs to be worked up in order to rule out other autoimmune associations like ILD. I would like to suggest the following, if not already done: 1. HLA B27, RF, and anti-CCP. 2. ANA by immunofluorescence. 3. ENA profile. 4. ANCA (MPO and PR3 by ELISA). 5. ESR (WG) and CRP. 6. Pulmonary function tests, and X-ray chest. 7. Tissue biopsy from the abdomen and its histopathology examination. If you are finding it difficult to tolerate Saaz (Sulfasalazine), then, other drugs like Methotrexate (MTX) may be tried, but only after ruling out the possibility of ILD. MTX would also be helpful in panniculitis. for more severe pain, NSAIDs or low dose Corticosteroids may be added for short term. But it is important to establish a final definitive or most probable diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Just wanted to know that from last two times, whenever I get my periods I get this cold sores and rashes like allergy happens on the linings of my lips.

I wonder why this is happening from the last two times. It never happened earlier. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The allergic rashes if they are occurring specifically during menses and the only line the vaginal lips then the cause is unlikely to be menses per se but rather the material of the sanitary pads that you are using from day one. If you have changed the brand of the sanitary pad lately then please revert back to the earlier one and in the meantime, you may apply ointment Candid-B locally over the labia minora and majora over the rashes thrice a day and try to keep the local area dry as much as possible. Also change pads every 3 to 4 hours, again depending on the bleeding.

As per pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I noticed the fall was really bad. The wound seems infected. Taking into account your personal history of diabetes, it might take longer for the wound to heal.  First, take good care of the wound. Wash with antiseptic soap or if you cannot find just use the soap as usual with warm water. Try to clean well to remove the hard parts. But do it gently. Might need more seances to get fully removed not at first time. Rinse well, pat dry well. Apply Betadine you find over-the-counter. Then apply triple antibiotic ointment two times a day for one week. Raise your leg. Apply cold compresses during the day away from the antibiotic ointment.

Thirty years later, I am now 72 and wonder if the condition has likely progressed and/or if surgical correction is still possible or advisable. I have good hearing in my right ear. I recently had a wax impaction in the right significantly reducing hearing and it got me thinking perhaps I should have had the surgery.","Doctor":"Hello. Otosclerosis often causes mixed hearing loss and can cause a maximum hearing loss of 60 to 70 db hearing loss which can be serviced to a good degree by doing stapedotomy. However, aging often causes presbyacusis that is an age-induced hearing loss which is neural and not salvageable by surgery. Since stapedotomy is a procedure done under local anesthesia, it may be still considered. However, it is possible if there is no significant SNHL (sensorineural hearing loss)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a headache in my upper part of the head. I do not know if it is connected with my neck because I had stiff neck due to my sleeping position. Well I lay down to bed most of the time due to quarantine and after I had that stiff neck I had this. It is not actually a headache, I guess it is like irritation in my upper head. I do not know if it should be treated with a pain reliever. As it is not that severe I did not take it.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. I understand your concern. I need to know more about your headache. How and when does it start? Is it unilateral or both sides? Is it intermittent or continuous or any diurnal variation? Any aggravating or relieving factors? Light or noise sensitivity? Does it associate with nausea, vomiting, or blurring of vision? Did you have a history of migraines or asthma? Any history of fever or sinusitis? You should always note the red flags of headache such as sudden onset of headache, the onset of headache after 50 years of age, increased frequency or severity of headache, new onset of headache with an underlying medical condition, headache with concomitant systemic illness (fever and weight loss), focal neurologic signs or symptoms, blurring of vision. In that case, you need urgent evaluation. If they are absent, you need not be worried. Some times neck muscle tension stiffness may lead to headaches, as in your case. Simple Paracetamol or muscle relaxant will be useful. Adjust your sleeping position, try not to use high pillows. Another most common cause of headache is migraine. Simple Paracetamol at the onset of the headache will be helpful. Also, avoid triggers that lead to a headache. You should have adequate sleep, avoid stress, and take meals on time. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

The same question, for chronic fluoride poisoning. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. In chronic mercury poisoning, it binds and stops the functions of SH (sulfhydryl-containing enzymes). It also gets deposited and causes cellular toxicity. If the toxic pathology happens in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), then the patient feels burning inflammatory sensation in the GIT. In order to cool it, he consumes more water. This concept is mentioned in Indian Traditional Siddha Literature. But, no modern study is available on this concept. It also says that even a person become psychotic. In chronic fluoride poisoning, there are no such symptoms as the fluoride target calcium sites like teeth and bones. It also has other effects in internal organs. Many geographical areas are contaminated or rich in mercury and fluoride. The groundwater (or drinking water) is rich in mercury or fluoride. The same water is used for agriculture. Thus, people tend to consume mercury and fluoride through drinking water and vegetables. Fish (from mercury-contaminated sea) consumption also leads to mercury poisoning on a chronic basis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 9 year old son has a problem with bedwetting.

Hence, the rise of LDH is due to mild persisting liver injury. Low exposure to sunlight has led to low vitamin D. I would recommend you to start taking vitamin D supplements such as Cholecalciferol 60000 units weekly once for eight weeks and try to increase your exposure to sunlight."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 25 year old female. Is there any way to effectively reduce elevated cortisol and aldosterone? But, it is not Cushing's. I just have too high cortisol for the last few years and weight loss problem.","Doctor":"Hi. There are medicines for that, but it would be a temporary solution. We need to find the cause of elevated cortisol and aldosterone. In that regard, kindly upload the tests reports. Also, let me know, are you on any birth control pills?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My eosinophils are increased to 7. It is very difficult to breathe. An effective treatment to eosinophilia may be communicated.","Doctor":"Hi. High eosinophils are found in conditions with allergic reactions. I would recommend you to please see your doctor and if your chest is congested, they would help you with antibiotics, short steroids, anti-allergic, and nebulizer. If you are asymptomatic with just mild cough, a short course of two weeks with antiallergics like a combination of Levocetirizine and Montelukast works wonders."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a severe infection on my penis head which I suspect (also confirmed by a doctor) to be Zoons balanitis. The infection has been for a year now. I am circumcised and this infection has been recurring for the past six years in the same area. The infection has eaten off whole skin on my penis head and also blocked my urinary opeing. It is so painful and burns when I pee. I have been applying a Fucibet cream for seven days now and also taking antibiotics prescribed by a Dermatologist but no improvement. I do not know what to do. I have been to various doctors including Urologists. They have done biopsy and results came back negative on cancer cells. I have tested positive for herpes and MRSA. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Can you send a picture of your lesion for proper diagnosis and treatment? Please avoid application of steroids over the area. It is good that you are circumcised."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My family doctor referred me to an ENT to investigate a persistent sinus discharge problem that seemed to be causing voice hoarseness, likely from mucus building up in my throat. I thought the hoarseness might be a side effect of the Tamsulosin I take each day for BPH, but he did not think so. During the exam by the ENT, he found that my nostrils were almost completely blocked. Although I had not complained of problems breathing through my nose, so air could get through, his scope with the light and camera on the end could only be inserted part way through either nostril. As a result, I am being scheduled for (endoscopic?) surgery to reconstruct the separation between my nostrils and clear the airways through my nose. Apparently, it will take about 30 minutes and will not leave scars or require any packing or lengthy recovery time (just a few days). The ENT thinks that will clear up the nasal discharge and ultimately solve the hoarseness. Does this sound reasonable?","Doctor":"Hi. Have you had any complaints with nose before? Has a CT scan been done to check for sinus inflammation or pathology? How much is the nasal airway compromise? Has he given you any sprays? Has he ruled out allergy?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I shall be highly thankful to you.","Doctor":"Hello. The main symptoms of allergy include itching and redness as you mentioned. Festive D drops will be more than enough to treat any eye allergy. Festive D can be used four times a day for 4 to 5 days. On the other hand, if you are having lots of sticky discharge from your eye, especially if your eyes stick together when you wake up after sleep, it suggests that there is an infection. In the latter case, seeing an ophthalmologist is best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 53-year-old male. My symptoms began about three months ago and include the following: Numbness and burning at the base of the neck. Shooting pains and stingers in the upper back and near shoulder blades. Soreness in shoulders. Muscle twitching that comes and goes particularly in hands, fingers eyelids and ankles almost all at rest. Body temperature regulation issues causing damp collar of my T-shirt after waking from sleep and now some anhydrosis on exertion because I did notice I do not seem to be sweating and I feel like I am overheating after some exertion. Foggy head feeling, especially in the morning. Dry throat upon waking up and sometimes during the day that will not go away. Frequent urination some days that sends me to the bathroom every hour to an hour and a half. Tests my internist has conducted in the last month to investigate my symptoms: MRI of my cervical spine that showed some bulging discs but nothing significant. CAT scan of my neck to look at lymph nodes and all was normal. Chest X-ray which was normal. Blood work which showed all normal except vitamin D which was low. I am now taking a supplement. I am obviously very scared that I am developing MND such as Parkinsons or MSA.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to low vitamin D levels. Anyway, I would also recommend performing further tests if you have not already performed yet: 1. Thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction. 2. Vitamin B12 levels for the possible deficiency. Nerve conduction studies would help investigate for neuropathy or motor neuron disease. Regarding Parkinson's, a DAT scan would help investigate for this disorder.

Please help because I really hate waiting for two months just to be seen again.","Doctor":"Hi. The left tonsil seems mildly hypertrophied and unhealthy. But it does not have any active infection. Can you take a picture with both tonsils in view? Tonsils are normal structures and unless one is much bigger than the other we usually do not suspect anything. Do you have any symptoms with tonsils? Is there a post nasal drip or throat pain or soreness or foreign body sensation in the throat?  The tonsils inside the nose or at the back of nose are called nasopharyngeal tonsils or the adenoids which usually regress by 10 years of age but in some, they remain. How old are you? What appliances are you wearing or using for jaw bone correction? Can you take a picture and send?  The tonsillar biopsy is not as simple as biopsies at other locations. We do it under general anesthesia and we remove the entire tonsil. This is done at a particular position and probably your jaw condition does not let that position to be made on you.

The dentist said I might be allergic to calcium hydroxide and then she said it could be an infection. I am not sure what is happening. Kindly help. Pain is unbearable.","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question I can understand your concern. The pain may be because of post RCT infection or because of the accessory canal in the root that becomes sometimes difficult to manage. In case it in infection you need to take antibiotics and that will help you. If you had antibiotics and pain still persist, please let me know about the name of antibiotics because you may be resistant to it. You can also upload the pictures of X-ray done during root canal treatment so that I can tell you, if RCT is done properly or not.

It looks like a white blister around the extraction site. My dentist will not listen to me and the pain I am in. Is it something I should worry about? It is causing pain too.","Doctor":"Hello. Your swollen gum and white blister on extraction site can be a canker sore (small and shallow ulcer) which can be treated with medicine and oral hygiene. This could have happened due to improper oral hygiene and using some pointed object (toothpick, etc.) to the extraction site. Grave disease supports mouth ulcer as well. This can also be a dry socket (open socket in gum) because of major trauma during extraction. Dry socket may lead to swollen gum and pain at the extraction site. In a few of the studies, we have seen that hypothyroidism also reduces the rate of wound healing. You are already taking Motrin 800 for pain management, please share the dosage. Alternatively, you can take Naproxen which is an extended-release tablet can help you to subside pain for a longer duration. You are also suggested to take semi-solid food, do not chew from the left side and brush carefully. Gargle with warm salt water.

I was wondering how I can prevent this; am I running incorrectly, are my calves tight, etc.","Doctor":"Hello. As you mentioned about the calf muscle pain, this should be related to the footwear you been using. Are you having a flat foot? Also, what type of shoe you are using. As any shoe being used in sports should be flexible and also should be having good material. The harder the shoe sole the harder the pain can be due to quick impact. I would like to know if you have a flat foot or any ligament sprain in the past which went unnoticed and untreated. For now, as you mentioned the pain in the calf, I will advise you to do balance board training which should activate the muscles of the lower limbs and do correction of the muscle imbalances. A good sports rehabilitation should give maximum output in the game. Also, consume more fluids to avoid fluid loss and leading to fatigue induced pain. Try doing balance board training and let me know after 10 days how the pain is. Sports injury.  Ligament injury. Muscle weakness.

As you have very well explained your symptoms, I am so thankful to you. I would have appreciated if MRl image too available. Scoliosis can give rise to spasm of paraspinal muscles of the affected area, and in your case neck, this explains your neck stiffness. Does trembling of head on bending correspond with your pulse? If yes, then it is a normal phenomenon. If no, then during pain and stiffness there is reduced strength of muscles which sometimes leading to trembling. Your condition improves with rest and worsens with exertion, clearly implying mechanical cause to your symptoms. Shortness of breath on bending neck forward is not a routine orthopedic symptom. Do you have any swelling in the neck? Do you have any cardiac or heart condition or chest disease? Your condition is not life-threatening You need a course of muscle relaxant with painkillers. Take rest for some time along with physiotherapy and once the pain subsides, start with isometric cervical exercises to strengthen neck muscles. Change your postural habit of sitting while at work and while relaxing. These changes in your lifestyle will help you immensely. The degree of scoliosis, its progression, pressure on cord or nerve roots and the current level of your symptoms will define the need for surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 53 years old and have been gaining weight steadily even though I eat fairly small portions and very healthy.

It looks like erysipelas, that is called the superficial skin infection. It would be helpful if you have had any recent laboratory investigations, complete blood count analysis ESR CRP that would be very helpful. I will advise you to apply Mupirocin ointment twice daily on the nipple so that will control the current infection from spreading anywhere. For pain, take Tylenol. If you need any further information, please write me back and at the same time I would also like to know about your medical history and surgical history.

I started having a sharp pain in my right arm shoulder which probably originates from the right back of my chest. Also, my bowel movements have not been clear since some time. I took a Pantoprazole with Domperidone, guessing that this might be due to gas.","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like a simple musculoskeletal pain and then you have been taking this Pantoprazole and Domperidone medicines and that could give some symptomatic relief but this looks like a musculoskeletal pain. Maybe you could have tried taking some muscle relaxant like Myoril (Thiocolchicoside) 8 milligram twice daily for three days.

What can be the cause of that?","Doctor":"Hello. A burning sensation is the chief complaint of patients with dry eyes. The causes of dry eye are several in number and ICL surgery by itself rarely causes dry eye. Although there are innumerable causes of dry eyes, the treatment is purely based on the severity of symptoms and usually starts with carboxymethylcellulose acetate 0.5 % eye drops. In case you do want to find out the exact cause of your dry eyes, you would need to get a thorough eye exam with or without eye or blood tests. In case you have any further questions, kindly send me a scanned copy of your doctors report, test reports. I will do my best to help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 35 years old and I started dieting early last year. But it seems like my weight plateaued. I have been eating a low carb diet during weekdays and on Sundays, I eat the carbs that I want to eat. I work out 3 to 4 times a week. I sometimes sleep late. I have been on this schedule for the past 10 months. So for now, I am frustrated and worried why am I not losing weight.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, eating only low carbohydrate will not help. Follow a protein-rich, low carbohydrate, a fiber-rich diet that will fulfill the purpose. Have three small meals per day with lots of water. You can cheat sometimes with healthy junks. Exercise regularly with walk in the morning, at least for 30 minutes. Have low fat or skimmed milk in the morning, with brown bread. Avoid spices. Can have vegetable soup in the evening. Chicken and vegetable salad can work. Can start pilates, which works wonder for shaping up the body. Meditation before going to bed to bring positivity in mind and calmness.

What shall I do? When should I take next Meprate dose.","Doctor":"Hello. Meprate is not the treatment for bleeding. It is a Progesterone and the dose is fixed, you cannot reduce it on your own as you would start getting withdrawal bleed once dosage is reduced, which is what has happened in your case. Once you stop Meprate, you shall again get at the bleed in next 3 to 5 days and may be heavy, as it would be a withdrawal bleed post-Progesterone intake."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female, 71 years old, hypothyroid. Question: I have an epithelial defect secondary to dry eye causing increasing blurred vision. Past three months I had an amniotic transplant but not successful followed by current tarsorrhaphy. I have been given little hope of better visual results when the sutures are removed next week. What, if any, is the next intervention here to regain visual acuity?","Doctor":"Hello. I am very sorry to hear about your condition. Usually, such a picture suggests quite a severe disease. So, there is no such clear cut fix to your problems. The main thing to understand is that dry eye which is this severe is usually caused by some secondary diseases which need to be treated first. A few other treatments which can be done in your case can be autologous serum eye drops, limbal stem cell graft, humifying goggles. Once again, as I mentioned before there is no straightforward fix. But these are a few genuine treatment measures which can be taken."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

So, I thought I was supposed to get my periods on the same date this month but did not have any sign of them. I took the homekit pregnancy test a week back and it was negative. Why are my periods late? Can I be pregnant? Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hello. With I-pill, sometimes periods gets irregular for 2 to 3 cycles. If there is any history of sexual intercourse after last month periods, then you can do blood test serum hCG. If it is negative then no chance of pregnancy at all. You can simply wait for 1 to 2 weeks for periods. Even after 1 to 2 weeks you do not get periods, then medicine can be given for withdrawal bleeding. But if bhCG is positive then pregnancy is there.

We understand your problem. The symptoms that you have told fit into generalized anxiety disorder with depressive symptoms. You had treatment in the past, and you were better with that. This time because of your pregnancy, things are not that straightforward. Still in my opinion, after evaluating risk and benefit, you should have both medications and psychotherapy. Initially, you can try tablet Clonazepam (Clonotril 0.25 mg twice daily). It is low dose only and safer after 3 months of pregnancy. Also, you should have your thyroid function and CBC test done. You can take an appointment for sessions, in which we can have detailed evaluation and management.

I have been generally healthy my whole life other than some minor chronic conditions (IBS, sinusitis). I had a hysterectomy two years back and appendectomy four years back. I was recently diagnosed with a sliding hiatal hernia and GERD by endoscopy. I have been suffering from reflux symptoms (without realizing it was reflux) for a few years. My main symptoms were inner ear pain or dizziness, sore throat, chronic cough. It was my ENT who discovered the acid in my esophagus. I have been on a strict low FODMAPs diet customized for reflux for three weeks. I was prescribed Dexilant and started taking 30 mg first thing in the morning four days ago. (On an empty stomach, 30 minutes before food. My symptoms are worsening and now I have chest pain with shortness of breath). Question 1: My doctor told me the Dexilant would start working in two days. Is it possible that it takes longer? Is it possible it can worsen reflux symptoms? Question 2: Could the chest pain or shortness of breath be caused by acid aspirated into the lungs? If so, how is that diagnosed? I am in a lot of pain and really need symptom relief.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for that detailed history and uploaded EGD report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Reflux esophagitis does sometimes cause symptoms of inner ear pain, sore throat, and chronic cough, but it is much more common to have symptoms of choking during the night time and heartburn. You have been diagnosed on endoscopy with a 2 cm sliding hiatus hernia (which is comparatively small size), grade A (LA classification) esophagitis. The polyp from fundus is usually benign (fundic gland polyp). A few biopsies were taken from esophagus, apparently to rule out eosinophilic esophagitis together with biopsies from duodenum and stomach. I guess you are awaiting the results. To answer your questions: 1. Yes, Dexilant (Dexlansoprazole) mostly improves the symptom in two days. Dexlansoprazole will act immediately but relieving of symptoms may take some time because it depends on mucosal healing. Dexlansoprazole can cause minor side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, etc. You should continue Gaviscon for a few more days. Avoid liquid diet, take more solids or semisolids, do not go immediately to bed after food, keep head end little elevated. 2. Esophagitis and reflux can cause breathing difficulty, but it happens usually if the symptoms have been persisting for a very long time and have been left unaddressed, so as of now I do not think you have any significant lung issues other than the probable occasional reflux of gastric content causing some symptoms. To improve your current symptoms, my suggestion would be to add Gaviscon tablets after every major meal for a week, simultaneously continuing with your Dexilant, which I believe you are taking 30 minutes before breakfast. The other lifestyle modification advice would be to restrict coffee and tea to 2 to 3 small sized cups for a couple of weeks, to not lie down at least for two hours after a major meal. Avoid wearing very tight fitting trousers or belts over the abdomen. Elevate the head end of the cot (or there are a special type of pillows which has a slant) by at least 6 to 8 inches. Avoid citrus fruits and sour food for a few weeks. Restrict smoking and alcohol."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have undergone preventive blood test. There is abnormality in cholesterol level.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

For the last week I have been experiencing something different which can be best described as random pressure or light pain almost behind both the ear lobes, sometimes the feeling is localized just there other times it travels towards the neck, occasionally towards the mastoid bone or it extends towards the lower jawline. I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body. Very rarely I feel this pressure going upwards to the ear and even more rarely a sudden pain arises inside the ear too but I hear no ringing or sounds. The weirdest thing is today I woke up with this sensation and I could feel heaviness behind my ears. This has come after an acute sinus infection, cough, night sweats (for which I had to take antibiotics) that hit me when I started tapering off Lyrica last month. I have had chronic sinus issues in the past too but this one was different, never had it progress to this level. I have uploaded an image of where exactly the pain or pressure originates but right now the pain or pressure is pretty spread out randomly across the neck. Can you please tell me what is going on and what could be the cause of this pain or pressure? Medicines: Although the sinus problem seems to be resolved now I am still taking Loratadine D, Xynosine nasal spray and Librax for IBS related issues.","Doctor":"Hello. Pain may be due to mastoiditis seen in chronic allergy or middle ear infection or eustachian tube block patients. Get it done CT brain or X-ray of the mastoid. Avoid cool drinks and freeze water. Use water vapor inhalation and salt water gargling thrice a day for five days. You may use Montelukast and Levocetirizine once a day for five days. If symptoms are not improved please consult your ENT specialist, he will examine and treat you accordingly. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Sometimes I see flashes of light as kind of line in the side vision. That too where more light focus is there on the walls, etc. That too if I observe clearly.","Doctor":"Hello. Such flashes of light can be seen in a number of different conditions. A retinal examination will be able to rule out the more dangerous ocular cause-retinal detachment. Usually, such flashes can be seen in posterior vitreous detachment, which is a benign age-related condition and does not require any treatment. The last possibility is of fortification spectra seen in migraine. These are usually immediately followed by a migrainous headache. To put all of this in a nutshell, in case you have any drop in vision, a sensation of multiple floating objects or non-seeing areas in your field of vision, I advise you to get a second opinion. In case you have flashes accompanied by headaches, meet with a neurologist. In case you just have flashes and no other problems, given that you have a normal retina, I suggest that you just observe your condition for a while and get back to your ophthalmologist in case of any changes in symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had taken a pill and got bleeding. I thought it was periods because I had little cramps but that bleeding was so light and it lasted for three to four days. After that I had protected sex two weeks back but to be complete sure I took another pill two days later and my periods was due a few days back and now I am not having any bleeding. That bleeding was my periods or what? And when next I am going to have my periods?","Doctor":"Hello. I-pill is emergency contraception. It should be taken not more than once or twice in a year. It has many serious side effects. Secondly, you took I-pill twice in one month would definitely create some hormonal imbalance which might take a couple of weeks to settle. It is difficult to tell whether earlier was your normal menses or withdrawal bleeding. Chances of pregnancy cannot be excluded without a blood test, you need to do a blood test to rule out pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Absolutely nothing is wrong with my baby. We went to the hospital and nothing is wrong. It is just that she is seven months and she has been eating foods. So now she does not like how her formula taste. We have tried every brand and every kind of formula and she just does not want it any more. What is something else that I could give her?","Doctor":"Hello. I just got your concern. Relax. I am here to help you. Follow advice. Just give her some time to accept the taste of the new formula. Do not rush to introduce many things at a time. By offering multiple tastes at the time you are confusing her so she is frustrated. Give one taste or formula at a time and try it at least a week. Meanwhile, you continue breastfeeding. Do not force her to feed. Offer her just twice or thrice. If she does not want then fine. Wait for her appetite. Give her when she asks. Monitor her growth and development. During weaning time consult your GP if he prescribes some Iron, Multivitamin syrup to bridge the nutritional gap."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, When I was using Q-tips to clean my ears, I slipped and I may have gone a little too deep with one. I felt a little discomfort in my ear. That was three days ago and I still feel a little weird in that area. Could I have ruptured or punctured my eardrum? Is it important to go to an ear doctor immediately?","Doctor":"Hi. For further information consult an audiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an injury to my eyes seven months back. I got metal shavings in both and had to remove and left scars on my retina. Since then everything is blurry and went to the eye doctor last month. My prescription has not changed. They say I have dry eye and starting of cataracts. Can the injury be a result of those things? I did not have a problem before.","Doctor":"Hi. Blurred vision may be due to a corneal problem, cataract or retinal scars. After trauma, all these complications can occur. Dry eyes will improve with artificial tears and cornea will get normal. But any corneal scar or opacity will remain and can hinder in vision. Cataract may be age-related or due to trauma. So if it is visually significant it is treated by surgical removal and intraocular lens implantation and your doctor will guide you when it needs to remove. The retinal scar can cause decrease vision significantly if they involve a central part of the retina called macula responsible for sharpest vision. But we can do much to treat retinal scars. So things to do are treat dry eyes and cataract (if surgery needed). I would suggest you visit your eye doctor and he will guide you accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The top skin of my penis is not coming back while masturbation or sex. It is not fully closed from the top but still, it is painful to push it back. If I try it forcefully then after some hours, it gets swollen from the top and some white hard substance comes from inside.","Doctor":"Hi. The white hard substance is actually the cause of the problem. It is called smegma and is formed of dead cells, bacteria and secretions. It collects under the foreskin if you do not keep good genital hygiene. You should daily retract your foreskin and wash it thoroughly. If you do not do it, the smegma will keep on collecting and cause inflammation and fibrosis of the foreskin and as a result, it becomes inflexible and inelastic. Now you should better get rid of the foreskin by surgically removing it. That will not only keep your penis clean but also reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and cancer of the penis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter was born a week back. Upon leaving the hospital her jaundice levels were at 10.2. The follow-up appointment was yesterday and after doing a bilirubin test it went up to 11.2. The doctor stated I should start supplementing with formula as I am breastfeeding. However, she was having 6 to 8 diapers a day with breastfeeding. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hello. You need to check the weight of the child and the hydration status of the child to comment on the reason for icterus. Also the blood group of the baby and mother should be known along with G6PD status. Another important factor that comes to play is breast milk jaundice which may be caused due to breast milk itself in some children. All the above problems (except the G6PD, blood group mismatch) are tackled easily without any issues when top feeds are given (temporarily). Hence, the doctor may have advised you for top feeds."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 41-year-old female, 143 lbs. I currently take Lisdexamfetamine 50 mg for ADHD. I have been experiencing bladder discomfort off and on for three months now. It was quite intense for two weeks, then went away for several weeks, and now is present again although less intense. It just feels like I have a tight bladder all the time and need to use the toilet more often. There is no pain or difficulty when urinating. I have had two negative UTI tests and a normal ultrasound. I have had a completely normal cervical exam as well. I have been taking Dexamfetamine since last six months, and the symptoms arose two months later. I am wondering if the medication is causing bladder irritation, or tightening, or if the medication is turning my urine more acidic and that is the problem? It has been suggested that I use an alkalizing agent, but that seems to be contraindicated with the Lisdexamfetamine. I also have learned that Amphetamine products can liberate Histamine, and that might cause bladder irritation? Can you advise what might be the issue if the medication is contributing and how I might best address it? I do not have a better option for ADHD treatment and would like to deal with this symptom rather than change my medication.","Doctor":"Hi. If you are having increased frequency of urination, night-time frequency, the urgency of urination, it may be an overactive bladder. It can occur spontaneously or be precipitated by UTI episodes, stone disease, medications, etc. In your case, the medicine may not be responsible. But anyway, we cannot change the medicine. You need to restrict your fluid intake to about 2 to 2.5 liters per day, limit intake of carbonated beverages, coke, tea, coffee. You have to avoid constipation. You may also get a urine test done for sugar to rule out diabetes. If frequency persists, you may take an anticholinergic like Tolterodine or Darifenacin after consulting your doctor. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 37 years old man. As per an ultrasound report, some problems are traced. A thickened spermatic code on both sides. Trace hydrocele on both sides.

I will be happy to help you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

From all these available information what I can say is that if he is active, playful, and eating well then just do not worry. Some toddlers have such kind of problems. If he continues to do so then will do stool routine report if anything is there.  Give him home food only, monitor his weight.

It is a very rare chance that your son has it but watch for some symptoms like persistent vomiting, seizure (fits), extremely irritability, prolonged sleeping, abnormal behavior or if you feel that he is not looking normal then rush to the nearest medical facility.

I pulled out way before I ejaculation. The day before she said that she was in her period. She also said that she does take the pill but it is only for her breakouts on her face. And I do not know if this matters but I do masturbate a lot like at least every day. So what is the likelyhood that she is pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. The fact that she had her menses the day before the episode, so the chances of pregnancy are minimal. However, unprotected intercourse can often allow even the precum to cause pregnancy in spite of having ejaculated outside as it is known to contain live active sperms. So the chances of her being pregnant would have been good if she would not have menstruated or if she would have just spotted. The earliest and the best way to rule out pregnancy would be to get a serum beta hCG test done after eight days post intercourse. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU then she is surely not pregnant and her bleed is definitely that of her menses. I hope I have answered your query."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I went for a trip. There I had naked body to body massage along with blow job using condom and even touched the private parts. But, we did not involve in intercourse. Later, I kissed and had intercourse using condom, but with a different girl. Yesterday, my doctor forcefully pushed my penis skin back and found a small red rash inside the foreskin. He advised me to get few tests done and prescribed tablet Doxycycline 500 mg and tablet Valvir 500 mg. What are my chances of getting STD? I felt very uncomfortable, when the doctor pushed my penis skin back. He prescribed a lotion and asked me to regularly push the penis skin back and to clean it with water and apply the lotion. I got back home and tried to do the same, but could not do so. I saw something on my penis tip that was very sensitive to touch. Is this natural? Did the doctor teared my skin tissue by pushing my penis skin back? I am having weird pain in my penis. Please help. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern.  The doctor pulled the skin back forcefully which means you has phimosis. Phimosis is a normal condition, where an individual failed to pull his penis foreskin back. If the skin was pulled back during childhood itself, it could have resulted in good retraction. Try to remove the skin or keep retracting the skin repeatedly. If you are not able to remove and retract the skin back, then I would suggest you to get a circumcision done. This will help to clean the penis with ease. As you did not have unprotected intercourse, the chance for STD (sexually transmitted diseases) is very less. The rash on penis can occur in case of urinary tract infection too. Take the antibiotics advised by your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I got a stroke but I do not know how to explain it. Twice I was bleeding along with the stroke.

An acute hemorrhage is for a short duration but very dangerous. The reason being a sudden build up of pressure in the brain. In case of chronic bleeding it is not so dangerous but it will remain for a long period. In this case there is a gradual increase of pressure in the brain. Patient goes to a doctor only when the bleeding is significant in case of stroke. I would like to have a look of your MRI brain scan to get a detailed view of your bleeding.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I saved the broken tooth piece in a cup of milk in the refrigerator. The piece is fairly small (bottom corner chipped off). What are my options to get my tooth fixed? It does not hurt but it is a little sharp to the touch.","Doctor":"Hi. That is good that you saved the part of the tooth. But actually little chipped off part of the tooth cannot be reattached to the tooth by any means. But if whole tooth and its root somehow got knocked out of socket while you fell down or so and that tooth is kept immediately under your saliva or milk and then re-implanted at the same place within one hour then this tooth definitely gets saved. But, unfortunately, its broken part is hard to re-attach. You should get filling of it done as soon as possible and get sharp edges trimmed else it will hurt your tongue or lips. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from nose block, throat pain, fever, occasional running nose, and headache. I am taking Nasaflo nasal spray and Fomtide inhaler two puffs every night. What is the drug of choice for the respiratory allergy and throat infection? Kindly help me.","Doctor":"Hello. From your history, it is obvious that you are suffering from allergic rhinitis and asthma. The current treatment you are taking is appropriate for controlling your asthma and nasal rhinitis. There is no any drug of choice for treatment of respiratory allergy. The steroids are the mainstay of treatment in any allergy. Nasoflo nasal spray (Fluticasone) and Fomtide inhaler (Formoterol and Budesonide) are good for allergic rhinitis and asthma treatment. For controlling nasal discharge, you can add any second-generation antihistamines like Levocetirizine or Fexofenadine or Desloratadine. The ultimate goal of treatment in nasal and airway allergy is to control symptoms. There is no permanent cure for any allergy. The avoidance of trigger or allergen should be given priority. So I advise continuing the same treatment for you. If the symptoms get worse in spite of treatment with inhalers, kindly take expert advice of your Pulmonologist. Thank you. Any allergen. Skin prick allergy test or blood allergy test. Nasal and inhaler steroids. Avoid known triggers."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother-in-law is suffering from muscle pain (no joint pains) with frequent urination.

He is frequently urinating but slow weight gain. Is my breastfeeding enough for him or not?","Doctor":"Hi. Frequent urination is because of more of foremilk feeding. Poor weight gain due to hindmilk deficiency. Hindmilk is rich in fat which helps in baby's weight gain. Foremilk contains more of water which makes the baby pass urine frequently. Your feeding has to be assessed. You should feed for at least 15 to 20 minutes. You should put her on next breast only if the first breast completely empties. Follow this advice and recheck weight after one week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. Height 5'10\\", weight 55 kg.

You are suffering from constipation that can go away by eating healthy foods which are rich in fiber, such as leafy vegetables, raw fruits, and vegetables, nuts like almond and coconut also. Drink more water than usual so that your body gets enough water. If you are hydrated, your stool will not be hard and pass easily. That will help in healing the injury also.

Since, eight years, I am taking tablet Metolar 50 mg for BP. I consulted my doctor, he asked me to get ECG, ECHO and also thyroid tests. I even got lipid profile, kidney and liver function tests done and all the tests came normal. Though, all my tests are normal, I still feel some discomfort. I am very much concerned. When I got a regular check up of my BP it was 130/70, pulse was 65, LDL was 103, HDL was 57 and triglycerides was 65. Now my doctor has asked me to take BP tablet regularly. Kindly advice. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I have worked through your query and understand your health issues. I assure you not to worry. With all the normal laboratory reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) palpitations in the morning and evenings may be due to anxiety. Anxiety is considered to be the biggest cause of palpitations. I suggest you to consult a cardiologist and get a complete physical examination done. He will insist you to take an EKG (electrocardiogram) and run few tests accordingly. Some of the causes of tachycardia and palpitations are: There are chances that after all the cardiac investigations, your cardiologist might change the tablet from Metolar 50 mg (Metoprolol) to tablet Atenolol."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a sickle cell trait. I was diagnosed with pcos and pmdd. I got a colonoscopy done for chronic constipation. But, the report was inconclusive. My main concern is that, my body is producing lot of male hormones. Due to which, I have a lot of facial hair and have a deep voice. On a regular basis, I have low blood sugar as well as low blood pressure, chronic fatigue, and chronic lower left abdominal pain. My periods are regular, but they are very heavy. I do have shortness of breath, muscle ache, headache, nausea and weight gain issues. Also, I am dealing with depression, mood swings, trouble to concentrate and at times insomnia. I am taking tablet Metformin. I am attaching all my reports for your reference. Please check them and guide me accordingly.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have multiple issues with your hormonal levels. I will provide some guidelines which you can proceed with: Your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is very low. This means you are overproducing thyroid hormones and having hyperthyroidism. This causes anxiety, anger, palpitations, fatigue, muscle pain, intense bleeding during periods and depression and also leads to weight loss. Treatment is carried out by using antithyroid drugs such as Neo-Mercazole (Carbimazole). The dose can only be calculated by proper examination and evaluation of the patient. It is not safe to administer this drug just by seeing a report. Your HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is 6.5. Hence, you are considered to be mildly diabetic. It can be either due to excess cortisol production or due to frank pancreas failure. After thorough evaluation, if cortisol is the cause, then we can start steroid reducing drugs. This has to be adjusted as per your body type. If overdose administered, it is dangerous. If there is frank diabetes, then you can be take small amounts of OHA (oral hypoglycemic agents) such as tablet Glimepiride or Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitor (DPP4I) or go with peroxisome proliferator-activated inhibitor (PPAR). To check why there is rise of A1C, I would suggest you to get your blood insulin levels checked. Intense bleeding and pain during your periods is mainly due to multiple fibroids. It can be treated with surgery. If you have grown up kids then you can go for removal of uterus which will give you complete relief. Else, you can go for myomectomy procedure which is cutting the fibroids. In second case, there will be relief to a large extent but cannot be cured completely. Use hormonal pills like Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) to give relief when done non surgically. But, it will not last long. The high testosterone levels, hair growth, weight gain, hoarse voice all are due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). There is no permanent cure for this problem. Depending on your examination, generally start with tablet Metformin. But it has not worked in your case. Next option is to take hormonal injections to increase follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estrogen and reduce testosterone. We can do an ovarian drilling to increase egg release along with regular exercise. When all this fails, we go for intense treatment and do an ovary removal to reduce abnormal hormone production. Since multiple hormones are involved in your case, doctor will not be able to adjust the dosage without physically examining you. I would suggest you to consult a good physician and get them treated as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 30 years old. For the past few years, I have been suffering with itching on my groin and surrounding areas. I usually use Cloritamazole dusting powder on and off. But, when the itch really increases, I use Quadriderm ointment for 1-2 days. Once the problem reduces, I stop using it. For one year, I have used one tube of the ointment and about 2-3 boxes of the powder. I have never consulted a doctor regarding this. But, now the problem has increased and I am looking for a right treatment. Since, six months, the itching has become severe on the groin, scrotum and penis. I can notice, there is a lot of flaking and chafing of the skin around it. Sometimes, I can find blood spots in that region. I have itching sensation even while sleeping. Generally, I wear loose clothing or no undergarments and spend most of the time at the comfort of AC. I have no other skin problems. Since a month, I am using pears soap and washing the area with lukewarm water twice a day. Occasionally I take tablet Allegra for itching. For last fifteen days, I am using Clocip dusting powder continuously. I am under homeopathic medicine for chronic sinusitis. But, need to take antibiotics once every 3-4 months.

I can very well understand what you are going through. I will give my best shot to treat your problem. I examined the photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and found the original fungal lesions have been converted to the present appearance because of medicine. It is a common tendency for a person to use local steroids like Quadriderm ointment to get relief quickly. This is when the problem gets complicated. My advice would be to never use such products.

I had them and they were fine. Even last year, my echo and stress were fine. I went in today for my yearly follow up and the doctor said that he wants to do a follow up echocardiogram. Because, some value on my last year echo was 58 and it is not supposed to be over 25. He said few reasons, but I did not really understand. Then he said something about checking for pulmonary hypertension. I read about that on the internet; as it is a fatal disease, I am frantic now. When I asked the nurse, she said his notes say that I have no symptoms and no other indications too. I have attached all my echo reports. Could Redux be the reason for pulmonary hypertension?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The symptom that you are suffering from is referred to as hemeralopia, this symptom can be caused due to a number of different conditions.

My physiotherapist said Ihave torn my cartilage and so, he advised me to take rest. It felt good. After 18 months, when I played football again for some half an hour, I felt the pain. So, I visited a different physiotherapist, and he advised me to go with some exercise for a 4-6 week every day. I am visiting him every week. While playing in the pool on Friday, it gave way again, and I could not straighten my legs.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for providing a brief history. As you had this injury persisting from 2 years now, I will advise getting a proper examination with the physiotherapist you been seeing for now and provide me the reports. Because the muscles must have got weaker and there will be a muscle imbalance due to which there is difficulty in straightening the leg now. I think an MRI of the knee will be helpful as in the beginning what I feel is it was left untreated and due to which it has become a chronic injury. Doing balance board training should help regain the correction of the muscle imbalance. Also, do reverse jogging and provide good core stability exercise. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most sports injury cases take up to 12 weeks which has helped them to have a good outcome score."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am considering an endoscopic bariatric stomach surgery procedure for weight loss.

Do not let water enter the ears. 3. Visit an ENT soon. 4. Assess the size of perforation. 5. Ask ENT if it will heal spontaneously. Some perforations are small and heal on their own in healthy individuals, but others do not. Regarding the pain in jaw joint and numbness, the perforation does not explain that. However, it could be that your sinus and nose problem resulted in rising of infection into the particular ear through the eustachian tube and caused a disease of the middle ear resulting in the discharge of pus through that ear eventually. In that case, the condition should heal on its own. But you need a course of antibiotic, nasal and systemic decongestant, antiallergic and painkiller."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The doctor told us to continue 4 mL for 4 hours and give a sponge bath, and if the temperature is more than 102, Meftal-P 100 mg suspension 6 mL is prescribed. Today at 10 AM it was 102.5 (it was 101.3 4 hours back ), so we gave Meftal 6 mL, and within 30 min he became active.

But, this time I have taken keratin treatment also. My hairs from the ends are damaged, frizzy and rough. Is it possible to repair them?","Doctor":"Hello. Keratin treatment is for damaged, rough and frizzy hair. You should always take keratin treatment for hairs. Take biotin supplements for proper growth and good texture of hair. Get regular trimming of hair at the ends as weathering leads to dry and frizzy ends. Avoid excessive heating procedures on hairs like straightening or dying of hair especially those that damage the hair. For now, I will suggest you do a little bit of trimming at the ends and keratin treatment will help in solving problems."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My sister is showing some strange attitude.

But, sometimes she put up strange behavior like aloud in the singing in the midnight and restless but will insist she is fine. How do I help my sister? How long does it take to cure? Does medication for depression make the patient see more than required?","Doctor":"Hi. Hearing a strange voice is a symptom of psychosis which can be a symptom of depression. Low mood, lack of interest in previously pleasurable activities and lethargy are some significant symptoms of depression. Genetic cause, a reaction in an unhealthy way to a life stressor, hormonal changes especially in females are some causes of depression. Recovery from depression varies with client symptoms. High mood and confusion can be a symptom leading to seeing of images.

I can see bubbles moving around when I concentrate at any point, it is like tiny white color dots on cornea. I am using spectacles since last few years (cylindrical power, -2(L), -1.5(R)). This dystrophy is not a big problem for now, but it creates a problem when I study or read something. It creates a headache, which distracts me while studying. Can you please suggest me a treatment either prevention through surgery or medication (any eye drop)? Please let me know if you need further details. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. Dystrophies of the cornea are divided based on the layer of cornea involved. If the dystrophy is the cause of your headache, then your dystrophy must involve the outer layers of cornea. More than frank pain, these conditions cause irritation which increases on blinking, more during early morning hours. If this is the case, then the best over-the-counter medication is Lacrigel (2% Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate). This medication is essentially a gel formulation of the drops your doctor has recommended and just like the drops, it will cause no side effects except for mild blurring soon after installation. The exact diagnosis of such dystrophies can be done by a cornea specialist. In case you need any further information, please send a very clear and magnified photo of your cornea. I will do my best to help you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am experiencing severe headaches. I have not slept in two days. I am having erratic thoughts, more so than usual which scares me a bit, to be honest. I feel like I am on the verge of a breakdown. I have had two psychotic breakdowns in the last two years. The headaches are getting worse. Initially, the pain is like a pulse and starts in any one side of my head, front, back, and either side. I am on medication prescribed by my doctors. I want to know if this might be happening because of damage to my brain or something. I have not done any scans yet, but it sure feels like there is something wrong inside my head. This feels more like a confession than a question, I know and I apologize. I need to know if my current situation is something that I should genuinely be worried about or not. Whether the things that I have described here could be signs of a breakdown and what I can do to prevent it? Thank you to anyone who reads this, and I would appreciate your advice.","Doctor":"Hi. The nature of pain you described fits into the diagnosis of vascular headache. It merely occurs due to dilation of blood vessels in the scalp and inflammation of perivascular tissues. Although it causes significant discomfort, it is a very benign illness and has nothing to do with psychosis. It gets aggravated by stress, change in weather, change in atmospheric pressure, intense sunlight, noise, etc. The treatment is simple in most of the cases. Naproxen 500 mg and Sumatriptan can terminate acute episodes. For prevention of such headaches, a combination of Propranolol and Flunarizine would be helpful. Some people respond better to Topiramate."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Instead, tickling of both breast three times a day for three to five times will help in stimulating the nipple. Also, cumin seed water daily will help. Your wife can stop all other medications given by other doctors as it can have side effects. Also, your wife should not have liver and renal impairment. Kindly get KFT (kidney function test) and LFT (liver function test) done. Also, please inform if she is taking any medications for a heart problem or any other disease to reduce side effects.

Once this happens, I go home and remove my lenses and rinse my eyes with eye drops. However, they continue to burn. They look very red, irritated and are not improving at all. What causes this? And how do I treat it? It happened probably three times in the last five months. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms which you have is usually seen in patients with dry eyes. It often presents with dryness, grittiness, irritation and burning sensation which goes down after washing the face. The best way to treat simple dry eye is to use over-the-counter lubricants, for example, Carboxymethylcellulose acetate 0.5 percent eyedrops. Also, make a conscious effort to blink more frequently. Also, give a \\"contact lens holiday\\" for a few weeks. If you cannot do without your lenses even for a few weeks, then use drops called Genteal gel (Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose) or Systane eye drops. These two can be used over contact lenses.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Your power should not change for at least a year. That is your power needs to be stable. Your corneal thickness must be adequate for the procedure. Your corneal curvature or shape must be normal.

It is good that you asked this question here because taking unnecessary antibiotics can be extremely risky and unhealthy for your body. This tablet is mainly used to treat pneumonia patients that have a severe cough, fever, and abnormal symptoms and blood reports. Hence I would advise you to avoid it at all costs for now, unless you have all of the above. Throat infection causes your symptoms and the right medication for you is TusQ (Paracetamol, Bromhexine, etc.) or Lozenges like Vicks, Honitus lozenges, whichever is available and suits you. You must understand that the main treatment for this is warm saline water gargles thrice a day and avoiding all oily food and cold foods and drinks. Take care and get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband and I will be using a surrogate to have kids. My husband is kell positive (heterozygous). What are the risks to this that the surrogate would need to be aware of?","Doctor":"Hello. Few points include: 1. As per medical facts, the first pregnancy remains silent. In your case surrogate is kell negative it means her body is still not exposed to kell antigens which are good, so this pregnancy will be safe. 2. As the husband is heterozygous, it means he has only a 50 % chance of having baby kell positive. In the rest 50 %, there is no risk of complications. So, theoretically, this pregnancy should go silent without complications. But then surrogate will be exposed to kell antigen from your husband, she should be aware of this risk which can create trouble in future pregnancies if the male is kell positive."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 years old.

She is 65 years old and seems to be healthy. Recently she was suffering ill (fever, sleepless at night, body pain, etc.) thus visited a doctor (physician). After a physical examination and studying certain blood tests (that he was suggested to test), the physician advised us to consult with a hematologist ASAP. Soon, we consulted with hematologist. He advised us to check certain tests such as protein electrophoresis and free light chain, HbA1c, LFT, USG abdomen and pelvis. He also pointed out that she may undergo bone marrow examination subject to test results. The reports are as follows. We shall see the hematologist by next week. Before meeting him, we wish to know an expert opinion about the interpretation of the test results and further course of action. HbA1c- 6.65, bilirubin- 1.5, bilirubin direct- 1, SGOT-54, SGPT-30, alkaline phosphatase 04-304, T protein- 7.1, S. albumin- 3.8, S. globulin- 3.3, calcium- 8.3, phosphorus- 3, uric acid- 6.1. USG remarks: Chronic liver parenchymal disease with PHT, no ascitesat present, other organs normal free kappa (light chain) serum– 46, free lambda (light chain) serum– 33.10, free kappa-lambda ratio– 1.39, total protein- 6.8, serum albumin– 3.7, alpha 1 globulin– 0.19, alpha2 globulin- 0.46, beta 1 globulin– 0.39, beta 2 globulin– 0.42, gamma globulin– 1.65, albumin-globulin ratio– 1.19, comments– electrophoresis shows elevated gamma globulin. No significant change in the other fractions. No M band seen. Kindly look into the above and revert with your valuable suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello. Your electrophoresis report shows increased gamma globulin level (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So your doctor might suspect plasma cell dyscrasia, especially multiple myeloma like condition. So referred you to a hematologist. But in electrophoresis report, M band is not seen which is classically seen in plasma cell dyscrasia. Moreover, Kappa to Lamba chain ratio is normal in the report. So, the chance of multiple myeloma seems to be less. But increased gamma globulin need further work up in form of CBC, serum calcium level, etc. In the case of multiple myeloma, the osteolytic bone lesion is also present. For that X-ray can be done in the suspected area. The gamma globulin increased in infection or inflammation as well. So your physical examination is necessary. Moreover, your cirrhosis with portal hypertension needs treatment in the form of beta blocker to reduce portal hypertension. The elevated bilirubin can be due to liver damage by cirrhosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 and 5'2\\" I think and I am a guy. When will I hit my growth spurt?

My mouth does not open fully. I used to chew tobacco before. So how can I get rid of the disease?","Doctor":"Hi. As per your query and presentation of symptoms of reduced mouth opening can be due to most common reason that is oral submucous fibrosis in which there is a formation of thick fibrous bands below the mucosa of cheeks and lips leading to stiffening and difficulty in mouth opening. It is a precancerous condition (although not cancer) and should be taken care of. It is commonly seen in individuals with tobacco and areca nut chewing habit. You need to consult an oral physician or a dentist and get evaluated and he can advise applying a steroid ointment in combination with Hyaluronidase containing ointment to break fibers. Intralesional injections of Steroid and Hyaluronidase can be advised to be injected after every three to four days. Anti-oxidant like Lycopene is also advised. Physiotherapy, like blowing cheeks, trying to open the mouth under pressure etc., can be demonstrated and advised to be done daily.

They are currently unsure about the exact type of disease and have asked you to get a test called the EOG (electrooculogram) done to identify the exact cause. You see, the test you had done with a few wires attached to your face while looking at lights on a white bowl in front of you (ERG), has yielded abnormal results. This puts the site of the defect in your retina, thus the possibility of it being genetic. Such a picture cannot be caused by computer use, it is usually inherited by birth. The next course of action would be to find out the exact cause, by the EOG test. Once the cause is known for sure the exact prognosis and long term outcome can be known. If unfortunately by chance it does turn out to be retinal dystrophy, the vision outcomes over a lifetime are very bad. But there is no way to predict the prognosis. There is although extensive research going on for the treatment of such diseases, given that you are still young, there is some hope that such inventions will be made in your lifetime."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I twisted my leg and got an x-ray done. The report showed fracture at the base of the 5th metatarsal bone. How to proceed with the treatment? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear about your injury. I had looked at the x-rays (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you seem to be having a pseudo-Jones fracture. Mostly, this fracture can heal without any surgical intervention. You will have to use either a walking cast or an orthopedic boot. If it is painless, then weight bearing by the cast or boot will be fine. This part does not bear any pressure. Few fractures though healed, may be associated with some amount of pain. In your case, the fracture line is entering into the cuboid-metatarsal joint. Hence, some pain may be present. I would like to have a look at the lateral view x-rays of your foot as well your knee to check for any injury associated with other tarsometatarsal joints. Pseudo-Jones fracture. 1. Walking with below knee cast or splint. 2. Walking with orthopedic boot for six weeks with weight as bearable."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 27 year old female. I was going through a lot of stress and started consuming alcohol at least 3 drinks a day. For the past 5 years, I have been suffering from acid reflux along with severe regurgitation and taking tablet Prilosec. I fell sick a month ago and taught it to be a respiratory infection and avoided my medicine. Within a matter of a few weeks, I could feel that my esophagus had burnt. I started regurgitating huge amounts of partially digested food. Some of the symptoms associated along with them are, my voice has become mildly hoarse. There is pain when I tend to shout or speak loudly. Generally, I have difficulty in swallowing. When I swallow, I get a feeling that my food gets stuck halfway itself for a few hours and often I have a dry throat. The regurgitation gets worse when talking or shouting. The regurgitation consistency is not the same always. Sometimes, it is acidic, sometimes it is clear or foamy and sometimes with the presence of mucus or food in it. For about three weeks I am taking tablet Prilosec 40 mg a day. Initially, I felt better with the medicine. But still, have pain while speaking as well as swallowing. It has not shown any improvement even with medicine. I do have constipation at times because of the medicine. I would like to know, will this medicine work for a longer duration and reduce my symptoms and make me feel better? Can you let me know, what are the chances of getting affected by Barrett's esophagus or cancer? Is the difficulty of swallowing due to stricture or esophageal spasm? Please suggest ways to manage constipation associated with medicine. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. There are many causes of reflux. Hiatus hernia is one of the conditions. It is a major concern causing lifestyle limitation. I would like to know if you are suffering from any respiratory problem. Continuous reflux can cause stricture formation and dysphasia (difficulty in speech). After a few years, it can cause Barrett's esophagus followed by esophageal cancer which can be a serious problem. Follow these guidelines to get a better result. Yes, constipation is associated with this problem. Once constipation is treated, reflux can disappear. Hoarseness of voice is due to reflux of the acid causing reflux laryngitis. It will disappear once reflux is treated. 1. Barium study of esophagus. 2. Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy. 3. Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Liver function test (LFT). 1. Take tablet Lansoprazole 40 mg twice a day before meal. 2. Take clear Lax 2 spoons twice a day for constipation. 1. Have semisolid and solid diet. 2. Sleep in semi- inclined position and elevate head end. 3. Avoid alcohol and liquids. 4.

Normal blood pressure 100-110/60-70 and pulse rate 86 to 120. Brain and cervical MRI was done recently. Brain normal and mild scoliosis at C6 and C7 vertebrae.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Your issues are all due to the scoliosis of the cervical vertebra due to which you feel the pain and stiffness in the neck. It causes misalignment and pain due to stretch and pressure on the nerves and the muscular spasms on the neck. 1. Take tablet Ibuprofen for pain. 2. Take capsule Lyrica (Pregabalin) by mouth. 3. Apply Voltaren Gel (Diclofenac Sodium gel) on the painful areas and massage gently. 4. Apply ThermaCare heatwraps on neck and shoulder. 5. Do physical therapy for the neck and yoga will be very beneficial. Avoid same position of the neck like watching television, laptop screen or mobile phone for long time to avoid sprain and muscle strains.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 45 years old and working as a senior level finance professional in a multi-partner practice owned by all of us. After going through the high levels of anxiety for several years, I consulted a psychologist who is my friend. After few months of showing little improvement, he put me on Escitalopram 10 mg. For about 2 years I took this medicine and was generally fine. When my friend moved out of the country, I shifted to a new doctor and he is a more senior person. He changed the drug to Paroxetine 25 mg which I have been on for the last nine months. I would probably say I am doing better now than before. The issue is regarding further counseling. While my friend did not feel that there is a need to continue counseling once he put me on the medicine. But, the new one seems to feel that I should resume counseling. Based on his advise, I went back to the counselor I originally saw, but somehow she seems to feel that I do not need any structured counseling. I am generally a religious person and try to follow certain regular spiritual practices like visiting a temple almost every day, reading at least a little from any scripture and do some chanting. At the same time, I still have the little odd feelings of discomfort too at times, though it does not trouble me so much like earlier. Specific cause of worry now is mostly the side effect of the long-term medication I take for anxiety, BP (Telmesartan) and for GERD (Esomeprazole). The primary concern now is that on most days I have a general feeling of boredom as though there is not anything much to do. Generally, I try to avoid associating with any new demanding assignments because I do not feel comfortable about doing things unless I am fully sure about the work. On the other side, it is also my dream to be a successful writer of fiction novels. I have finished one book, but that has not found any worthy publisher so far, which is disappointing. So, even though I have been working on my second book, I do not have too much confidence that my writing will reach anywhere. I am not a social type person and like to spend time at home. I will also confess that by nature I am known as a negative thinker, both at work and in the house. But my relationship with people are generally very cordial, because I try to lighten issues and also try my best to avoid any sort of conflict. All this leaves me with a general sense of dissatisfaction, although I am very clear that I do not want to stick my neck any further out either. Though at times, I fantasize about career and location change. I do not dare to think anything seriously, because I am sure that I will not get such a comfortable position again. But, to conclude the issue which is confusing me right now is, do I need counseling again? I am far from clear, what can I hope to achieve from therapy which I cannot get from my religious and spiritual practices? I note that online therapy is also an option on this site. Is that as effective as direct counseling?","Doctor":"Hi.  From your detailed information, I feel that you have responded to medication. All SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medications tend to over time make the person who takes them more relaxed. This could be attributed to the main task of reducing anxiety. Thus maybe a lower dose for a few months may benefit. Importantly, the absence of anxiety or motivation is more troublesome. Also, I do not think that any counseling will help you. As you are already aware and attend to the problem of not pursuing tasks to completion CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) or NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) or coach may help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I left the dentist at 3:45 after getting a big top right molar pulled. It is still bleeding at 6:30. Is that fine?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, it is normal. Sometimes it takes 24 hours to get bleeding arrested. Just take a big pack of cotton, place it in the socket, and bite it very tightly. Keep it in this position for like 2 to 3 hours. Do not check in between. After it, remove and then have some icecreams or take a cube of ice, crush it and rub over the area or put on cotton and place cotton pack again after taking medicines, meal, etc., for next 3 to 4 hours. Do not spit saliva in between but swallow it as it will be blood free as blood will be absorbed in the cotton pack, will not be taken in. Talk less. Keep it cold and take soft diet for a day. Hopefully, bleeding will stop in a day. Do not use straw for juices, get it in the glass to drink, make your facial muscles rest as much as you can. And then after 24 hours start saline water mouth rinses five times a day for two weeks. It is mandatory."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 70 years old. My blood pressure is usually normal. However, it spikes. This morning I woke up feeling nauseous, dizzy, cold feet, shaky and it is 146/86, pulse 84. Why does this happen?","Doctor":"Hello. After reviewing your medical history, I would like to explain that you need to closely monitor your blood pressure values for a couple of days (several times daily) in order to conclude on your average BP trends. It seems that an abnormally elevated high BP value may have caused your complaints. Anyway, it is necessary to discuss with your doctor on the possibility of performing a medical checkup, including a careful physical exam and some laboratory tests like complete blood count, thyroid, renal and liver function tests, fasting blood glucose level, blood electrolytes level, an ECG at rest. In case several BP values result abnormally high you may need to start an anti-hypertensive therapy. You should discuss with your attending doctor on the above-mentioned issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,For the last five months, I have had problems with my throat, left side.

Later on I did develop an infection, which cleared out with Ceftriaxone.The second ENT prescribed Azithromycin, Deflazacort and cleaning with baking soda. Felt a bit better, but feeling is still there. ENT said tissue was swollen, and true enough, I see a part unusually swollen, no pain though, just the annoying feeling. I am horribly terrified of the possibility of this being throat cancer, even if both ENT have ruled it out. Can you please check the pics and give me your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello. I do not know whether this satisfies you but there is nothing to suggest that you have any growth. It is either LPR, GERD, chronic pharyngitis due to other causes that may be causing these symptoms.

Please let me know if possible, have you been traveling recently? Do you have any fever symptoms? And do you have any difficulties in passing urine? Is your loose motion watery or stained with any blood?  The tablet you are taking is for urinary tract infection, I might suggest not to take it unless you have any difficulties in passing urine. I would like you to take these tablets:  Oral rehydration solution (one packet mixed in one liter water, kindly use it for three days minimum, until your loose motion resolves), tablet Loperamide 2 mg twice a day for three days, tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily for three days, tablet Multivitamin one tablet daily for three days only, tablet Albendazole 400 mg once daily for two days only. (One drug to be taken today and another drug after 14 days).  As you might be dehydrated a lot, please continue to drink at least three liters of water every day.

I have an Apple Watch which provides an ECG and this shows my heart is beating at regular intervals, but there is fairly regularly a single beat which is much larger. I can feel this in my stomach/chest area and feels like a heavy beat or a missed beat. I will upload a couple of PDF results to show you. You can quite clearly see when these large beats take place. I sometimes get chest pain but I usually attribute this to my stomach or anxiety, and the chest pain does not tend to accompany the heart palpitation. My main worry is it is quite regularly happening and it is one singular beat which is ‘off’. I have bad bloating which has been for the last month or two which comes and goes, but am unsure if this is related.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the results you attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are experiencing missed beats aslo known as premature ventricular contractions. They are are usually benign (harmless). Your symptoms can be worsened by drinking, caffeine, smoking or some medications. I usually do not prescribe my patients medication at first except it affects your daily activity. Firstly, avoid trigerrs like alcohol, drugs, sleeplessness, etc. Try to exercise regularly. Atleast 3 or 4 times a week. For a duration of 30 minutes. Make sure to sleep 6 to 7 hours daily at night. If your symptoms persist, you will need a Beta-Blocker medication. It acts by regulating how your heart beats. Ablation is the definite treatment of choice if all measures fail but am hopeful it will not get to that. I wish you good health.

I originally thought it all came from a back injury that caused a lot of anxiety as I have an anxiety disorder. I was even treated for a sinus infection because it has been so long since the headaches started. I am looking to see how I should go about treating this and if it is something I should be worried about.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you had a back injury, which you feel has been causing headache and neck pain. I agree with you, a back injury can lead to neck pains, which can give a feeling of a referred headache. The best way to fix this would be to see an orthopedic specialist. They will then examine you and if necessary, run tests to see if indeed the back injury is the cause of your headache. Coming to the question, could this headache and neck pain be caused by a problem in your eye, again I would say it is possible. But you would definitely be experiencing eye-related symptoms like eye redness, watering, pain, blurred vision, etc. A headache or neck pain caused due to an eye problem with no eye-related symptoms is quite a rare scenario. In my opinion, the best way to treat this headache is to find its cause which would mean seeing the orthopedic, ENT or ophthalmologist. The most common cause of headache in the patients who come to see me in my clinic is sinus disease."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He told me that everything is fine, but some kind of air obstructs the throat. Unfortunately, I lost the prescription. I have been to doctors here, but I am not satisfied. One doctor gave me gastritis medicine and it does not work. As per report my throat is fine. I do not have tonsillitis or sinus problem. But, I am keep clearing my throat. My current medication includes Rabeprazole sandoz 20 mg and Motilium 10 mg. I am in a real trouble. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. We are happy to help you. From the details you have provided regarding your symptoms and the previous consultations, I can conclude with reasonable surety that you are suffering from a condition called reflux laryngitis. This is a chronic condition characterized by symptoms like chronic throat irritation, feeling of something stuck down the throat, frequent clearing of the throat and excessive throat mucous. It is because of local production of acid. Acid is produced in the stomach to aid in digestion. The throat mucosa is not suitable to handle the acid. When such local acid production occurs or the gastric acid contents rise up the esophagus, they cause chronic irritation of mucosa and produce these symptoms. They are seen typically as inflammation of the posterior larynx in endoscopy. If you can search for your endoscopy report and share with us it will be helpful. The treatment for this condition is to take a proton pump inhibitor like Rabeprazole 40 mg or Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily, half an hour before food for about a month. Also, I advise to take a teaspoon of Mucaine gel (Aluminium hydroxide) after each meal and before bedtime at night for a week. The proton pump inhibitor prevents acid production and the gel which is a combination of antacid and local anesthetic produces relief of symptoms. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Some additional care to be taken during this treatment are, With these measures your condition will improve. But, it will be a gradual recovery. If you do not recover, then I would like to do some blood investigations to check if there is any other factor that is causing the throat issue. Also a repeat endoscopy can be advised to recheck the larynx, hypopharynx and cervical esophagus for the throat irritation.

I used to take Sildenafil Citrate but switched to Tadalafil a few months back. There are certain days when besides taking Tadalafil or Sildenafil I am unable to maintain an erection. This could be either due to low sex drive as this has become a routine chore or anxiety to conceive during ovulation so as to not miss the cycle. Under such circumstances is it recommended to take Tadalafil and Bupropion together? If Bupropion is advisable then how many hours before sex should I take it? Can I just take this tablet on days of conceiving? Do you suggest any other alternative besides Bupropion? Taking Tadalafil is giving me side effects like dry mouth and dry eyes, especially while sleeping. The side effects reduce a bit after a few days but continue up to the next cycle. Is there anything I can do to reduce the side effects?","Doctor":"Hi. First, I would like to know the frequency of intercourse and the days on which you are trying for pregnancy. I mean, do you have sex every day during those days? Once every other day?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have some questions regarding what the dermatologist told me yesterday, when I was visited with dermoscopy to check my nevi. I asked the dermatologist to focus on an atypical blue nevus (on my right arm) which has increased in size during the last nine years. He told me that the nevus pigmentation does not allow the dermoscopy to provide a conclusive diagnosis of melanoma. He adviced me to remove the mole but with no priority Now, I have some questions. 1. The fact that I have no priority means that there is a low probability that my nevus is a melanoma? Or it is due to the limitation of the instrument? 2. Would the dermoscopy have allowed to classify my nevus as a melanoma, if the nevus effectively was a metastatic melanoma? I do not know what to think.","Doctor":"Hello. Dermoscope is of different types. Some are more good than others. Using this instrument requires a lot of practice and experience. Sometimes the person performing it cannot appreciate all the features of a particular disease. In your case, the conversion of blue nevus to melanoma is very rare. On the safe side, the doctor advised you to remove it so that no confusion left. If he or she has picked up melanoma, they would immediately treat it. You should go for excision of your nevus and histopathology will reveal the exact tissue diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the last two weeks, my two wisdom teeth on the right side of my face have been coming in. The pain has been incredibly severe and is almost unbearable at this point. I have been experiencing headaches and tenderness pain in my neck, jaw, and gums. I have trouble moving my jaw and speaking at times due to the pain. My teeth have become extremely sensitive to hot or cold items, my teeth are so sore that I struggle to chew food since my molars cannot touch without resulting in an incredible amount of pain. I do not have any swelling in my jaw or neck aside from my gums. I have been taking as much Advil as is safe in a day and some CBD oil as well. However, nothing seems to be helping. I am really worried that I have an infection and how long I should wait before going to an emergency room.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand this pain. It is like erupting pressure pain caused at every 2 to 3 months interval. Since you are done with Advil (Ibuprofen) and it is not going away. Please start taking the following antibiotic regime as soon as possible. Tablet Augmentin (Amoxicillin) 625 mg twice a day, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg twice a day, tablet Brufen 400 mg three times a day. Do a course of all these medicines for 5 to 7 days. An infection will subside through it and hopefully, you will be at peace for a month. You can repeat this course every two months if condition recurs. If the pain does not subside through this course then sure go to an emergency room. Moreover, do salt water mouth rinses. Take a 1/4th teaspoon of salt in a cup of lukewarm water and do its rinses three times a day. Take mustard oil put a pinch of salt in it, make a paste and apply on swollen areas inside the mouth, at gum line before sleeping. This also helps in reducing swelling. Give me a followup after three days. Stay happy and blessed. Indeed, there comes ease after every difficulty or pain. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My vaginal opening is white in color and it itches a lot around that area. It has been like this only for the past 4 to 5 days.","Doctor":"Hello. The presence of itching over the vaginal opening with white discoloration is a possible indication of vulval candidiasis or fungal infection which can be treated with local and oral antifungals, but before starting any medicines, please get it confirmed by a local examination by your gynecologist or you may send a picture of the lesion for diagnosis and further advise."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having issues with sleeping. I am exhausted all day every day, sleep 6 to 9 hours every night and take 2 to 3 hours nap every day. I am unable to control falling asleep. I am not on any medications.","Doctor":"Hello. The reasons for sleepiness could be many. Firstly, could be related to the deficiency in vitamins in body or iron deficiency. This can be easily tested by blood tests. Secondly, hormonal changes can cause sleepiness, like low functioning thyroid gland, which can also be checked on the blood test.  Thirdly, sleep issues like sleep apnea or insomnia can cause daytime sleepiness which will require clinical assessment and sleep study. Finally, low mood or depression commonly causes sleepiness and feeling of exhaustion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have an abscess on my top left gum that is now spreading to my cheeks. I am 19. I had an abscess in the same place at 10 or other young age. Last time I went to the dentist they did not do the cleaning in the first appointment so I did not get one, but wisdom teeth removal was suggested. I have good teeth, bad gums. Also cracked my teeth when younger. So one of my two front teeth has a fake bottom (do not know if that is relevant). I do use a gel and just learned that it could be contributing.","Doctor":"Hi. Immediately start with these medicines. Tablet Augmentin 625 mg twice a day for five days, tablet Gramex 400 mg twice a day for five days, tablet Brufen 400 mg twice a day or thrice a day if the pain is severe for five days. Moreover, take some mustard oil or olive oil, put 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it. Make a paste and put it on gum line having the infection. Do it three times a day for three days. When swelling regress, put this paste on gums before sleeping. And start saline water mouth rinses. Take a 1/4th teaspoon of salt in lukewarm water and do its rinses 4 to 5 times a day for two weeks.

Like everything has a white haze light. It is pure not like fog or a dirty color. Sometimes it lasts a few minutes, other times a few seconds. Sometimes I see it, other times weeks pass without seeing it.","Doctor":"Hello. There are a number of causes which could lead to such a problem. In the eyes, macular degeneration can cause problems like a distortion of images, also called metamorphopsia and a drop in vision. Retinal detachment can cause flashes of light which come and go in an instant especially on eye movements. It also causes a drop in vision and floaters on your field of vision. The posterior vitreous detachment also causes flashes of light without a drop in vision. So, what I mean to say is eye related problems will have accompanying eye-related symptoms, other than just a white light. Coming to other causes, fortification spectra are seen in some cases of migraine and are usually described as multi-colored lights just before the patient experiences headaches. These are the most common causes which can lead to a feeling of seeing light. In case you feel like you fit into one of the above, there is no need to worry as most of these are treatable. In case you feel you do not have anything in common with the above, please let me know about your condition in further details, example what causes this light to come, is it accompanied by any physical symptoms, does it arise while you are in a certain place or while doing a specific action."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 5 years old. He has a wheezing problem from one and a half years. Recently, a pediatric pulmonologist diagnosed his condition as reactive airway disease. Currently, my son is taking Foracort 200 one puff in the morning and one puff at night. My husband and his brother both had a wheezing problem when they were children. However, wheezing disappeared after they reached eight years. The allergy test was done and the doctor said my son does not have an allergy. Primary complex test (Mantoux test) proved positive but the doctor also looked at the chest X-ray and enquired about family history (no smokers, vegetarians, non-alcoholic). So she asked us to wait. No medicines were given. Did my son inherit this from his dad side? Will his wheezing also subside after a particular age? He gets wheezing problem once a month or once in two months which settles only after nebulization even when he is on Foracort. As of now, I successfully identified one trigger that causes wheezing which is acid reflux that happens when he skips breakfast or eats late breakfast. Also, he does not pant for breath during wheeze but coughs a lot. Is this condition curable? He also gets wheezing whenever he has a throat infection. Why does he get frequent wheezing even when he has no allergy? Does he have asthma?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, your son may have inherited it from the father. Considering that the wheezing may have been inherited from the father, it should follow the same course and should go away by the age of 8 years. Even if it has not been inherited, usually this issue disappears by the age of 8 years to a maximum of 10 to 12 years. The issue and its frequency of occurrence goes on reducing with age and it eventually disappears. In a very few cases (1 % cases) the issue may persist into adulthood. The condition is not curable but it is controllable with medications till the time it goes away with age. I would advise you to use an Asthalin inhaler during such severe episodes along with the Foracort inhaler. Asthalin inhaler is to be used as Asthalin 100 mcg one puff four times a day for 3 to 5 days following a severe attack. After that you can continue the Foracort and stop the Asthalin. You can obviously use a nebulizer along with it on an SOS basis. As far as the reflux is concerned I would advise you to get it diagnosed by imaging and as per the grade, we can start medications like Lanzol 30 mg once a day before food to reduce such episodes. Please do not be depressed about this condition. It happens to 20 to 30 percent kids out there out of which most of them get rid of the condition by 5 to 6 years. So do not worry. Be happy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a crazy dog that scratched me 10 years ago.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals.

I saw a new cardiologist yesterday and my EKG results. Results said left axis deviation, LAPB, RBBB. I asked her if I have a bundle branch block and she said no because only the two heartbeats show it and the rest of the EKG was normal. I am worried whether I need a pacemaker if I have blocks now. What is she trying to say?","Doctor":"Hello. I guess you mean LAFB and not LAPB. According to you, you already have RBBB and this time the EKG strip read LAFB. Many times the EKG strips read the EKG strip wrongly. You should believe in your cardiologist as humans are needed to interpret the EKG with some specific criteria, to fit the EKG as normal or some pathology. While LAFB stands for left anterior fascicular block, there is no term such as LAPB in my knowledge. The other term is LPFB, which stands for the left posterior fascicular block. The LPFB is extremely rare and usually occurs in isolation. It would be nice if you could post the picture of your EKG so that I could give a second opinion. Also when RBBB is present in combination with the other two (either LAFB or LPFB) is called bifascicular block. If the bifascicular block is present chronically in a patient it has a relatively low risk of progression to a high degree block."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My vaginal opening is too loose without any sex.

Along those lines, what does a person typically experience after having their skull opened or a bone flap?","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that there are a lot of ways that a neurosurgeon can reach the brain: 1. Craniectomy: Trepanation and excision of the skull, which is called open surgery. 2. Endoscopy, through a device like a tube with a camera, which is called closed surgery. 3. Gala knife, which is a radiation technique, to treat brain lesions without opening the skull, but through radiation therapy. 4. Transphenoidal excision, through the nose, in case of pituitary tumors. This method avoids trepanation and uses anatomical ways through the nasal bone. 5. Endovascular catheterization to treat brain aneurysm and other vascular malformations by inserting catheters in the jugular vein, without trephination of the skull. In all these cases, the patient experiences mild pain, mainly due to the wound, which is well dominated by Ibuprofen or Tylenol. So, just like other surgery but the main thing is that brain tissue does not hurt. So, nothing tremendous happens after surgery. Recovery is quite painless, compared to other types of surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Before two years, my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer and has been undergoing treatment using Eligard and Xgeva. Early this year, he got diagnosed with vallecula carcinoma and for which he underwent chemo (Erbitux) six sittings and radiation therapy for 27 days. While vallecula seems to have subsided, he is now detected with tumor in some of the lymph nodes and for which operation has been recommended by the doctor. Also, as observed in PET scan cancer seems to be spreading to other parts as there are some areas highlighted in the lower part of the lungs.

I am feeling sensitivity and my teeth are slightly mobile. I have gum receding near about 6 mm. Can gum be again gained to its original position? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Your gum recession is not very severe. You just have to get scaling done at every 8 to 10 months time period. And for sensitivity, use Protect (Potassium Nitrate) mouthwash for sensitivity for one month twice a day. And do saltwater mouthrinses before sleeping for two weeks with lukewarm water. Sensitivity will get better then. You should also use sensitivity relieving toothpaste like Sensodyne sensitive or Colgate sensitive and put the toothpaste like cream in these six teeth and leave as it is for two minutes and then after it, do brushing. Doing all these will definitely lower down sensitivity and will promote the growth of healthy gums in this area in three weeks, provided you follow it all consistently.

Some individuals have acne prone skin in which normal follicles becomes clogged with keratin, sebum, organisms, etc., resulting in blackheads formation. When inflammation occurs blackheads convert to pimples and bigger pimples lead to cyst and nodule formation. Treatment of acne is important because it can lead to scarring if not treated early and properly. Its treatment starts with oral and topical antibiotics. For blackheads and whiteheads recommended treatment is topical Retinoid. Do you have oily skin or dry skin? I will suggest you start with antibiotics and at night time topical retinoid. Acne vulgaris. Tablet Azithromycin 250 mg BD for the first three days, then on alternate days for three weeks. Apply Clindamycin lotion over the lesions BD, apply Tretinoin gel plus cold cream at night on the whole face in small quantity. Wash face with mild soap and water. Avoid using irritants. Use sunblock SPF 60, moisturizer if skin gets dry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have shoulder pain. I was told that where my three fibers meet from my deltoid the point is inflamed or something. She told me it would heal in 4 to 6 weeks but it still bothers me when I do gymnastics. I train in gymnastics seven hours a week.","Doctor":"Hello. As you had inflammation at the junction of the meet-up of the tendon to muscles it takes usually 4 to 6 weeks of time. The doctor was right. Post which you should opt for physiotherapy for better assistance. As there is inflammation and the limb stays immobilized for 4 to 6 weeks for regular ADL it might have some sort of weakness of the shoulder girdle muscles and that need attention.  So I would advise you to do exercise which helps in stabilizing the shoulder girdle but that should be free exercise and not of any weights. Continue the same for 2 to 3 weeks and then indulge into weight bearing for 2 to 3 weeks. Post which you can start low-intensity weight training and progress gradually. There is a difference between weight bearing and weight training. Please do not misunderstand that. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most cases have been reported for similar complaints but with sports shoulder rehabilitation program they respond well. I will advise you the above program and not going straight to high-intensity activities."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was suffering from molar pain for the past two weeks and then decided to see a doctor. One of my molars decayed and I needed a root canal. But here is a thing, my tooth is very very short for a crown, it is between 1 and 2 mm in height. Is it fine to just put a post and then refill the tooth? How essential is the crown?","Doctor":"Hi. If your root canal is being in process and the crown length is very low, it is best to have post and core done on it after a final step of the root canal. This will strengthen your tooth and it will last long for like 10 years or more. If you do not get the post and core buildup on it and will go for a cap on such small crown portion the cap will be taken out in your chewing process more often and there will be a chance of breakage of tooth also that is saved through root canal treatment. So, I will advise you to get the post done. And one kind advice is that wait at least a week before your cap is placed so that you may rule out any pain or sensitivity issues of tooth in this time period, as once cap is placed and then you start feeling some sensitivity in the root canal or any symptoms of pain then cap removal will be difficult procedure. So, do not rush for the cap. Get post and core buildup done. Finish antibiotics, then take some time without medicines to see if all is fine. Then after a week or two get cap done. Stay happy and blessed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with a UTI a few days back and prescribed Cephalexin 500 mg four times a day.

I want the baby to be healthy and safe and am unsure what to do next. This is my third pregnancy and baby and this will be my third cesarean. I worry about this affecting the baby.","Doctor":"Hello. You may repeat the urinary routine microscopy test again and if the symptoms are still present, likely that you are resistant to Cephalexin and hence can be started on Nitrofurantoin 100 mg which is category B pregnancy drug and safe in pregnancy. It can be prophylactically taken daily once till delivery and then two weeks post-partum to avoid any chances of recurrent UTI during pregnancy and negating canes of preterm labor.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

When I wake up in the morning I feel pain in my lower abdomen. Also, my weight is decreasing at an alarming rate. Last year it was 68 kg and now it is only 52 kg. I had all the checkup like endoscopy, stool check, colonoscopy and all the blood test related to swelling in my intestines. Everything was normal. One doctor said it as IBS and the other said it is only swelling. But, over a year I am facing this problem. When I get nervous, my stomach gets upset and I have an urge to go for the washroom. Please help with my problem.","Doctor":"Hi. Considering your symptoms, I will also go with the diagnosis of IBS. But, my line of treatment will be based on ayurveda diagnosis. In your case, it is Vata Koshta - your digestive system afflicted by vata (increase in the gas in the intestines). Treatment for IBS will be a three-pronged approach. Follow all three religiously for best results. 1. Outside food causing infection in intestines. 2. Anxiety and nervousness. Medication: I can see that you have started some medications already. Better you go for the following medicines. 1. Bilwadi Lehyam - A semisolid preparation. Take 5 g of this 10 minutes before food twice daily. 2. Lavana-Bhaskar Churnam - A powder. Take 2 teaspoon and mix it with a glass of warm water or preferably with a glass of buttermilk and have it 10 minutes after dinner. This powder will be salty to taste. 3. Jeerakadyarishtam - A liquid preparation. 3 teaspoon of this liquid diluted with 10 teaspoon of water and take after food twice daily. You can take this after breakfast and lunch. 4. Dhanwantaram Gulika - A tablet. This medicine need not be taken regularly. You complained of nervousness causing stomach upset. In case you develop such a feeling, then pop two tablets. This will manage the problem. Before food or after food does not matter. Take these medications for 45 days and revert back. Then I will add medication for weight gain.  Exercise: 30 minutes of regular exercise is mandatory. You can pick whichever you like such as walking, yoga, playing, cycling and gym. Apart from this do 10 rounds of deep breathing exercises twice daily.  Diet: 1. Have curry leaves, fresh fruits especially citrus fruits and pomegranates are very good for you. 2. Have nutritious food and fibrous veggies like beans, carrots and all gourds are recommended. 3. Soak about 8 to 10 dry grapes or raisins overnight in water and have it the next day. 4. Try having at least 1 bowl each of fruits and vegetables daily. 1. Avoid overtly spicy food, deep fried food and stale food. 2. Stay calm. This condition is easily curable."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 26 weeks pregnant. Yesterday, I went for an ultrasound scan named targeted imaging for fetal anomalies. Other than hypoplasia of nasal bone, everything is normal. I need an expert opinion regarding advanced tests of ultrasound or amniocentesis, karyotyping or any ultrasound scan to conclude markers of Down's syndrome (DS). In case of Down's syndrome, is termination of pregnancy is a must? Is it safe to terminate at this term? What if we keep baby after conclusion of DS? Kindly help us.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) in toto. At 26 weeks period of gestation, the overall growth of the fetus is fine. But the concern here is hypoplastic nasal bone seen in the second trimester TIFFA (targeted imaging for fetal anomalies) scan. One has to understand that nasal bone hypoplasia (underdevelopment of nasal bone) have been designated as a single marker for Down's syndrome with a likelihood ratio of 81. There are other soft markers for Down's syndrome which indicate towards the likelihood namely:- Also what can be done in second-trimester screening for Down's syndrome is the quadruple screening, which is ideally done between 11-14 weeks of the period of gestation. It involves serological markers MSS2. In your case now there is only one marker present on TIFFA, but a strong marker indeed. So, amniocentesis (amniotic fluid test) is indicated under expert hands. As 26 weeks, the chances of initiating preterm labor are fairly high as the baby is already 900+ g weight. But, considering that the AFI (amniotic fluid index) is high at 20, it can be attempted. Following amniocentesis, the fetal cells so obtained can be subjected to karyotyping studies (to check chromosome count), which would be conclusive if it shows Trisomy 21 pattern on chromosomal studies. Now, presuming that the result is positive for DS, there is a legal hassle where pregnancy cannot be terminated beyond 20 weeks period of gestation as per MTP ACT (Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act). Only under special conditions where the child is either going to be harmful to the mother's health or affecting the mental status of the mother psychologically, with a legal intervention the termination can be undertaken with the opinion of two doctors plus one legal counselor. The termination would be a vaginal route and chances of the post part hemorrhage at this period of gestation are very high and can be dangerous for the mother. So ideally, we do not advise at all. Hence, we prefer regular ANC (antenatal care) visits so that any anomalies are caught early in the antenatal period. If you plan to deliver the child, it will take the course of normal pregnancy. One has to accept the fact that post birth, the child would have delayed milestones and maximum life expectancy is 17-18 years as recorded in literature. The scan undertaken has good resolution indeed, and they have undertaken a 4D scan for TIFFA. However, you may choose any diagnostic center or hospital for a scan to reconfirm the report. You may consult your gynecologist for the same. I would suggest an amniocentesis and karyotyping at the earliest."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old and soon I am going to get married. My doubts are, what are the birth control methods I can follow. What precaution should I follow for short-term and long-term birth control? May I know the difficulties which a girl face during her periods? I have no idea about that. She might be shy to express her difficulty. If I have prior knowledge, then I can trigger an indirect manner and communicate with her smoothly. During which period can I have intercourse for fertility? And when it can be avoided?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. Regarding birth control, you can use a condom or your wife can use oral contraceptive pill OCP. There are several brands having no major difference so use easily available one. These are the two best suitable for newlyweds. It can be used for both short-term and long-term. Other methods like intrauterine device and long-acting injections are more suitable after first childbirth. Regarding periods, you have the wrong ideas that it is a difficult time for them. Periods are just a normal thing. Some of them may get pain or more bleeding which is controllable by medicine. You can have premarital counseling to know everything in detail. The so-called safe period is not 100% foolproof to avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can take place at any time except during periods. But is less probable during first and last week of the monthly cycle. If you want to avoid pregnancy, then use a contraceptive. If you want to get pregnancy, then try the whole month except for the bleeding phase. There is no need to restrict your pleasure and limit your chance."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My uncle 52 years old, complains of pain in the right leg for one month.

This is typically a radicular pain which could be due to compression in the lumbar spine. There are three ways of treatment. First is medications. I am sure you have not taken the proper dose of Pregabalin. If not responding to medications, then we can give a transforaminal injection. If not responded to both, then the third option is surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have lower and upper jaw pain, toothache, pain opening the mouth and a neck ache.","Doctor":"Hi. You might have a habit of clenching your teeth very tightly, that is why you are having joint pain on opening and closing of the mouth. Your TMJ must be disrupted. For its relief, take tablet Brufen 400 mg twice a day for three days. And take any best muscle relaxant tablet like Nospa twice a day for five days. Moreover, do some hot compress at your temporomandibular joint three times a day for two weeks. Try not to yawn, eat with a spoon and try limiting your mouth opening wide as much as possible. For toothache, I need more elaborated history, minor pain will be covered through Brufen, but if a severe infection is there, it definitely needs treatment through the dentist.

I used to drink cheap Folic acid and Pregomega. I drank Pregomega up until the end of the last month. I stopped drinking the cheap Folic acid and started Inofolic on the first of last month. When I contacted my gynecologist, he said I must stop taking all medication until my eight weeks appointment. Is this fine? I stopped the Pregomega, but I am still taking Inofolic as I know how important Folic acid is for the baby's growth.","Doctor":"Hello. A pre-pregnancy Folic acid requirement is there. Actually Folic acid is best to start three months in advance before conception. As soon as the lady misses her first period, an initial base of central nervous system had already been kept as neuropores close before 28 days of the menstrual cycle even before confirming pregnancy in most of the ladies. So Folic acid is best to take three months periconceptually. In early eight weeks, Folic acid supplements are better to have. From the start, if pregnancy hemoglobin should be normal as in advanced pregnancy due to physiological changes there could be more reduction to hemoglobin so more Iron oral and dietary supplements are required. Calcium with Vitamin D is needed also in few ladies. Have a balanced diet with lots of fruits, vegetables and plenty of water. Have complete treatment of any health issue you have. Have recreational activities and quit recreational drugs. Hemoglobin needs to be maintained in the future period of pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am of 21 and I am suffering from permanent blurry eye vision in my only right one. It is by birth.

I understand that you are having blurred vision in your right eye since birth. This kind of presentation can be due to a variety of reasons, the most important being amblyopia. This is a weakness in your vision nerve and the vision centers of your brain. This diagnosis can be made after the examination of your eye and vision. In case you suffer only from a problem which is cured by wearing glasses, you have the option of getting the surgery done. In case you have amblyopia or other neurological problems, they are not corrected by glasses or surgery, that needs attention.

I was given injection Betnesol two doses 24 hours apart on yesterday and today. Please suggest me the precautions which I should take to avoid preterm labor and also suggest me diet during this term.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your query. Your report is absolutely normal. The head in the current scan is low down but at this stage, the baby keeps moving around. At present, it is down and the next moment it could be up or even in breach. So, the position of the baby is not very significant at this stage. The chances of preterm labor can be determined by the cervical length, which in your case is absolutely normal. Anything less than 3.5 cm could because of concern. Normally, it is around 2.5 cm when we say that preterm delivery is very likely. You can be assured about that. Your doctor's advice is also correct and valid, it is just that you need to take care of yourself. Do not do activities which can induce the cervix to ripen this early. For example, do not do squatting movements, avoid intercourse, avoid walking, avoid lifting a heavy load, etc. Basically should avoid movements which would further push the baby downwards. But, it is not necessary to be on total bed rest. If you repeat the scan in some time, you will notice that the baby may be in a totally different location and position."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having constant eye floaters, low back and hip pain, also my rib cage hurts.

Eye floaters are commonly associated with some issues with the visual field. So I would recommend consulting with an ophthalmologist to rule out any issues with your eyes. It can also be associated with migraine headaches. Low back pain and hip pain are common symptoms as well but I do not feel it is related to your eye floaters. I would recommend getting a few blood tests such as vitamin D, calcium levels, thyroid and vitamin B12.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She is now 52. Can you provide me with some up-to-date information or a webpage that explains the disease, its symptoms, if it goes by any other name or is a symptom of another disease, etc? I can only find some pages so far that are not very clear or shows a copy of an explanation from 45 years back. Has anything changed in the past 35 years or so in regards to the disease that we should be aware of or is it basically still the same issue it was back then?","Doctor":"Hello. I am very sorry about your wife, optic atrophy is an irreversible process and once the optic nerve has atrophied, there is nothing we can do. It is regarded as the end stage of the inflammatory process of the optic nerve called optic neuritis, optic neuropathy. Regarding the disease, you can read online about optic neuropathy, hereditary optic neuropathy, this should tell more about how the disease progresses, its inheritance patterns if it spreads to your children and how we can diagnose it early and try to prevent the progression to optic atrophy. Regarding newer advances in treatment, these are confined to optic neuropathy and no treatment currently available has been found to reverse optic atrophy. A few noteworthy and well-acclaimed treatment trails are ONTT- optic neuritis treatment trial and CHAMPS- controlled high-risk Avonex in multiple sclerosis study."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been waiting for over a year to meet with a rheumatologist in my area. I am 39 years old, and a year and a half ago I was in the best shape of my life, having 10 % body fat, working out 4 to 5 days a week. I own my company and work on a computer daily, and my hobbies include tinkering with the computer, building guns, and doing a lot of things with my hands that require fine motor skills. I have lost that ability lately, I have lost the sense of feeling in roughly my thumb and index finger. My thumbs are both swollen at the joint, all of my knuckles get red and warm, nothing I take seems to help (although I have not taken any rheumatoid medication yet). I am just getting very depressed, frustrated, and just want some sort of help on easing my symptoms and getting back to a normal life. My knees and ankles occasionally give me issues, as well as my toes swell the same as my hands. I do experience dry eyes frequently. I would like a recommendation as to what I need to tell our local rheumatologist if I ever get in to see one. I have a general practitioner that is working overtime trying to help in the meantime, but she is out of her realm on advising any treatments prior to getting into the specialist. Any advice will be greatly welcomed as I am just at a loss for how everything has changed in the last year and a half. I have taken tons of over-the-counter medicines and nothing works. I just want something to help take the inflammation away so I can be normal again.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, the possibility of inflammatory arthritis is definitely there, however that can be confirmed only when a rheumatologist examines you. The other symptoms are prolonged stiffness in your hands lasting more than half an hour, swollen knuckles and tenderness. The pain which is usually worse in the morning and better after rest. This pain usually gets better with anti-inflammatory medicines. This is confirmed by doing a rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, ESR, CRP done. I suggest do hot fomentation and mild exercises too. Make sure that levels of vitamin D are fine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just had my nose cauterized for the second time a week back and have a flight booked in two days. I am worried that it is too soon to fly as flying triggered my nose bleeds. I can change my flight to stay longer so it can heal further. Not sure. Just do not want it to start bleeding again and start the whole process over again. I am guessing that you can only be cauterized so many times.","Doctor":"Hi. Nose bleed is a very common problem. It is treated with cautery which may need repeating a few times. Since you had it only a few days ago, it might be better to avoid flying for 3 to 4 weeks, if possible. Carry on using the ointment for one month and then have yourself reviewed by your doctor. This is the standard practice everywhere. Nose bleed. Ointment in the nose for one month. Avoid nose blowing and picking. Keep blood pressure under control. Avoid blood thinners."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a gastroscopy a week back and when I asked the doctor if I had cancer she said no. On arriving home I saw on the report that there was a tiny nodule in the cardia which has been biopsied. My question is, why would she say emphatically that I do not have cancer if she has done a biopsy?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query in detail. The endoscopy has shown a healing ulcer and is showing healing as well as a small hiatus hernia. There is a very tiny nodule in cardia (proximal part of the stomach), which has been biopsied. These tiny nodules are usually innocuous, but as a routine approach, it is biopsied to rule out any kind of early changes, if any. The report is very clear that they have not found anything sinister (please read it as cancer). I am almost certain that the biopsy is going to come out as benign. Please continue with PPI and wait for the biopsy. Once you have the biopsy and have any further concerns, you could always get back in touch."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My sugar level is 210 after breakfast. Is it normal or high?

You might have erectile dysfunction problem as erection is poor as per history. Usually, during sleep time in the morning due to sympathetic stimulation, penis erection should occur for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour at such a young age. You need to rule out hypertension and diabetes problem by blood pressure measurement and random blood sugar estimation. It is advisable to check your serum testosterone level as well. I suggest you consult nearby psychiatrist or sexologist for detailed evaluation. Masturbation is safe and pleasure giving procedure which usually does not lead to erectile dysfunction."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My left eye has a spot near black circle. I do not know what it is and how it will vanish. I did not remember but it is from years in my eyes.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your photo (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I feel it could be a conjunctival nevus, given that you have had it since a long time and it did not cause you to have any symptoms. Such swellings have a tendency to grow in size during teenage or early adulthood, but usually, stop growing spontaneously. They do not cause any symptoms and are harmless in the long run. On the other hand, it could rarely be a small cancerous growth. Such swelling is called melanoma, although rare it presents with pain, foreign body sensation, redness and blood vessels growing around it. The best way to confirm the diagnosis is by excision biopsy wherein the swelling is cut out and put under a microscope. Given the rarity of this cancer and you being asymptomatic, I suggest that an eye examination whenever possible would suffice to clear your doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 6 years old and weighs about 24 to 25 kg.

Please continue the same treatment as going on. An antibiotic like Augmentin may need to be added based on the clinical examination of the child (to see if it is required). Also, Ibugesic may be started to reduce the pain and inflammation (if any) based on the clinical examination. As of now to relieve the pain you can use Ibugesic 8 ml (SOS only). As far as the cough is concerned, you may cut down on the Betadine gargles and instead take one teaspoon of honey with lukewarm water twice a day for a soothing effect.

The most common reason is the steroid that causes it whether they are present in products we use on face or from the treatment we do. Yes, it can be part of rosacea, in fact, perioral dermatitis come under the umbrella of rosacea. The most important thing is hydration of skin for which you have to apply emollient.

As you told your vision was fine with the glasses or lenses your doctor uses during eye exam and now you are having trouble with your glasses then most probably you need to recheck your glasses if they are dispensed according to your prescription or is there any error. Sometimes a minor error in dispensing cause much trouble especially if you having cylindrical number or axis. I think your glasses are not according to your prescription or it gets mixed with someone else. So first go and verify your glasses number and match with your glasses prescription."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

It is a category C drug that means if potential benefits justify the risk to the fetus, then you can use. As far as of now no well-controlled studies in humans, but it will not cause anomalies but it may affect your neonate after delivery like seizures, jitteriness, tremors, and dullness may occur.

My father died in the late 40s of heart disease.","Doctor":"Hello. Your aortic root is mildly dilated. If you do not have any other systemic diseases like any diagnosed syndrome like Marfans or Ehler Danlos etc., then this needs no treatment at present, but just observation. At this borderline dimensions, we just observe the patients and if it increases more than 50 to 55, then needs surgery. However, if it is genetic, then surgery is done at lesser dimensions. So, you will need regular follow up and 1 to 2 yearly CT scan to keep watch over the dimensions of the aorta. This could be done with echo as well. You should also have an echo if you did not have any. You should get yourself examined by a local doctor once to rule out syndromes. Also, mild to moderate exercises, avoid heavy activities like lifting heavy weights, etc. Avoid all addictions, if any. Low pulse rate is probably related to activities.

As the fatigue is going to set in because of a less muscular part in the leg region. Mostly the anterior portion of the leg pains which is the fascia pain. You can use icing to reduce the pain.

If instruments are not properly sterilized and if the blood of any patient who has hepatitis, etc., present over that, it is possible that it can be transmitted. Usually, in salons the exfoliator they use does not penetrate the body and procedure is very superficial, it does not come into contact with your blood, the risk is very very low.

I had the symptoms for about five days but now I am feeling better without any symptoms. What does that mean?","Doctor":"Hello. I need to know these things first. 1. How did you come to know about having hepatitis B, usually HBsAg (surface antigen) is detected in the routine kits? 2. Had there been, any past history of jaundice? 3. Were you immunized for hepatitis B in the past? 4. Were there any other tests performed to check for chronicity of hepatitis B? What happens in hepatitis B is if the virus is not acquired by birth (like acquired during adult life), the body can clear the infection in about 90 to 95 percent of the patients, but in about 5 percent cases the chronicity develops. But, if the virus is acquired from mother at the time of birth, then the chances of hepatitis B, being chronic are very high. If one has been immunized for hepatitis B in the past and active immunity has developed, then even if the body gets an infection from hepatitis B, the body can eliminate the virus on its own. You should get yourself tested for chronicity for hepatitis B, for that get yourself tested for IgM anti-HBc (antibody against core antigen), if it is positive there are high chances you had an acute infection which your body can fight out most of the time (~95 %), but, if it is negative then you need to get yourself worked up for chronic hepatitis B, and if eligible, should start treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past week, I had been having extra discharge down there.

Does your partner have some symptoms too? Please stop douching, it tends to wash away the good protective bacterial flora of the vagina. It does more harm than good. Increase the probiotic portion in your food, you need to take Clotrimazole and Clindamycin vaginal pessary every night before going to bed for six nights. If your partner has the symptoms, tell him to have tablet Secnidazole 2 gm single dose. Avoid sex for the six nights.

Her condition was not so bad before. She was diagnosed with intestinal disease and was given some antibiotics like Flagyl or Metronidazole. After she took those pills for a month, she had frequent loose or watery stool (without blood) and could not eat spicy or fatty food, sugar or any foods containing lactose. I found a probiotic supplement called Bifina, which helped a lot in controlling her toilet routine and her diet but needed to use together with Smecta. She still cannot eat spicy or fatty food, but she can have a drink or juice with an acceptable amount of sugar, which serves as a rehydration drink. She no longer has loose or watery stool. Once in a while if she reacts with a kind of food or eat more sugar than necessary, her stool will be softer with a few bubbles. In general, her bowel movement is under control.She is starting to recover but her long-term IBS resulted in her exhaustion. As I previously mentioned, she is now still using the probiotic supplement, Bifina, which helps a lot with the intestine treatment makes her easily feel tired or a little dizzy. I asked for support from a relative who works as a nurse because the doctors in my neighborhood just told her to get a rest and give her pills that did not help a lot. So, the nurse frequently gives her some vitamin B12 shots, Glucose 5% intravenous infusion and lactated Ringer's solution 500 ml for injection. This proves to help, but she tells me that she do not have enough energy. We went back to phlebotomy department to have her blood tested. It turned out to be fine, but every time her scores were very low. We thought the hospital could give her any session like fluid infusion or blood transfusion because she had diarrhea for over 10 months. It just stopped about 2 months ago and really has worn her out. But, they just informed me to go to another department like division of general internal medicine. We have already been there and have checked everything like x-ray, heart, liver, and kidney. Attached below are some images of her test results. Could you tell me if we are right to say she needs blood transfusion to help her recover better? Or she needs another solution? Or just stick to what we are doing now? I express a huge thanks for being patient and reading for so long now. I appreciate every answer. Thanks again.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can understand your concern. As you told that your mother had IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), I want to tell you that antibiotics are not the treatment for IBS. Probiotics can help. She might have developed antibiotic induced diarrhea after taking tablet Flagyl (Metronidazole). I have seen her reports and they seem to be normal except ultrasound which is difficult to interpret as it is not clear.  No need to worry she might have developed malabsorption syndrome because of chronic diarrhea as she cannot tolerate lactose containing food. There is no need to give excess vitamin B12 unless there is deficiency. Your mother needs proper evaluation and blood transfusion is not required. Get her serum vitamin B12, folate, serum calcium, vitamin D, stool routine and occult blood checked. Consult a gastroenterologist. As she had chronic diarrhea she needs colonoscopy also.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I cannot see with both of my eyes but I can recognize the light and can see a dark shape of the human body if anyone stands in front of me. My eye sight was lost on drinking a glass of whiskey where I doubt that one of my evil-minded friends added something in that glass because after drinking that glass of wine I felt pain in my eyes and the next day my eyes lost it sight. I went to the hospital and there I came to know that my optic nerve got damaged.","Doctor":"Hello. The condition that you are describing is referred to in medical terminology as methyl alcohol or toxic amblyopia. This presents exactly as you mentioned, with patient losing vision after alcohol intake. The course is variable and patients can have a total loss of vision with optic nerve atrophy. The doctors are treating you for this condition to prevent the involvement of the other eye also and to replenish vitamins lost due to drinking. The important thing is we cannot accurately predict to what extent the vision may improve and how much vision can be saved. The only assurance here is that the treatment will be protective for disease in the other eye, so you will not be completely blinded. My suggestion is to undergo alcohol de-addiction and continue with your current treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old. I am married. I have a bit problem in my sexual life. Whenever I insert my penis in her vagina she told me that when I insert full penis in her she feels pain. Is it normal or not?","Doctor":"Hi. Painful penetration in women may be caused by any injury or lacerations in vaginal walls, infection of the genital tract, forceful or violent sex, lack of lubrication in the vagina. I think you should do a lot of foreplay before penetration so that her vagina may get lubricated naturally. Also, it is highly recommended to use a water-based lubricant like KY jelly. Always be gentle to your partner while having sex. That is the key."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have depression, anxiety, lack of confidence, social anxiety, sweating and fast heartbeat, suicidal thoughts, weakness for the last 15 years. I am 38 years old, male and started masturbation at the age of 18. After some days, I started feeling nightfall regularly. I feel I ruined my life and went to a local doctor and they said that masturbation creates weakness in you. I was shocked and afraid and went into a deep depression thinking that I have destroyed my life. I avoid to meet people and soon had a lack of sleep with low energy. I lost my confidence and deeply regret and this phobia causes me depression and anxiety. I had taken so my ayurvedic medicine but no result. Finally, I tried lots of psychiatrist but medicine made me less active and I was not able to come out of my depression and anxiety and weakness. Then I went to meet a psychiatrist. They prescribed me Nexito 10 mg in the morning and Buspar 5 mg day and night. Presently I am taking these medications. But there is no proper improvement. In the past, I have taken lots of psychiatric medicines like Mirtaz 15 mg, Paxil, Prestiq, Stablon but no result. Please suggest should I go with my current treatment of Nexito 10 mg once and Buspar 5 mg twice or I should add other medicine or should I increase my dose of current medicine. I also feel sexually weak. Please help me with your expert advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me make it very clear. Masturbation is a completely harmless and natural sexual act. Almost 100 % of teenagers masturbate. Nightfall is a natural phenomenon and occurs to everyone in adolescence. Physical power and energy have nothing to do with masturbation. If you want to get fit, start exercising. Now, as you have been slipped into depression because of guilt and self-reproach, you first have to believe that you are just as normal as any random healthy guy. To get out of this depressive episode you need to take antidepressants in a sufficient dose and duration. The antidepressants you should take must be devoid of sexual side effects. The commonest sexual side effect of Nexito (Escitalopram) is a loss of libido. Moreover, the drugs you were given were not in a sufficient dose. I suggest you meet your psychiatrist and ask for drugs like Bupropion (starting dose 150 mg and to be increased to 300 mg). You may have an option to increase the dosage of Nexito to 20 mg in two divided doses. Buspar (Buspirone) is an antianxiety drug whose effective dose is 20 mg to 40 mg. Along with medication, you may go for psychotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I slipped from stairs before five months and got fracture. My orthopedic doctor diagnosed it as heel bone fracture in both legs. I mean intra-articular calcaneal fracture. I have lost subtle movements in heel and ankle area. He advised me to walk on toes for 20 minutes twice a day. He did not prescribe any medicine other than a pain killer. But, he told me that the pain killer has to be taken only when there is unbearable pain. He told me that it will take at least a year for complete recovery and if not then we will plan for surgery. At present, I can walk very slowly and I cannot walk on toes as doctor prescribed. I would like to have a second opinion for this. Do all intra-articular calcaneal fractures require surgery?

The treated tooth does not hurt and the root canal seems to be properly done but the abscess keeps coming back even after taking antibiotics. Why is this happening? Also, how can I know what type of abscess it is (periodontal, gingival, or periapical)?","Doctor":"Hi. An X-ray would be required. Mostly, such cases have to go for a treatment known as apicoectomy which is draining the abscess by making a passage through bone. Some abscesses are recurrent which cause necrosis of bone at the root level. Such conditions make root canal treatment unfavorable. In such situations, extraction and replacement of the tooth will be the best option going forward."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had driven the car for almost 1700 km in the five days duration. From last week onwards I am getting lower back pain on the right side. Today I visited the local orthopedic. They suggested to use ECT Forte tablet twice a day and Gaba plus containing Gabapentin 400 mg and dosage is one tablet after dinner. Is that Gaba plus tablet safe to use for lower back pain? Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, Gabapentin is pretty safe. The usual side effects are that you might get some dizziness for the first 2 to 3 times that you took the tablet. Also, nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. But overall it is a safe tablet to take. So, I would advise you to continue the treatment. You would also need some physiotherapy once the pain settles down."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am experiencing swelling of the gum on my molar and bleeding, as well as a bad taste in my mouth.

There is an infection present in your last molar region, most probably it is due to third molar impaction and known as pericoronitis. Sometimes it is also due to abnormal cheek biting. You should avoid spicy and hot food. Make proper oral hygiene, you could also use salted water to rinse your mouth. Please see your dentist for a clinical examination and treatment.

Can you please suggest me vitamin D supplements to overcome this deficiency, duration of intake and side effects, if any. I am a non-vegetarian and currently not taking any supplements and not under any medication. Should I be taking any other supplements apart from vitamin D considering my age is above 30. Apart from the vitamin D deficiency, I could see some abnormal values for lymphocyte percentage, lymphocytes absolute count, monocytes absolute count, total RBC, platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet to large cell ratio (PLCR). Attaching my health report for your further reference. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. Your vitamin D and HDL are low, and iron levels are low normal. Rest all reports are fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So, for vitamin D, you should have tablet Uprise D3 (or Calcitriol sachets) 60,000 units with milk once a week for eight weeks and then once a month for the next six months. This will cure deficiency and also replenish your stores. May cause some gastritis, otherwise safe. For HDL, you do not need to have anything, but just have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily food, regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to capacity. Also, for iron, have iron rich food like green leafy vegetables like spinach or jaggery, etc."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 35 years old, female. I went to the emergency room a few days back. The CT scan was done to check my ovary and when I look at my blood work for the past few years, I was wondering if there was any relation between some of the rising levels especially if anything is not functioning apparently. I keep getting dismissed as if there is nothing wrong. I am pushing for MRCP, but I keep losing weight and most of the pain is on my left side even though my dysfunctional gallbladder is in the right side but I know this pain is on the left side. Would you be suspicious of cancer, based on these results?","Doctor":"Hello. Your attached reports are not suggesting any specific cancer (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The left-sided abdominal pain could be due to gastritis or diverticulitis. For that, fiber diet can be taken more and antacid like Rabeprazole can be prescribed. Avoid the intake of excess spicy foods. If you are taking excess stress, then weight loss can be due to anxiety. So rule out anxiety problem as well. Your urine report shows the presence of blood in the urine. So, urine routine microscopic examination should be done to rule out urinary tract infection. PT, APTT, BT like primary coagulation study also can be done. As your spleen is mildly enlarged, I recommend you to consult nearby MD internal medicine specialist for your detailed evaluation. As far as the attached report is concerned, it does not suggest any specific cancer."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just had my acromioclavicular joint separation (grade 2 or 3), AC ligament torn. I am ready to accept the recovery time. My question is can I do pull ups again in my life? Or any permanent disability may occur?","Doctor":"Hello. Sure the X-ray looks kind of AC joint separation due to the ligament injury. With the image, the injury looks between grade II or III. I will advise you to take the call for the MRI shoulder to focus on the AC joint. This will help us understand the extent of the ligament injury as from outside examining will be a little tough. Once we get the MRI, we will be able to see the internal soft tissues including the ligaments and muscles. Post which your query of doing pull-up can be answered. But for now, do not do any movements of the shoulder and let all the healing to occur. Meantime, please take the MRI so we can judge the trauma to the fibers of the ligament. Once we get hold of the MRI we can plan the exercise prescription if the ligament is not completely torn and in future can prepare you for the pull-ups. In case if found complete tear then can advise for the next course of action. I will wait for your response."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

As a human we all carry some kinds of secrets or fear back in our head. I felt glad as you have the courage to admit that, most people cannot. So be proud of that. I think you need a scaling too, as you have not brushed for a long time its leads to swollen gingiva that might be the reason of uncomfortable using a brush. As you have caries and sensitivity associated, you might not necessarily need an extraction. If the caries has progressed alot, root canal can be done to save your tooth. Betadine Mouthwash, Gargle in lukewarm water 2-3 times a day. Do not worry, use it, if any foul breath that will be covered and your secret will be safe. As you feel uncomfortable using a brush, you can brush using your finger and toothpaste. That way your mouth will also be clean and issue with bristle will also be resolved. You can also take capsule Sporidex 500 mg one apsule BD for 5 days, tablet Zerodol SP 1 tablet BD for 5 days, capsule Pan D one capsule BD before meal for 5 days. You will be needing a scaling to remove any tartar. Once done you can start practising brushing using a soft bristle brush (even a baby brush will do for a start). I am confident you will succeed. But you have to start the habit and you will get used to it, trust me. You can train and motivate yourself by rewarding a candy or anything special. By that way you can overcome your fear and gain comfidence. I am glad that I could be someone whom you can share a secret. I wish you good luck. You can trust me and ask if any further query.

He suggested me to go for vitamin B12 injections. After taking injections for two days the pain became severe and my normal activity got affected. So, I stopped the injections.

I assure you not worry as you have consulted the appropriate expert physician who will take care of all of your medical concerns. The reasons for tachycardia are as follows. If you have any other symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness, fainting, etc., then consult a cardiologist for proper physical evaluation and treatment if needed. He may also prescribe some medicine to control heartbeat and blood pressure. Also, there are ways to treat tachycardia with home remedies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having an inguinal mesh removal and triple neurectomy 20 days later. What type of pain and side effects should I expect from the neurectomy?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that this type of neurectomy is usually used to treat chronic resistant pain in the groin area (inguinal region) due to inguinal herniation. So, it is supposed that your situation will improve, and you will experience only local pain due to the surgery and soft tissues inflammation. This type of pain will usually disappear in a couple of weeks, after healing. Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen can help improve pain. If neurectomy is not successful, persistent pain like heaviness or dull pain may persist. In such a case, Gabapentin or Pregabalin would help against the pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I wanted to ask you about long-sightedness.","Doctor":"Hello.

I fully believe I have adult ADHD, and being that I was diagnosed at 11 with it, would this help my case for medication with a psych?","Doctor":"Hi. Both adult and childhood ADHD needs to be treated with medicines. Three medicines are the first line drugs used to treat ADHD namely Methamphetamine (Adderal), Methylphenidate (Concerta) and Atomoxetine (Strattera). The former two drugs are more effective in treating hyperactivity symptoms while the third is more effective in impulsivity symptoms of ADHD. Another drug which has been used with great success in the past is an alpha-2 agonist called Clonidine. It is also used in treating hypertension and urinary retention."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been experiencing a patch of hair loss and it is getting bigger. I had two but the one is gone now. I am very proud of my hair and this makes me emotional.","Doctor":"Hi. This is alopecia areata, and the patch on your backside of the scalp is ophiasis, a subtype of alopecia areata. It is thought to be an autoimmune disease in which hair loss is in the form of patches but comes back itself as you have told. Meanwhile, you can apply topical steroids over it like Fluticasone propionate ointment or lotion. Another option is a mixture of topical Canthradine plus topical Capsicum and Methylated spirit in equal proportion and apply for five minutes twice per week as they have an irritant effect. Topical steroids will be beneficial for you. Follow up at one month. Alopecia areata. Apply Fluticasone propionate ointment or lotion over the area, take Multivitamins."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My ENT doctor told me that I am having granulation with pharyngitis.

If it is a recurrent condition you can be treated with Silver Nitrate to remove those granulations. There is no problem in the above-mentioned treatment. Apart from antacids, I suggest you take antibiotics and mouth gargles. If possible, provide me a picture of your throat by taking a picture in the mirror (if possible)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Today I noticed two moles on my back with large dark circles around them. I have attached the photos of one affected area only. I have always had these moles, but have never seen these dark circles until today. I have had biopsies of moles from my back before and they were not cancerous. However, in the past, my dermatologist and a plastic surgeon removed a pre-cancerous mole removed from my right calf and a suspicious mole from my right bicep. My mother had a melanoma removed. I am also recovering from a case of shingles on my face. Could my immune system have been weakened from fighting off whatever is going on with these moles? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Have had an endoscopy (EGD)? Is it usually that you have a feeling that you need to belch to ease the discomfort in your tummy?

Since I was diagnosed, I have not been given a prognosis of myelopathy associated with Hashimoto’s. I was paralyzed from the chest down before diagnosis. I was put on a course of three months Steriods and then 125 mg Azathioprine which was in last year and increased to 150 mg currently. I get three hours of physio a week and three monthly blood tests, full blood count, TPO, and TSH. In your opinion what would be the expected neurological care for this condition, and the absolute minimum acceptable standard of care? Is an annual MRI necessary? Should a specialist be able to provide a prognosis on my condition? Any other advice you consider helpful to me.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry to hear about your illness. You are likely suffering from Hashimoto's myelopathy based on your description. It is rare condition and only a handful of cases have been described worldwide. It is known to be very steroid responsive and there should be a remarkable improvement with steroids injections. If you had no response to the injections, I wonder about other diagnoses as well, given you have a history of cervical disc bulge causing weakness. The best way I can come to a better answer is by looking at the MRI images of the spine and brain, report of CSF studies with CSF level of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal antibodies. If we are seeing damage in the cord and the muscle power testing is weak with atrophy of muscles, for the past three years, then the recovery will be guarded. I will strongly advise, rehabilitation with PT, OT and botulinum toxin injections or spinal cord pump installation if significant spasticity is there in both legs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have consistent twitching in the bottom lid of my left eye. It has been ongoing for about for two weeks tomorrow.","Doctor":"Hello. This eyelid twitching can be caused by a number of different problems. In case you have only the eyelid twitch and have no other problems in your eye or other bodily diseases, we label such cases as essential blepharospasm. To reduce this, I suggest you do the following. Avoid tea or coffee completely for a few days. Get around eight hours of sleep at night. In case you have any burning sensation or itching or irritation use an over-the-counter lubricant eyedrop containing Carboxymethylcellulose acetate 0.5 percent 6 to 8 times a day. In case you have any other symptoms with the twitching or have already tried doing the things I just mentioned, please let me know. I would appreciate if you could share your doctor's records, relevant test results with me, I will do my best to help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Fraternal twins are when two eggs have been released and both get fertilized by two different sperms. Does this mean the woman had sex twice to fertilize the second egg or one sperm fertilized both of them?","Doctor":"Hi. Actually, twins are babies produced by single same pregnancy can be monozygotic (identical) or dizygotic (fraternal). Monozygotic develop from one zygote which splits in an early stage of development and form two embryos. Dizygotic (fraternal) twins mean each twin develop at the same time from a separate egg and each egg is fertilized by its own sperm at the same time. It means woman had sex once only and at time fertilization two eggs fertilized by two sperms. In a few milliliters of semen, millions of sperms are there. So two sperms used to fertilized two eggs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How are you doing? I hope you are good. My age is 29, from the last 8 to 9 days, I did not have a proper erection.

Please let me know if this is a major issue or I should make changes in my lifestyle or on food intake.","Doctor":"Hi. The cause of poor erection is due to poor blood to penile vasculature. The main cause is that a young person like you is psychological in nature like anxiety or tension due to poor communication between the partner or due to depression, fatigue, stress. The medical conditions such as thyroid dysfunction or diabetes, hypertension, etc., can also cause this. So first get these things checked that you have these medical illnesses or not. If you have any medical illness, then get them treated. Take a healthy diet and include fruit. Anything that is bad for the heart is also bad for the penis. Maintain a healthy weight. Do regular exercise. Avoid any substance use. Stop alcohol or tobacco, you can use the Mediterranean diet. If using any medicine, then check it with your doctor. Manage your stress effectively. Take adequate sleep, six to eight hours of sleep daily and maintain good sleep hygiene. Probably these things will help you.

My mother died from complications relating to Addison’s disease and over the last year or so I have been developing symptoms that could be consistent with it (hyperpigmentation, abdominal pain, dizziness).","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) can be due to many causes. It is like when your adrenal glands are not producing the hormones they usually produce. While in the past, infections (particularly tuberculosis) were the most common cause for the destruction of adrenals, but now the most common cause worldwide is autoimmune destruction of the adrenals. As with other autoimmune diseases, there can be a hereditary component and associated with other autoimmune diseases. Weight loss, fatigue, postural hypotension (feeling dizzy when upright) and hyperpigmentation are the initial symptoms. Among those, you have a few. You should definitely get yourself screened for it, by undertaking a cosyntropin stimulation test. And if that is positive, you should get your plasma renin activity checked, along with serum aldosterone concentration. Also serum ACTH levels. Increased basal serum ACTH concentration, high renin, and low aldosterone will help in making the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex with my wife.

I took some stool softeners a couple of days which helped, but I am still experiencing the need to evacuate my bowels. Also, I am passing some gas, but it is coming in little blips. Should I take a laxative or could it be like hemorrhoids or something?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your complaints and what I feel is you might have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but before I could make this diagnosis, I need to know, do you have abdominal pain along with your constipation part? Do you feel relieved after defecation, by relief I specifically mean relief in the pain? Does this constipation sort of thing keep on recurring along with some episodes of diarrhea? Did you ever have complaints of blood or mucus in stools? If the answer to the first three questions is yes and a no to the fourth one, then it is more likely to be in favor of IBS. The cause of IBS is not known, but this I related to some sort of stress at work, studies, etc. You could try laxatives and modify your food in terms of food low in FODMAP. FODMAP is an acronym for fermentable oligo, di, monosaccharides, and polyols. You should avoid high FODMAP diet."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to a cardiologist and he found me with tachycardia.

I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to a stroke. Low blood perfusion to the brain could mimic this clinical situation. Anxiety too. White matter changes could be related to different possible causes: chronic arterial hypertension, vasculitis, migraines, etc. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing further tests to investigate for possible causes like inflammation tests (complete blood count PCR, ESR), thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction, a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries to investigate for possible narrowing, an ECG Holter monitoring in order to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia.

Trying some physical procedures, like warm massage over the affected area, in addition to any anti-inflammatory drug could be of value like Naproxen.

Sleeping not-well is an important contributor for generating muscle twitching and other issues. You should be careful with the drug intake and periodically check ECG and blood parameters to timely prevent further homeostatic abnormalities. You should discuss with your attending doctor on the above-mentioned issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to delay menstruation. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. You can have hormonal medications to delay the periods. For better results, start 5 to 7 days in advance of a particular date. Have tablet Primolute N (10 mg twice daily) and continue till three days before you want to have periods. After stopping medications, you can have withdrawal bleed within latest two weeks and earliest 3 to 4 days. You can have heavy prolonged bleeding after stopping medications, it depends on your body how it reacts. Later, for some time periods will be disturbed and then gradually will be regular. Have a balanced diet, weight, and BMI. A complete treatment of any health issue you have will be helpful. Tablet Primolute N to start 5 to 7 days in advance 5 to 10 mg twice daily till 3 to 4 days before you want to have periods. Can have COCP afterward to regulate periods."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old girl. I have had eye problems for around nine months and have seen several eye doctors and ophthalmologists who all have told me different things and tried a lot of different treatments that have not worked. I am a contact lens wearer with extremely bad eyesight and first had eye problems eight months back. It started after a plane ride and assumed it was an eye infection from being on a dirty plane and touching my eyes. My eyes were stinging and crying and red and I could not bear to put contacts in. Nine months later I am still having this problem. I was first treated with antibacterial drops by a normal doctor then referred to an eye doctor when this did not fix it. The eye doctors diagnosed me with ocular rosacea, blepharitis, and MGD. I have rosacea on my face too. I have done eye compresses, gotten a liposcan (meibomian glands were not clogged enough to need lipoflow), I have punctal plugs in both eyes and I took Doxycycline for over three months which did nothing but destroy my digestion. I have been prescribed Restasis and Lotemax which I use multiple times a day. I use lid scrubs and a tea tree oil eye and face cleanser. But my symptoms are still severe, I have extremely dry eyes, my eyes are bloodshot 24/7. I have red lower lid margins and cannot bear to wear contacts which is extremely upsetting because I am an athlete and this is really impacting my athletic ability and quality of life. I just really hope someone has an answer and treatment that will work.","Doctor":"Hi. I can imagine the situation you are going through. MGD (meibomian gland dysfunction) with dry eyes related to rosacea is a disturbing problem. Your doctor is treating it very well but in spite of all, you are still having problems. You have done warm compresses, taken oral and topical antibiotics and steroid drops too with artificial tears and punctal plugs. Most of the people respond to this therapy. A contact lens is not advised in cases with severe dry eyes and MGD (but as you told you are an athlete and glasses are not suitable for you). And you are not an ideal case for refractive surgery too with such condition. So considering all these factors I would suggest that discontinue contact lens for some time or minimize duration as much as you can (better to discontinue) until your eyes get better. Secondly, clean your lid margins regularly with wet cotton or baby shampoo to remove crusts (if any). You are already using steroid drops (Lotemax) but I would advise you to use eye ointment at night like Blephamide (has steroid) or plain antibiotic ointments like Fusithalmic (Fusic acid) or Tobramycin. Apply this ointment at lid margins, eyelash roots at night after properly cleansing eyelids (as it is a disease of lid margins). Topical drops have limited effect on lid margins diseases but topical drops are necessary for conjunctival redness. So continue Lotemax (I hope your doctor is monitoring intraocular pressure IOP as steroid drops can cause secondary glaucoma) and Restasis (Cyclosporine). Restasis can be used as many times as you feel the need. As they are preservative free and have no side effects. Punctal plugs are good. So, in short, continue all the medication you are using. Discontinue contact lenses for some time. Continue warm compresses. Try Blephamide ointment (if IOP is normal) or some antibiotic eye ointment. Keep follow up to your doctor they are doing a great job."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a root canal today. When the doctor (a root canal specialist) made the hole into my silver filling, he did not use water. I thought dentist were supposed to use water when they take out a silver filling. Should he have done that?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, water is used usually to open the chamber of the tooth at first visit of root canal treatment. Somehow, maybe he has put water pressure so low that you did not get to notice or maybe suction would be done on spot by the assistant, so you did not get to spit. If no water is used still chamber gets opened up but some friction heat is produced that causes damage to the handpiece or drill and burs used by the dentist. Tooth gets a bit brittle but it is not much harmful. Hopefully, next visits will go smoothly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to leave cigarette smoking. So, please help me and give a solution. Is there any ayurvedic medicine available then please tell me.","Doctor":"Hi. There is no short cut to quit smoking. There are two methods you can try. The natural method. You decrease the number of cigarettes by 20 % each week till you reach to a point where you smoke only 4 to 5 cigarettes per day. Then reduce it by one each week. the other method is to substitute cigarettes with Nicotine chewing gums. These chewing gums are to be cheeked in the mouth like Khaini or Zarda. Along with it, start taking tablet Bupron XL 150. It will help in reducing the withdrawal effects of Nicotine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is barnyard millet good for a diabetic patient? My mother has fibroids in the uterus of 18 cm, does it impact the rise in diabetes in any case? Her current diabetes is 340 fasting. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hello. Samak rice (barnyard millet) is good for everyone, more so for a diabetic person as it provides a good deal of fibers, multiple nutrients, and enough calories too. Instead of regular rice, this can be substituted. The presence of fibroids in the uterus has no direct impact on either precipitating or increasing diabetes. Fibroids can cause problems related to the uterus itself. If there are many and fairly big ones, better to get a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) done. The best judge for this is your gynecologist who can assess the situation better. Follow that advice. As regards blood glucose control, ideally fasting glucose should be less than 100 mg or closer to 100 mg, PP 150 to 170 mg and HbA1c % less than 6.8 %. Maintaining good glucose control prevents the possibility of developing long term complications related to diabetes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 53 years old, 183 lbs, 5'4\\". For years, I ran a high white blood count and the oncologist said nothing can be done about that. We need to now watch red blood count and RBC distribution and watch my spleen. Now approximately nine years later, for the last four years, I am seeing red blood count high, hemoglobin high, hematocrit high, monocytes high, red cell distribution worth high, mean corpuscular hemoglobin content low, glycated hemoglobin high. I am very concerned.","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your query and below is my opinion. Your attached reports are suggestive of high RBC, hemoglobin, and HCT as per provided reference range in a laboratory report. So it is suggestive of polycythemia. It can be primary or secondary. Primary polycythemia seems very less likely here as total WBC count and platelet count is within range. Primary polycythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Although the possibility is very less you can rule it out by JAK2 mutation test and exon 12 study by a molecular test. For secondary polycythemia, rule out cardiac and respiratory causes by EKG and chest X-ray investigation. Your glycated hemoglobin is slightly high (attachment removed to protect patient identity) which is suggestive of a prediabetic stage. So take less sweets and fatty meals. Regular exercises are also beneficial. Repeat sugar testing with fasting and postprandial blood glucose estimation. Your vitamin D level is low for which Cholecalciferol sachet 60000 IU once a week for eight weeks can be prescribed. The slight high monocyte could be due to cytomegalovirus infection. For that virus only symptomatic management can be done. There is no specific medical treatment for that. Your CBC result is not alarming but needs to be monitored. If you are a smoker, then it can also lead to such a finding. Your ANA is positive which can be falsely positive in infection. So repeat it after few days and clinical correlation is needed for that. I suggest you consult near by hematologist for detailed examination and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to the dentist. I have dark brown stains on my teeth. He said it is from drinking fizzy drink and the only way to fix it is veneers. Is this true?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, these are now internal stains that cannot be simply removed through scaling. One of the causes for these kinds of stains is fizzy drinks, others may include taking Iron supplements for long, or may be due to the use of extra fluoride in water during childhood like the use of salty water in some part of your age, use of alcohol, smoking or tobacco. All these may lead to these internal stains. Treatment options for these are composite veneers like economical or veneers of zirconia which are expensive but very good in aesthetics. No need for capping is there as staining is just around gums area (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Feel free to ask if you have any further questions regarding it. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have an odd thing happening in my left eye. I see a flash of light when I look right to left in the left side of my eye. It is a curve from top to bottom. It happens in daylight, nighttime, and even in the dark with my eyes closed. I move my pupil left to right and see a bright arc of light. I cannot make it stay there, it just flashes as I move my eye balls left to right. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello. This occurrence of flashes of light can be due to various causes. The first and the most probable cause could be posterior vitreous detachment, this is a benign condition not requiring any treatment. Here, you may experience some floaters but no reduction in vision or nonseeing areas in your visual field. The most important to rule out here would be the second condition, retinal detachment. Here, although you do experience floaters just like in posterior vitreous detachment, the floaters are more numerous and keep increasing with time. You will also have a reduction in vision with nonseeing areas in your visual field. This often needs to be treated surgically. I recommend you to visit an ophthalmologist. In case there is no reduction of vision or increase in floaters, I would not say that it is not urgent."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, From yesterday, I am suffering from loose motions and vomiting. I do not feel fever, but, whatever I eat, I feel it is in my throat. I feel vomiting sensation. I feel very weak, drowsy and not able to do my normal work. Also, felt left side shoulder and chest discomfort. My age is 31 and I do not have any bad habits. I have high triglycerides around 345 and other lipid levels are normal.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I was in love with a girl for five years when I was doing my college and then I told my parents and they did not agree. She also loved me back. In her home also they will not accept. Now both of us are not talking for the past one and half years. I am working now and she is studying now. I used to meet and send her texts when I got leave and miss her. Now she does not want to talk to me. This time I asked her if she is free to meet me. She told she is busy. Now, is she really over me or just protecting me? What should I do to get over her? Sometimes, I feel like everything is over between me and her but then suddenly I miss her a lot. Is this how it is going to be always?","Doctor":"Hi. The best answer is to ask yourself whether you wish to and looking forward to marrying her or not? If not, you need to move on. A girl, unlike man, cannot call and text you just for the sake of pleasing you. Girls are always under the radar of their family and society. They need 110 percent assurance from you. They just cannot be your time pass. In your case, it is difficult for you to persuade your and her family but not impossible. If you really love each other you may have a fighting chance. During the last one and a half year of non-communication, she has probably decided to move on with her life as she got no real assurance from you. So call her, and try to meet her if you really are interested in marrying her. Or else, let her be a part of your good memories and move on."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am in trouble.

Kindly help me and guide me on how can I abort the child.","Doctor":"Hi. Termination of pregnancy can be done either with tablets or surgical method like D and C (dilatation and curettage). The first one seems easier, but as you have a history of two previous cesareans, I would suggest you choose the later. MTP (medical termination of pregnancy) with tablets may lead to incomplete abortion and torrential bleeding in some cases (chances are higher in previous cesarean cases due to retained products of conception-RPOC). D and C on another hand is a foolproof method without chances of RPOC and severe bleeding, additionally being painless (thanks to anesthesia). Instead, you can get a MIRENA or Copper-T inserted or tubectomy done in the same sitting preventing any further unwanted pregnancies. It is to be done under strict medical supervision, so please visit a gynecologist for the same."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have been doing weight training for six months but recently my eye specialist told me to not lift heavy weights because I had laser treatment for retinal holes three years ago. So, should I stop weight training completely or should I drop the weights? Currently, I am doing deadlifts at 20 kg and bench press at 10 kg. So what should be the maximum safe limit to protect retina?","Doctor":"Hi. There is no limit of weight lifting as such. But usually heavy weight lifting or strenuous exercise is banned if there are untreated breaks. If breaks are secured with a sufficient laser that usually takes 1 to 2 weeks for maximum effect. But there is always a risk of new retinal break formation that is caused by vitreous detachment. If vitreous is detached completely and there is no break, you can workout freely. There is no sharp line of weight. These are just protective measures and varies from patient to patient. That does not stop you from living life.

I see it was less on repeat but not sure how much was it spaced out and how much you took orally? Since it did not improve with oral replacement, you would need IM treatment and if I am your doctor I would also check you for vitamin D3 and iron deficiency. There could be a couple of things here including poor oral intake or poor oral absorption by the stomach or the gut."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had unprotected intercourse with my fiance and he ejaculated inside me 20 days back and within 24 hours I took a pill.

Unwanted 72 has a side effect of messing up periods and since you have taken it twice so probably your periods are delayed due to this reason. I would suggest doing a pregnancy test to be sure and if you vomited the next day, then it had not affected the efficacy of the pill, and your symptoms may be due to anxiety or stress due to delayed periods."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am too much possessive to all the one who I love.

I originally went in because of my knee and wrist pain then before I knew it, I was having my atlas adjusted by a machine. My last few days I have been miserable and feeling awful. Exhausted, my lymph nodes are so painful on the sides of my neck I have been in bed all day. I just feel this might be related but I do not know.","Doctor":"Hello. What I see there might be some changes in the muscles which may have led to compression over the lymph nodes? Few basic things to ask before I proceed. Are you having pain in the neck? Is the pain sharp shooting or dull aching? Are you feeling any kind of muscle tightness near the neck? Any signs of swelling? The pain in the knee and wrist can be of different pathology and need a different approach. Coming back to the history, the swelling in lymph node if you suspect then you need a physician approach than the chiropractor. We need to check out why the lymph nodes got swollen. Is it due to any pathology or due to some external factors. Usually, this area does not allow lymph nodes to get swollen sooner until there is some pathology and it is always good on our side to take care of our body in proper guidelines. Hope you take this matter to a physician first rather than a chiropractor. As per my practice of 12 years I never recommend cases with lymph node issue to chiropractor as the job is different. Degenerative disc disease. MRI cervical spine. Trapezitis. Neck pain. Ice pack and rest."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old and I have been having big problems with making friends since I was 7.

Besides all my life I feel like I am the one that jumps around people and tries to talk to them and they just do not care so I quickly give up and end up alone. And my house is so stressful too, it is so loud because my parents scream so much and I spend most of the time locked in my room because when I hear them screaming it feels so stressful (all this stress is like sitting on my back and I cannot make it stop).

Is it possible that I have some kind of mental illness or maybe autism?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, this is not a serious mental issue. Just remain relaxed. You have social anxiety most likely and this anxiety is resulting in symptoms like blushing when you are getting attention, difficulty in making friends, etc. This is social anxiety and a lot of individuals of your age develop. So do not think that you have any abnormality. Just continue to make your efforts to make friends and you will gain confidence with time.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I really want to pull it due to money. But I cannot afford an implant and I am concerned about facial features if I pull the tooth and let it go without an implant.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. You can absolutely choose to get the tooth removed in case of financial situations. But what I reckon would be to go for the cheapest replacement options such as a removable partial denture where you still maintain that space next to the implant. Unlike natural tooth, the implant does not shift to the empty space but the load bearing capacity changes. Since there would not be a natural tooth to hold the load every time you chew. It is transferred completely to the implant. So, the more implant gets the load the more chances of its failure rate. A removable denture for the lost molar will help distribution of the chewing load. And please do not worry about the facial features. It is not going to get affected at all if you remove the molar tooth. Aesthetics is a concern only with the front teeth and not with the molars."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is seven weeks pregnant (about three weeks from fertilization, we think, because she has long cycles) and came down with shingles almost 2 weeks ago (and a cold about a week ago). She has been taking Acyclovir and the pain has reduced but is still present. We are worried about the effect on the baby, particularly because we have read viral infections in early pregnancy can lead to Autism. Do you have any advice about how serious the risks are?","Doctor":"Hi. Shingles is herpes zoster, which is the reactivation of the chicken-pox virus in the body due to an immunocompromised status like pregnancy. But thankfully, the effects are not disastrous for the unborn baby as your wife already has antibodies against the virus in her body to combat transmission. If she had disseminated widespread shingles, there could be theoretical chances of viremia and fetus being affected. She is already taking Acyclovir, so viremia is not possible anymore. Do not worry, be happy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old and healthy but lately, I have been waking up with headaches that continue throughout the day and now the last few days I feel very light headed and dizzy when standing and get a stomach ache. I eat regularly and drink five bottles of water a day. I take regular medicines and multivitamins like I have for years now but do not understand why I just now am beginning to feel like this.","Doctor":"Hello. According to the history provided, here you are having a headache, dizziness mainly. Your blood pressure should be checked as fluctuations in blood pressure or high blood pressure can lead to a headache. Second otological causes should be evaluated as an ear infection can lead to a headache with dizziness. Viral respiratory tract infection can lead to a headache with dizziness (in this case congestive symptoms are present). If you are taking the stress and if having smoking habits than also headache can occur. Any cardiac history positive then less blood flow to the brain sometimes can lead to dizziness. For that investigation is done with EKG. If slurred speech is present, history of hypertension and if no specific cause found then CT scan like higher investigation can be done to look for the stroke-like condition. Take care. According to cause found a further specific treatment can be given. Consult a physician for examination with keeping all this in mind."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My age is 26 and having iron deficiency anemia. My Hb level is 11 but ferritin 18.

You can complete the course of Iron medication for 2 to 3 months according to your doctor's prescription. It is not advisable to take Iron tablet randomly. Usually, at 11 gm Hb level, dyspnea does not occur. For your breathlessness, I suggest you investigate with chest X-ray and spirometry investigation. For that, you can consult a pulmonologist for chest examination. Meanwhile, complete the full course of Iron medication."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have ulcerative colitis for more than two months. I pass more than seven stools a day (loose stools). Constant bleeding before every stool from the rectum. Fever, rapid heartbeat, and anemia. And have a fungal infection, taking medicine too.","Doctor":"Hello. For ulcerative colitis, an anti-inflammatory drug like Sulfasalazine group of drugs can be started. (In a severe case, Steroid can be prescribed for a short duration). Immunosuppressive drugs prescribed if needed. Anti-diarrheal medication also can be prescribed to decrease diarrhea frequency. Your anemia is because of constant bleeding in the stool. For that, Iron medication like Ferrous Ascorbate can be started. All these medications are taken regularly and even if still no improvement then surgical management can be done. Consult gastroenterologist for examination and accordingly get prescription. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, About two years ago, I was playing a video game while wearing a headset with fairly loud burst sounds from time to time, and I noticed a small hissing sound was present in my ears or head when I was getting off my PC. I have always used headsets for long hours before this occurred. Ever since then this tinnitus has moved from one ear to another, and then centralized in my head. Anyhow, now whenever I put on and listen to a headset for a short period even on low volume, my ears hurt. The sides of my head around the ear and the tinnitus spikes up usually. I have tried several popular and expensive headsets with same results. Other symptoms I have are I have difficulty breathing through my nose, I feel emotionally numb, anxiety, my jaw locks sometimes when I bite on hard food and sometimes it does itself during sleep. The bones around my ear hurt. I do not know if any of the symptoms are related. But I have not been to a doctor for various reasons.","Doctor":"Hi. Exposure to loud sounds creates pressure over your nerve of hearing and can evoke tinnitus. Hence, I advise you to use minimal sound during games. The pain in and around your ears is due to excessive usage of headset around your ears. For your nasal obstruction, you should get a diagnostic nasal endoscopy done to rule out the cause and proceed for further investigations. Locking of your jaw can be due to the TM joint which locks more in the morning and creates pain when infected leading to pain while biting hard foods. Hence, a muscle relaxant is advised."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have tooth decay for the past five weeks and it is causing a lot of pain. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Your tooth enamel chipped off, exposing dentin and inner layers of the tooth. This might have opened root nerves too and that is why you are having pain. Start taking tablet Brufen 400 mg twice a day for three days. If the pain gets relieved by it, it means there is no deep infection and tooth may be restored by filling. But if pain persists after leaving medication it means root is exposed and now root canal treatment is the only option you are left with. I can tell exactly if you can provide me with a radiograph. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 29-year-old male. I have been complaining of symptoms of prostatitis for seven years with LUTS, fatigue, and pain as the main symptoms. The EPS shows more than 10 WBC per HPF and urine and prostatic cultures are negative. Semen culture was done twice in the last six months with the first one showing high agglutination and the second one done three months after is completely normal. I had three courses of antibiotics. Two Levofloxacin and one Ciprofloxacin with a duration of one month to six weeks each time. Antibiotics show partial improvement. I am having a relapse now with pain along the epididymis and when bending down and walking, which happened before and showed improvement only on Levofloxacin. My question is regarding the new data about the safety of Levofloxacin with reported potentially permanent muscular and CNS effects. Should I change antibiotic this time? And what about Fosfomycin?","Doctor":"Hello. You are suffering from chronic prostatitis. It is very difficult to treat. Ideally, prostatic massage and EPS or semen culture must be done. But, if you have an improvement with Levofloxacin, then you can take it. The side effects are if you take it for a very long duration in years. For an acute episode as now take Levofloxacin. Then later, you can shift to oral low dose Nitrofurantoin 100 mg daily for three months. I would also like to add Doxycycline (with Levofloxacin) 100 mg bd for 14 days for an atypical organism. Fosfomycin is reserved in case you have resistance with other drugs. So do not use now."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 36 years old, male, 6'1\\", 265 lbs. I have a question about total bilirubin.

The doctor was not concerned by this but the highest I have seen it was three years ago when it was at .53 (total bilirubin).However, during the last month, I went from 282 lbs to 265. I have been extremely stressed out about it. Health problems and my anxiety are high. I barely slept the night before the tests and am possibly dehydrated. Could these factors have contributed to the increase? I am concerned about bile duct obstruction.","Doctor":"Hello. Since this question was posted under diabetology, I am wondering if you have any endocrine issues. The question asked here is about gastroenterology. The liver tests would be concerning for a liver process like gallstone if the enzymes were not coming back down or if you had pain in your right abdomen. Any fever?

Two months back, I tried a weight loss medication and my last period started on 12th, two months before. First I had spotting for 10 days and started bleeding heavily after that and it did not stop. I consulted a local gynecologist a month later to stop my bleeding and she suggested me Regestrone, 5 mg one tablet daily for 21 days. My bleeding stopped after having Registrone within six days. But unfortunately, I had missed Regestrone for three days and started bleeding again. On consulting my gynecologist again she prescribed me Regestrone 5 mg, two tablets daily for 21 days again to stop this bleeding and even suggested Pause 500 mg as SOS. It has been five days since I am taking Regestrone 5 mg, two tablets daily but my period has not stopped. Do you think my period will stop after taking Regestrone twice or do I need Pause 500?","Doctor":"Hello. The bleeding that started after missing Regestrone (Norethisterone) for three days is your withdrawal bleed where endometrial shed has started because you missed daily pills. Now, this endometrium cannot be repaired again by Regesterone once the bleeding has started. So just stop Regesterone tablets and start Pause MF tablet (Tranexamic acid and Mefenamic acid) 500/250 twice a day for the next five days. These are antifibrinolytics and shall help in reducing and further stopping the bleeding. Please increase your daily water intake to 3 to 4 liters as dehydration can further cause bleeding and weakness. Once stopped, then you should be started on PCOD regimen for next three cycles from day three of your next menses to control your PCOD induced hormonal imbalance and anovulatory cycles which are often the causes of prolonged spotting and menorrhagia thereafter in PCOD untreated patients. Please follow up with your hormonal profile, thyroid profile, serum prolactin, and ultrasound pelvis to assess the severity of PCOD."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from unilateral headache for the last two months. I had an eye examination and that was fine. My blood tests were all normal. I have seen three doctors, my GP and two hospital doctors, who all say it is likely a benign headache or tension-type headache of some description. I have no other symptoms other than the pain. I was prescribed Naproxen 500 mg twice daily which helped for two weeks. Pain came back a week after stopping Naproxen, but more mild than before. Then went away for five days and returned. Now, Naproxen does not seem to help at all. Doctors have not been concerned enough to give me a scan, because I have no other symptoms and just the pain. Again, this has been going on for two months now and even on pain-free days while on naproxen I have still had brief one second flashes of pain at least a couple of times a day. I have no sickness or nausea or dizziness. I do not have a history of migraine.There is no pain behind my eye or tearing. I also have no anxiety or tension issues in my personal life to attribute to a headache. The pain is in my left temporal area. I feel some pressure, pinching pain and tightness. Sometimes, it is in the inner ear and sometimes I have pain on the top left of my head. Before I started the Naproxen, it was at its worst at bedtime when I laid down, but I slept pain free for a month while on the Naproxen. The pain is quite mild, but persistent. So, it is very annoying and always on my mind now that the Naproxen does not seem to work at all and I cannot rely on it for relief. Why would naproxen suddenly stop working?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

But he has great eye contact, responds to name, asks for help with something, babbling, says words like nah, dada, nana for banana, he will point to banana in the book and say it. That to me is pretty smart for a 15-month-old. Imitates, for example, claps hands understands when I say something like, hey Siri he looks straight at the phone. Waves bye we do not even face to say goodbye just I am going or when dad leaves for work and he waves. Loves cuddles sometimes he will gnaw in my arms and make noises.

Spend more time with the child and interact more often with him. Your child should be fine if your interaction with him is fine. Find age-appropriate toys and games for him.

Blood in stool is not a normal condition as you are having the problem for one year. It should be investigated in detail and the following work-up will be useful. Rectal, anal area examination, stool routine microscopic examination, proctoscopy examination, colonoscopy, if needed. If needed during colonoscopy, biopsy taken from the abnormal area if found for histopathology examination. This work-up will be helpful to rule out causes for blood in stool like a polyp, proctitis, piles, colitis, diverticulitis, any growth, if present, etc. If the color of blood in stool is of brown-red color than bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal tract. If colour is bright red then the cause for bleeding is from the lower gastrointestinal tract. So, from your provided history, this work-up should be done and above causes should be ruled out.

I have seen the pictures which have been uploaded and there is indeed gaping of the vaginal orifice with perineal laxity and also decreased mons pubis and labia mayoral fat pad (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Ideally, after postpartum, one is advised Kegel's exercises to tone the perineal muscles for 3 to 4 months if surgical correction is to be avoided. In your case, where air is seeping in and it is affecting your personal relationship as well, it is suggested that you should opt for a cosmetic gynecology procedure under aesthetic medicine called laser vaginal rejuvenation by thermiva (instrument name- you may search literature if need be), which can help correct the looseness of the vaginal walls circumferentially. Also, after re-evaluation of the results of the procedure after a month, then you can be considered for corrective vaginoplasty with perineoplasty with bilateral vulvoplasty, which would help you regain the aesthetics of the genital area and also your concerns could be addressed. Post-procedure you would be asked to avoid pregnancy for at least two years which would help the wall to repair and strengthen and results can be followed up in subsequent visits. So please meet a cosmetic gynecologist, get assessed and discuss your options in detail. Do not worry, this is correctable."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I get stomach pain and diarrhea after meals. I do not want to do a colonoscopy because the preparation will cause more diarrhea. Therefore I want to know what can be done without colonoscopy for diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hello. Colonoscopy is an invasive procedure in which we can see the lesions directly. If we have doubt then we can take a biopsy and also if any lesion needs to be treated means it can be treated immediately. It is diagnostic and therapeutic also. CT abdomen, ultrasound abdomen and barium swallow, etc., are available but not possible to take the biopsy or treat the lesions. So, please consult your gastroenterologist. He will examine and treat you accordingly. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have nerve pain between my left bum and left leg for the past two months.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Presently also stomach feeling full of gas. Light pain feeling in the morning. I have taken one tablet of gas in empty stomach. Rabiprazole with Domperidone. What to take for relief since office hours has started and I want to be fit.","Doctor":"Hello.  I can understand you had a terrible time due to this problem since yesterday. The gas production in bowel is a normal phenomenon and majorly produces on its own given the number of gas forming bacteria within human gut; however, there are certain foods and environmental triggers that can increase the gas production.  Foods containing cereals grains such as wheat, corn, maze, barley, oats, millets, and milk. Cauliflower and many others that even you can find out yourself. So your symptoms and just an overnight onset with worsening intensity suggest you probably have one of these gas producing food a day before yesterday. If you can find out the foods that make you feel gas; then it would be very easy to omit that diet from your diet and go well. It is fine to continue with the Rabiprazole for now, but I want to substitute another medication over Domperidone. Tablet Digestine 40 mg once daily before meals, you can increase the dose to twice daily before meals if you dont feel improvement in next 48 hours. Gas and bloating I can consider testing you thoroughly if your symptoms remain for a week or so and does not improve with the medications I prescribed.

There can be different reasons for urticaria-like infections, drugs or certain things in our foods like additives, etc., that can cause it. Most of the cases are idiopathic that is the reasons are not known. The most important thing in its treatment is to look for trigger factors that are causing it like what type of food do you eat? Certain foods like egg, meat, junk food, etc., can cause it, taking any drugs, etc. Oral antihistamine are the mainstay of treatment and we can increase the dosage of it if not cured.

It is not that I cannot see a thing but I cannot see clearly either as compared to my right eye. I can see fully clear when it is about 5 to 10 cm from my eye (letters) but it became blurry when the distance increases. Right eye is pretty fine but left eyes are not proper as right. So what kind of medication do I need?","Doctor":"Hi. If you having blurring of vision in one or both eyes first thing to do is get your eyes checked for refractive error, you might need glasses. And glasses will solve your problem. Other cause of blurring after an excess laptop or digital devices use may be dry eyes. People who sit in front of screens have a greater risk of having dry eyes. In such cases, artificial tears are needed. So, the first thing to do is visit your eye doctor and get your eyes examined for glasses and complete eye examination including the retinal exam."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently, I had an event that impacted my hearing. I threw a heavy chain into the metal bucket of a backhoe. The clank was quite loud and gave me instant ringing in my ears. I then had to use the backhoe, which is also loud, but not deafeningly so, for about 20 minutes. Now my ears feel blocked up as if from a cold or elevation changes, reducing the volume of the sounds I hear. Even tiny clanks, like from a fork on a plate, give my ears a slight spasm. The tinnitus has continued, diminishingly for about five days or so. My question is about the permanence of damage done, and the relationship between my current symptoms and damage. I should mention that I am quite sensitive to sound and can get tinnitus from noises other people find tolerable. The ear blockage phenomenon occurred one other time for me, after a music show, and lasted several months before returning to normal.","Doctor":"Hello. It is very common that people feel certain blockage of the ears after getting exposed to loud sounds. It is called fatigue to ear. The hair cells get fatigued due to loud sounds. It also indicates sensitivity towards hearing loss. It is recommended to avoid a noisy situation as it can lead to hearing loss sooner in your case as you are taking days to recover. Generally, a few hours are enough to recover. Use ear protective devices or ear-plugs in the future whenever you know that you are going to a place with loud noises. Currently, wait for a few more days. If you are not feeling better consult an audiologist. Try to blow your cheeks with your nose pinched and see if it helps to relieve the blocked feeling."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Three months back, I started to have a small red dry patch on the skin developed on my chin. I tried to keep it moisturized but it seemed to get very dry so I put some Hydrocortisone cream on it for a few days, it seemed like it was gone so I stopped using the cream but within a week it was back but bigger now. I used Hydrocortisone cream for a few more days then stopped for a few days and the same thing happened, only it was spreading by the corners of my mouth now. I tried putting Zinc diaper cream on it and my skin got very inflamed. At this point, I went to walk in clinic as I do not have a family doctor, he was not sure but thought it could be rosacea and gave me Metro gel prescription. I have been using it for about three weeks and the bumps have gone down, but not as much from the Metro gel and the fact that I stopped putting anything on my face, I only wash with Cetaphil and use Cerave moisturizer. I wear makeup for even one day the bumps start coming back all over my chin and around my mouth. I did not use any new products just the same old makeup face wash and moisturizer I had been using for years. The only thing I did differently was my skin was getting really dry so I used a microdermabrasion device just before the red patch developed.","Doctor":"Hi. From your picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is steroid induced rosacea or acneform eruption. Whatever was the original disease, you used steroid over it that altered the picture and now you have developed problem due to steroid (Hydrocortisone).

Now, regarding its management, you have to use a sunscreen of SPF 60, Metronidazole gel 0.75 % is correct treatment but mix it with cold cream and then apply, take non-sedating antihistamine tablet, once bumps will disappear then we will manage redness but in a step-wise manner. Wash your face with mild soap and water. Avoid Dettol and other irritants. Do not scratch or rub the lesion. Steroid induced rosacea, contact dermatitis, steroid induced acneform eruption.

For the face lesion, apply Clindamycin gel two times a day only on the raised red lesion. Lesion around the eye may take somewhat longer time to heal. Brown lesion on arms is due to sun and dryness.

Do not worry about the periods, as you are aware that delay in periods can be due to obesity as you had suffered last time, however my compliments to you for reducing 14 kg of weight (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so we can conclude that delay is not due to being overweight. Then delay can be due to hormonal changes due to various medications specially birth control pills, etc., which you are not taking.

If a schizophrenic patient is committing crimes will there be any pattern?","Doctor":"Hi. Delusions are fixed firm unshakable beliefs that are not in keeping with a person's cultural, social and educational background. If a person is deluded about something he has it 24x7. But that does not mean that all of his functionality will be gone. Except for the domain of the delusion, he may function well. For example, if a person is deluded about being followed and spied upon, he may still be good at his work. Speaking of criminal responsibility. Well, it is a tough thing to prove or disprove but theoretically, if a person is deluded about his wife but hunts down a deer because he wants its skin or horns, he will be responsible for his crime because, at that time, he was not having a delusion about that deer."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have bruxism and TMJ, and I just started using a mouth guard that I got from my dentist. I am concerned because when I wake up in the morning, I feel that my bite is different. My back teeth do not touch. However, after 1 or 2 hours my bite goes back to normal. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi. Do you wear your nightguard properly at night? If yes, then it is normal that you feel the gap between teeth. As it is the prime function of giving you nightguard that it does not let your teeth overlap firmly and deeply. This tray does not allow teeth of both arches to meet another and creates a gap of about 0.5 mm to 1 mm while you are wearing it. When you keep wearing it for a long time like 4 or 6 months it eventually creates this 0.5 mm gap in your TMJ that is the real achievement, now even when you do not wear the tray your teeth will not overlap deeply and will maintain some space in between. That is a good sign. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

They found grade M tear in GE junction and also mucosal atrophy reported. H-pylori was found in rapid urease test. I am on Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin and Esomeprazole medication for 14 days and I have three days of course left. I do not seem to be healing well and reflux is getting worse than before and I need to be able to control the inflammation as I am scared it will get worse. I am 40 years old otherwise fit male. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query in detail. Usually, reflux esophagitis is reported based on the Los Angeles classification, which does not have a grade called M, but going through the report it is mentioned minimal changes of reflux esophagitis with the lax sphincter. Your treatment for H. Pylori is appropriate based on the rapid urease test result. Usually, when a person has H. Pylori infection, the acid production is suppressed by the infection (chronic gastritis, mucosal atrophy is a sign of that). Once it starts getting cleared from the mucous membrane, it is quite common to find the reflux symptoms, especially heartburn worsening, because that acid production is improving due to clearance of infection from the mucosa, hence even though you may be on acid-suppressing agents you might have heartburn. It is a temporary phenomenon and would improve over the next couple of weeks. Kindly continue with the treatment and you may add 10 ml of Gaviscon syrup (if you are abroad you can get Gaviscon tablets too) to be taken three times after major meals for a week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem. My teeth are brittle because if I eat something hard they sometimes break or I would feel a hole developing and this is stressing me out because I have already taken out three of them and now another one is close to being totaled. Earlier today I ate something and I think it damaged them. I am tired of taking them out.","Doctor":"Hi. There must be one of a few reasons for this chipping off of teeth rapidly. You might have calcium and vitamin D deficiency. To rule out this, you can get serum vitamin D laboratory test done. If there is deficiency then I recommend you medicines for it. Another reason might be the hereditary cause, that means even when you maintain your oral hygiene, brush properly, eat less sugary stuff and chocolates, still teeth are breaking off suggests it is because of genes you have got from your parents or grandparents. They would be more prone to damage and their teeth would be weak as well. In this case, you cannot do anything but visit a dentist properly and get all services done before-hand to avoid further damage. Can you provide me with a clinical picture of teeth? So I may suggest accurately what should be your line of treatment. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had braces on my teeth when I was 15 years old. Now I am 24 and I can see a lot of gaps developing between my teeth. Should I put on braces again or is there any alternative option that I should choose?","Doctor":"Hi. You must not go for conventional orthodontic braces treatment for such gaps, instead, you should go for clear or invisible aligners orthodontic treatment for it. In it you do not have to get bracketing done but only an invisible tray will be given to wear that will close these minor gaps. Once gaps are closed in 6 to 8 months then get fixed retainers at back of your teeth so your case may not get relapsed. I hope you will be clear about it now."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Last weekend, I ended up in the ER department after an overdose on THC capsules. Very scary experience my heart was going crazy, very bad chest pain, shortness of breath, tremor, etc., for about five hours. I had an ECG done in the hospital which said sinus tachycardia. My blood was taken (all fine apart from low magnesium and potassium), chest X-ray was done (all fine). I was given Diazepam and on discharge had another ECG done and it said sinus rhythm although my heart bpm was still over 100 bpm. The doctor said it is probably due to anxiety and let me go. Two days after this experience, I started getting weird symptoms (slight pain in the chest, lightheadedness). So, I went to my doctor, he measured my blood pressure, heart bpm, etc., all fine but put this machine in between my hands and could see my heartbeat was irregular. He prescribed me Digoxin for five days to see if it would get it under control. I went back again because I was concerned about the lightheadedness, he again measured heart bpm, etc., all fine, listened to my chest and said it is back in more of a regular beat and prescribed Digoxin for five more days and to come back again but at the moment, he is not overly concerned. I think I do not have bradycardia or tachycardia but I think I could have developed Afib from my experience in the hospital, is this possible?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is possible, but a likely possibility is of ventricular ectopics (or other causes) rather than Afib which could also cause irregular heartbeats on the machine. Even in normal individuals, the machine may falsely show irregular beats. Few points which are against are fibrillations are normal ECG especially if you had it done while having symptoms, even examination by a doctor for pulse and auscultation will help in diagnosing Afib. Also, the pulse rate is expected to vary to a large extent and cross the 100 bpm. You may also feel irregularly beating heart within your chest. Also, you can keep a finger over the pulse and feel irregularity and missing pulse. So, it could be an ectopic which is now settling. The only way to definitely confirm is ECG. If this continues, you may a get an ECG done or buy a home-based rhythm monitor like Alivecor Kardia device which records the ECG for interpretation. So, overall unlikely to Afib, but either ECG or examination by the doctor can confirm this. The other cause for pain in such settings is gastritis or reflux, which can commonly cause such symptoms. Also, ectopics may cause pain as well. Anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. Have plenty of water and adequate intake. If you are having these drugs for a long time then the possibility of withdrawal should also be kept. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have recently been experiencing lower back problems on the right side of my back. I work out a lot and have been working out for some time now and I generally do a range of heavy to mid-weight sets quite often. I remember initially feeling this pain immensely while squatting (was wearing a belt). Which I thought was just a muscle strain so I reverted to doing other back exercises that day. After leaving the gym, I remember the pain and soreness (I would say more soreness than pain) persisting for about a day and did not feel anything after. However, recently, I was walking and somewhat slipped on some ice. I never fell, but because of the sudden jerk, I felt that pain in my lower back on the right side immensely once again. This pain generally always comes and goes and it is usually during back exercise or sudden jerks. Therefore, I was wondering if in your opinion do you think this would be a problem regarding a strain of a muscle or a disc problem in my lower spine. If so, should I have an X-ray done to confirm?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for providing a brief history. As per me, it looks like the paraspinal muscles are getting over excited to safeguard the spine and the ligaments of the intervertebral joints are also getting over excited due to the weight lifting. There should be a proper guiding before doing any kind of heavy weight lifting and also there should be enough of the core muscles strength before doing one. This pain which is on and off is a red signal for the spinal column. Taking up and MRI should be really worth rather taking up an X-ray. As this pain is only while doing movements I will highly recommend to take up the MRI and get back with the reports. Gym. MRI. Sacroiliitis. Degenerative disc disease. Stop the gym for a week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Emergency contraceptives either work by preventing or delaying ovulation or implantation of a fertilized egg. So, it depends on how early is it taken after unprotected intercourse, or what period of the cycle is it taken. Vomiting, diarrhea, some medicines do affect the efficacy, unfortunately. In your case, since you used vaginal film also, chances of pregnancy are bleak. But to rule out all chances, please do a pregnancy test, if you miss your periods.

Usually, they are not hereditary but very rarely 1 out of 100,000 cases, it can be genetic. Once cured after surgery they do not occur at the same place but in your case, one cannot guarantee you that it will not occur again.

Actually fibroscan is three stage in fatty liver. Should I take fibroscan?","Doctor":"Hi. I just went through your symptoms and I also saw your laboratory investigation reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your liver function test enzymes are very normal and you do not have to worry about it. The second thing is your hepatitis B surface antigen is reactive which means you are hepatitis B positive. At this point in time, what you have to do is go for a further evaluation with viral load and you will have to take care of hepatitis B treatment. You do not need to get fibroscan. You do not have to get it done at present. Instead, if you have an ultrasonogram or CT scan of the whole abdomen that might be able to tell you if you have any underlying lesions in the liver."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 3.5 years old daughter's upper front four teeth have decayed very badly and our dentist has advised on either root canal treatment or taking them out. Which treatment is best suited overall for my daughter?","Doctor":"Hi. Go for antibiotic coverage and meanwhile get the culprit teeth extracted if it is definitely amongst the first four. These are milk teeth which will come at age of 6. Do not get them extracted together. The one or two causing severe infection should be extracted out. Another option is to cover infection through medicines only. Give your daughter syrup Augmentin three times a day, syrup Metronidazole three times a day and syrup Brufen three times a day for seven days. If the swelling goes away with it, everything is back to normal, leave it as it is. If pain and swelling recur once medicines are stopped, try getting chamber opened or root canal of the culprit tooth if the infection is minor, if it is major then get it extracted. I would still recommend having root canal attempted on posterior milk teeth rather than the front because front permanent teeth come at around age 6 while back milk teeth fall at age of 9 and 10 and are definitely needed till this age so do not need to be extracted soon. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old girl. I have had thyroid problems since I was around 11.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Just before sleeping at 11:30 AM, I took two Panadol advance pills and one Muscerol 3 pill altogether. I have not eaten for the last five hours earlier. Later that night, I woke up around 2 AM feeling nausea which lasted for a few minutes. Since then, it has been three days feeling upper stomach pain, especially in the morning. This pain vanishes once I am eating but returns mildly afterward. Other important information. It was the first time I am taking Muscerol 3. I am not a person who takes heavy medication regularly. I take Panadol pills when I am feeling very sick only. I do not have a previous diagnosis of ulcers.","Doctor":"Hello. The drugs that you mentioned all contain NSAIDs. These drugs are known to damage stomach mucosal lining and cause gastritis. I would suggest to minimise these drugs. You can use some over-the-counter antacids like Pantoprazole or Ranitidine available at stores along with syrup Gaviscon for a couple of days. If symptoms persist, you should get yourself examined by a gastroenterologist locally."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son has a persistent headache since last 15 days. It started with headache. Consulted various neurologist. Got MRI and CT done, all clear. He gave various medicines, even Noxdorm 250, but no response.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that his symptoms could be related to a tension-type headache. Coming to this point, I agree with the doctors prescription about Citalopram and Sibelium (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But these drugs may need up to two weeks to show its effects. For this reason, you should be patient. If the situation does not improve in a couple of weeks, I would recommend trying Amitriptyline and Valproate combination. You should discuss with his doctor about these treatment options. Based on his test reports, I would conclude about a primary headache (benign, related to psychological stress)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an extraction and an implant placed for tooth ​13 about six weeks ago, and I am supposed to get a crown placed on the implant in about six more weeks. Sadly, apparently due to the change in my bite caused by having number 13 tooth, a bottom tooth broke through an old filling in the 14 tooth and cracked the tooth, and I was experiencing constant low-level pain in that tooth. My dentist drilled out the old filling and filled the tooth eight days ago, and he said I still have a crack he could see, but does not know how deep it goes. He wants to try to wait for six weeks and do the crown for the 13 implant and 14 at the same time. He said I may need a root canal for 14 or possibly extraction, and he would know more when he drills it for the crown, and he said I should contact him if the pain gets bad. I had a lot of pain for three days after he drilled and refilled the tooth, and then the pain got much better, but yesterday, day seven after he drilled and refilled, I had very intense pain, and it still hurts a lot today. Does the pain mean I need a root canal (or extraction). Or is there a good chance the tooth will still be fine with just a crown? Also, if the crack in 14 is really deep and extraction is recommended, can I add a second crown for 14 to the implant I already had placed for 13? I have read that you definitely can put two crowns on one implant, but I was not sure if that requires the implant to be centered between the crowns. In this case, the implant would be off center, directly under the 13 crown.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for giving all appropriate history. Tooth 14 that is having intense pain is indicating for root canal treatment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If it would be a crack deep down to root you would be having sharp pain when you bite from it, otherwise pain would be mild. But in root canal case, you would be experiencing sharp lancenating pain and throbbing pain in continuous manner that increases when you lay down straight at bed. Moreover, your dentist will check clinically after opening the chamber of tooth that it is going for root canal or extraction. Again I would say from your given history I am suspecting it to be root canal case. Now, if it would be root canal of 14, then everything would be good as 13 will have cap on implant and 14 will have cap on root canal treated tooth. But ,in case of extraction you can surely have two crowns on support of 13. As a single implant is able to support atleast three crown in anterior segment of jaw and two definitely in posterior segment. Be easy with it. Hopefully, there will be no need of involving any third tooth in bridge cover. It would be best if you can provide me with clinical picture of both teeth and radiograph of the quadrant that is under procedure, so that I can suggest you more accurately."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My ECG is attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I regularly have high BP medicines. At present, my BP is normal.","Doctor":"Hi. The ECG shows that you have a fast heart rate of around 120 bpm (100 is the upper limit normal at rest). This could be because you had the ECG immediately after walking long distance or not had adequate rest before you had the ECG. If this is done at rest (that is at least 10 minutes rest) then you need to start taking some medications to control the heart rate or increase the dose if you are already on one of those medicines. It is worth keeping an eye on your heart rate regularly to make sure that it is not a one off fast heart rate."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently had a full blood count done and would like a second opinion on the results. It was my cholesterol which surprised me. I have never suffered from high cholesterol but over the past three years, it has kept up and recent tests showed serum cholesterol 7 mmol/L/HDL, 1.25 mmol/L/LDL, 5.07 mmol/L, triglycerides 1.5 mmol/L. This surprised me as my cholesterol two years ago was 5.0 mmol/L and I gave up all meat four years ago. I am 45 years old, eat healthy, exercise 3 to 4 times a week. I find it weird that my cholesterol has gone up when I have given up meat though there does seem to be a family trait in my mother's side for high cholesterol. I have also been reading a lot recently that views on cholesterol are changing and studies show that it is not directly linked now to saturated fats and heart disease. The other test I wanted to briefly discuss was my liver results. My doctor said they were all fine. I have looked at them and they all do seem to be fine except I noticed my Bilburin level was up a bit to 24 umol/L which sits just outside of the norm. My doctor mentioned nothing about this. Is it a concern?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. I have gone through the reports you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, your cholesterol is high especially LDL. This is more worrisome. Cholesterol runs in family. So, despite a healthy lifestyle, some patients fail to reduce cholesterol. Please let me know your weight, your height, any alcohol habit, are you taking any lipid-lowering drug? Please reply me answers to the above-asked questions, so that I can guide you better.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a recurring ailment that I usually get once or twice per winter. It starts with extreme shivering and overheating, but no fever. Day two usually involves a very dry nose, very low energy, and heightened sensitivity to touch or light. Days 3 to 5 usually involve more traditional sinusitis symptoms of a headache and sore throat, in addition to the dry nose. Days 3 to 5 also cause an orange or white cobblestoning pattern in my throat due to my lymph nodes. I would like to know whether you think this is bacterial or viral, whether or not it is contagious, and whether or not it can be prevented.","Doctor":"Hi. Most of these attacks start as a viral infection and then become complicated by bacterial infection. These attacks are hard to be prevented completely but the use of seasonal influenza vaccines are helpful and can decrease the number of the attacks. Flu vaccines are taken before the winter season by 2 to 3 months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, 3 to 4 years ago, I remember myself being very flexible, but now I am not.

I also suffer from shin splints a lot (very common). Please, can you tell me how to prevent these things and increase my flexibility? Aside from this, I have started to lift weights, to try to build up biceps. My wrists seem to hurt whenever I do it meaning I have to stop. Is there any other way of building biceps or is it something else which I am not doing right.","Doctor":"Hi. You are playing a very active game that requires stamina as well as muscle strength.

Three years ago, I sprained my right ankle (inversion), by jumping over a fence and landing on the outside of my ankle. I had never sprained my ankle before, so I did not understand the appropriate treatment and recovery. So, three days later, when I could put weight on my ankle I started playing football again. I sprained my ankle again. This process happened for six months, I would think I had a full recovery, but then I would roll my ankle again. The next year I sprained my left ankle, but I knew the recovery process so it recovered much better than the right one. Although I have not rolled my ankle this year, both ankles feel very weak and I feel it could roll anytime. I change direction during hockey or just simple jogging. Could you please tell me how to strengthen my ankles, so they become normal again?","Doctor":"Hello. Giving a brief into the ligament injury which happens in the ankle. Usually, ankle injuries are ignored. Also, no proper rehabilitation is done for the same. So ankle becomes prone to injuries again and again. Let me put in this way. Ligaments do not heal as a soft tissue again but a fibrosed one which is more rigid than the original ones. Coming to your concern about the ankle joint stability. I will recommend you to follow the exercise because the ankle is the joint which had to bear the whole body weight. Using the Rocker bottom board initially for correction of the muscle imbalances is the first step to regain stability. This is level one of the training which I follow in my clinics for sports injuries. The next level goes to the wobble board training which is the second level of training and this gives the utmost outcome scores with great stability of the ankle joint and correction of muscle imbalances. You should focus on using this board and do strengthening of the upper limbs and lower limbs along with the core. It is completely a sports rehabilitation program as you are an athlete, so having an injury for you again is not affordable either to you or the game. Sports injury. MRI ankles. Ankle sprain.

Let me first evaluate it. See splenic hamartomas are usually benign that is non-cancerous. Similarly, are renal angiomyolipomas. They are removed with surgical excision if they are causing any hematological disorders, a decline in renal functions. A lot of surgeons recommended the removal of these structures. A lot may not recommend you. At this point of time, your wife needs further evaluation.

The more you have to understand is you have to face problem step by step, like if you have fear talking to people then start it with imagining them on call then with one person, two person and so on. This is the way to overcome that situation. Because of nervousness, you have lost the important things in your work. You have to start reverse counting when you getting anxious. For remembering things, you should be attentive for a particular task but because of nervousness, you cannot concentrate on that particular task. So, that you cannot remember about that.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

It is located directly between my thigh and vulva. I was also diagnosed with gutate psoriasis last year and have had a mild rash or skin discoloration on my back ever since (during the original outbreak the spots were all over my torso and some in the pubic region).

If you still feel pain or discomfort during the surgery, it can be converted into general anesthesia.

Do you think we still need to do Gtube for her or what are the other suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi. You can use NJ tube in the meanwhile till the problem persists. With the growing age, eventually, things should be fine. The other options that you can discuss with your treating physician are: 1. Thickening of feeds. 2. Using Gaviscon (an antacid medication that creates a layer of foam above the ingested food and reduces the discomfort of the child). 3. Use of Mosapride (to be done as last resort). The above medications must be given with PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) and gastric emptying medications for better effects. You can start intermittent oral feeding and NJ tube feeding for some time and observe how things go. The most important thing to monitor would be the child's weight and the bouts of vomiting or coughing she has.

With normal regular periods, sex drive remains high and normal menstrual blood flow also continues but as this disturbs sex libido, menstrual flow, mood variation, all appear. If you gradually transfer your child to home-made child food then gradually reduce breastfeeding and start combined oral contraceptive pills to have hormonal support and regular periods. Try to have a balanced diet, weight and BMI and daily exercise to have normal BMI. Have recreational activities and quit recreational drugs. Listen to music, watch a movie, go for an outing before planning sex, have long foreplay with proper orgasm. As you are breastfeeding, so prolactin level will be high.

It shows two lines one dark pink and second light pink. I have checked two times but same results. I have done an ultrasound, but it does not show pregnancy in the report. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read the description of your problem. There can be three explanations for this. 1. Either it is an evaporation line (if have you have checked it very late than the time mentioned to check on the kit which is a false positive result). 2. Or this could be a very early stage of pregnancy where the levels are not sufficient enough to be detected in urine so gives a faint positive test, obviously at this stage usually the pregnancy may or may not be detected on USG (ultrasound). 3. Or the third possibility is that this is a very early pregnancy which is failing. If you could give a little bit more details about your previous menstrual cycles, the date of your last periods, and when the scan is done, it could have helped to narrow down the possibility.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

The symptoms I encounter after the incident are as follows. I am feeling very tired from day 10, and I think it as stress. From day 12, I am having some sort of difficulty in breathing and numbness all over the body. On day 14, I have experienced itch inside the penis with clear watery discharge like urine, and it lasted only for a few days. On day 17, I had fever and headache which was cured in a day with treatment. I got an itchy rash on the chest, back, face and scalp on the 19th day. It lasted for about five days and got reduced, but still remains some. Then other symptoms persist till date which occurred gradually are sore throat, lower back pain, abdominal pain, joint pain, coating on tongue, bumps on back of tongue, red spot on tongue with irritation, itchy legs and hands without rash, blurred vision, painful itchy and sore armpit, thigh, genital area and buttock areas. I have attached the photos, please have a look. Do these symptoms suggest acute HIV infection? Or can it be other STDs? I have undergone the following tests to check HIV. Rapid blood test on day 19 and the result was negative, and I repeated the same test on day 35 and that too negative. My partner tested in front of me one day before sex, and it was negative. He claimed that he is clear and safe. But, he said that he had one partner three or four months ago and also many partners before. If my partner is truly clear and safe and I am HIV negative, then what cause all these symptoms? My doctor said I have very similar symptoms of acute HIV which makes me freaked out and nervous. I made mistake to have unprotected sex with him. I am going to get married soon. I will decide my marriage according to my HIV test result only. Please answer my questions and give advice. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for providing the clinical pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would try to provide you with the best possible answers to your questions. The symptoms you have mentioned for example fever, general feeling of not being well, vague body aches may be a hint of acute HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) syndrome. They may also, in reality, be hypochondriacal that is due to stress and you are giving a lot of importance to them. The skin eruption that you mentioned and the pictures are suggestive of urticaria or hives. This may also see even as a response to mild fever or medicines that you may have taken or may even erupt in absolutely healthy people. Itchiness without any lesions in the groin area may be due to sweat, exacerbated by stress levels. The prominence of tongue swelling is nothing abnormal. They are the normal lingual papillae which mean that normal texture of the tongue present in all. When a person is psychologically stressed, often these normal tongue markings are interpreted as being abnormal. So, do not worry about this. Genital discharge you mentioned may or may not be normal. You must attend an STD (sexually transmitted disease) or STI (sexually transmitted infection) specialist to get yourself checked for the discharge, which may be a sign of urethritis - infection of the urethra. For this, a urethral swab or swab dipped in the discharge will be taken to rule out. Having said that, the possibility of acute HIV syndrome cannot be ruled out with 100% certainty based on these symptoms, although apparently, the chances are too low. Yes, you can contract HIV even from a single exposure. The risk is moderate, from being the passive partner and allowing unprotected intercourse and passage of your partner's seminal fluid into your anorectal mucosa. Further, your partner agreed to have been promiscuous himself. A rapid HIV test is just a modification of the standard ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test. The only difference between rapid and standard HIV test is that the results are given out within 20-30 minutes of having given the blood sample in rapid test module whereas have to wait for a period of a week for the results in the standard test protocol. The more confirmatory test would be a western blot or p24 antigen assay or HIV RNA PCR. These tests can confirm or rule out HIV within a maximum of 12 days of the last suspected exposure. So, get them done to put your mind at peace. My final advice does not panic. Visit an STD-HIV specialist as soon as possible for evaluation of the genital discharge and request to get the fourth generation test done. Also, the additional blood tests mentioned below. Get back to us with the report of these tests and take treatment for urethritis, if it is confirmed. No need to panic even if your fourth generation test comes out positive for HIV. It takes an average of 10 years for HIV positivity to convert into AIDS syndrome. And with a healthy lifestyle, positive thinking and available anti-HIV drugs, most patients who have full-blown AIDS, are also able to live healthy in the present medical era. Have you been vaccinated for hepatitis B? You must get tested for hep B and C and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory) syphilis. If you have not been vaccinated for hep B, get vaccinated as soon as possible. Maintain good oral hygiene. Your tongue seems to be coated due to lack of oral hygiene. Use a mild cleansing mouth wash and also get your tongue swab tested for fungus. 1. Fourth generation HIV testing assay. 2. Western blot test. 3. Urethral discharge or urethral swab evaluation for gonococcal and non-gonococcal infections. 4. Additional blood tests - serology for hepatitis B (HBsAg -hepatitis B surface antigen test) and hepatitis C (Anti-HCV - hepatitis C virus antibodies), VDRL. 5. Tongue swab for fungus. Always use protection in the form of condom for any sexual activity. Never trust any sexual partner about his/her promiscuous nature or HIV status."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is suffering from severe neck pain for the past year. Her doctor believes it might be arthritis, but he is not sure. She even got several shots in her neck for pain by a physical therapist but nothing seems to be working. My mother got her first MRI scan done a week back without contrast medium. She was extremely pleased with the way the doctor conducted the investigation. He was very quick to respond and did a commendable job. No serious issues were observed in the MRI scan. Today my mother got another MRI scan done, both with and without contrast medium. Can you please read this MRI scan and also let me know if there is any sign of cancer in the neck area. I have attached my mother's MRI reports for your reference. Kindly have a look and guide me. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I had a detailed look at the contrast images of your mother (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There appears to be light gray to black areas seen in the central portion of T1 and the left side of T2 vertebral bodies. These findings were not clearly seen in the previous scan. There was even a vague appearance seen in a small portion of the C7 vertebra on the right side of the body, but nothing abnormal as such. After a thorough examination of the contrast pictures of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), I observed, that the contrast sequences do not highlight the lesion, just the way it should in case of a tumor or cancerous area present. It seems to be due to marrow changes. According to my knowledge, on T2 sequence, it happens to be non specific, benign signal abnormalities seen in more than one vertebra which may not cause severe pain on the left side of neck. I would like to suggest you to get another MRI scan in a period of three to six months time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 2 year old daughter has a bald patch on head.

I presume it as tinea capitis or simply a fungal infection of the scalp. Do not worry, hair can regrow again and there is no permanent damage. It is common in children. It is very important to start the following early for best results: Before we commence treatment, wash baby cap or cloth coming in contact with the baby's head in hot water with some antiseptic.

The feeling of insects crawling inside your body is mainly a psychological condition known as delirium. There are no tests or investigations to prove it.

I was healthy when I walked in and then, not even for a single day I felt well. When I was given my epidural, my heart rate shot up to 150 and you could see it beating from the outside. They took it out and replaced it. The anesthesiologist said he must have hit a blood pocket. What does that mean? The epidural caused my BP to drop every time I lay on my left side. My baby's heart rate dropped every time I lay on my right side. After what felt like an hour, they made me lay on my left and gave me a shot to keep my BP up. Is that normal? Because I stayed on my left side, I could not move or feel anything on that side but could feel everything on my right side. I now have migraines, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, and fibromyalgia, all on my left side. Could the issues I have now have been caused by the issues with the epidural? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Maybe unintentionally epidural needle must have hit a blood vessel in epidural space and so needle was withdrawn and reinserted in order to place it in epidural space avoiding blood vessel. Hypotension in pregnancy may be caused by supine hypotension syndrome and also due to regional anesthesia. So you were placed in left lateral position and you were given an injection to keep your BP up. It is not unusual to have these situations and are treatable. The issues you have mentioned are due to a spine problem most likely prolapsed intervertebral disc, etc., and very less likely due to epidural. May require MRI of the lumbosacral spine to diagnose. Need to consult an orthopedic surgeon."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 4 months old and this is what's been going on with her need answers or if over reacting.

The b-ultrasound heart is normal, amniotic fluid is less than normal, domestic doctors recommend termination of pregnancy. I wanted to consult if there is another way to keep the baby.","Doctor":"Hi. If you have been experiencing an outflow of amniotic fluid since 10 days and now bleeding for a day then only this history is showing the history of preterm premature rupture of membranes that can lead to chorioamnionitis (infection within the womb) and intrauterine fetal death as well. Utrasound confirms this rupture and leaking of amniotic fluid by measuring fluid amount within the uterus (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It might be possible that you will get labor like pain and cervical changes in recent future that could lead to the delivery of the fetus. You should have related tests to immediately check infection, scan to properly measure cervical length to check any changes locally, fetal viability and the exact amount of amniotic fluid remains inside uterus. Complete blood count for checking leucocytes count (shows infection), C-reactive protein and need to start antibiotics and to have immediately speculum examination and a litmus test for confirming leaking. If blood tests confirm infection, the only option will be the termination of pregnancy. If amniotic fluid already come out, that means protection for fetus has gone and any time it can lead to an infection that could be hazardous. Early or late either cervical changes will occur itself or due to infection will urgently need to terminate the pregnancy with antibiotics cover. As per your description, gestational age is 23 weeks at which lungs development is in very very early stage and the fetus is not completely reached at viability age so it is count as a fetal loss not stillbirth of the viable fetus. So, it is almost impossible to try for the survival of 23 weeks fetus. The infection can harm you as well. It can lead to severe sepsis even need of ICU admission, if not treated well. CBC, C-reactive protein, ESR, scan, save serum, blood grouping, and cross-matching. Need antibiotics cover. Detailed examinations to confirm the rupture of membranes. Follow tests reports. If membranes rupture, confirmed with or without infection, will need termination to avoid complications like severe sepsis. All investigations should be done now in the tertiary care center."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old, my height is 166 cm and my weight is 54 kg. I am a female.

I have a healthy weight, do not have any eating disorders, have not been under lots of stress or anything similar lately. I am just so scared. Feels like period cramps but less intense. Been going on for days. I really do not know what to do. I do not want to go to a gynecologist. I am afraid and really not ready for that. I just want all this to go away and to get my period back. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. According to your history and symptoms, it seems that nothing is wrong with your body system. Sometimes, periods get disturbed. Your symptoms are pointing towards signs of PMS and I feel that you are panicked by the situation which is making the condition worse. I would suggest that you have not to worry about it and just wait for a few more days. Hopefully, your cycle would resume by itself because unrecognized stress results in delaying of the cycle."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Injured foot in football four days back, badly bruised, very little pain but now have no movement in the fourth toe.","Doctor":"Hello. Sorry to hear about the injury. The first thing you should do now is to take an X-ray for a safety case. Ignoring cannot be beneficial. Usually, the fracture is uncommon but still have to take an X-ray to rule out any fracture possibility. Also, for now, do icing and stabilize the part. In case if it is fracture you may find some discoloration of the skin in that area and need immediate attention. Always use the RICE protocol in injuries which can avoid major damage to soft tissue. Please take up an X-ray and if X-ray reveals no fracture then we can guide for home care therapy for the same. Please get back after taking up an X-ray. Sports injury. X-ray. Fracture. Ligament sprain. RICE. Immobilize the part."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Almost 5 years back, my father had an operation for a brain tumor in the left tempero-parietal region. He had Dexamethasone injections 12 mg and radiation on a linear accelerator 51 and 45. After two years, he had a CT and everything was fine. He even walked. But, when we started lowering the dose of the hormone he stopped walking. He took those 12 mg for five months. Now, he has steroid diabetes and retinopathy. We lowered the dose of Dexamethasone slowly and currently, it is 0.88. Now his bile production is bad and his stool is yellow. When the dose was 0.96 everything was fine with the bile. He takes Essentiale three times a day, Pankreatin 8000 thrice daily, Omez 20 mg once a day, Ascorutin thrice daily and Citrocalcium. When we lowered the dose of the evil hormone to 0.88, the bile problem started. When we started to give double the dose of Essentiale, everything started to be fine again. But, with the usual dose again the problem has come. Because of this hormone his sugar level does not drop. He is getting Insulin injection and the sugar level is 5.2. My questions are does the gall problem occur because of Dexamethasone? Is there any medicine to restore adrenal cortex function? How can one stop taking this hormone? How can we make him walk again? Will he ever be fully functional again? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I would like to know a few things very clear here. From your history, I gather that he had surgery on the brain and was on steroids post-op. And also he received radiotherapy. For what condition the brain surgery was done? He might be having what is called as steroid-induced diabetes and for which Insulin is the treatment. Steroids can harm the liverover time, but they would have been prescribed because the benefit at that time was more than the harm that would have been caused. We need to know the clinical improvement with reduced dose for further reduction. There are no medicines that can restore the adrenal cortex function. His steroid production is suppressed due to exogenous steroids. It needs tapering and then if possible can be stopped. I can comment on his recovery only after knowing his exact detail of the medical procedure done and the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I have been having some issues with my penis. At first, a month ago I thought I had balanitis and so I used Terrarisil balanitis cream but I have only used a few times and now I see that one of my veins got swollen and it feels like it aches a little. I do not know what to do with both these issues. Can I treat myself at home before it gets worse?","Doctor":"Hi. I would like to know your age, are you sexually active? To me it looks like Mondor disease, a condition in which veins get swollen for which there can be many reasons like penile injury, sexual activity, etc. The condition is treatable. You have to take oral antibiotic and pain killer along with antihistamine. Mondor disease. Tablet Co-Amoxiclav 1 gm BD for one week, tablet Ibuprofen or Aspirin for one week. Non-sedating antihistamine tablet. Maintain hygiene of the area, wash with soap and water."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am currently awaiting a call from my doctor on my ultrasound results. However, I am concerned about my ultrasound report and I am impatient now. The radiologist's notes on my pelvic ultrasound were as follows. CX appears WNL AS VIS. ENDOM appears thickened, complex with increased vascularity and could not define any solid mass at this time. Left ovary with hypoechoic area. Right ovary appears WNL AS VIS. Blood flow to the bilateral ovary. No FF seen. Does it seem like a normal prognosis? Or do I have a reason to be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi.I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The cervix appears normal. This is the mouth of the uterus and is normal. The inner layer of the uterus is called the endometrium. It is thickened but there is no measurement given. It is also described as a complex appearance with increased blood flow. The left ovary probably shows a follicular cyst and is normal. The right ovary is normal. No free fluid is seen in the pelvis. This is a normal finding. Keeping in mind the increased endometrial thickening with vascularity, many possibilities exist including the following If there was a pregnancy sometime in the past, less likely since your test is negative, then retained products of conception might be considered in the differential diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 36 year old male. I am suffering with OCD and I stammer for past 15 years along with laziness and tiredness all the time. My appetite is not good and so my weight is approximately 53 to 55 kg only. I have changed many psychiatrists in last 15 years. I had Nexito 20 mg, Ciplar 40 mg and Lonazep 25 mg twice a day and a capsule Performax for libido under doctor supervision. Few days back I went to a physician and I told him about my issues. He prescribed me Fluoxetine 20 mg to take in the morning and Nexito 10 mg at night that is 2 SSRIs together. After which my libido was totally reduced. I am single now. So, what should I tell to my partner about my issues? First of all, should I tell or not? Because medications can be life-long and I do not like either my partner or in-laws questioning me for that after marriage. My parents and friends advised me not to tell anything now. Second thing, as I told you, in the past I was having good libido but now it become less. Earlier I used to masturbate regularly but now once in two weeks. Should I get this issue solved before marriage? I had an affair in the past. After break up, sometimes I feel like does not want to mingle with anyone. I faced a lot of negativity in my life and still not able to prepare myself completely for marriage. Please give a genuine marriage.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read the query, and I can understand your concern. You have OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and co-morbid anxiety. The combination of Fluoxetine 20 mg and 10 mg Escitalopram (Nexito) was totally irrational. It is not advisable to take two SSRIs (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) at the same time. Both drugs have the same mechanism of action so using two drugs together increase the risk of side effects only. This was the probable reason that you suffered a loss of libido. In my opinion, there is no need to tell your future partner about the issues related to libido. You can tell your future partner about issues only related to OCD. Anxiety disorders are not the contraindication for marriage. Your libido was normal, and I do not think there should be any problem in the marriage. One broken affair should not cause any hurdle in marriage. One should move away from any past. You are young and have a whole life ahead. Getting married will improve your mood and anxiety. So do not afraid of marriage. Try to look for good examples and avoid thinking about negativity. Ignore anything that causes negative effects on you. It is common in OCD patients to have ambivalence about anything. Try to remain relaxed, these thoughts will reduce with time. Continue to take medicine regularly. Spend at least an hour for exercise, and you will see improvement in mood. The negative thoughts are due to OCD symptoms and depression. With treatment, these symptoms will decrease."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 30 years old. My weight is 140 lbs and height is 6'3\\". I am doing a computer-based job. My diet is poor for the past 2-1/2 years. As I often work at night my sleep too gets disturbed. I am single and never had sexual contact with anyone. There is no history of skin disease, smoking and alcohol. My current issue is, I have a wart-like growth on the penis. It is located on the shaft, middle of penis, slightly towards the right side. I have this for over 20 years. It has never been carried over or has affected any other area of my body. There are no such growths anywhere in my body. I first observed it when I was 8 or 9 years old. It was neither painful nor caused discomfort. It is a flat, long hard mass appears as if inserted into pinched skin. Three years back, I had a very slight negligible discomfort after a long period of erection. When I was pinching, it came out of the sleeve of skin. It was growing in and detached from the body. It actually did not grow down into the penis, rather perpendicular. Six days ago, I had a long period of erection. Afterwards, the sensation of very slight pinching, localized pain focused on a few millimeters deep where the growth is. It is still there, but not bothering me much. But, this time it is slightly higher on the sensation scale and it is not going away. I have noticed some increase in the width. I am trying to keep it clean by frequent washing. There has never been any bleeding, redness on or around the affected area. It does not cause any problems in full erection. In fact, I feel less discomfort in full erection. Is this a wart? Is this dangerous? Would it be contagious to my sex partner? I am scared of surgery and I really prefer something non-invasive. Please suggest any topical cream or oral medication? What would be the expected time frame of recovery? Is prevention possible? It is quite close to the dorsal vein. Would it have any effect on the neurovascular bundles? Please see all the attached images. I am paranoid and scared because I think this will make my life very hard.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and relevant pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I appreciate the same. As I can see that you do not have any signs of wart or contagious disease, please relax. The lesion you are having is just a dilated hair follicle or pore which is not dangerous. It is similar to a black head seen on the face, but a bigger one. It is commonly seen as a single lesion and forms a canal in the skin which contains skin debris that is frequently shed. Occasional pain or irritation is because of the debris hardening and poking to the stretched skin. There is no topical treatment for this as the creams cannot reach till root of the canal. The only effective way is to get it excised and sutured. It is a very simple and affording procedure with hardly any recurrences. Please go ahead with the surgery as it does cause irritation during erection and intercourse."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a bent penis that causes pain and dissatisfaction. Please suggest me a solution.","Doctor":"Hi. A downward bent of the penis is an absolutely normal variation and is present in 15% - 30% of men. It will be a problem only when it is extremely bent and difficult to penetrate. Pain in the penis can be because of anxiety. If it has been since a long time, then there are chances of it being a cause of urethritis or some scarring in the musculature of penis known as Peyronie's disease. You do not have to worry unless erection is normal. I would suggest you consult a urologist for physical evaluation to check whether the bent in the penis is a normal physiological variation or not. Stay calm and do not get tensed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have disc desiccation. There is a pain in my right leg while walking.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Yes, serum potassium of 5.5 mEq is a bit high. The usual range of serum potassium is 3.5 to 5 mEq/L. Although 5.5 mEq/L is not that high to produce symptoms, but as your query suggested you are feeling the irregular heartbeat, I would suggest you get an ECG (EKG) done at the earliest.

I just went through your blood reports and urine protein examination in blood reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your hemoglobin level seems to be normal 12.5 also and then other components like white blood cells, red blood cells platelets all are within normal limits. Your liver function test is also quiet normal, nothing is to be worried. Coming to your kidney function your creatinine also seems to be quiet normal.

I just recently discovered that I have scoliosis. I do not know much about it but I will tell you what I know. My scoliosis currently has only a 3-degree curve and I am pretty confident it is a C shaped curve, although I am not sure. What do you think are the chances that my scoliosis will develop into adulthood? Do you think it will stop progressing once I am fully grown?","Doctor":"Hello. Before going into the progress of scoliosis, I would like to make you some clarity about the facts on it. 1) The Cobb angle is a measure of the curvature of the spine in degrees. This helps to determine what type of treatment is necessary. A Cobb angle of 10 degrees is regarded as a minimum angulation to define scoliosis. 2) A scoliosis curve of 10 to 15 degrees normally does not require any treatment except for regular check-ups. 3) If the scoliosis curve is 20 to 40 degrees, the orthopedic doctor will prescribe a back brace help to keep the spine from developing more of a curve. 4) More than 45 degrees need correction surgery keeping many pedicle screw and osteotomy to correct the curve. I hope you go for x ray done of your spine and it will be easy to measure properly about the curvature."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Age of the child: 20 Months Gender: Male Weight: 12 Kilograms Height: 30 inches Started Walking: 15 Months Started Sitting: 5 months Started Crawling: 12 months Problem: My baby has started walking at the age of 15 months and is very active. He runs, jumps, rolls, and can climb stairs with the help of an adult. And can speak 2 words sentences. The problem we are facing is a balance issue. He is an active child but has an issue in maintaining good posture and is easy to fall. When standing straight and static an observer can feel that he is dizzy and swings slightly left and right to maintain the balance. He also has lazy neck control. At 2 months of age he suffered from “Torticollis” which we have managed to minimize by exercises recommended by other pediatrics. He also has digestion problems since birth and has loose motion after 1 week. He has also slight drooling. My question: Is this balance probelm common in this age group or should we choose to consult an in-person doctor which I am avoiding due to COVID-19 crisis as the hospitals are crowded.","Doctor":"Hello.  First, let me appreciate you for describing whatever your child has appropriately. As you have said that the baby has just started walking about 5 months ago, the problem with balance could be just his learning curve. Kids normally do fall while learning to walk, am sure even you will be aware of that. He is able to walk, rule and climb stairs only means he is growing normally.  Now, to say if the balancing issue is normal or not you can make a small video of it and show me. It is difficult to say without seeing the baby. Let us assume that it is a part of normal development, then you do not have to go to a doctor and you do not have to worry about it. Now, if we assume that it could be because of a physical problem, the child will have to be examined. My advise is to wait till he completes 2 years. If the problem still persists, then you have to go to a doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My current medications are 60 mg Cymbalta for depression and 300 mg Seroquel for the sleep disorder. I am in my 40s and I have had a few episodes of depression during my lifetime. I was lucky enough to be able to attend a psychiatrist in a country I lived in for a long time. It was a great help. My question at the moment is about medication. When I was quite depressed I took Cymbalta and another antidepressant which I am fairly certain was Wellbutrin. I dropped the secondary antidepressant after a year or so as I began to feel better. I am just considering using it again as I am now in a state of emotional upheaval due to a family death. I have just got in touch with a GP for an appointment in the next two weeks. What I would like to know is, it safe to take Cymbalta, Seroquel, and go back to Wellbutrin? How would I work the dosage? Would I start with 150 mg of Wellbutrin and possibly go up to 300 mg? When should I take the antidepressants? Can I take them both at the same time, or do I need to space them out? I am not prone to seizures and I have never had one. I am a female.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for taking help from a psychiatrist. You can take Cymbalta and Seroquel. You are already on both medications, so you should continue both medications. If you fill depressed then take tablet Wellbutrin 150 mg once in the morning for a short period of time, then we can taper off within 6 months. If you do not improve your depression on 150 mg of dose after 15 days then we can increase the dosage as per requirement. You can take medications together and you do not need to space out. But you must take Seroquel at night as it causes sedation. Even you should follow some non-pharmacological management as mentioned below. 1. Do exercises daily for 30-45 minutes like walking. 2. Do meditation for 20 minutes daily. 3. Eat healthy home cooked foods, avoid junk foods. 4. Spend quality time with friends and family daily. 5. Spend time for creative hobbies like read good books, write journals, painting, drawings, learn new skills or language or musical instruments. 6. Take enough (7-8 hours) sleep daily. 7.

In my armpits area, there is some kind of infection like I do not really know what that is but it looks like an infection and my sweat and sweat odor is due to that particular infection. Now I am describing the infection I used to wax my armpits and there is something that grows over my armpit hair a yellowish something and if I try to remove whatever the thing is, it gets out of the hair in powdered form. At first, I thought it as a fungal infection. I used a serum to remove fungus but nothing happened. It does not hurt but only if I use hair removal cream in the area.","Doctor":"Hi.

She is 85 years old and still in pretty good condition. Her current cardiological status rated to be very well with no diabetes or any other medical issues. But from last year she shows a myelodysplastic syndrome. A bone marrow biopsy was attempted a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, the material made available to the laboratory was of not adequate in quality and no result could be given. However, I read in the report that the material was of fibrino-leukocytic consistency and assuming that there is refractory anemia with excess blasts. Is the material of fibrino leucocytic nature possibly proving the suspected condition?","Doctor":"Hi.I have carefully worked through your case and want to assure you that proper care and expert opinion will be extended. Actually, when there is a hematology report which questions the quality of the biopsy specimen, we cannot just comment on the outcome of the test or to what should have had been there it was like that or the other way. The fibrino-leukocytic consistency just means that there were just a few leukocyte cells in the background matrix of fibers. I preferably suggest that this is a mistake in taking the proper specimen, or if the technique was fine then due to the replacement of the bone marrow with fibrous tissue to some extent causing anemia. My final suggestion is to repeat the diagnostic test and expert hands needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He is vomiting while eating grains. What is the reason for vomiting and what can be done for this? Please tell me about this response to Tagrisso. If it is good? How much time does Tagrisso take for the remission if it works like this? What is the average duration for Tagrisso to become resistant? Please clear my doubts.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. In reply to your question for Osimertinib (Tagrisso), Osimertinib demonstrated improvement in PFS (18.9 versus 10.2 months, HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.57) and duration of response (17.2 versus 8.5 months) relative to other TKI. The PFS (progression-free survival) benefit was consistent across subgroups, including either patient with or without brain metastases. Response rates for Osimertinib is around 80 %. To put it to simple terms, the disease is controlled for more than 1.5 years with Osimertinib. Treatment with an EGFR TKI is generally continued until there is disease progression. If there is persistent vomiting, we need to do more tests to confirm whether it is leptomeningeal (LM) disease which is diagnosed in approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic cancer. The most common solid tumors giving rise to LM are breast cancer (12 to 35 percent), lung cancer (10 to 26 percent), melanoma (5 to 25 percent). Headache is the most common initial symptom of LM, present in 30 to 50 percent of patients with symptoms of confusion, forgetfulness, disorientation, subtle personality changes, and/or lethargy collectively referred to as encephalopathy or altered mental status, are common in patients with LM. I would request to do Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine which often provides important evidence of LM. The definitive diagnostic finding for LM is the cytologic identification of malignant cells within the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25 year old male.

I start in or can criticize but I do not start screaming and yelling as soon as she does. I need a break down here for clarity. Fights go off the handle. Very bad. We love each other but we fight way too often and with harsh name calling especially now on my end. She starts with bad words and I can lose it. It is bizarre that we have so much love, no deceit, but we cannot get it together.Together two years. Married 4.5 months. I am 40 she is 28. She has a history of being verbally abused. I have anger that once triggered is fiery. We spend an awful lot of time together. She is not working, just taking online classes. So she is home a lot. I am working part-time hours for now. What do you think? We have to fix this. The cursing and yelling and battling and jealousy is a lot. Both ends there. Please let me know what this looks like as far as abuse.","Doctor":"Hi. Marriage is a relationship which demands most of our compromise, understanding each other, handling each other's fault and try to maintain an equilibrium but at times the equilibrium disturbs and it results into a series of conflicts. One thing leads to other and even small things starts irritating as the dissatisfaction from relationship occurs. Our thoughts start imagining things in extreme. So there remains always a state of unrest at both the sides. The best way to go with it are: Sit together, go to a dinner or a park, make rules of conversation like each one will speak one by one, no interruptions while first one is speaking. Set some rules at home like no shouting or yelling or using bad words. Try to control the response, the biggest problem always remain is we respond too quickly and stop listening and start blaming another one. If you people can, then try to get some marital therapy sessions, they will help you a lot. Plan some holidays, give her small gifts and surprises, give evidence of your love to her."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was wondering if anyone could tell me about my condition. I used to go to an eye doctor when I was little but I cannot remember when I last went. I was never pushed to go by my parents when I was younger, only when I needed a new pair of glasses. I was born with one eye small, the other normal. My vision is fine, I am very nearsighted but with glasses, I see quite well. My depth perception is normal too, I can see most things and when I tried to drive once, it went well. In my affected eye pupil is floating around. I cannot see much out of it, and it is not big enough. Other than that, no other health conditions. Could anyone tell me what this is? Is it something that progresses and will I go blind someday?","Doctor":"Hi. You have unilateral microphthalmos i.e. your one eye which in your case is right eye is not fully developed and has developed a squint. Other eyes appear normal but I will advise you to get a fundus in the left eye also to rule out any retinal anomaly. The condition in the right will always remain like this and this condition will not affect the left eye. If it is normal just do not engage in activities that can lead do an injury in the left eye also. So please consult a vitreoretinal specialist to rule out any retinal lesions in the left eye and get yourself rechecked for glasses every six months. Though your left eye appears very normal from outside but since you are nearsighted I will advise you to get retinal examination in your normal eye too, so that if there is any treatable lesion we can fix it at an early stage."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 6.5 years old. When she was 1, she had a seizure for a couple of times in two years, for which she took medicine and now she is off from medicine for the last three years. Now recently she was diagnosed with adenoids for which we are going homeopathy. My concern is she is right now 112 cm tall and 21 kg weight. I find her too short compared to her friends, my wife is only 5 feet tall and I myself is 5'7\\". Is this the reason she is not growing, since last 4 to 5 months her height is the same, or due to adenoids or medication which she took in the past? What should we do regarding her height? I want her to be at least 5'4\\", up to what age girls height can grow? She takes Pediasure, two eggs in terms of protein every day and four days a week swimming, is there anything special I can do? Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hi. Here are certain points of advise I would like to give you. Weight is absolutely normal for her age as per growth charts. As per the height mentioned (112 cm), the child is shorter as per other children in the growth chart but considering the parent's height, the child seems fine. If the child's height had to be affected by adenoids the weight also would be effected but it is not. Girls grow in height up to the age of 14 to 16 years. The final height of the child should be close to 5 feet, 2 inches considering the parent's height. The current age of the child is 6 years so you have a time period of 8 to 9 years for height growth. There is no exercise or supplement specifically for height. However, it has been noted that children who are very active and have a good diet end up with good heights and weights (with respect to the parent's height). Both of these are well-taken care by you as your child seems to be active and feeding well (as per history). So, I would not worry much. As related to adenoids, I would suggest taking the opinion of an ENT doctor for the same. If they do not cause many issues, they can be left alone. An X-ray neck lateral can be taken to see if they are enlarged."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 18 months of age. She was born at 38 weeks due to placenta failure and oxygen issues. She was 5 lbs 10 ounces at birth and was healthy (did not have to stay in the NICU). She hit all of her milestones in terms of rolling over, crawling and walking (walked at 14.5 months), but is a toe walker. Her left leg (to us) is weaker than her right and her left leg does not bend as much as her right leg. She began to speak around 10 months of age then her speech left. We came to find out she had chronic fluid and a month back she had tubes placed. I am hearing more vowel and consonants now but no true words yet. She makes fine eye contact. Her non-verbal communication is good. She responds to her name but not always. She is beginning to learn more of what we are saying, she plays with some toys, is not terribly social. We are thinking that she may be on the autism spectrum and we have an evaluation soon to determine that. But my question is, could this be cerebral palsy?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand the situation you are facing with your child. As there is no history of perinatal insult and NICU stay at birth, cerebral palsy could be less likely at this early age to diagnose. The description you made is more of a like to be an autistic spectrum disorder. But this could be just a small delay in catching up all milestones. Some kids learn early and some little late. So, observe over a period and if no improvement is seen, then consult a pediatric neurologist and developmental specialist for further evaluation and management."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I feel fatigue despite good sleep of about 7 to 8 hours. I have sporadic pain in the body. I feel cold and freeze rapidly especially on air conditioning. Otherwise, constant palm sweat is present. I am getting discomfort with lights. I have a sense of fullness in the head as if I were on a plane. I am getting fear of the future, especially of disease and death. I could not identify the source of these symptoms. If these are psychological, then what is the solution?","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Such an issue happens due to either of the following causes. Thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic disease, heart disease as endocarditis, hypertension and autoimmune disease where body's immune system gets against the body's own tissues. Situation like this may also have a psychological part of the disease.  Can you please tell me how much time elapsed for such symptoms? Is this a continuous one or on and off? Do you or anyone else at your home know that you snore while sleeping? What are your blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate today? Respiratory rate is when you sit quiet and count for one minute that how many times you inhale and exhale, a complete respiratory cycle. Pulse rate, you may count by keeping the finger on wrist and counting the feeling of pulse in one minute.  Do you have fever? How active are you? Can you please upload the tests you went for? Diagnosis is the key to proper treatment. We can rule out certain causes from diagnostic tests. If not available, no problem I have written all the necessary tests. You must get it done as soon as possible so that we may proceed further. Get the following investigations done and upload the report: 1. CBC (complete blood count) with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and differentials. 2. Fasting blood sugar levels. 3. Fasting lipid profile. 4. Thyroid profile. 5. EKG (electrocardiogram). 6. Total CPK (creatine phosphokinase) levels. 7. HBSAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and Anti-HCV (anti-hepatitis C virus) levels. It will be decided on follow up details. Do not worry, it can be managed."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 36 year old female. My height is 164 cm and weight is 48 kg. I was healthy with fine ligaments. Two years back, I had spine surgery for a herniated disk at the level of L5/S1. Soon after the operation, I got something like sleep myoclonus. The neurologist said that as benign, but I did not have anything like before. I am suffering from loose and weak ligaments in my spine and elsewhere. I am also having TMJ dysfunction, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and ligament laxity. During anesthesia, I was given one dosage of Midazolam 2 mg, Propofol 200 mg, Cefazolin 2 mg, Atropine 1 mg, Fentanyl 0.3 mg, Rocuronium 40 mg, Neostigmine 2.5 mg, and Sevoflurane 63.05 mL. The operation duration was around 2 hours and 34 minutes. I do not have any drug allergy. But, I did not receive any inhaled anesthetics before. Does ligament laxity occur as a side effect of Sevoflurane?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. Myoclonus or muscle twitching is a known side effect of Sevoflurane use, and it is not a serious concern. Sevoflurane does not cause laxity of ligaments. Very common side effects of Sevoflurane occurring in more than 10 % of patients are nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cough, and increased agitation. Common side effects occurring in 1 to 10 percent of patients are increased salivation, tachycardia, hypertension, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, breath holding, apnea, respiratory disorder, somnolence, dizziness, shivering, fever, hypothermia, headache, increased fluoride in blood, abnormal liver function test and abnormal blood glucose level. Uncommon side effects occurring in 0.1 to 1 % of patients are dry mouth, arrhythmia, ECG abnormalities, increased sputum, hypoxia, wheezing, bronchospasm, hyperventilation, pharyngitis, hiccup, hypoventilation, dyspnea, stridor, hypoxia, asthma, crying, nervousness, confusion, insomnia, confusional state, syncope, hypertonia, taste perversion, asthenia, pain, fluorosis, increase in AST (aspartate aminotransferase), increase in ALT (alanine transaminase), bilirubinemia, increase in LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), increase in alkaline phosphatase, hypophosphatemia, acidosis, hyperglycemia, increase in BUN (blood urea nitrogen), increase in creatinine, glycosuria, albuminuria, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, urination impaired, urine abnormality, urinary retention, oliguria, pruritus, and rash. Rare side effects occurring in less than 0.1 % of patients is malignant hyperthermia. Female hormones progesterone (before menstruation) and relaxin (during early pregnancy) cause joint hypermobility and ligament laxity. But, it is difficult to predict whether these factors are causing your symptoms or not. People with connective tissue disorder also might have laxity of joints."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father has undergone angioplasty last year. He went for TMT review last week.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Since then, I have been back to the dentist twice to get adjustments on the crown, under the suspicion that its slight misfit with my bite was causing the dull-to-sharp pain I experience when I use that molar. Despite the adjustments, no improvements have been made. During both adjustments, the dentist asked me questions regarding the pain type, sensitivity, etc. (I would presume to determine if a root canal or something else is necessary) and nothing raised flags- No passive pain, no sensitivity to hot or cold air. I have pain from use only, but it is significant enough that I have not used the left side of my mouth to chew since that time. Should I go to another dentist to get a second opinion? I feel strange repeatedly going back to basically say he or she must be wrong and that no improvements are being made. Any advice would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. In your case, there are three possibilities. The first line of treatment is as done by your dentist. After crown placement, slight misfit issues occur that need to be adjusted by trimming of occlusal or biting surface. It gets better soon after trimming or relieving pressure. Otherwise, it gives continuous pain only at biting. So by symptoms, you are having pain on chewing and your dentist has not trimmed it to your comfort level I guess, or you might be having very deep bite that porcelain surface space would not be available and it needs to be trimmed now and dentist is avoiding it as metal will get exposed and it will not look good aesthetically. 90 % of crown issues and pain gets fine by trimming high spots. Now the second line of treatment: If still pain persists and you feel the pressure inside the tooth, you experience pain at night or on lying down, or slight infection in gums right above the crown tooth, then it is an indication of root canal treatment. As the cavity was already deep, it was filled and then tooth was trimmed down for crown preparation so that it is vital and it becomes sensitive and there are only 10 % chances that your pulp of root might have been exposed or silent infection of cavity might have got triggered up after deep cleaning. So now, root canal treatment is to be done in such case. Or before attempting root canal if antibiotics are given, then such infection subsides and you might feel absolutely okay with this tooth during medications. After the course is over you will start feeling pain again. And then it would be better to opt for a root canal. The third line of treatment: If you do not have any root canal issues and still pain persists on chewing, then there is 1 to 2% possibility of fracture of the tooth due to uneven biting pressure over the crown. In such worst case scenario, extraction is recommended, the root canal does not help it. I hope this is not the case. Hopefully, you have a better idea of treatment options in your case. If you have further queries let me know. My advice is to go to another dentist and ask him to trim the crown as much as he can to make it comfortable, leaving aesthetics aside. If it does not work, do an antibiotic regime course it will work."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have cervical pain radiating to the right shoulder, neck, and arm until fingers.

The symptoms that you have described point towards cervical disc issues with a small disc and bone (osteophyte) that is irritating to the right-sided nerve at C5-6 level as mentioned in the MRI reports. Usually, such cases heal within 6-8 weeks. On and off pain is common. But persistent pain in the arm and hand is nagging and decreases productivity especially if it is a dominant hand. We need to take MRI films to interpret the severity of the disc problem, know the handedness, know the exact location of the pain and if associated with tingling or numbness, and any weakness in the hand or arm.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Right now, I am not on any birth control method except for the rhythm method. I have tried multiple birth control methods in the past, such as the implant, the pill, the ring, the patch and had annoying side effects with each of them. I had spotting that would not go away with the ring and implant probably due to low estrogen in the devices, compared to the pill. My doctor ended up removing the implant for this reason. I have used each method for a long enough period for my body to get used to them, so it is not like I have not been giving them a chance. With the implant and ring, it got to be too expensive buying so many pads or tampons and it really puts a damper on my sex life. In addition, when I was on the pill I was not very good about taking it on time. I am looking to try a long-term contraceptive method, that I would not have ongoing spotting with. I have heard that one can get the implant or an IUD and take estrogen or birth control pill that would stop bleeding in between periods. I would really like to receive some advice on this. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. You have described elaborately about your experience about all the contraceptives.

Please help. I have attached my report. I am afraid and shivering. Is there any problem in my blood test?","Doctor":"Hello.  Your CBC report is normal and does not suggest a specific abnormality. The red blood cell count is within the limit so do not worry about that. In the attached report, serum amylase and lipase are elevated (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So pancreas inflammation has to be ruled out. For that, you need to investigate with ultrasonography of the abdomen. Meanwhile, symptomatic management has to be done. For stomach pain, Rabeprazole antacid has to be prescribed. For gas problem Simethicone containing tablet or syrup has to be prescribed. After one week, repeat your serum B12 level. It is water soluble vitamin, so mostly it will bring down to the normal level after a few days. I suggest you consult a nearby physician for detailed evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have skin peeling on my glans penis and also some white dots near the skin joint on glans.

Avoid friction."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a bad throat recently and I took Doxcef 200 for five days from a previous prescription thinking it would help. However, now I have a throat ulcer I guess as my throat hurts when I gulp. It is predominantly on the right side. It happened once last year and based on that prescription, I am doing Betadine gargle and taking Bevon capsule once a day. I am not taking Rebagen although doctor prescribed. There is no improvement and moreover, I feel that my stomach is gassy all the time with belching. Please let me know how I can take care of this.","Doctor":"Hello. I would say that you did a mistake by taking the medicines from the previous prescription. Most likely you have caused unnecessary gastritis due to proper dosage of antibiotic pertaining to the current problem. Most of the throat problems like soreness and cold are due to viral causes and seasonal changes. On top of those weather changes and allergy and pollution add to the soreness. One does not need a strong antibiotic like Doxcef 200 every time this occurs. If you had consulted one of us we would have guided you on how to go about. Now that is you have taken a course of strong antibiotic, it is likely that the friendly bacteria in your stomach have got destroyed and resistant bacteria have colonized causing vitamin deficiencies. These cause the current problems you face. You need to stop the gargles. If possible take a picture of your throat with open mouth showing details of the back of the throat with tonsils and send to me. Would like to check if there is post nasal drip, granular pharyngitis, allergic mucin, tonsillitis, etc. Nextly, you need to follow some dietary changes until you get better. You would need a proton pump inhibitor taken in empty stomach for appropriate dosage as per your weight. Depending on the symptoms you may need a prokinetic drug like Domperidone. To help you better I want more details about your problems and habits. 1. Gas formation occurs after diet or its when your stomach is empty, that is, between meals? 2. Smoking, drinking or tobacco chewing or pan paraag? 3. Alcohol intake? 4. Type of food: spicy, oily? 5. Vegetables and fruits in the diet? 6. Bowel habits - normal, loose or constipated? 7. Burning sensation in the mouth? Do revert back with more details so that we can guide you appropriately."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A portion of right lower number 7 tooth chipped off (the light cured section was done two years back) along with partial silver filling done in that tooth during taking food. The dentist took an X-ray and suggested RCT with a crown. I have started the RCT but she has said that the RCT will be completed in two sessions. My questions are: My previous experience with RCT is that it took 5 or 7 sittings. Can RCT be completed in two sittings? Can I go for a permanent filling after RCT rather than going for the crown as suggested?","Doctor":"Hi. Your first concern is regarding the number of days of your RCT. RCT can be done in a single session or 2 or 3 sittings depending upon the severity of your case. If there is severe pain or infection, the dentist may have to delay for treatment for 3 or 4 sittings. You should go for a permanent filling after RCT, which is mandatory. But, you definitely should wear a crown because your teeth are more brittle after RCT, so there is more chance to break off. You can go for a crown after six months once you make sure you have got no pain."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

After five days, she broke up with me saying she did not want to drag me down with her. Now she has quit her job and quit school to move away and follow a dream. My questions are that are there bipolar medications that have street value? Can an abrupt stop to medication cause someone to relapse that fast? How long does it take to come out of this episode?","Doctor":"Hello. Bipolar illness is a severe mental illness. It needs constant treatment. Stopping or switching the medicines on your own can lead to relapse. Medicines are provided by a registered medical practitioner and cannot be sold OTC (over-the-counter). She has to be started on medicines. She cannot come out of it on her own. Without medicines, her condition will worsen."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 86 year old healthy male. I had sudden seizures. What is the reason behind it? I have attached my MRI brain with this. Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) in detail. Please find my observations below. There are mild age-related changes like prominent markings on the surface of the brain, prominent ventricles which are fluid spaces and periventricular hyperintensities. This is expected at 86 years of age. There are few small hyperintensities on T2 and FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) in the white matter which is probably due to small vessel ischemic changes and is acceptable at this age. Mild bilateral maxillary sinusitis is noted. This is not related to the seizures and is an incidental finding. There is no tumor or bleeding in the brain. There is no obvious acute infarct. Cerebrovascular disease, infections, primary neurodegenerative disorders, brain tumor, traumatic head injury, stroke, and acute metabolic disturbance are the most common causes of seizures in the elderly and no specific cause has been found in this scan. Sometimes early scans can be normal. It is important to know if the patient has any medical condition (though it is mentioned normal health) and whether any abnormal laboratory tests have been found. Seizures can happen due to sudden abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Keeping in mind the seizures it will help to do electroencephalography (EEG) to know the probable site of abnormal brain waves which triggered the seizure."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 20 year old boy. I am suffering from hair fall. How to get it cured? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. It is very normal for around 100 hairs to fall each day. We do not notice this because all of those do not fall at once. Second of all, I would like to ask you whether is it hereditary on your maternal and paternal side? It is called androgenic hair loss. With these major queries ruled out, I would shift the focus on diet and sleep. Diet should be regular with a lot of greens and milk. Eat a good amount of protein as this should reduce the rate of hair fall and also provide a good body to your thinning hair. Hair is precious and does not play with it by trying out new brands with overwhelming claims. Stick to a gentle daily cleanser, medicated products are much more quality assured than fancy brands in the market. Hence, I suggest you use products like Kerawash shampoo and a good conditioner. Washing your hair at least three to four times a week is mandatory. Conaderm (combination of Ketoconazole and Zinc pyrithione) is good for dandruff. But if there is no dandruff and simply continuing with the anti-dandruff shampoo will eventually cause hair loss on chronic repeated use.Any medication beyond a particular time period will cause a side effect. So, stop using it if the desired result has been achieved. If not then treat dandruff first. The only shampoo will not help. You have to take medicines and use an anti-dandruff shampoo at the same time. The proper way to use an anti-dandruff shampoo is to apply it on scalp rather than the hair and once desired foaming is achieved, let it stay in the head for 2-3 minutes so that the medication has got sufficient time to act on your scalp. Observe good hygiene wherein you wash your pillow cover every four to five days in summer and seven to eight days in winter. Because the germs causing dandruff can be inside the pillow cover and after you shampoo and clean your hair, it can come and sit there again when you sleep so the treatment has got no effect overall. If it is a hormonal problem, then we need to start the medicine as soon as possible so that to control the effect of hormones on your hair.Once desired control is achieved over a period of two months then we can shift the focus on regrowing the lost hair and cover the bald patches.Send me some clear pictures of your scalp of different parts and we can start treatment as soon as possible. Do not worry, it is just a matter of time before we control your hair fall and you can have your desired hairstyle done. Stay positive."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently took the Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab rapid test. The counselor used two drops of buffer. The test brochure said to use only one drop.

By looking at your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems that your orthodontic treatment was not successful. Now it seems that you have more problems in your lower jaw. So, it is better to correct lower teeth only. You should either try to put crowns (cap) over the lower central four teeth, or there is a method called veneering where we put a half cap over the front teeth on both upper and lower to give a good look to your smile. Ask a specialist that is an endodontist to give veneers to the front six teeth on both upper and lower jaw. The procedure veneering is a little bit costly but gives a very good aesthetic smile makeover.

The wrong position of breastfeeding may cause back pain and tiredness. You should not bend your back while breastfeeding. Put some pillows behind your back and raise the baby to your breast and feed. Tiredness may also be due to blood loss and anemia during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the child takes up a lot of iron from the mother and also during breastfeeding. Check your hemoglobin level and contact me. You may also feel tired and weak due to lack of calcium. For which start taking more milk, curd, vegetables, and fruits.

I have now developed a stye on my left eye (upper lid). The bump is swollen and formed a round ball. I have again tried warm compresses and it seems to be making it worse. I am now trying salt and warm water soaks. I have also been to the doctors and had blood tests, etc., and all came clear. I just need advice on what I need to do to get rid of this. I have been washing eyelashes daily.","Doctor":"Hello. The stye usually resolves in a week. If it is persisting even after treatment then it could be a chalazion. Kindly share photos of your eyes so that I may guide you better."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter is 20 years old and studying in a hostel. For the last one month, she is suffering from a headache. After taking painkiller it subsides and again it stars on the next day. So after three days, I consulted an ENT doctor and he after examining and after taking X-ray, diagnosed it as sinus headache and gave antibiotics and painkillers for five days. She completed the course and while using the tablets she did not have a headache. Now, again she has a headache. Kindly advise whether the headache is really from sinusitis. Why am I doubting that she has only headache with mild nose block and no other symptoms like discharge or fever. So, my doubt is whether it is sinus headache or not and if it is due to sinusitis even after completing the course why again headache?","Doctor":"Hi. Headache can be of many reasons but while pertaining it to ENT, it is mostly due to sinusitis. For declaring the headache due to sinusitis you should have got done a nasal diagnostic endoscopy by an ENT surgeon or should get a CT scan of the paranasal sinus. X-rays are of the very very old generation and no one is using it as a tool to diagnose it. But since you have got the X-ray done, kindly share it along with the reports.  Kindly understand that if at all the sinusitis persists the medical management which may completely reduce sinus infection is antibiotics up to 4 to 6 weeks (for a permanent cure) along with mucolytics, a short course of oral steroids and nasal spray if the patient is allergic to dust or pollen. If the above medical management fails then the patient has to be subjected to surgery which we can decide with our CT scan. As you have also mentioned regarding nose block a deviated nasal septum can also be a cause for headache. So kindly share the X-ray report."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

And, that could be causing tingling, numbness, and tiredness. For treatment, I would suggest tablet Calciquick 60000 units. You take the tablet once a week for eight weeks and after that same tablets once a month for another ten months. Methylcobalamin injection, one ampule 1000 mg should be given as an injection in the buttocks, two injections every week. In total, ten doses for five weeks. I hope this helps. Thank you.

The eye doctor put me on Acyclovir cream and later added Cortisone drops to prevent scars. After a month, while on vacation (lots of sun and salt water) it came back. I did not recognize the signs at first and thought the redness was only due to irritation. It lingered, so after coming back home, I was put on Acyclovir orally. Two months back, the dye did not show any active ulcers, so I could lower the oral dose to 400 mg and use Cortisone drops again. Last week for a check up the dye showed two active ulcers again. I am really shocked and scared now. My doctor did not say if it was stromal keratitis or not. Is there a way to tell? I have always had 100 % vision since the lesions are not in front of the pupil. But I do not know why I had a recurrence even while on Acyclovir. Could the Cortisone drops be detrimental? My doctor said to increase the dose back to 800 mg and stop Cortisone. Is there a way to clear this for now? I do not know if I had two relapses or if this never really healed in the first place. Is there a way to prevent such frequent outbreaks at all? It is difficult not to stress when I fear I will go blind.","Doctor":"Hello. Please do not panic. You will not go blind. I assume this is herpes simplex and you have herpes epithelial keratitis. Epithelium keratitis is usually treated with antiviral and lubricating eyedrop. The steroid has no role in epithelial keratitis. Steroid increases the risk of recurrence. That is why steroid is instilled undercover of antiviral. If there are more than two attacks in a single year, then we may need to continue prophylactic oral Acyclovir for a very long period (maybe years). With recurrent attacks, there may be scars which may blur your vision."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been experiencing a receding gum line and decaying teeth in my front two bottom teeth.

Unfortunately, there is nothing better you can do but visit a dentist and get scaling or cleaning of this hard plaque and tartar done as soon as possible. It was a plaque that gets hardened, turned into tartar and started pushing gums down the neck of the tooth, and this will eventually cause loosening of teeth. So, it is better to get it cleaned. Better to be safe than sorry. You can do saline water mouth rinses for arresting of gum recession till you get an appointment of the dentist. (Take a 1/4th teaspoon of salt in a cup of lukewarm water and do its gargles for 2 to 3 minutes). Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 54 years old. My weight is 145 lbs and height is 5'7\\". Almost every night I am getting severe pain in my right hip and groin. The pain is sharp and burning. It radiates down to my right leg. However, it completely dissipates after about 15 minutes of walking around. Always the pain occurs in the same side. I have zero pain during the day. This has been going on for almost six months now. What could this be? What questions should I ask my primary care physician? Earlier I was diagnosed with osteoporosis and low protein C and S. My medications are Forteo since one year, Estrogen patch over 5 years and B12 injection.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query completely. I do not think this pain is due to appendicitis or ureteric stone. They will cause severe pain and does not relieve by walking. You are taking Forte for osteoporosis which does not cause you this problem. It may be due to cramps, which is common in osteoporosis due to altered calcium and other mineral metabolisms.The pain may be due to lumbar disc prolapse which is lumbar discitis. In which case the pain starts from the lower back and spreads to one of the legs. It can also be due to faulty sleeping position. Many people have sleepy legs due to faulty sleeping position. It is commonly relieved by altering the position. Sometimes we sleep by keeping one leg over a pillow or edge of the cot. It may cause nerve compression and temporary burning pain over the legs. You should ask the following questions to your primary care physician: After visiting your doctor please do update me for any doubts you have. My wishes for quick recovery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Is diagnosis important? I have been diagnosed by many therapists and each one has had a different diagnosis.

Persons with BPD are said to be on the borderline between neurosis and psychosis, persons with bipolar disorder experience episodes of extreme mood swings ranging from depression to mania. Asperger syndrome is disorder of autism spectrum. PTSD is posttraumatic stress disorder. Depression like features after significant trauma.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After trying to fix my general teeth and gums, I have managed to get rid of the yellow plaque after a few days. However, after brushing gums excessively, ulcers have appeared, and my gums have swollen slightly and are very painful. I was wondering how to fix them and how long it will take?","Doctor":"Hello. Actually, you have gum infection (gingivitis). It is common and curable. First thing if there is any hard deposit then you should see your dentist for a professional dental cleaning. Maintain proper oral hygiene like two times brushing, flossing at least once a day, do not use any type of tobacco or smoking, change your toothbrush every two months and use proper brushing technique.

An ultrasound, blood tests, biopsy, and a bone scan was conducted. Bone scan did not show any metastasis. He was advised to take a pelvis MRI 15-20 days after the biopsy. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Initial PSA was 45.4. It was suggested that a radical prostatectomy should be performed. I am in need of a second opinion now. I would also like to know the difference between open surgery and robot-assisted surgery.","Doctor":"Hi. From the reports submitted (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is clear that your father has prostate cancer. From MRI, we can know the exact size of the tumor. It will also help in staging and we can get to know is there any spread to the nearby lymph nodes. As the bone scan is normal, there are no distant metastases. Plan of treatment is usually drawn after MRI, but it is most likely that your father has a localized, moderate grade prostate cancer (based on ultrasound report). The best option would be surgery that is the removal of the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes which can be done by open or robotic methods. The robotic method has the advantage that it gives better access for the surgeon with magnification and so the chance of complication is less, but it also depends on the surgeon. If the surgeon is experienced and well trained in a robotic way, then it is better to go with it or else open method of surgery can also be done. By chance, if the MRI reveals extension of cancer beyond prostate, surgery may not be possible, and radiotherapy would be preferred."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have done PRP and my skin peeled so much.

The 7.5 mg capsule is marketed as a menopause or anti-hot flash drug called Brisdelle, but is just Paxil. Is it safe to combine this 7.5 mg of regular Paxil with my Paxil CR for about a week or month? It feels weird to me because of the CR or regular difference, the short usage, and the fact that the pill is marketed as a menopause relief pill. Thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi. It is safe to take the additional 7.5 mg of Paxil or Brisdelle along with 37.5 mg of Paxil CR, as you rightly mentioned that both are same medicines. The increase dose of Paxil or Brisdelle for short time is for managing your hot flashes, and it is just like that the dose of Paxil are increased to manage your symptoms.

I develop pain in my throat while singing high notes. I want to show you what happens when I sing using a sample song. Can you diagnose and give treatment after listening to my song?","Doctor":"Hi. I treat a lot of singers, so I totally understand what you are going through. To answer your first question, yes it is totally possible to diagnose based on an audio clip of you singing (attachment removed to protect patient identity), though a better method would be a scopy of your voice box. However, I am guessing there are breaks or voice gaps in certain parts when you hit a high note. This is common among male singers. The issue here is that your voice box has 2 vocal cords that vibrate when you sing. The slightest inflammation or irregularity in these vocal cords can produce noticeable changes in a singers voice. The problem here is that the slightest change in the singing voice makes the singer more anxious and he tends to practice harder. Doctors typically prescribe steroids, but that will not help unless you give your voice a rest. Give the vocal cords enough time to heal. There is a lot more I would like to say, but I will try and summarize my advice for you.  1. Total voice rest for 7 days. No speaking, no whispering.  2. Daily concentrated salt water gargles.  3.

Just after the filling they did scaling of all the teeth. I asked them should I wait for an hour after the filling, but they did it anyway. Now after a month the filling broke. What do you think the reason might be? But I did not chew any hard foods after the filling.","Doctor":"Hi. In your case, there might be the following reasons. 1. Uneven biting pressure. It may cause the filling to break in class 2 cavities specially as walls of tooth are involved and sometimes unintentionally person bites with slight uneven pressure and it results in breaking down of filling. 2. Water or saliva contact right after filling. Usually half an hour gap is given after GIC filling for water contact, for eating and even for drinking water. If scaling is done right after filling by putting separating medium on filling still there can be chances of water contact through scaling procedure that causes filling to become porous and it might break. Now you can go back to dentist and ask him to do composite filling instead of GIC as it has more strength. After composite, there is no need to wait, you can have direct water contact too. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been on Finasteride for three months now. Recently, I have been having a huge shed of around 100 hairs a day, up from 5 to 10 before the treatment. The hairs I shed are thick but half the length of the rest of my hair. They are also thin at the base of the hair. This hair loss is in a diffuse pattern on my whole head rather than just at the temples like before. Is this sort of hair loss normal for this point in the medicine?","Doctor":"Hi. When Minoxidil is started, it can lead to hair loss at first because it regulates hair cycle and all hairs go into one phase leading to diffuse shedding of the hair. But eventually it stops. Ensure proper diet with Vitamins and Minerals. Take Biotin supplements along with it because Biotin is very important in hair growth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got my Mirena IUD a month back. I had unprotected sex with my fiance about 3 or 4 times after I got the green signal from my Gynecologist that the IUD was in its proper place (after two weeks or so). I am afraid that I might be pregnant. I am experiencing constant peeing and tender nipples. I know IUDs are almost as effective as tube litigation. I am just immensely worried that the symptoms may lead to what I think they are. I had unprotected sex the first time about 1 to 2 weeks ago. After each time, the sperm would come out or drip down my leg. I know I probably sound crazy worrying, but I would just like to hear from an expert.","Doctor":"Hi. If you have got your Mirena inserted within one week of your periods, your Mirena should be working properly providing contraception. If the insertion is after the first week, then there could be chances of pregnancy. Get a pregnancy test done to rule out speculations. Increased frequency of urination could be a symptom of urinary infection, get a urine culture done. Secondly breast tenderness is quite common complaint in ladies after Mirena insertion, that will subside gradually, you may apply ice packs or warm water bag on your breasts to reduce the pain."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter has Erbs palsy but we did physiotherapy for three months and the doctor said she is fine but she is still struggling with the hand and this is about six months after the doctor discharged us. Please tell me what should I do.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for providing the brief history of your daughter. I am sorry firstly to hear that your daughter is being diagnosed with Erb's palsy. Well, I would suggest you to continue physiotherapy for atleast three days a week as it will be of good help for her. Usually, cases with Erb's palsy recovers well when they perform physiotherapy for over longer periods in infants. Firstly, in the initial stages the physiotherapist will do passive movements of the limb but off late it will be progressed to toy reaching where she can use the maximum of her efforts and learn proper movements. We need to teach brain the movement. In between there might be a use of infant stimulation which will be of use to activate the muscles which are not active. A competitive physiotherapist for using the stimulation over an infant is needed as they have to analyze to which muscle it has to be given. Also a precaution has to be taken while applying a stimulation to the infant as the kid might not like it, so a competitive physiotherapist is a must for this. In my clinical practice over a period of 12 years I have seen many infants with Erb's palsy. They have responded well with the physiotherapy and with careful attention. Breech delivery. Erb's palsy.

My conditions got better but not fully cured, so I was given another 14 days of medicine (including a proton-pump inhibitor). Soon the lockdown kicked in and I went back to my home. I meanwhile took Ayurvedic medicines for a month here. While it has reduced the duration of heartburn episodes, the problem has not gone yet. For the last month, I have mild heartburn (pain in chest) for 20-60 minutes in a day (spread across three to four intervals). 14/30 days my throat felt different. 7/30 last days had acid refluxes. But heartburn occurs daily. I have tried varying my diet, but have not found any significant changes. Is this a cause of concern that despite having medicines for 42 days, I still have mild heartburns occurring daily? What should I do? How long will it take for a medicine to show the effect? Should I continue the course and if so, for how long? And if yes, does prolonged usage of medicine have side effects? Or if left untreated, do they have side effects? I took Somproz initially for four days, Lesuride-25, and Deltone for 14 days, and for the next 14 days I took Lesuride 25 and Nexpro 40.","Doctor":"Hello. You have briefly and well described your history, and I understand that you have very genuine concerns. So, the problem you have is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This is basically reflux of acid from the stomach to food pipe causing heartburn, sore throat, sometimes cough, and shortness of breath. Our stomach produces approximately 1 liter of acidic juices to help digest food. The acid produced does not usually come into food pipe unless someone has loose sphincter at the lower end of our food pipe which prevents acid refluxing into the food pipe. There are two further classifications of GERD. PPI responsive GERD, and PPI refractory GERD. Your symptoms suggest that you have PPI (proton pump inhibitor) responsive GERD since your symptoms are significantly improved when you are taking PPI. Even in PPI responsive GERD the symptoms may not completely vanish but are declined to a reasonable level and this may be in your case. For this, you just need to increase the dose of PPI. Instead of once daily dose, you can start taking it twice a day before meals. The rest of your symptoms like sore throat will go away once your acid reflux is suppressed well. Diet may or may not affect the GERD. However, there are certain precautions that you can do to prevent heartburn. Avoiding large volume meals, instead, take small but frequent meals. Avoid taking large meals at night or before going to bed. Give at least three to four hours gap after night meals before going to bed for sleeping. Raise the head end of your bed by placing a cement or wooden block down the head side of your bed. Or there are commercially available anti-reflux mattresses that can be used instead. Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothes and belts. So your concern about the presence of symptoms despite 42 days of treatment is valid, but you see the acid is produced daily, and the medicines can decrease the acid production for the duration of time they are in the blood, once the level of the drug declines from a certain point, the acid production takes over back. So taking a daily pill to control your acid production is the only effective way of treating your condition. No long term use and side effects. Well, all PPI are relatively safe and do not cause significant side effects if taken for years and years. However, there are studies that have shown renal damage, bone protein loss, and aspiration pneumonia but in practice, these side effects are not that common as elaborated in studies. The one daily pill to control your acid and prevailing a normal lifestyle is much more important than unforeseen and often unestablished side effects from long term use of PPI. I would recommend if PPI helps you to do well then there is no reason for stopping for the sake of unforeseen complications. But if you still have a concern about the long use of PPI, then I would recommend you to get PH-impedance 24 hours testing to confirm GERD, and if present then PPI again is the therapy, but if the test comes out negative, then PPI can be stopped.I hope this helps. PPI responsive GERD. Ambulatory 24 hours PH-impedance testing. Non-erosive reflux disease. GERD. Tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast. You can increase it to 40 mg BID before meals. Follow up if want to discuss more."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The pain was almost gone but there was some numbness in the same leg and stayed for almost a month but what I noticed is that I kept feeling like some urine in dripping from me, some times I find nothing and sometimes I find something but I am not sure if it is urine or not. A month ago I got a urine tested and there was nothing but I still have this same feeling like urine is coming out of me. I used to not drink water, some days I only drink one or 2 cups and I fear public restrooms so I used to keep urine almost 12 hours, can that be the cause?","Doctor":"Hi. I read your question that one month ago you had left leg pain and you also have a recurrent urinary tract infection. You are a young woman, no diabetes because I saw your HbA1c report that is less than 6.5 which means you do not have any diabetes mellitus. Coming to your symptoms, left leg pain and dribbling of urine. I want you to get a basic blood test done which is complete blood count renal profile, liver function test, urine routine and also check your vitamin B12 and vitamin D as well. When there is a deficiency in B12, your nerves will lose its functioning normal level. Drink plenty of fluids and water because that will help one from getting too many episodes of urinary tract infections. Drink as much as you can but not more than six liters and eat healthily. Avoid deep fried items like chicken, burger, sauce, chicken fries. Drink tender coconut water, eating banana will also help you get rid of some muscle pain. In order to answer the question perfectly I need to get a basic blood investigation and in the meantime take a regular painkiller like Paracetamol or Acetaminophen 650 mg twice a day whenever needed and you please get back to me if you have your old blood reports, you can send it to me.

As you mentioned that you are suffering from depression and was always undermedicated, in depression, it is common to have a disturbance of memory and attention which lead to forgetfulness.

One is I forget always names of person, place, etc., while talking with someone. However, I have remembered a lot of things of pasts but while talking about it, I often forget the names especially. The second problem which I used to face is the confidence problem. As my nature, I want to do any work either perfectly or do not do it. When I start to proceed for something, it can be anything like going from anywhere, studying, traveling, working, etc., my mind happens very unconfident for self-preparation and I do check my pockets in my pant that is anything here? When I find nothing is in my pocket, but I check again the same and I am irritated. After many times doing the same known thing (checking my pockets), I check it again and again and I am finally unable to make my mind understand that I have not had anything in my pocket. So, you may have understood my problem. Please suggest me what should I do.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry, I have understood your problem. Let me talk about the second problem first, because it needs to be solved as a priority. Your repetitive thoughts and behaviors seem to be of an obsessive-compulsive type. That is why you are aware that you are getting useless thoughts but you are unable to stop them. And that gives you a lot of stress and even guilt and self-doubts. These thoughts occupy most of your mind and energy, and that is why you are having difficulty to remember routine things. The reason why your old memory is intact is the problem is not in the memory part of your brain. The problem is: 1. Because of constant unwanted thoughts, your attention and focus in not good. That is why your brain is facing problems in registering and recalling information. There is no problem with the storage function. 2. Because of constant stress, your mind is not able to feel relaxed and fresh properly. That is why it is not being able to manage other functions properly. So, for these problems, I would request the following treatments. 1. Relaxation techniques: There are various relaxation exercises available. Progressive muscle relaxation is easy and effective. You can also try Sudarshan kriya or meditation. 2. Behavior therapy: Therapy of systematic desensitization helps a lot with this problem. 3. Medicines: Medicines are very effective in treating the part of the brain that is producing unwanted thoughts repeatedly and producing thoughts. It is not possible to teach the therapies through messages. It can happen through a phone call or meeting. You can decide about therapies and write me back in three days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter, who is 11 years old, is found to chew sponge. She will not swallow but used to chew it.

One should not be angry with the child as this will lead to an increase in the related habit. The second cause could be pica. In pica, there is iron deficiency anemia and the child usually eats wall surface, whitewash, sponges, etc. In pica, children usually have anemia or low hemoglobin in simpler words.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am very happy with this, it has really changed my life. Just recently I started reading up a bit more and now I feel very confused and weird about it all. The thing is, I was told I had a mild mid-frequency hearing loss. When I actually look at my audiometry test it shows that as well, but my hearing is barely within the range of being considered a hearing loss. Reading around I found out that most people with such a mild loss can mostly hear fine and do not need hearing aids. When I read about what my hearing loss is supposed to be like, I do not relate. I relate way more to the explanations of what moderate hearing loss sounds and feel like. And hearing aids help me a lot. When I do not wear my hearing aids it sounds to me like listening to people talking through a door. I rely a lot on lip-reading if I cannot wear my hearing aids, phone conversations were almost impossible before I got them. I just cannot make my hearing loss make sense with my actual experience with hearing. So I have been wondering what causes me to feel like I hear so bad when my hearing is just slightly below the normal range? I should say that I have tinnitus as well, sometimes quite a lot, so that maybe factors into it too. Recently I began to wonder whether the reason I hear so much worse compared to other people with my level of hearing loss? Is that I have ADHD and PTSD which makes it so hard to focus? Do you think this is a possibility? Or could it simply be that I handle my hearing loss worse than others? I just do not understand why I experience hearing speech as so difficult and why I am so dependent on hearing aids when my hearing loss is technically very mild?","Doctor":"Hi. Let me tell you a statement which explains it perfectly. The ear receives the sound but interpretation of sound happens at the brain. So many a times with mild hearing loss speech perception is low moreover you have tinnitus too. I hope you have fitted with digital programmable (computerized programmable) hearing aids. If yes, it amplifies exactly the same as required in each frequency. No need to worry about it. By the way avoid caffeinated drinks (tea, coffee, alcohol) and avoid noisy situations as much as possible. Puretone is used in the test in which you got the result mild mid-frequency hearing loss (pure tone audiometry). But in day to day life you are not listening to pure tones right? It is speech so pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry should be done and correlated, if that would have been done then you must have a clear picture of your problem. My honest suggestion is to use the hearing aids, so as not to worsen the condition. If you stop using it that may cause further deterioration."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My friend is a 40 year old female. She met with an accident before 10 days. Her arms and shoulders got fractured. Her ribs too got injured. She is having chest pain, breathing problem and clot in blood vein. I have attached all her CT scan and x-ray reports with this. Please advise what treatment is required.","Doctor":"HiAs per the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) submitted, I understand that it was a major accident. She has multiple injuries to various parts. Usually, with such injuries, it is difficult to isolate each problem and provide a solution without seeing the patient as multiple organs are involved. As it has been 10 days since her accident, I assume that she is clinically stable by which I mean that her pulse rate and blood pressure are normal or near normal. Both the bones are fractured in her arm. So, an internal fixation (installing plate) done by operation would be ideal. For the shoulder, I cannot make out any fracture which needs surgery. Anything minor can be managed by support and strapping for clavicle. Chest pain and breathing problem will be there due to multiple rib fractures. CT suggests minimal blood in the thorax. She will require chest tubes (which might already have been put) on both sides, but the decision is clinically based. High dose analgesics (painkillers) will be required for the pain, to help her breathe. Also, she may require ventilatory support for the sometime as she may not be able to breathe well due to the pain. I could not see any report suggesting blood clot in the veins whether it is in the upper limbs or lower limb. If it is associated with the fracture in the upper limb, then the best treatment is surgical removal during fracture fixation. Lower limb clot also may need surgery based on the extent of involvement, and it is a clinical decision. It is usually done at the earliest. As it has already been 10 days since the accident, I do not understand which clot they are talking about. Remaining supportive care is going on as required as you have written. Her last hemoglobin was 8.3. I believe she was given blood transfusions after that. If not, she needs blood transfusion too."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, From last few days, I have been facing cold. Cold is my common friend due to allergy. The friendship is almost 8 years old. I have been using tablet Levocetirizine when required. In this recent episode of cold attack, I am having irritating cough. It even wakes me up at night. At the time of sleep, some sort of snoring sound comes out from my chest. I can feel that it is due to cough. I am attaching the sound. The mucus is dense and pale yellow in color. Please suggest me the right way to get out of this.","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I appreciate you for uploading the sound clip (attachment removed to protect patient identity) which is a really helpful move. You are having the typical symptoms of asthma and the sound clip showed that you have \\"expiratory wheeze\\". When the airways are narrowed due to some reason, it makes difficult for air to pass in and out of the lungs and creates such noises as you can hear in this sound clip. Cough is a part of acute exacerbation of the asthma attack. You need to have proper medicine for sometime to get rid of the situation. You need reliever medicines to give you ease right now and also some long term relief medicine named controller medicines. Keep a follow up for better outcome. 1. Pulmonary function tests. 2. Allergy test for asthma. 1. Combivent inhaler - combination of Albuterol and Ipratropium bromide. You use this when you feel shortness of breath or the sounds like you have right now with respiration. It means you will need it as needed. 2. Prednisone by mouth 20 mg twice daily for two weeks. 3. Azithromycin 400 mg once daily for 10 days. 4. Ebastine 10 mg twice daily for 10 days. 5. Ibuprofen twice daily for a week. 6. Cough syrup available over the counter."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have few questions which I would like to ask a professional. As I am not able to find the answers by myself, I would love to hear from a practicing professional. How is the best Insulin treatment (syringe, pen, pump and pod) selected for a type 1 diabetes patient? Generally, how long the patients need to learn the injecting technique? Why does injecting Insulin into the same location cause a hard bump in that area? Is this reaction the reason ports are not used to deliver Insulin? How common is the use of the new inhaled Insulin? Does it have to be supplemented by another method of injection? When would an islet cell transplant be recommended? When would a patient be given an entire pancreas transplant operation rather than an islet cell transplant? In both situations, what keeps the beta cells from being tagged by autoantibodies and destroyed again?","Doctor":"Hi. Rather than the best way, we consider more convenient and economical ways for the patient. The best is always an Insulin pump, but it is costly and requires continued patient education. Injecting Insulin into the same site will cause damage to the fat tissue which results in necrosis (cell death). Because of the fat damage, hard bump forms. New inhalation Insulin is not yet come into usage in full fledges. Also, I have not put any of my patients yet on inhaled Insulin, so cannot comment. But yes, initially it has to be supplemented with subcutaneous Insulin as dosing and efficacy is not completely established for Inhaled Insulin. Islet cell transplant is recommended for patients of type 1 diabetes who are difficult to control on Insulin (by any method). If the transplant is considered for only diabetes purpose then only islet cell transplant is sufficient. The pancreas has other functions like digestion. If the digestion system gets impaired in a patient who is requiring islet cell transplant, in such a patient'sentire pancreas transplant would be helpful. Well, if no immunosuppressant is used post-transplant, these autoantibodies can destroy the newly transplanted pancreas also."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My nose is always blocked and have mucus, from past four months.

My skin is peeling now, and I cannot use any cream or soap, as it starts burning. I had been to the dermatologist, and he gave me Emolene and Eumosone. I have been using it from past 1.5 months, but the results are slow. Please suggest some cream or ointment, which will heal my skin fast, as I have a family function this week.","Doctor":"Hi. Use of strong cosmetics and bleaches does affect the natural look of the skin. In a few people with sensitive skin, it does lead to irritant dermatitis. The essential step in the management of such a situation is adequate sun protection. Sun exposure only further worsens the situation by leading to burns, redness, and pigmentation.  I would advise you try using a good sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, daily in the mornings immediately after a bath. Also, preferably avoid sun exposure between 11 AM to 3 PM.

She is very sensitive to weather change. We consulted a local doctor and he advised for Mantoux test. The report says that the erythema and induration developed around 18x16 mm area after 48 hours. What does it mean? Also, the doctor has given tablet Rifacept Kid-3 for six months. Please explain what is it for?","Doctor":"Hi. Recurrent episodes of cough and cold occur when the child has decreased immunity due to some illness or it could be a symptom of tuberculosis. Mantoux test of more than 10x10 mm is suggestive of tuberculosis. In your child, it is 18x16 mm which is strongly positive. In tuberculosis, the symptoms are weight loss or poor weight gain, persistent cough and low-grade fever. The confirmation tests are positive Mantoux test, increased ESR level, and x-ray may or may not show patches. Usually, a history of tuberculosis contact is also present. Going by symptoms in your child, like recurrent cough and cold, weight is around 12 kg which is less for her age with positive Mantoux test is suggestive of tuberculosis. In tuberculosis, treatment is continued for six months. Initially, a combination of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol is given for two months which is changed to Isoniazid and Rifampicin for four months. Your doctor has given Rifacept Kid-3 tablet which contains Isoniazid, Rifampicin, and Pyrazinamide but no Ethambutol. In my opinion, Akurit-4 should be started which has Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol, this should be given for two months after which drug should be changed to a combination of Isoniazid and Rifampicin. You should give the drug of tuberculosis regularly; tuberculosis is a treatable disease so there is no need to panic."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain and sometimes heavy bleeding during or after sex and I can only do certain positions where I can tolerate the pain.

You need to get a pap smear test and a per speculum examination done to rule out cervical erosions or cervicitis which are the most common cause of post-coital bleeding in reproductive age group women. The element of infection present can cause pain during menses and also a pelvic inflammatory disease which can be a cause for heavy menstruation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old male.

Some days it seems a bit better and some days worse. I have stopped doing weight training due to quarantine, but I am not sure if this is related to my problem. What should I sign up to check me? Or will this just go away?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from pain on your right breast that probably under the nipple and it is painful to touch. Some medical conditions can cause breast pain. When abnormal growth and swelling of breasts in men caused by excess amount of estrogen and less amount of testosterone production is known as Gynaecomastia. Cyst is a lump under the skin, and they contain fluid or air. They can cause breast pain. Putting extra pressure on the muscles can cause a strain. Fat necrosis occurs where fat tissue becomes damaged. Fibroadenoma is a non-cancerous lump and can be developed in breats and occur rarely in males. Breast cancer is rarer but can occur in males. Again chest or cardiac abnormalities, acid reflux, back, neck, or shoulder pain may cause breast pain. Treatment depends on the causes. You should undergo some investigations like mammogram, ultrasound scan, CT scan, biopsy, ECG (electrocardiography), CXR (chest x-ray), etc. To find out the underlying the causative culprit for your sufferings and treat them accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The possibilities of your problem despite pills maybe 1) Missing pills in between. 2) Taking pills not on time (these two are the most common causes for such a scenario). 3) Dose of the pill may not be enough. However, as you are complaining of severe pain, have an in-person gynecologist opinion. USG (ultrasound) abdomen is done to rule out uterine, and ovarian pathology.

After carefully reviewing your uploaded ECG recordings, I would like to assure you that your QTc interval is not more 440 ms, which is not dangerous or life-threatening for a female patient.

There are a few precautions that can be helpful. Three months time is just start so not to worry actually if she has regular cycles. I will advise some healthy lifestyle habits, some precautions.

Have recreational activities to have better emotional and mental health. For males, better to quit smoking as it reduces fertility and can show some effects on the fetus. Have complete treatment of any health issue you have. A woman should take Folic acid daily if normal BMI and no chronic health issue, then 0.4 mg and if high BMI and health issues then 5 mg daily. Have a balanced diet with less salt, sugar, oil and spice, more fish, dry fruits, vegetables, and fruits. Have sex in the fertile period of the cycle, check positioning during sex to have better penetration and female better to stay asleep after sex to move semen gradually to the destination rather than move and wash away in the toilet.

It started out like a pimple and is now spreading. I thought it was an infected pimple and applied Bactroban which did not help. It tingles and burns.I do not know whether it is a fungal infection or not. I had something similar to that last year, and that took long to heal as well. It healed and left a dark mark on my face as you can see in the picture.I had a blood test done, and everything came back normal. I am taking Multivitamin, Vitamin D and B12 now. The spot is bothering me because I am very fair and it is right on my cheek.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sure your problem is distressing and is affecting you severely. Let us understand your case. Since you are a very fair skin type patient, you are naturally more exposed to sun radiation which is UV-A and UV-B (ultraviolet A and B) rays. In effect what it does is, it disrupts the self-healing power of your skin and makes you more vulnerable to sun damage. The damage surmounts over time and the net result is skin changes along with the symptoms you described in your questionnaire. Microscopically, the cells in the deepest layers undergo irreversible changes and the cellular environment becomes a very rampant scenario where the speed to clear the damaged cells falls short of the rate at which the cells are damaged. So it results in pigmentation, slow or non-healing and damage at the molecular level. In my professional opinion, gauging from the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) alone my diagnosis goes in favor of discoid lupus erythematosus or DLE. It is a chronic or longstanding skin response to sun damage. It is a reversible benign condition if we institute the treatment right away. However, if we leave it to change letting time be the healer, it can transform itself into a more severe form of skin condition. It would include wearing a good sunscreen like SPF50+ (sun protection factor) or SPF70 with PA+++ on a daily basis. It should be applied liberally on all the sun-exposed sites of the body like arms, face, neck, etc. You must apply it 15-20 minutes before going outdoors. It should be reapplied again after 2-3 hours. If the face becomes oily, it is a good idea to cleanse the face with a face wash and then reapply the sunblock. My advice is to visit your dermatologist and take a skin biopsy to analyze the edges and the cell changes to clinch the perfect diagnosis. Biopsy is the definitive diagnosis. The treatment option is adequate sun protection. You can use mid-potent steroid cream like Mometasone on the affected part every night for 12-14 days and you can see a dramatic improvement. Avoid sun at all costs. Use a cloth to cover the area when you go outside. Strict sun protection is the cornerstone of the treatment. Try eating more of beta-carotene in diet from sources like carrots which act as natural sunscreens."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from acute eruptive lichen planus. I consulted a doctor and had some medicines. But still the marks are there and itching too. I am applying Lobate cream.

It has been seen that skin lesions subside within 9-12 months in about 50 percent of the cases. Since you are still developing fresh lesions you will have to take a course of tablet Prednisolone 20 mg daily for 6 weeks which can be reduced gradually. You seem to have severe itching which is not responding much to Levocetirizine. I would recommend you take tablet Hydroxyzine 25 mg twice daily till the itchy subsides. Along with this apply Clobetasol propionate on the itchy areas. But if large surface area is involved, dilute it in a moisturizing lotion in the ratio of 1:4. This will surely help you. 1.

Now, I am experiencing accelerated heart rate and in particular, irregular heartbeat. It was usual with what I have taken so far, and I will not repeat this mistake. However, I would like to understand whether I need urgent care or not. I have attached the ECG, and I have recorded it with my mobile as it has a heartbeat sensor.","Doctor":"Hi. I welcome you and want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I have seen the heart beat monitored through your smartphone (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I want to assure you that this is not a big concern of medical emergency. You need not worry as it is a temporary increase in heartbeat. You will soon be normal. You need no antidote as your body will adjust at its own.  When there is a high dose of the stimulants in the body, the heart rate increases due to the effects of the drugs. Our heartbeat increase and it is sensed by the sensors. It leads to an increased parasympathetic activity and that causes a decrease in the heart rate and heart beat goes normally. This is a natural reflex activity that happens in all. You also will get normal heart rate and normal heart beat.  I do not think this is a medical emergency and you need not worry much. Relax and sit calm. I am happy to know that you will not do it again. It is necessary to know that if you will do it again and again it will have very dangerous effect on the heart and may cause severe damage or heart failure due to enlargement or sudden cardiac death which occurs in severe cases when heart gets an abnormal rhythm (arrhythmia). The heart beats in the mobile sensor are not reliable but I have seen hundreds of them. So when I decode yours, it is harmless for now. There is nothing significant. Nothing needed much. Take plenty of water and avoid caffeinated drinks of any type."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Five years ago my mother was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I think she also has rheumatoid arthritis.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

But I am teething and it feels uncomfortable. What to do to get relief from it?","Doctor":"Hi. Wisdom tooth eruption will occur periodically. You will feel pain and pressure in months. For relief, you may take tablet Brufen 400 mg twice a day for three days. Put oral gel Clinica (Chlorhexidine with Metronidazole) three to four times a day for a week in that particular area. And lastly that is most important, do saline water mouthrinses three times a day for two weeks. It will relieve the soreness of gum areas. Take a 1/4th teaspoon of salt in a cup of lukewarm water and do its rinses."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Currently, I am using Epiduo (Adapalene + Benzoyl peroxide) gel for acne treatment. My doctor advised me to not to use any other beauty product. Because of winter my skin is becoming dry now. So, can I use any cold cream along with Epiduo? If yes, which one can I use? It has controlled acne for some extent but still pimples are there in my face. So, please suggest me any other tablet to control acne.","Doctor":"Hi.I have noted your complaints. In such a situation, the following strategy works efficiently. It takes several months to control acne even if these are moderate intensity. Therefore, waiting, for now, would be ideal. In general, your current treatment is something which is both ideal and effective while being safe. Have faith and do your best under guidance. I hope you will notice further improvement in the coming weeks and get good results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an MRV done. In the report, it said my right internal jugular vein was not visualized at the skull base. What could this possibly mean? It was never followed upon. I get terrible headaches.","Doctor":"Hi. The internal jugular vein carries blood from the brain and neck area to the heart. There are many reasons for the non-visualization of the internal jugular vein on MRV and the causes can be technical due to slow flow of blood or can be due to a mild compression of the vein due to a secondary cause. Rarely it can be from a thrombus in the lumen of the vein. If the MRV of the brain and rest of the internal jugular vein is normal, then the non-visualization is likely due to technical reasons and is artefactual. If you are having headaches, then it is better to talk to your doctors and get a neck venous Doppler done to rule out any external compression of the vein or any luminal thrombosis of chronic nature."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Most often, I have heard from doctors that there is a liquid between every joint which is similar to an oil or grease to gears in the vehicle. They say, when we crack our bone, an element of that liquid gives the cracking sound and if we do it often, then the liquid declines and we can have severe joint pain. Now the question is that chiropractic doctor most often cracks the bones which may relax for time being but would give severe pain after 50 years of age, is this fact?","Doctor":"Hello. Cracking of joints is not advisable as there is a release of nitrogen molecule which in later stages can give trouble to joints more. In chiropractic practice, there is just unlocking of the joint so that the sensory system which is located over the joint gets released of the pressure and pain comes down. Now to make it more principle way, when there is pressure on the joint this might be due to the weakness of the muscle. As the muscular system acts as a support system to maintain the gap between the joints so that the proprioceptive system of the joint do not get pressure and also joint friction is avoided. I would advise you that you focus on strengthening the muscular system so that the pressure on the joint can be relieved and also the joint proprioception do not get trouble. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Reduced joint space. X-ray. Ligament injury. Knee injury. Exercise."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am coughing yellow colored mucus or sputum for almost a week now with post-nasal drip. Does this mean I have a bacterial infection and I need antibiotic? Please look at the attached image.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your complaints. You have been having yellow colored sputum which means that you have an infection for sure but then does not mean that it has to be a viral or bacterial infection. If you have a fever and you have a productive cough like this then you will have to have an antibiotic for now. Then, when you do not have fever and just only this cough and sputum I would advise you to take medicine called Fexopen 120 milligram at night for five days and then you try steam inhalation for about five days everyday once. At this point in time, do not advise any antibiotic. I would also want you to get a basic blood investigations CBC and a chest X-ray as well to look for what kind of infection. If you have been smoking I would advise you to strongly quit smoking at present and also forever. I do not think that you will require an antibiotic if you do not have any fever. But if you do have a fever please let me know."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How common is it to develop a blood clot or PE with no underlying clotting disorder, surgery, not on birth control, etc.? Like can a PE happen out of nowhere? Or is there always a culprit?","Doctor":"Hello. Usually, there is always an underlying risk factor for the development of deep vein thrombosis. Advanced age, genetic conditions, smoking, obesity, trauma, surgery, etc., are some of the risk factors. The genetic disease includes protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, prothrombin gene mutation, etc. So it can be ruled out by full coagulation profile testing. Low molecular weight Heparin and oral anticoagulant drug like Apixaban are the modes of treatment for that. Usually, there is always some risk factor present for PE."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,The last exposure was a year back, had pin-prick sensations on head and arms. After three months, I had three HIV tests, two were blood and one rapid test oral. Eight months later, I had a PCR RNA qualitative and another fourth-generation blood test antigen and antibody, both were negative. I also got tested for Hepatitis C, HTLV I and II. But signs of lipodystrophy are present, fat relocation to the abdomen. Legs are thinning. Low testosterone, lipid abnormalities as well. Elevated sedimentation rate and CRP come and go as well. I really think this is HIV but if it does not show up on a test I cannot get treatment. Or if this is not HIV what else should I get tested for?","Doctor":"Hi. As per description, you are more obsessed with HIV rather than the actual scenario. Any infection will have a remnant in the body, called the footprint of the infection. In case of HIV, the virus leaves its particles in the body, of which p24 is the core protein that protects HIV DNA. For HIV to infect human CD4 cells, it needs to break this core protein and release RNA material from the virus which passes to human cells and then further replication continues and the virus spreads through the body. So, we test for p24 particles in the body. If they are present, then you are infected and if it is not present, then you are not infected in any case (even you highly suspect or think). So, the fourth generation detects, not just these particles but also the body's response to these particles, called p24 antibodies. So, if you are negative after three months by this test, then there is no chance of being positive with the exposure. You have to accept the truth. And coming to other conditions, lipodystrophy, check for the endocrine problem which may be a cause of low testosterone. All your complaints may have undiagnosed conditions but HIV is not at all the cause. Do not be obsessive, accept the truth that you are free of infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I get tanned really easily. My skin is super sensitive. None of the sunscreens really helped me with this problem. If I am under the sun even for five minutes, I get super super tanned.","Doctor":"Hi. Which sunscreen are you using and its SPF? Actually, sunscreens are of two types. Physical and chemical. Physical sunscreen is better in protecting from suns radiation but the problem is that they are not cosmetically acceptable. Because they are visibly seen on the face. I will suggest you use topical Vitamin C preparation along with your sunblock. Properly use sunblock of SPF 60 frequently. Apply it every two hourly and evenly.

Please could you tell me is that large for a cyst as I have been told it needs further surveillance. It is showing two benign looking hepatic cysts.","Doctor":"Hello. A 16 cm cyst is a bit large cyst. A few more details about your condition would be quite informative. Have you ever had any pain in the abdomen or jaundice in the past? Any contact with sheep, any pet dog? Kindly inform what was the management for acute cholecystitis, was cholecystectomy done or just managed with antibiotics and other medicines?

I am a 28-year-old male with one genital wart and I wanted to know if this is for life? Will this keep coming back every so often? What are the best ways to get rid of the wart and a way to prevent them from coming back? I also read that the immune system plays a big part in clearing the virus. I was thinking about taking medical mushrooms and Inosine Pranabox for immune boosting.","Doctor":"Hi. Warts are treatable. Kindly always attach the picture of the lesion for reference. It is not necessary that warts come and go. Once you are treated properly it does not mean you have to suffer from it again and again. It is human papilloma viral infection. This virus has 150 types because our immunity has to fight with this. That is why it is very important that our immune system should be healthy. The best treatment for genital wart is cryotherapy. Other can be CO2 laser. Sometimes a small wart can shed off itself but that depends upon the type of the wart. To boost your immunity you can use Zinc preparation. It has a role in preventing further warts. Genital wart. Cryotherapy for wart. Use Zinc preparation to prevent it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

In these four months, though I was in stress I gained 12 pounds of weight.I need your opinion on the following. Do all lymph nodes seen around or in left supraclavicular areas are more prone to cancer such as lymphoma, NHL or gastric cancer? What is the probability for that? How much is the size of the lymph node to be cancerous or worry about? Do you think I have lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma? I am having pale skin, black stool, blood in stool and stomach swelling, is this due to the stomach or gastric cancer? Why my node is not growing in size? Everybody says the node related with lymphoma and NHL is persistent and one. Is that right?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your queries, my opinion is as follows: Node is partially fibrotic, so it is not able to go back to its original size. There is no reason for it to grow, as there is no infection or cancer. Yes, nodes are persistent and usually multiple and increasing in size. But here it is not. At your age, very low chance for cancer. If doubtful, get an FNAC or biopsy of lymph node done. It will confirm. Blood work is useless, unless it is blood cancer. Do get back with the biopsy of the lymph node and stool examination report for further opinion.

The simplest, long-term and permanent solution for phimosis is circumcision and is a minor day care procedure. However, if you want to try medicines you can use ointment Fludrocortisone along with Clotrimazole ointment to be applied daily for three weeks. If it does not improve, go for circumcision. Even if you get relief with ointment it is likely to be a temporary solution. Moreover, after circumcision, it is easy to maintain hygiene and there is less chance of repeat infection.

After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

They are commonly used but not recommended in this age group. Does your daughter wheeze as well? Your doctor will be able to check by listening to her chest during the examination. If there is significant wheeze, nebulization can be considered. Other tips for managing cough and cold are as follows. Give her frequent sips of warm water. It will hydrate her.

In your case (if your periods are regular), you ovulated around 22nd two months back and fertilization took place only after that.

I was playing football on Monday and my left foot slipped, naturally I tried to stop myself from falling but my weight went down on my left knee and it bent backward. I did not fall on the ground, I was still standing but it was sore for a few minutes then it went, but when I tried to bend my knee backward, now it feels like something is about to pop. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hello. As you mentioned the nature of the injury and now the knee bending is difficult and painful, the first thing you did good was to stabilize the injured knee in the bandage. Now immobilizing the injured part is of utmost importance to avoid further damage to the joint and it is internal structures. Since this has happened in past as well where you were not seriously noticing to seek medical help, over a period of time ligament injury might have developed. There might be ACL injury which is common in football players and needs to be conscious about it as the game is full of fun and enjoyment. I advise you to seek an orthopedic, for getting your knee assessed as it might be of importance. He might do a checkup on a clinical basis of your knee and if needed an MRI which is of utmost importance to check the extent of the injury to the tissues within the knee joint. Please do not ignore such injuries as you can be a better player in every game you take upon. Now, there are types of ligament injuries. Some are a sprain, a partial tear or complete tear. Based on what type of injury it is we have to take up the call for the treatment plan. But be assured that all the treatment are designed to get you back in the game and live action. Post analyzing the proper injury a good exercise regimen can help you a lot more than just leaving it unattended. I hope you understand that the knee is one of the major joints for weight bearing and should not be ignored. Sports injury. MRI. ACL, ligament sprain. ACL injury. Based on MRI scan. Avoid moving the knee, avoid weight bearing, avoid knee bending."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been in combination birth control pills for over a year and recently got MMR shots.

Rubella specifically has a hazardous effect on pregnancy if occurs during the first trimester. If the shots were more than a month from your last period date, then you should not worry so much, as the antibodies are already formed, but if it is less than a month between the shots and a missed period, I guess it becomes risky. Please revert back with your vaccine date and last menstrual date.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

These kind of problems are very common due to our dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. Sometimes it is due to deficiency of enzymes also, this is uncommon and the main factor is lifestyle.  The syndrome of bloating and constipation is known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). This is a very common problem and involves around 10-30%of population. Stressful lifestyle also causes such problem. You already have one stress due to chronic illness. The management is very simple, it includes avoidance of fatty and spicy meal with plenty of water, regular exercise and alleviation of tension.

I want to assure you that do not worry as everything is going to be fine soon. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concerns. First thing is unless the diagnosis is made by an expert physician, the resembling symptoms do not mean straight that you have Parkinson's disease. There are many other drugs that are to be used as an adjunct to the Levodopa and that show a good result in many patients. Such as Levodopa with Carbidopa (a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor) is a good combination.

With all parameters, your BMI is on a higher side, and you have to lose some weight. It seems that you have been prescribed medications by your general physician for management of diabetes and hypertension. There are many causes of swelling in the legs and associated regions like ankle, etc. The most common reason is posture, and many patients develop it when they stand for a long time. But as soon as they elevate their leg up, the swelling will subside. It is also a common manifestation of systemic pathologies like diabetes, cardiac causes, etc. It can happen after infection or inflammation too. Sometimes heavy physical activity may also lead to swelling in your calf muscles and around ankle region. But we have to look at medical causes as well. Chronic cardiac conditions can lead to swelling. Any pathology which leads to low protein in the body like deranged liver function tests, kidney function tests, etc., can also lead to swelling. Hypothyroidism can also lead to generalized swelling like appearance in the body. So for accurate diagnosis, we need to clinically evaluate and get some appropriate tests done. It includes CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), LFT (liver function test), KFT (kidney function test), serum electrolytes and thyroid profile. Most of the conditions can be managed under the supervision of a good physician especially if there is no history of any injury which is also very unlikely to happen around both ankles simultaneously. 1. Postural. 2. Cardiac causes and hypertension. 3. Systemic pathology like diabetes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got my teeth cleaned two weeks ago by a dentist and now a tooth is sensitive to heat.","Doctor":"Hi. Sensitivity is a common encounter after scaling and cleaning. I reckon you should try toothpastes which help reduce sensitivity. But even after using them if you feel sensitive to hot or cold then visit your dentist again to check for any hidden cavities. X-rays might be required to find them out."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have about 4 inches of patches of ringworms on both of my buttocks and a 3-inch patch on my vaginal area. I am using Covate GM cream for the treatment but it is not showing any results. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. If you have ringworm infection, kindly use oral and topical antifungal agents.

Will you please advice any other medicine?","Doctor":"Hi. I read about your mother's complaint. I would advise you to have a basic blood investigation to look for serum potassium level. If potassium is low, she will need extra potassium in her diet like tender coconut water and other dietary supplementation. You will also require a complete physical examination.

It does not seem to go away no matter what I do. It hurts to move or do anything. Could I be in labor? And do I need to go to the hospital?","Doctor":"Hello. The sudden onset back pain in a full term pregnant patient is likely to be due to lightening when the baby's head goes down in pelvis and the sacrum and coccyx bone extend to accommodate the presenting part. If there is no abdominal tightness and contractions which are of increasing intensity and lasting for more than 15 to 20 seconds each, then unlikely that you are in labor.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

As explained by you, this seems to be the case of crown fracture in which no deep part of the tooth is involved. Even simple fracture of the crown (enamel) may cause sensitivity and roughnesses caused by fracture may cause traumatic ulcers.

Next, to the headache, I have observed a decline in my cognitive skills (learning, concentration). I can take care of the headache using meditation techniques, however, I am not able to deal with the decline, which is causing degradation of my private and work-related performance. Apparently, there is a medicine available that can enhance cognitive performance- Modafinil. I wanted to ask you for an opinion, how to take the medicine, what should I pay attention to (dosage, cycles).","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that Modafinil is a drug used in other medical conditions, but I do not think that this drug is appropriate in your clinical condition. This drug is usually indicated in persons suffering from increased daily sleepiness or sleep apnea. I do not think that this is the case. You should know that chronic tension headache does not lead to cognitive decline, especially at your age. The cognitive decline in your case could be attributed to the lack of concentration due to accumulated psychological stress. When you cannot concentrate, you cannot learn, and this makes you think that you suffer from a cognitive decline, which is not true. The good news is that this is quite a reversible situation, with the proper therapy. That is also the main cause underlying tension-type headache. Coming to this point, I would recommend starting SSRI (Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, etc.), which can help reduce the tension-type headache and also improve your concentration and your cognitive skills. Yoga can also help improve your situation.  Psychological stress. Troubles with concentration. Tension-type headache and troubles with concentration.

First thing it is inhalational anesthesia and most commonly used in pediatric procedure, it means there is no use of any kind of drug for anesthesia. Only a gas mask placed on face and a balanced ratio of N2O (laughing gas) and oxygen release for a conscious sedation. For continues monitoring an anesthesiologist should be present all time during procedure. After procedure within a minute child will wake up from sedation. So, please do not worry about this.

Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid (dosage based on age and weight) and trypsin-chymotrypsin combination can work if it is an infective origin for the irritation.

Please clarify the dosage too as his present weight is 15 kg.","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to icliniq.com. I have read your question in detail. The initial dose of Topiramate is 1 mg/kg/day which is gradually increased to 5-10 mg/kg/day. Your child is getting 100 mg Topiramate which is around 6 mg/kg/day. So, the dosage of Topiramate is correct. There are some side effects like anorexia, weight loss, blurring of vision and glaucoma. But these occur at late stages and when higher doses are given. So, in my opinion, Topiramate is not causing any problems in your child. Secondly, the initial dose of Clobazam is 0.1mg/kg/day which is gradually increased to 0.3 to 1 mg/kg/day. In your case, your child is getting 15 mg daily which comes to 1 mg/kg /day. Side effects of Clobazam are constipation, behavior changes, aggression, sleep disturbance, weight gain.

You can take hormone pills for two to three months to stabilize your hormones, and the problem should resolve. But before I prescribe you the medicine, I would like to know if you are under any medication? Have you got any test done for the same?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a doubt regarding some general facts. Please explain the following elaborately. Is it fine to pluck out a gray hair? What happens when something gets stuck in between teeth for several days? What is the effect of teeth chatter? What is the growling of the stomach? When does the ear pop? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. When we pluck out a hair, we feel a slight sharp pain at that point of time. The hair usually breaks along with its follicle, thus that space remains hairless in the future. But if the hair breaks in between with its follicle intact, then the hair will regrow. When food gets stuck in between teeth for many days, the primary problem is the discomfort for one or two days. Then followed by the food particle gets decomposed causing bacteria formation which then causes initiation of caries from sides of both teeth due to acid production. You must pay attention to such a decayed tooth. When our teeth chatter, there is not much discomfort or other problems. But it can cause attrition of incisal edges and sensitivity in the long-term. Our stomach growls when our stomach is empty, thus acid production irritates the stomach walls and gas is formed. This growling is called hunger pangs. It is a physiological method by which the body lets the mind know about the need for food immediately. Our ears pop when there is a pressure change in the atmosphere. For example, when we go to a higher altitude, the eardrum adjusts to the external pressure by changing its position slightly. This helps in creating an equal pressure both inside the ear canal and outside. This maintains our body balance and helps in standing erect."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am experiencing lower back pain. It is hard to sit up and to stand or to do any rotating motions. There is also pain with curving my back. I have tried a massage bed and using tennis balls and a foam roller to stretch out the lower back but that is not helping.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through history. It appears to me as a sacroiliac joint dysfunction. As it has occurred in the past and resolved, it should not be a big issue this time also. In sacroiliac joint dysfunction, there is a malpositioning of the sacrum and the iliac crest which can lead to sharp shooting pain which is non-radiating or tingling in nature. Maybe you have too much muscle spasm. You can use hot water fomentation and try to lie on your back and tuck the stomach in for 30 seconds, keep repeating this for 10 times with a pause of 30 seconds in between. By 2 to 3 days of time, you should perform well. Post this, you have to start working out for your core and hip muscle strengthening to be precise the gluteus muscles. Muscle weakness. Nothing required. DDD. Muscle spasm with SIJ dysfunction. Hot water fomentation with exercise.

You are suffering from bilateral epididymo-orchitis (infection of the testis). You need to rule out any obstruction in your urine tract which might cause this. Do you have any difficulty in passing urine? Or any problem with urine flow? Get done with uroflowmery test which will rule out any urinary obstruction.

Your upper and lower jaw are connected with a joint called temperomandibular joint. Similarly we have elbow joint and knee joint. The lower jaw is movable only because of this joint. So whenever you yawn, sounds like that joint is rubbing high and that is why you feel that something is going up. You might be able to hear a clicking noise as well if I am not wrong. If you are feeling sore at your joint every time after yawning, please visit a GP and he or she might give you a script for this like a muscle relaxant."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have hemorrhoids and a lot of gas build up that triggers it painfully, constantly.

In an effort to not be so reliant on it, I am trying probiotics with no luck. Would you recommend any topical treatment as well as probiotics to help treat the gas and hemorrhoids?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, stop all spicy, junk and fermented food. Consume fruits like banana, papaya, pomogrenate, grapes. Avoid green chilli completely. Take one cup of water, add 1/2 teaspoon of jeera and boil it, do not filter and add 1/2 teaspoon of ghee. Drink warm daily once for 10 days. Have buttermilk daily before lunch.

Yes, it is hidradenitis suppurativa. I can understand it is a very difficult time for you. This condition requires both medical and surgical treatment. It is the problem with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Once the glands are out, one can have relief. Right now you have active infection over the area so please start taking antibiotics. Hidradenitis suppurativa. Tablet Augmentin (Amoxiclav) 1 gm BD for two weeks, tablet Rifampicin 450 mg BD for two weeks. Apply Clindamycin lotion over the area.

Citalopram tablets are recommended to be administered as a single daily dose either in the morning or evening. The usual dose is 20 mg daily but can go up further up to 40 mg daily. I presume you have been prescribed Citalopram to manage depression or anxiety or related emotional disorders. Can I clarify why you want to split the dose? If you are experiencing any side-effect like sedation you can take the dose at night time. How long have you been on Citalopram? Usually, you will get used to the medication by two weeks or so. If side effects are persistent and severe, kindly review with your prescribing doctor. Anecdotally, I have seen a few patients taking Citalopram twice daily instead of once daily. They have responded fine without any adverse effects. But once daily dosage is the well studied and recommended dosage plan."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got the influenza vaccination about a week ago and have a swollen and painful lump in my armpit.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. You are having lymph node swelling axillary post influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is a very safe vaccine. Although some may have local pain, swelling, and fever. Some may have local lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy is a swelling of lymph node (normal gland present in our body, which function as clearing harmful substances and providing immunity). Local and systemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process. It is a reactive response of the lymph node to the vaccination. So no need to worry. It can be managed by simple Paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medication such as Serratiopeptidase. It should resolve within a week. If it is associated with fever or any other site enlargement of lymph node you can visit your physician. I hope this helps. Reactive lymphadenitis. CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), USG (ultrasound) axillary lymph node. Lymphadenopathy. anti-inflammatory Paracetamol 500 mg twice or thrice daily or Aceclofenac, Paracetamol, and Serratiopeptidase combination tablet twice daily for three days. Follow up after three days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My teeth are straight at this point but a few very small misalignments that will easily be fixed soon. I have an impacted tooth above my right-side second pre molar on my top row of teeth that is facing the wrong direction and needs to be removed. The problem is that my orthodontist wants to take out the tooth below it, the parallel second premolar on the left side of my top row and the two teeth on my bottom row matching where the top two are to balance out my mouth so it is not asymmetrical. (After these, the removed the braces would continue to close the gaps). Do I really need to get four teeth taken out (five including the impacted one) in order to fix this issue? Not only does it seem like such a large amount of teeth to lose at a young age but I have also heard many scary stories about how this will change the permanent shape of my face and jawline. Do you agree with this decision? My orthodontist does seem knowledgable but I have never heard of someone personally who has had to get five teeth on all sides of their mouth removed for one impact. I am just really scared that my face will look terrible.","Doctor":"Hi. Actually, by book, this is the only way the Orthodontist can make your face look symmetrical. Ideally, only four teeth are extracted as described by your dentist on each side of the jaw in crowded teeth but unfortunately, your fifth one is impacted so it has to go too. He is absolutely right according to his treatment plan. But now looking up to a broader aspect, I want to offer you a second treatment option too that many patients go for because they do not want to prolong ortho treatment too much and want to avoid many extractions. This second treatment plan has an extraction of 2 or 1 tooth only. If the maxillofacial surgeon is able to remove the impacted tooth only without touching or removing the tooth below it, it is best. Then you do not have to go for any extractions. Your case will simply end up as it is. But if the below tooth and impacted tooth both are removed, there will be space left for one socket. In this socket, implant screw can be placed and once it gets firmer with bone in 4 to 6 months then a cap will be placed on it. First, get ortho done and keep this space of socket intact through space maintainer, you do not need orthodontist to move teeth here to close the gap. End up treatment and then place the implant in this socket. That is simple, no more extractions will be needed then. The third treatment plan is that get extracted both impacted and the below tooth. Keep space of socket intact till your braces get off, then get a bridge of three units done here. Two teeth of support and one missing tooth will be covered. That is the most economical option to go for. Implant and prolonged ortho treatment both look costly and time taking as compared to it. The only cons of this is that slight 2 mm grinding of natural teeth is done that is not harmful at all. I would suggest you personally for the third option. Rest you can decide well. Hopefully, you would have got a clear idea of all treatment plans. If you can afford, then for you, the second treatment plan will be best as no adjacent natural teeth will be involved, only a single implant will be placed in bone directly."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have struggled with staph for nine years. I have tested positive for MRSA on at least three occasions in the last 10 years and at least two other different strains of staph. I have taken Doxycycline several times, Bacetrine, and several other oral antibiotics in the past. I have also been given injections in the butt along with taking the antibiotics. After several years of this, the outbreaks are usually confined to my face. Mostly my nose. I use antibiotic ointment a lot but it does not seem to help either. When I take the oral antibiotics they usually clear my face up but the outbreaks keep coming back after I stop taking them. I believe that I probably have staph in my bloodstream and it just sleeps when the antibiotics are being taken and then comes back out once I stop taking them. It usually coagulates in my nose and the outbreaks start there. What is the most effective treatment for this?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for your inquiry. Here are some strategies to minimize the risk of these recurrent MRSA skin infections. 1. Hygiene: The bacteria that cause skin infections are transmitted by skin contact. Wash your hands diligently and frequently to minimize the spread of bacteria to other parts of your body, to other people, and to objects you touch. 2. Decontaminate yourself: Bleach baths are an effective way to reduce the amounts of bacteria living on your skin (see instructions below). If you are unable to do bleach baths, you may use antiseptic wipes (Chlorhexidine) to wash your body daily. Your doctor will give you a prescription for Chlorhexidine if required. 3. Antibiotics: Not all skin infections require oral or IV antibiotics, as many of them are self-limiting. Antibiotics should be reserved for more severe infections. Your doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic to apply inside your nose to reduce the amount of the skin infection-causing bacteria. 4. Decontaminate Your Environment: The bacteria that causes skin infections also live in your environment. You should routinely decontaminate high contact surfaces, like tabletops, countertops, doorknobs or handles, chairs, handheld devices, etc., with antiseptic solutions. Do not reuse the same towels before they have been thoroughly washed. Clean your linens frequently. Avoid sharing personal items such as razor blades, nail clippers, towels, clothing, etc. 5. Cover open wounds: If you have an open wound on your skin, it is important to keep it covered to prevent the spread of bacteria. Do not participate in activities requiring skin-to-skin contact with others until wounds are fully healed. Do not share personal items that come in contact with the wound. Bleach Baths: Add ¼ to ½ cup of common 5 % household bleach to a bathtub full of water (40 gallons). Soak your entire body, keeping your head above water, for about 10 to 15 minutes. Limit diluted bleach baths to not more than twice a week. Do not submerge your head and be very careful to avoid getting the diluted bleach into the eyes. Rinse off with fresh water and apply moisturizer."},{"Patient":"A couple of weeks before I got severe heartburn, I often felt really bloated and nauseous especially after meals but I kept ignoring it as the symptoms would go away. A month back, I had a faint heartburn throughout the day, and woke up in the middle of the night with severe heartburn all over my chest . Mid week it was so bad that it went in my throat and everything. I went to the hospital and was immediately prescribed ranitidine 150mg for 14days. As it came to week 2, I got only worse, with no sleep whatsoever, lump in my throat, extreme fatigue where my leg was involuntarily fluttering and my lip was voluntarily twitching. By third week I started omeprazole 40mg with the ranitidine and the heartburn intensity reduced but I experienced lots of other symptoms like bloatedness, stomach making noises all the time, nausea, breathlessness was the main one, heart palpitations which were never ending and this constant pressure on my nose and head. I’m now in week 5 and unfortunately the heartburn is still very much there, it comes and goes. The lump in My throat has improved from the second week but it still feels very heavy, I can almost press it and feel something clicking. Doc has said to double my dose of omeprazole so to take 80mg plus ranitidine. Will I get any relief at all from this constant heartburn and all the other symptoms? Am I in some sort of serious trouble? I’ve lost quite a bit of weight, I’m on bland food, elevated at night and all the lot but yet my quality of life is so heavily impacted as I can’t do anything throughout the day because of the constant palpitations, heartburn or pressure in my nose and head or the bloatedness and nausea. The heartburn gets worse after i eat. Please help! I’m only 28 and don’t understand why this happened to me as i was never obese or had any health conditions except hypothyroidism. Last thing to mention, my stools since having acid reflux issue has been a pale yellow and has only recently started to be brown again, what could this mean as well? Any help would be appreciated, as docs are just putting it down to anxiety and stress all the time.","Doctor":"Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. I can understand that must very much frustrated for your ongoing non resolving symptoms. I want you to understand why this symptoms of heartburn occurs in reality. Hear burn is a common symptoms, that can occur in normal subjects as well but does remain long. In some people heart burn occur secondary to acid reflux in food pipe (esophagus)- which usually settles with one dose acid suppressant medication or twice daily capsule. However, there is a third group of individuals where by the maximum does acid suppressant does not effect very much-as in your case. We call this condition as refractory Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). So why I started emphasizing on all this, because management is different. The work up of refractory GERD start with an endoscopy-a procedure where by a gastroenterologist puts a tube with camera in to your esophagus and see what is inside. Also there are other battery of test which could confirm what is exactly a problem- may be straightforward i..e. reflux, but it can be some thing which is mimicking GERD. The GERD mimickers are many. The one of most common are esophageal motility disorders-which are another set of disorders in itself. So to cut the story short, I want you to first of all optimize the acid suppressant treatment. I know you taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily, but it is important you take these medication 30 minutes or sometime 45 min. before meal. It is very important, since at times it is timing which is important than the drug itself. But, if you are doing it already in that manner, I would recommend you to think about endoscopy now. But it would help us to determine some other more information not necessarily the acid reflux. Keep taking gaviscon, but increase the dose. Take 15 to 20 ml at one time, 4 to 5 times daily and half hour after meals. The rest of your symptoms such as feeling lump in throat is common if someone has reflux. It is called as globus sensation. Dont worry about that. It will go away once your acid controlled adequately. The stress and anxiety sometime create a vicious cycles, where the disorder is perpetuated and influenced by it. But I think this is not the only explanation of your problem. The stress is obvious thing in one with non resolving symptoms. For example if do not reach to a particular diagnosis by endoscopy, I would consider testing for esophageal motility disorders, and some more allergic and hyperalgesic problems of esophagus. But for now, let the above treatment plan work. Meanwhile get some blood test done as advised below. I hope this would be helpful for you Let me know if you need any future consultations. Have a good day Refractory GERD complete blood count Check your thyroid status. TSH, FT4, FT3 GERD Motility disorders Esinophilic esophagitis After 1 week"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just want to ask that where can I buy an EC pill?

Anyways, after a few days my left eye started to go outward and within a short time went completely outward (divergent squint). At that time, I did not care nor did my parents but now I am 22 years of age and suffer from social anxiety because of my eye. So the question is can it be corrected with surgery? Is there any chance of me having double vision after the surgery assuming everything goes well? Thirdly, an eye doctor said it may again turn one day. Is that true? Is there any possibility of eye turning again after surgery?","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, as you have mentioned that you have had a total retinal detachment (RD) in your LE during childhood, I would like to emphasize on the fact that RD surgery will not help in improving your vision. The squint you are talking about is an adaptive mechanism of the eye towards poor vision due to RD (abnormal retinal correspondence). Even after squint surgery, the vision would not improve. Squint surgery involves either lengthening or shortening of the muscle. So the amount of correction needed is only a subjective measure. Only for cosmetic reasons, squint can be corrected. The outcome of surgery can be analyzed only by performing certain tests. Also, whether the squint can revert back or not can be decided only by the test results. So, kindly revert back to me with the following test reports. Refraction testing, intraocular pressure, dilated fundus examination, B scan of LE, OCT of LE, squint evaluation (qualitative and quantitative). Coming back to your questions. Firstly, squint correction can be done for cosmetic reasons with no visual outcome. There are chances of having double vision or diplopia after squit surgery, depending on whether there is over or under correction. There are chances of squint reverting back (due to various other reasons). Kindly revert back with your reports."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old female, no current medications, no known conditions, family history of many different heart problems on both maternal and paternal sides, seen by a cardiologist for bigeminy and irregular heartbeat over the summer, palpations still happen pretty often, chest and shoulder pain both on the left side still happening occasionally. Told by my cardiologist that I have nothing to worry about at all, have not talked to her since then. Yesterday, I got my paperwork and my test results from wearing the 24 hour Holter monitor and I am extremely worried.","Doctor":"Hi. What you have is called premature ventricular contractions (AKA PVCs), which are extra beats coming from the bottom chamber of the heart and in some occasions they present in every other beat (what is called ventricular bigeminy) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These beats can be tolerated as normal in many individuals, However, there are two things that are the most important factors to consider: 1. What is the burden (amount or percentage of PVCs in 24 hours in your heart? While some people say that up to 6 PVCs per hour is normal, the number that cardiologist gets worried is more than 10,000 or more than 20,000 in 24 hours. The main reason we get worried with this number is because this is the limit when PVCs can be associated with impairment of the squeezing function of the heart. 2. What is the heart function, in particular, what is the ejection fraction (squeezing function) which in other words is the ability to pump the blood? If the ejection fraction is low, we have to explore the amount of PVCs (particularly if more than 10,000 in 24 hours) as a potential cause of this low pumping function. This is something that can be done with an ultrasound of the heart. If we do see that the pumping function is low and there are more than 10000 PVCs in 24 hours, we need to consider treating this with medications, a catheter-based procedure or both. Finally, it is important to determine if you have a lot of symptoms, in particular, palpitations, dizziness, fainting or chest pain, in a regular basis and if these symptoms are interfering with your life.

Currently, being treated with Prednisolone 8 mg to go to 5 mg and Azathioprine 50 much. My ALT/AST are within normal range last two months coming down from almost 2000. ESR has been steadily rising since past five months, commenced Azathioprine later, ESR was normal. Can you tell me your thoughts? I did not see the consultant for two months. I have been told all other blood reports are fine, ESR now is 52.","Doctor":"Hi. In general, ESR is a very non-specific marker. It has no significance in isolation. However, in countries where tuberculosis is predominant, we always consider it while a person is on immunosuppressive drugs. So you can ask your doctor for a chest X-ray. It is however not essential if you do not have any symptoms in general. So go ahead with your treatment. If you have any symptoms like cough, weight loss, then we need to do work-up for tuberculosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem controlling my anger and anxieties which leads to erratic, eruptive behavior. It is hard to let bad things go for me. My expectations from others are very high and that leads to making them feel bad for not doing enough.","Doctor":"Hello. Could you please provide more details about the problem? Do you think that the anger issues are persistent since years or are these issues occurring in episodes? Like you become irritable and have anger outbursts for a few weeks and then you are totally alright? The repetitive anger outbursts could occur in some mood disorders like bipolar disorder. But other symptoms like stubbornness, increased activity, the risk-taking behavior, decreased need for sleep, disinhibited behavior, etc., are also seen. These symptoms usually occur in episodes. This could be due to intermittent explosive disorders. Episodes of anger outbursts are seen usually and sometimes after that, individuals feel guilty because of their behavior. Even atypical depression can present with irritability which cannot be explained. Low mood, sensitivity to rejection, anxiety, etc., are seen. You should visit a psychiatrist for evaluation and treatment. Drugs like Sodium Valproate can be used for controlling mood and will reduce the anger episodes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby just turned 6 months. I gave him Nan Optipro One for his 1st to 6 months, now I gave him the follow up milk which is Nan Optipro Two. After two days of drinking, he is suddenly having diarrhea now (five times a day). I tried reaching out for a pediatrician in our area but they are not accepting the appointments. He is also irritated because of his blooming teeth and he is eating oatmeal with banana puree. I wanted to ask if it is just his tummy adjusting or is there any underlying problem?","Doctor":"Hello. I appreciate your concern regarding your child. I would like to advise that transition can cause diarrhea but it should settle within four to five days. If it does not then we should change the feed. Ensure hydration, give him ORS (oral rehydration solution) solution (dissolved one packet in one liter of water). She must take 90 ml of this solution after each loose stool. This ORS contains electrolytes that have lost by stool. Give it until loose stool subsides. Syrup Zinc 5 ml once a day for 14 days, it will fulfill zinc deficiency in your child and prevent further episodes of diarrhea and pneumonia also. Give him semi-solid food more along with curd (this will help to improve the digestion). During this illness watch for any color change in urine output or decreased urine output, and any lethargy. In case they come please consult."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Unsure of diagnosis (could be a combination). My questions are as follows: 1. What is my diagnosis (they say schizophrenia and autism high spectrum) memorized 200 digits of pi in one day? 2. Could I not have mental illness and Marijuana was a one-time incidence? 3. If I do need medicines and stay on Lithium, how do I get off of Olanzapine after taking it for 20 days 5 mg and 10 days 10 mg? So not to go manic from the stop. Took a lot of medical Marijuana with them and went crazy, they took me to the psych ward. Put me on medicines for the first time. Risperidone and Luvox and did great, so good I stopped taking it which I relapsed (did it too fast I believe) but the doctor will not put me back on. Then I went on Invega Sustena monthly shot and cut my self out of anger, did not really want to live, they took me off. Put me on Lithium 900, did great for six months, then I missed a few doses and mania started coming to play. They added Olanzapine and that is where my problems started. Slammed the refrigerator door 10 times, broke it. Felt the need to listen to a message of jumping out a window (I did it on the ground floor), then broke a second story window due to a message in a song. I feel Olanzapine is increasing the message and I read that it can increase hallucinations. Can I just stop Olanzapine cold turkey? Still getting messages at 10 mg but never had messages before the Olanzapine (except during medical Marijuana).","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns about the diagnosis and problems encountered by you. Although the provided information is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of a case, but from the available description, it appears to me that you are suffering from cannabis-induced psychosis, a variant of schizophrenia which often starts with the use of cannabis. Although this has a cause, elimination of cause itself never sufficient to cure the problem. I must acknowledge that before making a diagnosis I need to have access to all your records or at least 30 minutes interaction with you. As stated above I do not think your mental illness and Marijuana can be separated from each other. Although the literature is scarce I have seen multiple numbers of patients with cannabis-induced psychosis. Since the problem is already there I think there is a need to treat. Since you have responded well to Risperidone or Invega, I see more merit with Risperidone use in your case in compare to Olanzapine. Although Olanzapine can be discontinued cold turkey, there is a need to manage those voices with the use of any other medication, preferably Risperidone as stated above. So I mean to say that it is fine to discontinue Olanzapine but simultaneously talk to your psychiatrist to prescribe Risperidone to manage those hallucinations. Having said this, I would like to inform you that we need to have a one to one discussion for making a proper diagnosis and designing the best strategy for the cure of your problem. This can be done through online consultation provided you are comfortable with the idea of online consultation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What does both kidney slightly hyperechoic in an ultrasound indicate? I am 19 weeks pregnant and very worried about my baby.","Doctor":"Hi. Hyperechogenicity in kidneys is seen in some congenital polycystic renal diseases leading to renal failure in late childhood or adulthood. But in fetuses, this marker has been studied sparsely. These studies have shown that if the amniotic fluid around the baby is adequate as per gestational age, outcomes are favorable like no kidney impairment. Please follow up with USG growth scan every three weeks to note the fluid level and liver echogenicity as well. If follow up reports remain within normal limits, it is just a normal variant. No need to worry in such conditions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My child had critical pulmonary stenosis and had balloon dilation at three months. She is now 13. She has moderate pulmonary regurgitation, her LV ejaculation fraction is 69 %. She has a mildly dilated RV and pulmonary artery. She gets breathlessness. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi. As per cardiac MRI (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the degree of pulmonary valve regurgitation is moderate at the most with only mildly dilate RV. Please be assured at this stage. However, she still needs yearly follow-ups either with an echo or another cardiac MRI. If you have the full report of the MRI, I am happy to go through with you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old female, 137 lbs, and on no medications. I have had irregular periods since I was 13. The longest I have gone without a period was three months. I have had multiple negative pregnancy tests. I have not had my period since last month and I am not pregnant. I am worried about my health although this has happened before.","Doctor":"Hi. Please answer the following questions: 1. Putting on weight, and unable to lose that? 2. Acne? 3. Facial hair increased? 4. Hair loss? 5. Thick hairs on chest, back, thighs, arms, belly? 6. Any known hormonal issues? 7. Any long-term medication taken? 8. Sedentary lifestyle? 9. Are your parents diabetic or prediabetic? First few years of menarche can give you irregular periods, and that is normal as your hormonal axis is not matured enough to have a cycle, but by 15 years, it should generally be fine which in your case is not. You could be suffering from some hormonal imbalance. Work out the following: 1. A balanced diet containing loads of yellow fruits and green vegetables. 2. Regular physical exercise for 30 minutes to keep heart rate above 100 during the activity. 3. Add cinnamon and turmeric to your diet. These small changes can bring a lot of difference. Do it for the next three months. I can assure, you will feel the difference in a month but continue it. You also need to get USG pelvis done to rule out polycystic ovarian syndrome."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to ask whether composite dental bonding is durable or if I bite a mutton stew or chicken leg piece, it will come out? Is it for a lifetime? If it dismantles anyway, is it freely replaceable or I need to pay again? Also, I have heard that laser treatment leads to early fall of adult teeth in the late 50s. Is it so?","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Yes, you can eat whatever you want to eat, there is no issue of chewing. Make sure you do not eat any hard substance for the first 24 hours. After that, you can eat mutton or chicken anytime. Better is to go with the best possible restoration provided by your dentist. Less expensive fillings are also available these days but their efficiency is not too good. No, laser curing composite does not affect your teeth or make them prone to fall. If the fillings fall or come out, it will be replaced by your dentist free provided it falls early, if it falls after two or three years it may not be replaced without charges."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have 10 months old baby.

My cycle is usually 25 days and I have not got periods yet. I tested 10 times, all were negative. Should I go to gynecologist and request for an ultrasound? Will ultrasound detect early pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. The possibility of pregnancy is very less and the possibility of hormonal imbalance is more likely. Please let me know. Do you have any other symptoms like breast tenderness, abdominal pain or fullness? Have you taken Plan B before? In my opinion, you should wait for 1 to 2 weeks more before going to the gynecologist for an ultrasound. Please reply me with answers to the above-asked questions, so that I can guide you better. I will be happy to help you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 58 years old, last week he had a heart attack and turned out he had a blockage of 75 percent in the left anterior descending artery (widowmaker). So, he had a cardiac catheterization and one stent, so we feared that the side effects of quitting smoking might affect his heart since he is in no position to go through them. Is E-cigarette safe way to quit? Can it give him another heart attack? Also, he has diabetes stage 2, but we are still monitoring it.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry to hear about your father but I am glad he survived and was appropriately treated. If he wants to increase his survival and decrease the possibility of dying, having another heart attack or developing heart failure (weak heart), he must stop smoking. There is no risk of stopping smoking related to this heart disease. The real risk is not to stop smoking. In regards to E-Cigarettes, they have been found to have a risk to the heart and lungs that do not make them a safer alternative to regular smoking. However, there are plenty of therapies and measurements to help him quit and although it is not easy, they might be very effective if used appropriately. And if he fails and recurs, it is totally fine and he can try again, over and over until he quits."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My exams are about to start. I was not serious at the start but from the past few days, I have been working really hard. People near me say it is too late now something worse is going to happen. But the way I have planned things I know I could easily score good marks but the problem is I am not able to do as I thought. I am wasting most of the day wondering here and there. Plus the masturbation has also increased. Please tell me what should I do.","Doctor":"Hi. From the description, it seems that you had confidence regarding the exams before some days. But it seems that, for now, you have lost your confidence. Why have you lost your confidence? Is it because of other people who try to demotivate you? Is it because you could not perform well in mock tests? In any of the case, do not worry or think too much. The answer to your question is simple. You will score good marks if you have prepared well. You will score low marks if your performance is low and medium marks if your performance is medium. That simple. There is one more limelight. You have prepared 60 % and if almost all the questions are from the portion that you have prepared, there is still a chance of scoring 90 %. So do not be demotivated. You still have time. Last minute preparation provides more insight and knowledge. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a C-section eight years ago with my son and a C-section seven months back with my daughter. I am interested in having another child and wanted to plan on coming off of birth control till mid of this year. My doctor said that, in general, they prefer women to have two years between deliveries. My question is, when will my uterus get completely healed and ready to handle the pressure of another pregnancy? If I get pregnant sooner than later, I would be a few months less of the two-year mark.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. Generally, by book, it needs 18 months for your uterus to heal from the previous cesarean cut, but healing is regulated by many factors like intrinsic tissue quality, general nutritional status of the lady, the healing power of the body, diabetes, postoperative convalescence, sepsis, the presence of protein diet, etc. Since you had another C-section, did the doctor mention the difficulty of the cesarean section at that time? Did your first and second cesarean go well or was associated with greater care than general? Since the healing is dependent on a lot of things, and also the uterus can never come back to its original strength due to two scars on the body, so the two-year safety mark. So, if you wish to take the pregnancy sooner, you should be compliant in visiting a doctor in a tertiary care center, with an emergency OT and blood bank facility."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Actually, I have been feeling low energy, tired, and fatigue for a couple months now.

I have been getting an aching pain in my upper arm and elbow, hip and knee but mostly my upper arm. Can it be the low vitamin D that is causing it?","Doctor":"Hi. I cannot say it with utmost certainty, but yes it could be due to low vitamin D3 levels. The majority of patients with moderate to mild vitamin D deficiency (serum vitamin D between 15 and 20. The majority of patients with moderate to mild vitamin D deficiency (serum 25[OH]D between 15 and 20 ng/mL [37.5 to 50 nmol/L]) are asymptomatic. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase are typically normal. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are elevated in about 40 and 50 percent of patients with serum vitamin D levels less than 20 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Patients with low vitamin D and increased PTH (secondary increase) are at increased risk of having rapid bone loss, seen as low bone mineral density (BMD) in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA scans]), fragility fractures. With chronically low vitamin D levels one can develop secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can affect serum calcium and phosphorus levels.

I do not know your vitamin D levels, but there is usually no harm in taking vitamin D supplements orally weekly or daily."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,There is some thrush coming out of my vagina and it is slightly yellowish like cottage cheese and along with that, my vagina is burning, itching, and inflamed.","Doctor":"Hi. Have you been treated for any other health issue like diabetes or any other chronic issue? If yes, it is better to have a regular check-up and proper treatment for that. Diabetes increases risks for infections. Overtreatment can destroy normal vaginal flora to make it more prone to the infection. You already have Fluconazole tablet, it is better to have 150 mg but it would be better if you take a high vaginal swab to check in the laboratory before starting treatment. Have strict hygiene, use condoms to avoid transmission of infection. Wear soft comfortable undergarments. Avoid cosmetics and products locally and use water and soft razor for removing hairs. Have sitz baths frequently. After swab collection, have tablet Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and tablet Metronidazole 400 mg eight hourly for 14 days along with Clotrimazole and Clindamycin vaginal suppository for alternate three nights. Collect swab report and discuss. Infection.

The blister has gone but left a small dent in my hard palate which I am concerned about as it is leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Is this common?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, this is common. You do not need to worry. The mucosa of palate is very sensitive as compared to the tongue. So it gets affected easily. You just put an Oral gel Clinica (Chlorhexidine with Metronidazole) gel on the spot for three days and three times a day. Then give me a followup after five days. Hopefully, everything will be fine. New mucosa on palate grows after almost 10 days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am using 75 mg Zoloft for the past seven months for anxiety disorder. I have started with 25 mg and my doctor increased the dosage slowly for my panic attacks. But for the past two months, I do not have any strong panic attacks and when I have the small ones, I am capable of handling it. I want to stop to taking medication. Could you please advise me how to do it in order to avoid withdrawal syndromes of Zoloft. How should I quit? How much I should reduce the dosage and how long should I continue?","Doctor":"Hello. Zoloft (Sertraline) is a good medication for anxiety disorder. You are on a low moderate dose of 75 mg once daily (dose range is 50 mg to 200 mg once daily). It is good that you are feeling better for the past two months. It is recommended to continue Sertraline for at least six months after you are feeling better. So it is advisable to continue for at least another four months. During this period also develop psychological strategies to manage anxiety (talking therapy or CBT will help you to achieve this). If stable after four months, discuss with your prescribing doctor about gradually tapering down the dosage gradually. You can try cutting down to 50 mg once daily and see whether you continue to be stable. After a month, you can consider cutting down further to 25 mg once daily. Continue for another month then stop completely. Remember, if symptoms reappear at any time during tapering down, you have to go back on the higher dose. To sum up, continue Zoloft at least for another four months. Get CBT if not done already. Then if stable after four months, taper down gradually under medical supervision."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is having toothache and swollen and inflamed gums for four days. This is due to wisdom teeth. Currently, she is taking Cataflam 50 mg two tablets in 24 hours for the past two days for pain relief. Her age is 36 years and her weight is 56 kg. She does not have any past medical history. Currently, we feel visiting the dentist should be avoided. Please advise for medication.","Doctor":"Hi. The proper treatment of wisdom tooth is extraction as wisdom tooth is not able to perform its function of chewing because it is present in the most posterior position of our oral cavity. So it is of no use in saving it by RCT (root canal treatment) and crown and wasting money and time in it. So it is better to go for extraction after lockdown overs and kindly visit a dentist who is taking all the sterilization measures with PPE (personal protective equipment) kit. Until that time, do saline and warm water gargle three to four times a day for seven days. Take hot pack from outside the mouth and apply it on the affected cheek area to reduce the swelling twice a day for seven days. Take tablet Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 mg BD for five days, Zerodol SP (Aceclofenac, Serratiopeptidase, and Paracetamol) BD for five days, Pan 40 (Pantoprazole) OD before food in the morning, and capsule Becosule OD. In case of severe pain take tablet Ketorol - DT (two tablets dissolve in a glass of water). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,A 5-year-old boy has a neck mass or lump on his right side of the neck under the jaw. He feels pain while swallowing food and if he touches it. No fever, no cough, no cold, no complications. The lump is visible and was observed yesterday. We have visited a doctor and he advised to take antibiotics (Taxim-O Forte) with Paracetamol syrup for seven days. After seven days, if it does not go away, he suggested some additional tests. Could you please let me know if this is some major problem and any further diagnosis needs to be done immediately?","Doctor":"Hello. The mass or lump that is being felt may be inflammation of local gland due to infection or lymph node enlargement. Both of these will respond to the antibiotics given. In case that it does not resolve, then a further workup is recommended which include radiological, pathological as well as blood investigation. Followup clinical examination is necessary to delineate any kind of pathological condition. So followup visit to a pediatrician for clinical evaluation is necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think my maxillary lateral incisors are not in perfect shape but my dentist thinks they are. I just need a second opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. Your maxillary lateral incisors are perfect in shape and place (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Only, maxillary left central incisor is a bit down from occlusion that only dentist or you can feel the difference. If your case is about to end, ask the dentist to remove the bracket from #1 left side upper and put it back just 0.5 mm above and then put the wire back for like 2 or 3 weeks. Then this tooth will be intruded and will be perfect in place. Otherwise, if he feels like he can do slight slicing of this incisor too so that both the incisors will be same in place. 19, 20 difference would not be much obvious. Give me followup after your next visit to the dentist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just got married. Right after two days, my wife experienced a sharp pain on her right head to the neck, it felt like someone hammering the head. Then after 20 to 25 minutes, she slept and it stopped. Then again after 5 to 6 days, it came up again in the same frequency and same pattern just right side of the head to the neck (right side) and then again after three days, it came back. Can you please suggest something?","Doctor":"Hi. If she does not have any other deficits like a hand or leg weakness or giddiness or cognitive deficits, then most likely it is a migraine. It is just recent in onset. So, we can wait with medicines. Tablet Topiramate 25 mg at bedtime for 21 days, tablet Sibilium 5 mg at bedtime for 21 days. Initially, she may get more sleep, but with lightheadedness for 3 to 4 days, then her symptoms will improve gradually."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, We are concerned about our 3 years old boy. He started urinating very often at the day time. He urinated about 40 times a day today. Every couple minutes, sometimes 5-10-15 minute gaps with a small amount urine. Our boy has no temperature, no pain, seems happy, playing like usual. Sleeps well and does not urinate at night. Hopefully, you will give me an advice. I will look forward to hearing from you soon.","Doctor":"Hi. From what you are describing, there may seem to be an overactive bladder. It is more during the day and normal at night in this case. In such cases, it is usually transient. I would also want to know the psychological state of this child if he has been shouted at or beaten by someone. Since this is a very common reason for such a phenomenon, it should go away in a while once the offending agent is taken care of. It is advisable to do an ADH level for this child if this persists for more than a week. Oxybutynin may need to be started if symptoms are severe and not resolving."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Three months ago, I saw a dark brown mole under my right breast. The mole does not produce any symptoms. The mole when touched is noticeable bulging, is not smooth as other moles that I have. What can it be?","Doctor":"Hi. It could be a normal melanocytic nevus. If there is a sudden increase in shape and size with irregular border, an increase in color or rapidly evolving, then you can go for a non-invasive technique like dermoscopy and invasive technique like skin biopsy to confirm whether it is benign or malignant."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The left side is very loose and I cannot bare any pressure without significant pain. What is the best course of action without insurance and can the tooth be saved?","Doctor":"Hi.

How long will it take to improve as she still sneezes a lot?","Doctor":"Hello. As per the history and the doctor's notes, I understand your daughter has allergic rhinitis and lower airway hyperreactivity. There is no easy solution for allergy. Allergy is due to some component in the air that she breathes. We must identify what she is allergic to. Some of the following you may need to do. 1. After using the Duonase spray for 15 days as given by your doctor, change it to Mometasone and use it once daily. Two puffs in each nostril for 30 days and thereafter one puff each nostril. There is a particular way to use spray. If you do not know that then revert back. 2. Continue the Montair LC syrup for a couple of weeks and keep using it on an SOS basis whenever she gets allergy. When you start, continue it for a day. A single daily dosage is sufficient usually. 3. Inhalers like Asthalin and Seroflo are to be used as per the chest physician advice. Keep both handy and may need to be used whenever there are flare-ups. 4. Maintain a diary and write down whenever she gets allergic symptoms, when she goes to some new place, when she opens any old book, garden, pollen, any relation to the food she eats, linens, beddings, etc. 5. Keep house and surroundings extremely clean and tidy. 6. Stop exposure to smoke, pollution dust, and direct cold air. Do revert back to me for further support and help.

It is not as bad as it was before, but I am worried. Why is it happening? Is there a chance of antibiotic resistance?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand what you have been going through. Now, as you can see the pus point at the lid margin, it is an external hordeolum or stye. Recurrences can occur with respect to stye. The reasons being multiple. If possible, could you revert back with pictures of your eye so that I could make a more definitive diagnosis? The chances of antibiotic resistance with respect to stye is highly unlikely. Once it is drained, the neighboring meibomian duct might get inflamed resulting in a stye. However, recurrences are common in diabetics, uncorrected refractive error, and immunocompromised states.

To me, the changes are due to viral infection you have been experiencing all this while. Now, we should not rely on the complete blood count report only. Sometimes, there is a destruction of platelets due to chemicals inside the sample carrier.

I would like to know your age and past medical history. I also agree with your doctor on the recommendation for a brain MRI, as it is very important to exclude some of the above possible causes. I would also recommend performing some other blood laboratory tests like complete blood count for anemia, vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels, plasma levels for possible deficiency, PCR for inflammation, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction.

In this situation, my advise to you would be a direct and clear communication on what are your expectations and what things are hurting you. Do not plead in front of your partner for his time, love and care. This will make you even more granted in his life. Try to make friends also.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am Rh negative. I recently had an abortion of six weeks and was not given the Rh injection. Is my health status safe to prevent future complications in pregnancies? This is the third week into the abortion. Can I still go for this injection?","Doctor":"Hi. Injection anti-D is needed to be taken in case of bleeding within 72 hours of the event. So, it is late already. Most mothers have well-developed immunity against rhesus positive blood group in her second pregnancy if the first child had Rhesus positive blood group. But in the case of fetomaternal hemorrhage also antibodies develop. Rhesus negative issue arises if your partner is Rhesus negative. So first of all, check the blood group of your partner. If he is negative, then there are fewer chances of the fetus to have a positive blood group, so fewer chances of Rhesus isoimmunization issue in coming pregnancies. You can have antibody titer to be on safe side if the husband 's blood group is positive. But if the husband has blood group positive then in next pregnancy as per protocol you will have to get anti-D at 28 and 32, if pregnancy remains uneventful otherwise more time you could receive. Rhesus negative with a history of miscarriage. Husband's blood group. Balanced diet. Normal BMI, weight. If the husband's blood group is positive, then early booking for the next pregnancy to have better care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 32 years old, and I am kind of facing the issue of fantasy in my head and mind deconcentration. Whenever I am busy or in social gathering most of the time I am fine. But when I am alone, walking alone and traveling alone, my mind goes into the fantasy. I kind of see this thing becoming common in people and while observing them I noticed that whenever I am in this situation my body is at rest while facial expression is changing according to what I am thinking. As I watched a lot of fantasies movies and seasons, my mind keeps stuck in these, thinking about different scenarios along with facial expression like smiling, anger, etc. It is kind of embarrassing when someone notices me. I would like to know what it is. People are saying it as daydreaming. My question is whether it is really daydreaming, or if not what it is? How can I overcome it?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, you are suffering from excessive imagination or daydreaming, which is common in every individual. But some people do it more which becomes a kind of habit. Sometimes, we also use this kind of defense and imagination in order to avoid day-to-day stress. It becomes a form of avoidance behavior. Distract yourself with some positive and productive strategies like focus on your career, practice your hobbies, make a day-to-day schedule, try to follow it, use some aversive stimulation to prevent yourself from going deep in imagination like pinching yourself hard on the hand."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 54 years old and I have never taken good care of my teeth until a couple of months when I started noticing a very rapid erosion of enamel on my front teeth near the gum line. This area was becoming very thin on a couple of teeth and turning brown and no amount of brushing, cleaning, etc., was making the brown go away. So I went to a dentist for the first time in about 46 years and had a deep cleaning done and a brief consultation. The cleaning got rid of the brown stains but then the brown stains returned within a week on the same thinning areas next to the gum line. I keep brushing and trying different things (a whitener, baking soda, peroxide, a mineralizing toothpaste, avoiding food and drink that causes staining, brushing right after eating) but the staining just continues to get worse and is now happening on all of my front teeth (near the gum line). It has been about three weeks since the deep cleaning and in a couple more weeks I have an appointment with a different dentist who is going to clean them again and hopefully give me some advice on what I can do about this including dental bonding perhaps. My question is, what can I do to get rid of these brown stains and keep them away. Are they just going to keep coming back and getting worse no matter what? Did the deep cleaning somehow cause this to be worse? It seems like it did. Can dental bonding cover these stains and stop them from getting bigger? I have changed my diet also in order to promote healthier teeth. Eating more nutrient foods with more Vitamin D, Magnesium, Vitamin K2, making sure I get enough calcium, using Celtic sea salt instead of regular salt, anything that is known to help promote better teeth and gums. Please, any advice you can give me would be very appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. Just checked your given picture and thanks for detailed history (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These brown marks are because of smoking. You have not left me with anything to suggest you as you have already done with home remedies, peroxides, care, etc. Now, if you do not want these brown lines to come back you have to quit smoking for it. Correct your brushing technique. You have to brush your teeth with light hand pressure because I can see at some points you do brushing vigorously that caused enamel to wear off. I would say it is erosion and abrasion at gumlines, where you put a slightly more pressure to get rid of brown lines. You immediately need to stop this. Stop getting angry. Do not be surprised, as your teeth say so. I guess either you are introvert, do not express your feelings or pour out your anger on others and keep grinding your teeth instead or you are a person who takes stress too much. Is it so? Do let me know about it. I can say you are suffering from a condition called bruxism, that is, clenching of jaws or habit of grinding your teeth consciously or unconsciously at night. For it, you definitely need a night guard so your teeth might not get minor fractures or uneven occlusal surfaces can be arrested right away. This is just an additional finding I diagnosed by seeing your ground teeth. Regarding your presenting complaint, yes bonding will definitely work in arresting these gumline abrasions you made yourself by brushing harshly and smoking brown stains will also be limited by it. Rest, for getting permanently rid of it you need to leave your beer and smoke which are definitely injurious to your health. Do give me followup after next visit and after breaking down your habits."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hypothyroidism and I take 50 mcg tablets every weekend. Can I conceive even though I have this condition?","Doctor":"Hi. Thyroid abnormalities have many side effects related to fertility but the patient conceives and gets a healthy outcome as well if we take proper care and regular continuous treatment and strict check on it. Thyroid can cause fertility issues, miscarriages, congenital anomalies, etc., so it is better to try for conception as soon as possible otherwise with age complications increase. Try to have a strict check and control over thyroid and keep in touch with your physician. Thyroid levels for normal females also fluctuate in pregnancy. So just prepare the body for pregnancy. Have complete treatment of any health issue you have. Have a balanced diet, weight, and BMI. Have folic acid 5 mg. Partner also needs to have a balanced health condition. Have early booking and continuous regular antenatal visits in the maternal medicine antenatal clinic. Serial scans also need to be done for fetal well being and to diagnose any abnormality. In pregnancy, Propylthiouracil is more preferable. Better to have a double marker test at 13 weeks. Continue folic acid, iron and calcium supplements. Balanced diet, weight and BMI matter. I hope things would be better if given proper attention. Regular checkups with physicians. Try to conceive as soon as possible. Sex in the fertile period. Complete attention on physical condition for both the partners. Quit recreational drugs and have recreational activities. Have complete treatment of all health issue, if you and your partner have."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 65 years old, male, otherwise in good health but BMI around 31. I have a damaged spinal cord at C4 (due to disk herniation) and had anterior discectomy with fusion in 14 years back. I have had left sided peripheral neuropathy since my surgery (15 years). All sensory, no motor issues. However, I have noticed recently a weakness or tired feeling in the left flank, abdomen, and chest that gets worse through the day in addition to increased burning neuritis (eight months). After night's rest, I do not have the symptoms or less. Symptoms return late afternoon into the evening. MRI and CT scans normal. My question is that can exercise improve strength to muscles otherwise compromised by nerve damage? Can exercise relieve neuropathy symptoms? I swim but I have not noticed any improvements. Any recommendations?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and reviewed your uploaded test reports and would explain that physical activity is important to maintain a normal muscle force and avoid muscle stiffness due to a damaged spinal cord. Regarding neuropathy, maybe it cannot help improve the situation as it was before the injury at 100 % but it can help reduce the progression and maintain normal muscle strength. It can also help reduce back pain by reinforcing the back muscles and correcting the posture. I would also recommend taking a diet rich in vitamins."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 44-year-old male. I had a hard lump on the left lower back between top of the hip bone and lower ribs. No pain to the touch. It feels about the size of a marble or the end of a pinky finger. What is it most likely? I did have a hard fall on my back about a year ago in that area, but I am not sure if that could be related. I want to know what is the chances of something like kidney cancer as that is what comes up when I use Dr. Google. Can you feel a lump from the kidney that close to the surface? Does it feel like what I described? I included an image of the same. I am currently using Prilosec.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the picture. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Looking at the location you pointed there should be no lump ideally in that area as it is purely muscular. Having said that, in your case since you had a fall at that point last year, possibly a hematoma has formed and not totally dissolved due to lack of movement or physiotherapy. This is quite normal and not worrisome. Chances of kidney cancer if it is painless, are actually one in a million if you have no other symptoms especially urinary symptoms. I would recommend an ultrasound abdomen-pelvis once feasible."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I took my HbA1c blood test and it came back 6.3. Am I diabetic or pre-diabetic? I have brought a change in my eating habits completely and exercising twice per day. Will this reduce my results in six months or I should take diabetic medicines?","Doctor":"Hello. HbA1c % 6.3 is considered a pre-diabetic state. Following are the criteria to diagnose diabetes: 1. Normal: FBG: 70 to 100 mg/100 ml, PP: less than 140 mg and HbA1c % less than 5.7. 2. Pre-diabetes: FBG: 101 to 125 mg, PP 141 to 199 mg and HbA1c % 5.7 to 6.4. 3. Diabetes: FBG: 126 mg and above, PP: 200 mg and above and HbA1c % 6.5 % and above. Fortunately, when a person is in a prediabetic state, it can be reversed or prevented from progressing to diabetes or progression to diabetes can be delayed for a very long time by adopting a modified lifestyle. Which means taking a properly balanced diet that provides calories just as much required based on ideal body weight and extent of daily exercise. Secondly, exercising regularly for over one hour and maintaining near normal weight. Plus avoiding sweets, junk foods, pastries, bakery items and increasing the intake of fiber-containing foods, green leafy vegetables, salads, and fruits. Refraining from alcohol and smoking is also helpful."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have had unprotected sex. I took Plan B (72 hours) pill almost right after, four hours later. I consulted with the pharmacist on the phone but she sounded careless and told me it was safe to use. I am too young. The main question is I do not know if I should even call this vaginal sex because he did not cum and we decided to call it off after three minutes because we were scared of the consequences. But I took the pills anyway, just in case. Can you help me?","Doctor":"Hi. Plan B is an emergency contraceptive to be taken in case of male ejaculation inside vagina. If you have already taken the medicine, nothing much can be done right now. I hope you have attained menarche, so then you should get your periods in the next two weeks. The next period might be a bit irregular due to the pill effect. If there was no ejaculation or pre-cum, there is no chance of pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had my mother's ultrasound done today. She is a 39-year-old anemia patient admitted to the hospital. She has hypothyroidism from the last 12 years and is overweighed and obese. Her ultrasound shows 19 cm liver from the mid-clavicular line with increased echogenicity. Is this something of concern? If yes then what has to be done?","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed the ultrasound report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I can say that she has hepatosplenomegaly probably due to fatty liver disease. This is why to my opinion she needs to do liver enzyme tests like AST, ALT, GGT and alkaline phosphatase, blood work too. It is important to lose weight and to avoid fatty foods."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. Since childhood, some of my teeth are sort of crisscross. So the accumulation of food has led to yellow spots in some places. I brush once a day but properly. I consulted a dentist and she suggested me to get my teeth cleaned. But that is not a permanent solution. What can I do for permanent white and well-aligned teeth?","Doctor":"Hi. Your teeth are actually crowded. So, deposition of food and stains have lead to these brown marks on your teeth. What you have to do to make your teeth white is go for proper scaling and polishing, and brush your teeth twice daily regularly. Second Option, if still, it is the same, even after scaling and polishing, marks are not going, you can go for a veneer. Now let me ask you some questions. Are you a frequent user of some tea, coffee or black tea, beverages? Are you taking any medicines regularly? These all can cause these marks to appear again. Then for proper alignment for your teeth, you can go for a fixed orthodontic treatment. You can also use aligners if there is only a small difference in alignment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am currently on 40 mg of Fluoxetine. For the past four days, I was put up from 30 mg to 40 mg as my 20 mg stopped working after three years. While on the 30 mg, my symptoms got better for a couple weeks and then I went back down to where I was, in the beginning, feeling extremely depressed, anxious and completely awful. I was wondering why this happened?","Doctor":"Hello. Fluoxetine 20 mg OD is the usual dose prescribed in managing depression and anxiety. Sometimes Fluoxetine dose needs to be increased to 40 mg OD if the previous dose is no longer effective. You have been on 40 mg for the past four days. You may be aware that you need to wait for at least 2 to 4 weeks to see the maximum therapeutic response. In addition to medication, you will benefit from counseling, CBT to manage your emotional difficulties. Discuss with your GP, CMHT in case you have not had taking therapy before. Try to exercise daily. Even brisk walking outdoors for 30 minutes daily can help to improve your mood and lower anxiety. In case, if you do not get better even on Fluoxetine 40 mg OD. Kindly consult with your doctor. You may need a reassessment of your symptoms and sometimes alternative SSRI needs to be considered."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

My asthma is not severe and it is seasonal asthma and only happens during season change. Lately, my asthma is not going away I did a myteka and fexet course along an antibiotic course. I do use Ventolin inhaler which gives me relief. Normally, these days when I wake up I feel short of breath, again it is not that severe it is like 20%. When I am not sick my asthma goes away it does not bother me at all during any physical activities. I am a chain-smoker and have been smoking for two years yet it never made a problem. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi. I can see that you are worried about your asthma. Let us start from scratch. Firstly, let us confirm your diagnosis of asthma and because you are having symptoms now it is the best time to perform spirometry. Secondly, for asthma, you have to use inhalational medication for at least a year after diagnosis and then we can taper-off as you are relieved of symptoms. I totally understand this is a long duration, but we need the medication for controlling your future symptoms. Thirdly, the medicine (Ventorlin) will provide you immediate relief but it will not prevent further attacks, so you need to add inhalational corticosteroids to your medication. And last but not least, you need to quit smoking. You already know the health hazards of smoking and in your case, it is worsening your asthma symptoms. It will be a difficult job but I can help you with that, only if you want. I hope this helps. Poorly controlled asthma due to smoking, not taking medicine regularly and not taking inhalational corticosteroid as well. Spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility testing. Poorly controlled asthma. Inhaler (Formoterol 6 mcg + Budesonide 200 mcg) with spacer, two puffs twice daily and can be taken up to four times daily if required and once exacerbation is over it can be tapered off for a month. Tablet Fexofenadine 120 mg once a day for a month. Quit smoking. Avoid exposure to allergens. PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) monitoring. Follow up with investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went last night to get tested for STD for fishy discharge smell and 20 minutes ago I went to the bathroom and noticed I was bleeding down there, which is weird for me since I just finished a none-day period a week ago. So I am worried if I need to get checked out right away or wait.","Doctor":"Hello. A fishy smell is indicative of bacterial vaginosis and not yeast infection alone. If not accompanied by curdy white vaginal discharge, pathognomic of vaginal candidiasis. Also bleeding per vaginum on nonmenstrual days can be due to cervical erosions which can be confirmed or evaluated with a per speculum examination and a pap smear."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a breast-feeding woman. I used to be a smoker before I got pregnant. I am really stressed out. If I have one and wait three hours before feeding, will it be fine?","Doctor":"Hi. I would recommend trying to quit entirely. Cigarette exposure in infants increases the risk for several problems, including asthma, SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), eczema, and many more. There are several options to help quit, including nicotine patches, gum, and even some medications. I would speak to your doctor about quitting. If you must smoke, try doing it before breastfeeding. It takes 90 minutes for half of the nicotine in your body to be eliminated, so it is very difficult to eliminate it entirely. Additionally, never smoke around your baby, always do it outside, wash your hands and change your clothes before returning to your baby. A good rule of thumb is that if you can smell the smoke, your baby is being exposed to it. That being said, the benefits of breastfeeding are immense and are generally thought to outweigh the risk of minor nicotine exposure in breast milk. So in summary, try to quit if you can, but if you cannot, take the above steps to minimize your baby's exposure. Please let me know if you have any more questions and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have found this spot on my tongue for the past seven months and for the most part, has not really changed.

As per your photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it does not look like any severe problem. This could be the friction or irritational in nature due to a sharp tooth edge. This lesion only looks like hyperkeratotic and nothing else. So, there is no need to worry about it. Please let me know if there is any sharp tooth edge, also if there is any swelling under your mandible (chin). You can also take high Vitamin A diet like carrot or Vitamin A supplements for at least a month, it will be helpful and the lesion will disappear soon. Sharp tooth edge or faulty brushing technique. Traumatic ulcer. Frictional hyperkeratosis. Enameloplasty, if there is a sharp tooth edge. Brushing (modified Bass technique).

You have a history of blood clot in the previous pregnancy. So there is more chance of blood clot in the second pregnancy as well. A thorough investigation should be done like PT, APTT, BT, coagulation profile, cardiolipin antibody estimation, etc., for you.

But you should discuss all these with your treating gynecologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 5-year-old son has a wheezing problem right from one and a half years. A year back the doctor prescribed Foracort 100. I administered Foracort 1 puff daily for one year. Now, I have stopped it as adviced by the doctor. Still, he gets wheezing minimum one time a month and a maximum of three times during winter. He also gets wheezing whenever he has a throat infection. The allergy test was done and the doctor said my son does not have an allergy. Primary complex test (Mantoux test) proved positive but the doctor also looked at the chest X-ray and enquired about family history (no smokers, vegetarians, non-alcoholics). So she asked us to wait. No medicines were given. Why does he get frequent wheezing even when he has no allergy? Does he have asthma?","Doctor":"Hi. Generally, we would label your son a recurrent wheezer at this age. Asthma is not a diagnosis of the tender age. Wheezing is generally associated with allergy and not always can be found with a blood test. It can be an allergy to dust, pollution, dampness, pets or anything. Sometimes, we use Montelukast for a long duration to modify the wheezing condition. Ask your doctor for the same. Giving an annual flu vaccine also helps. Mantoux test is a non-specific test and does not confirm tuberculosis. Other investigations are performed in addition to the Mantoux test to confirm TB."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please check my X-ray and guide me.

However, The extension of the lesion cannot be determined as the X-ray seems to have elongated the structures. Proximal caries in the second (last molar of the mesial side, that is, between the two molars). 2. The fillings seem to have developed secondary caries but that seems mild.

So, the next vaccine which was supposed to be given in six weeks has been given on 7th of this month (after two months) but if I see according to his birth it should be near 1st or 2nd and the next vaccine which is in 10 weeks comes on 7th or 8th of next month but according to his birth the 10 weeks completes by 1st of next month. So my question is are the vaccination being given as per the day of birth or as per the time from when the birth vaccine was received? Please solve my problem and tell me whether my baby is on the right track of recieving vaccination.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. Vaccines are given as the birth age for a full-term normal weight baby. If the baby was premature and hospitalized, then it can be delayed. If it is delayed then one month gap is usually kept between two vaccines for better vaccine uptake. You are right, your baby's next dose schedule is around 1 or 2 of this month. There must be a reason for the delay, as I mentioned earlier. In the long run, it usually does not make a lot of difference. Make sure all the necessary vaccines are received."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a tooth filling that has come out, and woke with a white lump beneath it on gum, swollen lower face too on the other side of the site of lump. I had a dull, drumming pain during the night before. I rinsed with warm salt water this morning. Wondering if Flucloxacillin 500 mg which I was prescribed for a bad reaction to summer insect bites and too worried to take, would they help gum infection or abscess? Are four tablets a day all right? I have a dental phobia and will need to wait to be treated at my local hospital.","Doctor":"Hi. Your tooth is probably infected which has caused the white lump on your gums. The decay has gone inside the pulp, almost touching your nerve and there is infection beneath the root of your teeth which has caused this swelling. You will have to confirm the status of your teeth by taking an X-ray, to check how much the infection is affecting your tooth. I will not suggest you having Flucloxacillin 500 mg because it is not effective for dental infections. To suggest an antibiotic, I need to know the proper medical history of yours. At present, take an antibiotic and pain killer so the swelling subsides and meet a dentist as soon as possible for further treatment. Can I know if you have any allergies for any medicine, or any systemic diseases present? If so, I can prescribe the medicine for you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having excessive gas and belching to the point where it feels like I am being choked. My stomach area also feels tight, but that might be from the bloating.","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms look more from gastritis and acid reflux. You need to modify your dietary habits as well as add a few medicines. Practice small frequent feeds rather than heavy meals. Avoid excess water when you eat food. Avoid talking while having food as this leads to aerophagia. Practice being in erect position for at least an hour after food. Avoid foods which worsen acid reflux like coffee, excess spicy foods, etc. You can add tablets like Pantoprazole 40 mg in the morning with Domperidone 10 mg twice daily 30 minutes before food for two weeks. Follow these dietary measures consistently for a month and see the response. If symptoms are not improving, you need to consider an evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hi. My grandmother is 80years of age.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What makes the difference in the deep bradycardia (35 BPM) between disease and fitness?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com. You raised a very good point. Cardiologist usually looks at the ECG and patient's symptoms. If the ECG does not show any features of conduction abnormalities and the patient is fit, healthy and has no symptoms, then it is reassuring especially if they are athletes. However, if the ECG shows a conduction abnormality or delays then it is of a concern and if the patient has symptoms of lightheadedness, fainting, collapses or exertional breathlessness, then it is of concern and needs more investigations and possible pacemakers if the condition persists after stopping all heart slowing medications. You need to bear in mind that a single ECG could confirm a conduction abnormality if present, but does not 100 % exclude as the condition could be intermittent, This is why a period of continuous cardiac monitoring is recommended for the patients who have symptoms could be related to conduction abnormalities."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter, 11 years old, has her eardrum damaged.

On the other hand, if it is a chronic perforation then surgery is the only treatment.

I am an 18-year-old 130 lb male, and I was wondering if the blood test was high because I had fasting and it was in the morning. My doctor told me it might be polycythemia and to go back for another test in three months.","Doctor":"Hello. The dehydration for prolonged duration can lead to high RBC count, high hematocrit and high hemoglobin level. But eight-hour fasting cannot lead to such findings. It is advisable to repeat your test after a few days. Until then, keep yourself well hydrated with lots of water. If still, it comes high after a few days, then further workup for polycythemia should be done in form of EPO estimation, chest X-ray, EKG and JAK2 mutation testing as per need."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have my niece with red islands or patches on the tongue surface.

I suffer from tachycardia (heart checked, everything is normal) and anxiety and depression, and dizziness only when I am walking. I am not having dizziness when I am lying, and I am a smoker too. I have a headache often but I cannot recognize if it is a migraine or not, and recently have my MRI scan on the brain. Can you please tell me your opinion about the result? This is the impression: T2 FLAIR hyperintensity foci within the white matter in the centrum semi ovale and near the vertex which is more than expected, given patient's age. The distribution is non-specific. Most of this is atypical for demyelination.","Doctor":"Hello. The tachycardia you are experiencing if the usual cardiac exam and diagnostics were already been done and showed normal result may have been coming from anxiety. This should be well tolerated and cannot produce you any harm. The dizziness and headaches should coincide with the same problem either what comes first will lead to the other symptom. Dizziness basically comes from so many factors like lack low iron supply in the blood or low red blood cell count. Other factors that can precipitate to this is benign positional paroxysmal vertigo or simply BPPV (basically a condition coming from your middle ear). Diagnosis entails having blood exams like your complete blood count (CBC) and otological exam using an otoscope to check for inflammation and infection of the ears (which is a fairly common problem with BPPV. The exact mechanism on this is the head position that you need to identify so as to keep this dizziness to reoccur in certain positions. It would be helpful taking some Betahistine 16 mg tablet twice a day for this bout of dizziness. Headaches, on the other hand, could also be of so many things but usual causes are myogenic in nature. It can range from migraine headaches, cluster headaches, tension headaches, etc., and the treatment entails primarily with a Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like Ibuprofen taken every eight hours, but remember to take this religiously without fail to keep the drug's potency so as to make it effective. Migraines usually occur with a strong family history. If you have a family member that exhibits this kind of headaches, then possibly you also have it. They are most of the time precipitated with a stressful insult, may it be from lack of sleep, skipping meals to a tiresome job. It is helpful if you could identify this stressor so as to avoid it. It would definitely help you. The MRI findings T2 flair hyperintensities foci within the white matter in the centrum semi ovale and near the vertex are incidental findings that do not correlate well to a disease. This particular signals in the brain are most often than not seen also in normal individuals and does not cause any symptoms at all. To conclude, it is nothing important and will not cause you trouble. This all should help you best as your guide."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Is there a way to cure this?","Doctor":"Hello doctor, The pictures uploaded did not show the said stretch mark (attachment removed to protect patient identity). However, what readily comes to one's mind is that it may be spider veins (widened tiny blood vessels just below your skin). The doctors call such condition telangiectasia. Use of corticosteroids, certain abrasive creams, and soaps, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, increasing age, hardening and contraction of the skin, inflammation of the skin and the muscle under it, systemic lupus erythematosus, or it may be part of HHT-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Investigations to rule out underlying disorder include clotting profile, CT scan, MRI. Spider angioma, Sturge Weber disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Spider veins- telangiectasia.

It does not hurt, but I can feel the tightness. What should I do to stop this? I am scared.","Doctor":"Hi. This sounds like calf tightness, but it may be a few other things that are more concerning. If the tightness is only in one calf, you need to get follow up, especially if you are on birth control or have another risk for blood clots. Depending on your age, you may be at risk for problems with your blood vessels that can cause calf pain when walking. Calf tightness is very common especially in athletes and in women who wear high heels and is usually from overuse of muscles that have not been stretched properly, causing inflammation and tired muscles. For treatment, I suggest starting with a massage to the area, which can include rolling your calves on a foam roller or even a small ball. There are specific trigger points that are particularly helpful in treating the knot in your muscles. Do this for several minutes a few times a day. For treatment and prevention, research a few calf stretching exercises and do those several times a day as well. Another important thing for sore muscles is hydration and electrolyte repletion. If you are doing exercise, remember to stretch for 15 to 20 minutes before and after, and ice your calves after exercise. Finding out if your tightness is more due to inflammation or fatigue can be helpful in guiding a more personalized treatment plan, but would require more questions. Also, it would help figure out if you may also have a strain or even small tears that would need to be treated more carefully. Delayed onset of a muscle disorder, muscle strain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My penis length really frustrates me. I have read that it is the average size. I am still a virgin (19). I want to know if there is anything that I can do to surpass this kind of fear or doubt that I will never please a woman in bed.","Doctor":"Hi. The dissatisfaction with penis size is one of the commonest issues with men. The roots of this insecurity about self lie within our cultural prejudices and fears. Let me tell you that the length of the penis or shape of the penis has nothing to do with sexual satisfaction and the ability to have good and enjoyable sex. It is the way you handle your partner in and out of bed. You need to show how much you take care of her emotional needs and how much you love getting intimate with her. Women are aroused by the emotional component of sexual intercourse rather than by the size of your penis. A good foreplay followed by gentle yet passionate sex is what makes them happy and content rather than the size, color, and shape of the penis. So, do not worry and be confident about yourself."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My kids are getting cold and fever because of tank water.

I am on anti-hypertensive medication for years, my current BP is in the range of 140 to 150 (sys)/60 to 70 (dia). Is this BP good enough for my age? Any suggestions, please?","Doctor":"Hello. Diastolic BP is fine, but systolic is mildly elevated. According to recent evidences and guidelines, lower is better. If BP is persistently elevated above 140, then it is better to add some other medicines to keep it atleast below 140 consistently and preferably below 130 systolic. We are not much concerned about diastolic BP even if goes lower. Since pulse rate is 60, then Concor dose may be increased to 7.5 or 10, but cautiously monitoring pulse rate. Instead better option is to add another medicines like Losartan 25 mg or Chlorthalidone 25 mg. Should also have low salt diet and regular exercises.

I have a burning sensation when urinating and my eyes feel tired and a bit watery from time to time. I have itching between my anus and my scrotum. Recently, I have noticed a dark black mark on my penis shaft just below the crown of my penis and about a month ago, I had a hard blister like spot on one of my bum cheeks which burst a week or so later with a watery looking discharge. Lastly, I notice a cottage cheese like discharge underneath my foreskin from time to time. Can you help me by telling me what is the cause of these things?","Doctor":"Hi. The hard nodule bursting on your buttocks was an infected sebaceous cyst. If recurrent on the same spot, you may need a small surgery of cyst excision. For eyes, get refractive error checked and if needed specs. Burning urination is with poor flow, straining of urine? How many times you get up at night. Kindly get urine analysis and USG KUB and share the report to suggest treatment. For itchy perianal area sit in a warm sitz bath for 15 minutes, if persistent, show to a general surgeon.

I have vomiting, high fever, rashes, drowsiness, and stomach pain. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me medicines. I do not understand, and I am confused whether he gives tablets for jaundice and typhoid or whether he provides tablets for cough, headache, and vomiting. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, jaundice is a symptom, and typhoid fever is a diagnosis. Jaundice is a state in the human body in which there is an increase in bilirubin (produced in the liver) level causing yellowish discoloration of sclera and skin. I am not sure whether you have typhoid or not. These symptoms you have seem to be due to acute viral hepatitis. But the picture you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is of antibiotic combination which is used in the treatment of typhoid fever (Cefixime and Ofloxacin). We cannot diagnose typhoid just by symptoms, and we need to perform some blood tests for it. You should take a lot of fluids and glucose water. If it is acute viral hepatitis, the yellowish discoloration or jaundice takes a month to disappear. You should not worry much about it, but get a full liver function test done along with PT (prothrombin time) and INR (international normalized ratio). Also if interested, get a screen for IgM anti HAV (hepatitis A virus) and HEV (hepatitis E virus) serology. Acute viral hepatitis occurs mostly due to improper hand hygiene or contaminated water source. You will get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been facing testicular pain since last few days. What could be the cause?","Doctor":"Hi. Testicular pain can be due to many reasons. Ascertaining the reason of pain without proper history and examination is not a good idea. The wrong diagnosis will eventually lead to the wrong treatment. You should visit a surgeon in person and get yourself examined. Urine examination and an Ultrasonography may be needed to ascertain the cause of pain. Do not feel shy and do not delay. If you are not able to consult a doctor or if a doctor is not in reach, please again ask your query with details of pain like, from where it starts and where it radiates, how it started and any associated symptoms. Get a urine routine examination and TLC, DLC done and share the reports."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am nursing a 2 month old, and I was told that I need to take Omeprazole. I have gallstones.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If there is any problem in stool passage, it may reflect as a burning sensation or frequency of urine as the nerve supply to both areas is same. In case there is no fever, and stomach is still upset, you can start with a probiotic like Econorm sachet twice a day for three days. If symptoms persist beyond 2 to 3 days, then get urine routine test and an ultrasound KUB and revert. A short course of antibiotic like Nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice a day for three days and Solifenacin 5 mg once a day for five days can be started after consultation with your GP."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What is the best tan removal treatment for me? I am suffering from tan since 16. I am now 23. My tan is all over my face, but when I put on a beard for a month and then shave it off, it all goes away back to original. Is my tan deep or stubborn or easily removable? Sunscreen application is recommended every two hours. I am thinking of day Vitamin C serum application. I need to wash my face with water before re-applying sunscreen? Can I wash my face? Will washing off for sunscreen reapplication deter the efficacy of Vitamin C serum?","Doctor":"Hi. Tanning is due to sun. When you grow beard your hair protects the underneath skin hence it looks fair when you shave. Tan is not deep or stubborn. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Keep Vitamin C application in evening and night and sunscreen should be used only when you go out in sun. It is useless to use sunscreen when at home.

After taking the tablet for a month, I stopped it now. I am suffering with headache again. Should I continue the medication?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Depression is a mood disorder and the disorder occurs in episodes. The treatment also should be continued for a long duration. Nexito is Escitalopram and the drug should be continued for at least three to six months post remission of symptoms in the first episode. You have stopped taking the drug within a month and that too abruptly. This is the reason you are having withdrawal symptoms in the form of a headache. If the symptoms are persisting and are causing significant distress then, in my opinion, the drug should be continued again. Consult your doctor for reevaluation and start taking tablet again.  Do not get feared by the drug. The drug if taken under a proper prescription does not cause dependence and is safe. This will help you to come out of your depression."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 25 year old, fairly healthy female. I have been suffering from kidney stones since the age of 15. Mostly the stones would go away on their own without causing any pain. But in the last seven to eight months, I had been suffering from recurrent UTIs and mild pain in the kidney. Around four months back, I got an ultrasound done and found a 10 mm stone in the middle pole and 6 mm stone in the lower pole. At that point, I started on ayurvedic medicine (Calcury). I got an ultrasound done a month later and found the stone size remains the same. But there was no pain or infection of any sort at that time. Last month (I was still asymptomatic) I got a KUB done. It showed only one stone, it did not look like a staghorn stone. A few days later, I got another ultrasound at a different place and according to that doctor, my stone was 17 mm (in the middle pole) and 8 mm (in the lower pole). In the last 15 days, I passed two tiny stones of 3-4 mm which were very soft and pebble-shaped. This made me realize that I may possibly have struvite stones. However, for the last week, I am getting immense pain after a workout. My creatinine was 0.9 last month. I would like to ask you the following questions:- What should be my course of action after this? What is causing this sudden pain? How can I find out what kind of stones do I have? Will shockwave lithotripsy be possible in my case? How accurate is the number 17 mm and 8 mm?","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have got stone problem so early and since you are a recurrent kidney stone former, you need a thorough evaluation to prevent further stone episodes. You should collect the stone you pass in urine and do FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy analysis to know the composition. You also need a 24 hours urinary metabolic evaluation to know the exact problem leading to stone formation. The stone size as per ultrasound may not be accurate, so please get a CT KUB (computed tomography of kidneys, ureters, and bladder), to know the exact number and size of the stone. Pain is due to blockage of the ureter when the stone comes down from the kidney. ESWL (extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy) is definitely a good option for stones up to 15 mm size."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 70 year old female. My height is 165 cm (5'5\\") and weight is 70.3 kg (155 lbs). My current medications are Quinapril-HCTZ 20-25 mg and Diltiazem 24HR ER 120 mg. I am experiencing discomfort in the right buttock for the past one year. I had a total body nuclear scan done recently and the narrative is attached. I am being sent for a CT scan. My doubts are, I got a total hip replacement in 2008. Would it be helpful to the CT scan radiologist to see the attached x-ray of the prosthesis since it shows a screw going into soft tissue? As this screw incidentally has been in the same position since 2008 and it has not caused any problem. Would it be helpful to the CT scan radiologist to see the narration of the nuclear scan? Is the CT scan capable of showing a possible bursitis inflammation?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) in detail. Please find my observations below. The x-ray is always useful when reporting a CT scan. It provides a two-dimensional picture of the screw which is seen to be partly in the region of soft tissues. As a radiologist, I will always be happy to see an x-ray if available. The nuclear scan shows that there is no infection around the prosthesis. There is a small amount of suspected infection in the bowel or fallopian tube on the right side of the pelvis. This might help the radiologist to specifically look for bowel infection or fallopian tube pathology on the right side of the pelvis. The narration is beneficial to the radiologist to have a detailed look through your CT scan pelvis. CT scan will show bursitis if it is severe. Recent studies have shown an MRI scan to be the investigation of choice for inflammatory bursitis. In your case, bursitis is less likely because the nuclear scan does not show any abnormality in the region."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

First of all, I must say that as per your height and weight your BMI (body mass index) is fine. Now you should start taking good quality foods enriched with protein. Once you are taking whey protein, it is like one-sided food. As you need more energy to do a workout, it is better to go for a balanced diet."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, What is non-Hodgkin lymphoma?

In NHL, How to know the swelling of stomach, spleen, and liver as it is not visible outside? Can a cough occur in NHL? In NHL/lymphoma, can we get any clue from the change (decrease/increase) in the level of blood cells such as WBC and platelets?","Doctor":"Hi. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of lymphomas, which does not fall into the classification of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Anything which does not fit the criteria of Hodgkin's is NHL. NHL can be caused due to a viral infection like Epstein Barr Virus, radiation, immune-modifying drugs, etc. Any age group can be affected, but particularly above 50 years. Yes, it can occur even without any previous family history. No, it can rise in infections from surrounding areas or even another type of cancers. Virchow's node is one classically for gastric cancer metastasis to that node. Single lymph node, even if persistent is not a classical sign of lymphoma. Usually increase in size, multiple lymph nodes involvement and at 2 or more sites like axillae, femoral, etc. Single site, single lymph node which is persistent, is usually due to chronic inflammation. Due to chronic inflammation over a long time, intra-lymph node fibrosis (just like scar tissue) must have formed, which would not allow it to reduce in size. So, it will remain the same size. If there is no change in size, then nothing to worry about. Cancer particularly NHL can reduce immunity and increase the possibility of infection and hence fever. Also, in cancers, increased metabolism occurs, which can result in increased metabolic rate and hence sweating or fever can be seen. Night sweats particularly indicate cancer/ NHL. Usually, some symptoms will be found. Depends on the location, the involvement of other areas and the stage symptoms can vary. This way, all cancers start small and are not detectable, even by best methods. Internal lymph nodes require radiological investigation like CT, ultrasound etc for evaluation. Based on symptoms, if any, it can be evaluated. If doubtful, get a lymph node biopsy of the Virchow's node to confirm. You can find spleen and liver enlargement by radiological investigations or deep palpation. Stomach requires a definite ultrasound. A cough is not a classical symptom of NHL and usually, in lymphomas, bloods levels are not affected."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband is not available whenever I ask him.

Over the past year, I have been getting muscle fasciculations on in my calves (mainly) and also in my quads. I have seen several doctors now and they have checked my reflexes and feeling in my legs and it is all fine. The fasiculations occur, or get worse when I do weights that strain the back of my neck, where it meets the base of my skull. For example shoulder press, or bench press. I have proven that this is the problem many times now. Caffine, alcohol, etc., are all stimulants that make it worse. However, the weights I mentioned above I am certain is the problem. The fasiculations are bad, I have had countless sleepless nights because the twitching is so bad. It is important that I find the problem as I do not want to stop weights permanently. I requested my doctor to prescribe me with blocker drugs and he has given me Gabapentin Milpharm 300 mg. These actually help and reduce the fasiculations. I also went to a chiropractor who was excellent in helping my mobility through my neck and back but could not stop the twitching. He said that I need to see a Neurologist. Does anyone know what is wrong with me? Or what I should do from here?","Doctor":"Hi. Involuntarily muscle twitching or fasciculations could result from various causes. Most common being anxiety, hyperthyroidism, nerve compression at lower back, restless leg syndrome, vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency. If we think of uncommon causes, they could be amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or multiple sclerosis. In my opinion, you need a comprehensive workup first. That includes thyroid profile, vitamin D and B12 levels, blood counts, MRI LS spine, EEG. So, you do not need to rush to a neurologist. First of all, go to your GP. Request him for these tests. Let the report come and then you can go for a neurology opinion. My recommendations in such cases for treatment would be taking Mecobalamineshots, Vitamin D and Calcium supplements. You can also ask your doctor to prescribe you Pregabalin in sustained release form for at least three months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Yes, you can opt for tubal ligation during cesarean section but you have to give consent for the same prior to the cesarean. Usually, the doctor proceeds with the ligation only after the pediatrician confirms that the baby is doing fine. If not, then you are being informed on the table and the doctor usually avoids the procedure in good faith considering the condition of the neonate. The procedure can then be performed after six months to nine months by laparoscopy once the child has been found to be growing healthily."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression because of work-related issues before two years. Then I was prescribed with Deanxit 10 mg one every day till last month. Now I am trying to withdraw by reducing the dose over a month time, taking one tablet for every two days for two weeks, then half medicine every two days for two weeks. Before this, I tried to withdraw two times under the doctor's supervision. But both times I failed to be able to withdraw as both times, more likely my withdrawal symptoms got severe in three weeks and it was difficult to manage, so put back again on medication. Now I am in a stress-free environment and I hope withdrawal symptoms should be less severe and I might be able to withdraw. If in case, it is going to happen like the previous times causing severe symptoms, what should I do in that case? Is it fine that my method of withdrawal reducing the dose as mentioned above is good enough?","Doctor":"Hi. If psychologically you are feeling stable for at least six months to a year, then you can try to cut down medication gradually. You can try tapering off the medication over a longer period of time to minimize the chances of withdrawal symptoms. For example, try taking half the dose for one day and full the next day alternately for two weeks. If you are not experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, then reduce the drug to half and take it daily for the next two weeks. If you are not experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, then take half-tablet on alternate days for further two weeks. You may stop the medication provided you are comfortable. This is a rough guide. At any stage, if you develop withdrawal symptoms, step up to the previous dose for a longer period and then try again. Sometimes it may take a few months to completely withdraw the medication. I have to say that Deanxit is not the first line medication indicated for anxiety and depression. It is no longer used in many countries due to difficulties in withdrawal and side effects. I will recommend visiting a doctor locally as well to monitor and support you during the withdrawal period. Also, use psychological strategies to prevent any relapse in mood and anxiety symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from keratosis pilaris. My upper arms are full of bumps.

How CMIA combo for HIV testing is done? How much it is reliable at 175 and 180 post incidence. INDEX was .14 and .08, respectively. What are the chances of error in the result? (Done at two different labs). Even after three years, I have no medical issue. Please give me awareness on procedure reliability.","Doctor":"Hi. Below are the specific answers for your questions. CMIA is based on chemiluminescence principle and it is performed on an automated analyzer. It is the most effective technique nowadays to rule out HIV. CMIA can almost 100 % rule out HIV after 90 days of exposure. Usually, in most of the patients, CMIA can be effective after six weeks of exposure. So after 175 days of exposure, you need not to worry about HIV. The index value is cut off value based on which the result is given. The chance of error is very less. After testing for two times the chance of error is almost nil. After three years of exposure there is no medical issue, so the chances of HIV is very less."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to ask about the kidney transplant that if it is safe to do for my mother. My mother is 60 years old and has diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, GFR is 6. Creatinine is 543. Potassium is 5. She had congestive heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation. The ejection fraction is 35 %. She had hypertension, hyperthyroidism, dyslipidemia, DM controlled.","Doctor":"Hello. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that kidney transplant would be a perfect solution for her low kidney function, but it could be at high risk because of her heart function. You should know that heart failure has a reserved life-expectancy. You should know that only half of the heart failure patients survive after five years from diagnosis. Anyway, this depends on many factors: lifestyle, genetics, treatment, comorbidities, etc.  Besides, you should know that a kidney transplant can increase the risk for cardiac complications post-surgery, like myocardial infarction, etc. Being diabetic may indicate being also at an increased cardiovascular risk. That is why it would be necessary performing a Dobutamine stress echo or nuclear cardiac stress test before undergoing the kidney transplant, in order to investigate for the presence of coronary artery disease and undergo coronary catheterization if necessary, in order to avoid complications. So, you can see that benefits should be evaluated comparing them with the risks of surgery and heart complications. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have sagged skin in lower abs. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

My mother was a fish seller till her age of 61 which involved lifting fish box. Now for the past two years she is not going for work. Though she is active at home, is not able to walk as before. Last year, I consulted a bone specialist nearby our town. But after consulting him she is not even walking 100 m. Before that she used to go to our nearest town walking around 1 km. I have attached the previous consultation reports. The doctor had also done some blood test. Most of the blood tests were normal including blood pressure and blood sugar. But there is a slight increase in gamma globulins. I have attached her back x-ray too. I am much worried that after consultation her problem has increased. Please guide me further.","Doctor":"Hi.

Her main issue is her back pain with back bone problems. She has got kyphosis (outward curvature of spine-hunch back) in the lumbar vertebral region. She has got the narrowing of the intervertebral spaces due to age related degeneration of the intervertebral discs at many places. In simple words, she has got issues with cushions that are naturally placed between the two vertebrae of the backbone for properly supporting the body weight. There is no big issue with gamma globulins and that slight change has no impact on her overall health. 1. Improve her diet by giving her plenty of water, salmon fish and a good amount of fruits and vegetables. 2. Give her tablet Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) for pain reduction. 3. Lumbosacral corset for supporting the back and to reduce the pain. 4. Apply Voltaren (Diclofenac topical) gel, massage gently and apply heat pad for soothing effects. 5. Apply ThermaCare heatwraps on the painful and pins and needles sensation areas. 6. Give her by mouth capsule Lyrica (Pregabalin). She will feel much better. Proper rest is necessary for her.

Full dentures are used to replace the whole lot of teeth when absent. In your case, as you have mentioned that you got only one front tooth left, it is much easier to replace only those lost teeth. So, the options here are removable partial dentures. Here you get regular or Valplast to choose. Valplast is much flexible than the regular ones. Fixed partial denture which is nothing but a set of crowns to replace your lost teeth with support in either side from your original back teeth. The options with the material and cost here are ceramic and zirconia where zirconia is much natural looking than ceramic. Dental implants replacing lost teeth with tiny metal screws followed by fixing the ceramic caps or crowns.

The skin does not look different at all, and it seems to literally be the skin and nothing deeper or muscular. It is an area roughly 10 cm by 10 cm (~5”) on the front of my upper right thigh, the bottom of the area is around where my boxers end. I can clearly outline it by tracing my fingers up my thigh. If I just stand still, I cannot really feel it. Lightly tracing my fingers over it, even through my pants it hurts a fair bit. Rubbing and such hurts more. But applying a lot of pressure straight down does not make it hurt particularly more than the initial touch. Light-fast rubbing hurts the most. Walking or just moving also hurts because my clothes interact with the area. The pain feels sort of like burning, or like touching a burned part of your skin. It started two weeks ago, got worse over the first few days and now I am not sure if it is still getting slowly worse (more painful) or if it is just bothering me more and more. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello. Please provide a clear photograph for better understanding. With the description given it can be frictional dermatitis or tinea if it is itching. If there is no itching and only burning sensation, avoid friction of both legs by wearing suitable clothes and apply some moisturizers or aloe vera cream. If there is itching, try Miconazole cream 2 % for 10 days and see if there is any improvement.

Also, I advise you to consume green vegetables and legumes especially spinach which is a natural healing medication for such cases. And, keep yourself hydrated. Drink lots of water. No frizzy drinks, please. The above should help you in a more natural way.

My throat will be itchy sometimes, but no pain.  2) suddenly I get headache Star at the back of my head until my shoulder. I get this headache often. It just start randomly for no reason. I have gastric issue, is this the cause of this pain?","Doctor":"Hi, There are two possibilities for the problem your having 1. A chronic gerd with lpr( gastroesophageal reflux with laryngopharngeal reflux). Basically over here acidic gastric contents have a faulty reflux into your throat and this can be the reason of feeling something stuck in your throat or just a itchy discomfort. You will not have any difficulties with swallowing as such. Inflammation around the throat often results in a irritative cough. 2. A chronic allergic pharyngitis can also be another reason, there could be exposure to some irritative substance indoors itself which can irritate the throat and again be the cause of intermittent cough. What can be done? 1. Avoid exposure to any irritative substance, the best thing to counter this is to wear a n95 mask. 2. Gastric issues have to treated seriously with medications and precautions with more emphasis on the later. You can follow the advice mentioned below. I think this should suffice and keep your symptoms at bay! Hope this helps!

When I was about 10, I started taking 2 mg of Risperidone once a day and 200 mg of Lamotrigine twice a day for the mood disorder. However, for the past year, I have cut back on my medications to the point where I only take 100 mg of Lamotrigine once a day and have eliminated Risperidone completely. As a result of reducing the medication, I feel much more talkative and impulsive. For example, I am noticing myself interrupt my friends talking more often, but also feel happier (my guess is there are more natural amounts of Dopamine in my brain, almost all the time. In addition, I do not feel angry. My question is what is the science behind the change in my behavior after cutting back on the medication? And should I worry about the potential consequences of my change in behavior and reduced medications?","Doctor":"Hi. The diagnosis of mood disorders is not easily made at the age of 8 years but if you were given that diagnosis then there must have been a detailed assessment of yours. Coming to your questions, our mood, thoughts, and behavior is controlled by certain chemicals in our brain like Dopamine and Serotonin. The imbalance of these chemicals is responsible for inducing the mood and other psychiatric disorders. Risperidone and Lamotrigine both balance these chemicals in your brain and keep your mood in check. Yes, decreasing the dose of medicines without your psychiatrist's supervision worsen the problem. I would advise you to get back to your psychiatrist, he will adjust your doses according to the current state."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 8 years old and we found out that she has low iron at the end of last month due to fainting episodes she was having. She has been on a liquid Iron supplement that she takes with a glass of orange juice since this month. Her iron levels we found have continued to drop even with the supplements. She is constantly fatigued and sleeps half the time. We also discovered she is vitamin D deficient. The doctor has tried to refer her to a specialist but they have said to continue doing what we have been doing. We have been doing this for two months with the opposite of our desired results. Any suggestion?","Doctor":"Hi. According to the history provided, fatigue, sleepiness, low energy are the main complaints. Let me tell you that in the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), serum ferritin, serum iron, HB level, WBC counts, platelet count all are within limit. It does not look abnormal. So her iron deficiency anemia seems to be improving. But weakness is still present. Hence, neurological examination and all reflexes should be checked. Investigate with serum TSH, T4 estimation which is strongly recommended to rule out thyroid issues. Check her electrolytes levels also, serum sodium, calcium, and potassium. For low vitamin D level, Cholecalciferol sachet with milk can be prescribed. Check liver and kidney profile also as the disorder also can lead to chronic weakness. If the cause is not identified, then, the muscular dystrophy-like muscular disorder has to be ruled out by EMG like an investigation. Take care.

I have no cut on lips and mouth. Is there any chance of me getting any STI?","Doctor":"Hi. It is really great that you want to know about an important issue and just do not want to make assumptions on your own. STIs are the diseases that are typically transmitted during sexual intercourse. It is unlikely to catch sexually transmitted infections with kissing alone, but with a few exceptions if the STI has manifested itself orally and/or in oral fluid of that person. Hepatitis B virus can be transmitted through kissing as the virus is found in saliva and other body secretions of HBV infected person.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) or warts and syphilis are less likely to be transmitted through kissing. So far, there is no reported case of HIV transmission through kissing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son (4.3 years old, 21 kg, 109 cm), seems to have a tendency of increased thirst and urination for the past two months. Can I request you to review the below summary and attached reports to help him get well? There are at least 3 to 4 occasions in past two months when he had drunk up to 4 to 5 liters of fluid in a day and urinates at least in an hour up to 3 to 4 times in an hour in the evening. These days he also seemed to have some amount of sweating and hiccups too. Couple of these occasions happened the next day after he has taken some outside food (like noodles). However, there was no loose motion or fever as such. When he urinates 3 to 4 times in an hour, the urine volume is not that much always, neither there was any color or smell. We have also tested his urine routine twice, but nothing obvious was there (attached). We have taken him to a local doctor a couple of times, who did not find anything wrong clinically. His BP comes up as 90/60 and 88/60, while an instant sugar check (after 1.5 hours of light breakfast) shows 132. He had reported 3 to 4 occasions of a headache and reeling of the head in the past two months or so. He did have some forehead injury (not fall) 3 months ago, which was reviewed by a doctor with antibiotics and the local dressing was done. He has taken two doses of Zentel syrup (5 ml) three months back. He has got two instances of cold, cough, fever in past two months, for which he had taken medicines like Calpol 250 mg (7.5 ml), Xyzal (3.5 ml), Montec LC Kid (4 ml), Ambrolite-S (5 ml) and Lupital (3 ml) since almost past one month. Apart from the above symptoms, he seems to have moderate stomach pain (around naval chord) since today morning along with vomiting tendency and no appetite. We have given him Domestal Syrup (6 ml) twice, which although prevented vomiting, but he seems too tired, weak and unable to do his daily routine, etc.","Doctor":"Hello. The urine report uploaded seems to be absolutely normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity). And as suggested by the case history, he was never diagnosed with any chronic illness. Blood sugar and BP was always within normal limits. More amount of water intake is normally observed after having refined food like noodles or any oily food. And more water may lead to more urine output. It is good that you have already dewormed the child. Now, I would recommend a course of probiotics along with Multivitamins. CBC with peripheral smear, vitamin D level. Give Enterogermina suspension 5 ml twice daily for five days. Syrup A to Z 5 ml once daily for 30 days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

A thing I have started to notice is it seems to get much worse after eating anything with carbohydrates. After I eat, the symptoms ramp up in 30 minutes to one hour. I can exercise without any issues. I am 33 years old and this has never happened to me before. I went to the hospital one week ago who confirmed my heart was racing and temperature slightly up but standard blood tests came back normal and there was nothing on a chest x-ray. Where do I go from here? Will this stop? Many thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. Fever causes a faster heart rate. Another reason, which is not uncommon in young people, is vagal atrial fibrillation. This is an irregular fast heartbeat that occurs in bouts after eating and during resting and spontaneously revert back. What did your ECG show? Was it only sinus tachycardia or rhythm problem such as atrial fibrillation? Fever usually causes sinus tachycardia, which is a normal response to fever. When fever subsides, the heart rate slows down. Sometimes it occurs due to gastrointestinal problems, in which eating leads to insulin gush, which lowers blood sugar and sensation like blackout, weakness, palpitations, and fatigue develop. Chances of this are very low. Please send me the ECG strip so that I may diagnose your rhythm. Blood tests that might be helpful include CBC (complete blood count), U&E (urea and electrolytes), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and the ECG. These are also some rare disorders that cause a sudden rise in heart rate, fever, shortness of breath, and very high blood pressure. This condition is called pheochromocytoma, but it is extremely rare. Please tell me the other symptoms you develop along with fast heart rate feelings and fever. This along with the above tests will guide to reach a diagnosis. If the above tests are normal, I will advise you to have Holter monitoring done for 24-48 hours to catch fast heart rhythm, if not caught on ECG.

I have already seen my health care provider. For this, she gave me a prescription and I still have the manic episodes.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. I would like to inform you that most of the psychiatric medications take too long to show effects on individuals. Since you were prescribed Risperidone just a week back, there is no need to wait for more time. Most patients with Risperidone show an effect after 3 to 6 weeks in general. In addition, the prescribed dose of Risperidone is just 0.5 mg which is the lowest possible dose. In case the effect is not evident by 2 to 3 weeks, the dose should be increased to a higher level (1 mg or higher). Most of my patients need 1 to 4 mg Risperidone and only small fraction responds to low dose such as 0.5 mg. I mean to say that both the time and dose of medications may need change to show the effect of prescribed medications."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Please read my query and give me your best opinion. I am currently under a cardiologist due to fears that I have had a heart attack in the past and chronic chest discomfort. My cardiologist asked me to take a Holter monitor for 24-hours and the reports he gave me last week were normal. He said that everything was normal. He stated that my maximum pulse was 134 (while working hard), minimum 55 (while sleeping) and average 87. He did capture palpitations but said these were normal increases in pulse associated with activity. He stated that my ECG shows Q wave. Though he said, that is not a pathological and I do not have right BBB, (last week) he did, however, referred me for an echocardiogram to reassure me. He also said that it would be very unlikely for it to be abnormal considering everything else normal. I have had lots of ECGs for the last few months and all normal aside from the Q waves. I have also had my troponin levels monitored, and these too were normal. All doctors say that it is due to anxiety. Before four days, I was taken to A and E due to a sudden increase in pulse from 81 to 135. It then settled within 2 minutes, however as it had panicked me I attended A and E. In A and E, they checked my oxygen (99%), BP (153/92 mmHg) and my pulse (118). The ECG showed normal, sinus tachycardia; however, I was concerned over what looked like ST elevation in AVR. When I asked for the second opinion, I was told that it is fine as it was only in one lead in AVR and not an acute heart attack. I then requested a second ECG as my pulse had gone down to 90s. It again showed normal sinus rhythm and no issues and was sent home from A and E. I have since been in a state of worry over my ECG, which I have attached here. I would like to ask you if the ECG show any issues aside from my usual Q waves. Also, my QRS is long on the new ECG and on this day I started a new course of medication called Omeprazole, which can allegedly cause changes to heart rhythm. Could this have caused my long QRS and heart rate spike? I am a non-smoker, do not drink and have no family history of heart disease.","Doctor":"Hi. Anxiety and panic are the first possibilities. Sudden onset of palpitations is a very unusual sign of heart attack. None of the investigation and symptoms are compatible with the heart attack. Although there are some ECG changes like Q waves, which can be present, are indicative of heart damage in case of heart attack. But, your echo is normal and so no need to worry at all. There is also T-wave insertion in lead 3 and non-significant elevation in AVR. So, given these changes, I would advise for some stress test like treadmill test or stress thallium, which you did not mention anything about. If you have not undergone it, then you can have it to rule out the possibility of inducible ischemia. The QRS prolonging of such mild degree is not significant, and this much variation may normally occur with different ECG. It is not very common with Omeprazole.

Amputation would be the only option. But she is not a suitable candidate for surgery. Will radiotherapy help in this condition? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. The usual treatment for angiosarcoma is the removal of the cancerous tumor by surgery. However, in those patients who are unfit for surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are alternatives. Radiotherapy involves the use of radiations to dissolve the tumor and chemotherapy involves medicines for the same. Both these nuclear medicine treatment modalities are palliative. They may help control the spread of the tumor and also to a certain extent shrink it. However, the prognosis of these treatments depends on the stage of the disease."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 9 months old baby had a high fever, cough, and cold. Initially, it was the fever that was concerning. Later the cough was severe and hospitalized for bronchiolitis. He was put on a nebulizer and after three days his condition has improved. So, the doctor suggested moving from the nebulizer to Asthalin huf puf. Later that night, he had a continuous cough for one hour and was then back on nebulizer. He is put on oxygen support as his SpO2 dropped to around 86. We are much worried as he is premature and was formula fed mostly. Please let us know if this behavior is normal with bronchiolitis.","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms that your child has been suggestive of bronchiolitis. In bronchiolitis, nebulization needs to be given for five to seven days; usually, the child recovers in seven days. Your child was discharged from the hospital and developed respiratory distress after continuous cough and spO2 has decreased. I think that during continuous cough your child has aspirated the food and this has now led to bronchopneumonia. In my opinion, your child needs antibiotics and nebulization with a repeat chest x-ray to see the extent of pneumonia. I think your child needs admission for a week after which he will be alright. Take care of your child."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My sister was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy during her pregnancy. Her age is 31 and weight is 55. She delivered a baby girl through normal delivery. 2D echo report says 20%-25% heart function (LVF). But she is not having any external symptoms like swelling, breathing problem, tiredness or high BP. I have a few questions about her disease and treatment. Is this curable? How much time will it take to get completely out of it? How frequent should she visit a cardiologist and review 2D echo reports? Will fixing an ICD with surgery help her in handling sudden cardiac arrest? What is the approximate cost? If required, is heart transplant possible? What precautions should be taken? When can an emergency situation arise? Should we keep some emergency medicines ready at home? Is there a chance for her baby girl to have a similar problem when she grows up? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Before I answer your questions in detail, I would like to tell you that if she is totally symptom-free and her ejection fraction (EF) is 20-25%, please do get another echo done from an independent reliable source to confirm the diagnosis. The condition peripartum cardiomyopathy or PPCMP has no definite cure. A proportion of patients will completely recover while some may have partial recovery and will continue to have low ejection fraction and symptoms. Some unfortunate patients see no improvement and may not survive for long. There is no definite period of recovery even for those who recover completely. Continuous improvement of up to five years has been seen. The frequency of visit depends upon her problems and her cardiologist. Whenever she has a problem she should visit the cardiologist or whenever the cardiologist calls her, she must visit. The frequency of echo is decided by clinical circumstances and depends upon symptoms. I do first follow up echo after 6 weeks in my patients if there is no emergent symptom. ICD or internal cardiac defibrillator is indicated in patients with low ejection fraction. It helps in the prevention of death caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmia. However, since low EF may revert towards normal in a subset of patients, one should wait for three to six months. In western countries, a wearable ICD (not surgically implanted) is sometimes used for these three to six months. Cost of ICD implantation is nearly four to five lakhs. Yes, a heart transplant is possible and is available in major cardiac centers of metros. Do take your medicines on time. Do not over exert. Stick with recommended salt and water intake. Avoid alcohol. Avoid steroids and painkillers. Only take medicine under the supervision of your cardiologist. None can tell that when an emergency situation will arise. Do take medicine as prescribed by your cardiologist. Visit health facility in case of an emergency. No emergency medicines can be prescribed as such. Although a number of case reports are available regarding the occurrence of PPCMP in daughters and sisters of patients of PPCMP. However, systematic studies regarding such an association are not available. In fact, routine genetic studies of PPCPM patients are not recommended as yet."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fiancee is 59 days pregnant.

But safety profile says, until seven weeks these pills do not cause heavy bleeding and pain, so can be prescribed by a single doctor. For more than seven weeks, often bleeding and pain is more leading to unwanted hospitalization, that is why dilation and curettage under short anesthesia are preferred.

Some thick skin between the two top middle teeth is sort of stuck to the inside of his upper lip. We only noticed because he just got hurt and a part ripped. We thought some skin was stuck between his teeth and tried to pull it out but it is stuck there. I am now seeing that it may cause teeth to be seperated as he grows up. Should I go see a dentist? He is happy now and playing. Should I just see a dentist in a few days to see what should be done to prevent teeth gap?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. The upper lip tie in your child is one of the common problems faced. This is called high labial frenum attachment in dental terms. There are two major disadvantages of such frenal attachments. Firstly, it would compromise the gum health of your kid by interfering in the placement of toothbrush. Secondly, it is one of the main reasons to cause midline gap between the two permanent upper central incisors. Now your kid has got only the milk teeth. We should be more concerned when his permanent teeth erupt that is around 5 to 6 years of time. But, consulting with a dentist virtually, and getting the triangular piece of frenum removed (frenectomy) before the permanent teeth erupt is an ideal treatment to be done. As you said, emergency treatment is not necessary but it has to be treated. Getting a 1-year-old in a dental clinic is a challenging job. So, start encouraging your kid and prepare him or her for the first dental visit and make sure it turns pleasant. Once he or she gets a knack of it, you may proceed to introduce your kid to various treatment procedures."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have pain while urinating.

Do you have to strain to pass urine or have frequent urination? Is there any pain around the lump you noticed and is it painful to touch? Do you clip your scrotal hair or shave them? Looking at the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the redness surrounding the lump, it appears to be some inflammation of the hair follicle involving only the skin. It usually subsides with mild antibiotics, and as you are already on them, you do not have to do anything additional. I would, however, urge you to visit your local dermatologist or urologist for a visit, as a clinical exam is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.  Regarding your burning sensation during urination, I would suggest you wait till you finish your antibiotics and if it persists, a urine examination would help to identify if there is any urinary tract infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been diagnosed with GERD as confirmed by an ENT specialist, I took medicine for over a month but I did not get totally well.

If after a day tooth is still mobile and mobility is grade 3 (severe mobility), take him to the dentist immediately. Meanwhile, keep giving your kid Brufen syrup eight hourly, three times a day for three days.  It would be great if you can provide me with a video of mobility of tooth so that I can tell accurately will mobility be covered through rinses or splinting of the tooth by the dentist is required."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, The use of moisturizer or face wash made my skin glow. If not for five to six days, my skin would become very dull even without any sun exposure. So, I used them regularly. But, I had stopped applying anything on my face for about three months and then my facial skin stopped responding to them. Now my face is much darker than my body. I have tried scrubbing and even chemical peel but no results are seen. I do not think any signs of disease are shown. Then what could be the reason?","Doctor":"Hi. My inference from the above is that your skin is facing lack of oil. There is dryness which makes your skin vulnerable to sun and other external influences. Hence it gets dark. However, with moisturizer, the skin gets adequate moisture and hydration and stays supple and healthy. I suggest you to restart applying the moisturizer on a daily basis. Also, there are combinations of moisturizer + sunscreen + fairness creams in the market. They are offered by all leading brands like Garnier, Neutrogena, Vaseline, Ponds and many more. These creams are very effective as they provide the required moisture and oils for the skin. They prevent sun-related damage and darkening by acting as a sunscreen that prevents contact of sun rays on the skin. They have ingredients which overtime lightens your skin. At the same time, please check if your skin gets excessively dry after face wash. Use a mild moisturizing face wash and not any soap. Also, do not use face washes which are meant for people with oily skin as they will dry the skin even more and help evaporate the skin oils."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a skin condition. As per my research, it could be pruritus ani. But I am sure I would get a proper and accurate diagnosis from your end. I have a severe itchy bum and have been suffering from the same for almost eight years. I have never had the courage to consult a dermatologist in person because of the reason for a physical examination. All I am looking forward is a cure to it as it has been really disturbing lately. I would highly appreciate your suggestions.","Doctor":"Hi.I can understand your concerns as I have analyzed each detail that you have provided. I have managed lots of cases with matching condition and feel that you too will make good use of the information and suggestions. I am sure the problem can be managed even though it might not be possible to do so in a matter of days. The key to treatment is to let the skin heal, remove any cause of irritation, and break the cycle of itch-scratch which is bound to have resulted in thickening of the affected skin."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a protein shake for three weeks, around five scoops a day. Since then I get a pulsation in my buttocks and legs. This also causes dizziness most of the time. If I eat too much this problem gets worse. Drinking a lot of water helps but it is not sorting out the problem. I was advised to see a toxicologist for this problem as someone said to me that it could have given me protein toxicity. Anything I eat with high protein like chicken, lamb, fish, etc., makes this problem go worse. I also tried to stop eating that for a bit. It did help a little but again it did not sort out the problem. I have tried taking Detox as well. I am suffering through this problem for the last one year. I have been running around my gp. I am really fed up with this problem. All blood tests were done and everything normal. I have also tried taking vitamin C it did help a lot. But I experienced some pains around my kidney area so I stopped taking that too. This shake has definitely done something to me and nothing was helpful. I have tried a lot to find a toxicologist because I think who is the right person to help me with this issue. Could you please suggest me the correct medication for this problem as it is messing me up and stopping me from work as well? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. After going through your question I feel that you are really worried about the ill effects of protein shake. Let me assure you that a protein shake is perfectly safe even if you have taken in large quantities as mentioned. The fact that even after three weeks it has not altered your renal function or liver function itself is the proof that you need not worry about the toxic effect of the protein shake. Drink plenty of fluids and try to cut down fried food and junk food as your body mass index - BMI is high. Just bring down your weight. It will ease your problem a lot. Do not worry. You will be all right."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 33 year old female. I am married. I have two sons. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism over ten years ago and I am on medication. I am having a horrible time with pms over last few months. I used to have terrible headaches and irritability before few days of my periods. Now it has been two weeks as my period is ten days late. I am having the worst time in my life right now. My headache and the pressure drive me crazy. I am having hard time. I am getting into deep depression. I do not know how to get through this. I cannot stop crying. I have an appointment finally with an endocrinologist in two weeks. Whenever the thing gets worse my gp will increase the dosage of my medicine. My hair is falling out. I am not the same person at all anymore. I feel like this is killing me. Need some help.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your query and I can understand your condition. First of all, I need to know whether your hypothyroidism is under control or not. Kindly upload your recent TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) report. Now we need to see whether your headache and irritability is due to your PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or if there are some other reasons. Your endocrinologist will evaluate for that. But a simple way to know is to halt your periods for two months and observe what happens. Ask your general practitioner to prescribe you certain oral contraceptive pills. This shall halt your periods for a month or two and if you feel better then it is due to PMS. But if there is no improvement then other evaluations have to be done including your blood pressure testing, eye check up and if necessary brain scan. If there is an improvement then you can take the contraceptive pills for three to four months and then stop and observe."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A new mole on a toe that I have not noticed before, I know about it probably for a week, it is blackish and not round, about 3 to 4 mm wide and sort of even in color. I am 21 years old male and as far as I know we have no cancer history in my family. I can provide photos too.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your case history and the photos provided by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can see a dark irregular lesion of about 5 mm in size over the tip of the toe. As it is to 3 days history the first thing I want to rule out is an history of injury or bruise.They do present like this and you may have forgotten the history of trauma. Secondly, moles also appear at this age and they also present like this if you have tendency of moles this may be a normal mole you can just observe it for few days. The other thing obviously is melanoma, acral lentiginous melanosis, this can be dangerous and has to be ruled by biopsy as soon as possible. But as you do not have any family history and if you do not have any other or very few moles over other parts of the body the chances again become very less. And again such a small history of the lesion the possibility is least. But to be sure you should monitor the lesion. Observe it for 5 days. If due to trauma, it will diminish and slowly go away. If persist and grow more immediately, go for a biopsy by a dermatologist for histopathogical examination. trauma, biopsy after 5 days. Intradermal hemorrhage, nevus nevus excision. none after 5 days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Me and my partner had unprotected sex, and she took I-pill within 72 hours (but after 24 hours), and now after 8 to 9 days of taking the pill, she is having mild cramps similar to period and also mild bleeding (just a few spots), but the discharge is brownish in color, and this is the third day with cramps, although the bleeding is very less. Is it side effect of the pill or is it implantation bleeding? And when can she expect her normal periods?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your concern. Spotting or sometimes profuse bleeding accompanied with cramps are most common side effects after taking the emergency pill. This is due to the high-level hormones (Progesterone) contained in the pill. However, this is difficult to differentiation from implantation bleeding. The only way you can identify it is taking a pregnancy test since it has been more than eight days since your last contact and if you are pregnant then it would have turned out positive by now by using a simple home pregnancy test kit."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had protected sex with a sex worker and according to my knowledge condom did not break and slip. Can I contract HIV? I took HIV combo test CMIA method at 28th-day and the result came negative. Again on the 35th day and 41st day both were negative. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Following are the answers to your query: Condoms are an excellent way to protect not only from HIV but also from other sexually transmitted infection (STI) and if you have used the condom correctly and it did not slip off or break, it is unlikely you contract HIV if your partner is HIV infected. It is always recommended to check the expiry date of it before using. Also at every time of sex, a newer condom should be used and water-based lubricants are always recommended with it. The risk of exposure is dependent on the length of time that had passed after the condom was initially put. No type of condom is 100 % effective against HIV or for any STI, but if you and your partner are having sex, nothing protects better against these than a properly used condom. Using a latex male condom can greatly reduce but not entirely eliminate the risk of HIV or any other STI. You increase your risk of contracting HIV and for that matter any other STI if you have multiple partners. It is really good that your HIV test is negative on 28th, 35th and 41st day post-exposure. But, as per the recommendations, I still suggest repeat HIV rapid test at three months and if negative, then at six months. You need not repeat in between."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a breathing problem. I feel like something has tightened my lungs. Please advice what should I do.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See if you do not have any other symptoms like fever, cough with sputum and pain in the chest, etc. Then you can take steam of plain water and can add two to three drops of eucalyptus oil in it. It will help you. But if you feel some serious problem, then visit a nearby physician immediately because it could be due to some serious problem which is excluded with the help of clinical examination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 32, male. There is a huge problem regarding my sex drive. I do not have till now found the root cause of low sex drive but I feel it is due to masturbation and porn. I used to masturbate from 15 years of age but from the last six months, I am watching porn like daily and masturbating once in 2 or 3 days. I usually masturbate by rubbing hard on bed. I am confused that whether my low drive is related to stress or excess masturbation or porn or some other hormonal imbalance. I am going to get married and that is why I am worried. I tried safe sex with a sex worker previous month but not enjoyed at all because of low sex drive. Could you tell me the reason and remedies for the same?","Doctor":"Hi. Masturbation is normal. It does not cause physical problems or sexual problems. Also, do not give any importance to the advertisement that mentions that masturbation cause health problems or destroys life, and masturbation does not require any treatment. Your problem can be due to stress, anxiety or due to a physical cause. For physical cause, you need to do blood tests Hb, TC, DC, fasting sugar, prolactin, TSH, testosterone. Please upload the reports. Depending on the reports, treatment can be decided."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a root canal over a year ago, had a cap put on and no problems. A month ago it was pulled off when I ate candy. It was glued back on. Yesterday, the tooth suddenly felt different. It feels sensitive when pressure is applied and sometimes it feels to be throbbing under the cap.","Doctor":"Hi. Throbbing pain or sensitivity in a root canal treated tooth is an indication of re-infection in it. Sometimes the nerves regenerate from the apical end and start causing infection, it may happen due to food stuck around margins of gums for a long time, etc. There are two lines of treatment to it. 1. Medications- Take Augmentin 625 mg, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg and Brufen 400 mg for five days, twice a day. It will heal the infection and there will be no need for further treatment, your tooth will be back to normal. 2. If infection recurs after medicine regime like in 2 or 6 months with severe pain then cap will be removed for a while, re-endo or root canal treatment will be done, that is, deep cleaning of roots will be done and then it will be sealed again once infection is gone and tooth cap will be put again. There is also a third option that is a severe one, if root canal treated tooth is stuck with it then sometimes we have no option left except for extraction. Provide me with clinical picture and radiograph of your tooth so that I can exactly recommend you what should you opt for after medications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

For that she is taking head bath and applying oil on scalp. She is prone to sinus problems. Now for a couple of days there are boils inside and outside left ear. It is troubling her very much. Please suggest some medication or remedy for immediate relief.","Doctor":"Hello. With the picture it appears like a hair follicle infection of the small hair in the ear canal (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Considering her age and that she suffers from diabates and hypertension (diabetic people have slightly less immunity compared to normal people) I am suggesting antibiotics for her. Tablet Augmentin 625, 1 tablet thrice daily after meals x 5 days, tablet Chymoral Forte 1 tab thrice daily before meals x 3 days, tablet DOLO 650, 1 tablet SOS for pain, can take upto three tablets per day in divided doses. T-BACT ointment use clean little finger and apply the ointment thrice daily over the area. If using ear buds take particular care that it does not go deep and injure the ear drum. Do not let water enter while taking bath. Keep a cotton plug (spread with some T-Bact ointment or vaseline) inside the affected ear and throw it off after bath. This condition is called acute localised otitis externa (furuncle of external ear). It appears that there is a single boil with a lot of redness in the picture you showed. It is quite painful. Please continue your diabetic and hypertension medicines as before. I hope you are taking those regularly and the sugars are controlled. For a few days avoid applying oil in hairs.

Probably bacterial. The treatment is antibiotic eye drops. You should consult an Ophthalmologist for the same. Most important is that it should not spread to others. It spreads from person to person by droplets. thus everyone in your family should avoid using the same clothes, etc., like your mother. Also, ask her not to hold any babies and touch others hands.

Autism, unfortunately, is sometimes associated with an array of other behavioral co-morbidities like intellectual disability and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). The symptoms you described are almost suggestive of ADHD.

What could it be?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to icliniq.com. The bumps signify there is some local inflammation. If there is associated pain, discharge, pus or fever then you need to take appropriate antibiotics as these are signs of infection. I suggest you to visit your doctor who performed the surgery for physical evaluation. Mild bumps without above-associated symptoms will get relieved by some anti-inflammatory drugs like Paracetamol or Chymotrypsin and hot fomentation. The peeling in the ear could be due to an allergy to the earring or whatever you are wearing in the ear.bIt could also be an allergic response to any cream or ointment you had applied. I suggest you to take tablet Paracetamol 500 mg twice a day and observe. If it worsens or develops any additional symptom it needs physical evaluation. Otherwise, it will subside.

What are the other birth control methods which are safe (I am not much inclined towards hormonal methods since they lead to weight gain etc)?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. How was the bleeding before pregnancy and for 3 months after delivery? Was your delivery a normal or C-section? Whether the copper-T is properly placed or not or to see some other cause for heavy bleeding you need to take a transvaginal ultrasound -TVS. Sometimes if the bleeding continues then removal is the treatment, the period will regularize if it is due to copper T. If the cause is something else and the spotting continues, you will have to get treatment. There are medicines which can reduce the amount of bleeding. You need a clinical check-up."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Is that fine to bring peanut butter (PB) on an airplane? I would like to know the ways that bringing PB on a plane might or might not pose a threat to others? What should you do if you are bringing PB and if you have an allergy and want to keep safe in case someone else brings some on the plane? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. You have asked an interesting question. Peanut allergy is one of the most severe food allergies. It can cause itchiness, urticaria, swelling, eczema, sneezing, asthma, abdominal pain, drop in blood pressure and cardiac arrest. It may even result in anaphylactic death if not controlled at the right time. The routes of exposure of the allergen are mostly the accidental ingestion of peanuts or PB by the concerned person (who is hypersensitive to peanuts). Air-borne particles in a farm or factory or crushing environment may cause respiratory symptoms in allergic individuals. However, the odor of peanut butter or its mere proximity has not produced any allergic symptoms in various studies conducted.

When do the female egg and male sperm actually connect with each other?","Doctor":"Hello. Azithral (Azithromycin) is safe during pregnancy and is a category-B drug. So, it is not going to harm in any way. Moreover, after intercourse, the sperms usually take 24 hours to fertilize the egg in the fallopian tube if it has already been released. The life of the egg is also 24 hours. So, if there is a conception, still the medicine would not affect the fetus. Regards.

I feel so low and like a total failure. How do I ensure that I do not spiral into depression? My husband is supportive and encouraging, but I end up crying each time I see or hear news of a baby.","Doctor":"Hello. You should, first of all, reassure yourself that if you will have sexual intercourse in a relaxed and stress-free mind then this will yield the best results. If you will do sexual intercourse in anticipation of the baby then you will remain stressed and this will make negative results. Stress too is one cause of poor fertility. You should spend more time in foreplay with your husband. Have more sexual encounter during a fertile period of the menstrual cycle that is during 12th to 16th day of the cycle (the first day of the cycle is the first day of bleeding). Keep your both legs up while you will remain lying down after ejaculation. This will prevent the leakage of semen. Remain in this position for around 5 to 10 minutes after sex. This will also help you a lot. Just do not lose your confidence. Just keep one thing in mind that you are healthy and you will have a baby without many issues. Try to spend more time in doing constructive activities. Avoid spending more time on the internet because this increases stress only. Light exercise in the evening too will lift up your mood. Do not get irritated on your family members which could happen in depression. This will help you. If needed, visit a psychiatrist for help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Which drug works better for throat infection, Augmentin or Azithromycin?","Doctor":"Hi. We usually do not care about throat infection when it is mild and then it gets worsened and causes undue discomfort. Regarding choice of appropriate antibiotic, it is very important to know your history. It includes previous use of recent antibiotic, presence of fever, purulence of sptum, systemic symptoms etc. So. if it is just mild sore throat with mild fever and no excessive cough or other body symptoms, tablet Azithromycin will do good. But for severe infection, systemic symptoms, high grade fever and difficulty in swallowing, we need to give something which is broad spectrum like tablet Augmentin 625mg thrice daily for 7 days. So, it is the clinical judgement to select appropriate antibiotic according to the presenting clinical symptoms.
