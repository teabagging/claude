Incorrect Flossing technique - If you are using wrong flossing technique and you are applying more force , this can cause damage to gums over time. You should gently floss your teeth2 Sensitivity of teeth- sometimes flossing exposes your teeth to saliva and food stuff. A clear possibility of this is when you have plaque on the teeth surface.3.Gum disease- If you have a severe case of gum disease such as periodontal disease, your gums will recline and expose your teeth even further. When this happens, it is normal to experience more pain when you floss because you are cleaning the inner parts of the teeth and gum that weren’t previously exposed to open conditions.4.Dental/ gum abscessIf the pain persist, see a dentist immediately for professional treatment.Don't worry you would be fineHoping your query is solved."},{"Patient":"My gum in between my upper molars (the last two molars) hurt sooo bad it's always painful and throbbing.

Due to decreased clearance or swallowing..In your case it odes not seems that the salivation has not increased but it is due to reduced swallowing due to the fear that the pressure imposed on the extraction site where the dressing is placed will dislodge the dressing..You need not to worry as swallowing the saliva will not cause the dislodgement of the dressing and you can easily swallow the saliva and gradually you will feel that the problem of excessive salivation is reduced by itself..If at all the salivation is increased it can be due to the medicament placed in the dressing and when some amount of the medicine touches the tongue of the inner cheeks there can be increased salivation..For faster healing of dry socket the dressing should be changed every alternate day and take antibiotics like Amoxicillin to prevent infection and painkillers like Ibuprofen to prevent pain..You will be fine soon..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"I got a top back tooth removed atfer two failed fillings and 7 injections but had to go back to get it recleaned only to still have pain along with ulcers and redness where tooth was pulled I also got antibiotics and am taking a nasel spray as my nose is running (something to do with my sinus??) how do I know if its an infection or a dry socket, there seems to be something at the gap would it be the medication they packed into it?

As per your query  bleeding from teeth and swelling on gums which is mainly because of infection of gums which might be because of improper cleaning of teeth or food deposition between teeth.

My powerchain's turning yellowish and i think its kinda gross. Thanks in advance for answering.","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concern.... As per your complain in case of Orthodontic treatment there is a limit of time for which the braces are to be worn by the patient and once the treatment is successful and the orthodontist assesses the outcome of the treatment and if he find that proper tooth movement has taken place and now the relapse will not take place the braces are removed and the retainers are placed..Power chains are placed on adjacent teeth and are used to close space. Power chains are removed and replaced at each appointment so we can continue to provide light, continuous pressure to efficiently move teeth.As the tooth movement occurs sufficiently the power chains become loss and as they apply pressure which helps in tooth movement therefore their placement and removal is purely the decision of the orthodontist and you should not put any efforts in putting the power chains yourself as unwanted and unequal pressure application can lead to defects in your already successfully commenced treatment..Better visit your Orthodontist and continue the treatment as he advises..Hope this information helps..If you find the answer helpful please give me a Five Star Review and click on found the answer helpful as a token of appreciation..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"hi my canine teeth stick out when i smile and my lateral incisors are both pushed back and i think i have an overbite but my bottom teeth are nearly perfect except for one that is like rotated but still in line with my other teeth, how can i fix this?","Doctor":"Hi Dear,  Understanding your concern.

The surgeon had difficulties extracting them as they were big and weren't growing in the right direction (too big for my mouth) some of my teeth began moving, re-adjusting into my mouth, creating a gap between two of the top back teeth whereas I lost the temporary bandage I had on the bottom back teeth. I had a check up a year or so later and everything was fine. But then, my jaw began making incredibly loud noises when I chewed, opened my mouth and often began to crack while the side would hurt a little but nothing major. I never had any real pain, just mainly my jaw cracking and making noises. Later again, my tooth began being more sensitive to cold, showing a deep hole where the bandage used to be. Until recently, the side of the tooth seemed to have weakened, being loose. One evening, I ran my tongue over it and it fell into my mouth. I didn't bleed, it didn't hurt or anything. The inside was a little darkened and the piece that broke wasn't big, shorter than a pinky nail. Now, it hurts a little and I looked into the mirror and the inside of the tooth is gone, leaving my flesh/gum bare... I think it is the sensation of having no tooth when I move my tongue or it being exposed like that that hurts, but it goes through phases... Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't. How can I stop it from being like this? It brings me more discomfort than pain, as if something was stuck when it isn't. I live in the country side and my car broke down, leaving me unable to travel far. The dentist near my house can't give me an appointment until mid-August... will it be okay until then? I feel it is already partially late but I have tried many times to get dentist appointments and with life getting in the way and all the waiting for appointments, moving out, exams, it was simply impossible. Could the tooth breaking be a result of it getting damaged when I got my wisdom teeth removed? Is it possible to fix the tooth so I can not lose it as it is my second molar. I know it may sound silly but I am really scared and one of my fears is to lose my teeth. Thanks for your kind response.","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I have gone through your query and can understand your health concerns..As per your explanation i have come to a conclusion that the second molar which is bothering you got fractured not due to any trauma but due to loss of bandage[filling] and infection leading to caries due to which the tooth got weakened and a part of it has got broken..Due to fracture of the tooth the inner portion of the tooth that is the inner dentine is exposed and the central portion of the tooth that is PULP which contains nerves and blood vessels has got a thinner covering on it now, so whenever you eat or drink something hot or cold there must be sensitivity and discomfort..As per the symptoms I can evaluate that the tooth can be saved but it needs treatment and consulting a dentist is needed..The dentist will take an x-ray and evaluate the condition of the tooth..In case if the Pup is not exposed and there is a considerable layer of dentine over the pulp then filling of the tooth with a permanent filling material followed by Capping of the tooth is the treatment to be done..In case if the pulp is exposed then the Root Canal Treatment has to be done and then the tooth has to be capped after 15 to 2O days..As of now if there is pain you can take Advil [Ibuprofen]..You should not wait and get appointment with a dentist soon as more the time will go off more will be the decay and there are chances that the tooth can fracture completely as well as there can be an outbreak of severe pain..Hope this information helps..If you find the answer helpful please give me a Five Star Review and click on found the answer helpful as a token of appreciation..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"I have been having severe tooth pain in a back tooth.

Leukoplakia is the major reason for white spots on your gums which is because of poor oral hygiene of oral cavity. Food particles keeps on accumulating which are causing continued irritation.I would suggest you need not to worry about anything. Its not symptoms of oral cancer. Still you should visit oral pathologist once and get scrapings from gum and get it examined properly to rule out any malignant pathology. Maintain proper oral hygiene by antimicrobial mouth wash. Do gum massage on daily basis. Brush and floss twice daily. Leukoplakia is harmless as such, you should visit dentist once and get it surgically removed if its troubling you. Take Nystatin suspensions as well to prevent fungal infection.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"The gum behind my last tooth on the left side, the gum is swollen & there's a hole there & inside of the hole is something white.

What is the hole & the white in it??","Doctor":"Hi..Can understand your concern..As per your complain the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation..There can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth..In case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as PERICORONITIS.The white material in it is Pus.In case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation.It can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside..I would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly..In case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done..In case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help..In case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done.Hope your query is solved..If you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"Have a tooth infection with a tooth that has root canal work. Filling came out last night causing more pain. Dentist removed top of tooth today and rest to be taken out when infection cleared but he found cotton wool under filling? Would this have caused infection ?","Doctor":"Hi Dear,welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern.As per your query you had reinfection in the root canal area and due to that you get that teeth extracted, while extraction cotton wool find under filling which was not a source of infection as cotton pellets are placed in teeth to help in the quick removal of temporary fillings. It helps the dentist determine that the temporary filling has been removed and the bottom of the tooth is being approached. In most cases the pellet is removed prior to the placement of a permanent filling. The cotton pellet itself is not a source of infection since they are usually sterilized.Bacterial build up under tooth area is the source of infection. Some times root canal treatment fails and extraction is the only treatment option in that case. I would suggest you to take antibiotic such as Ibuprofen to prevent further infection and get also extracted whenever infection subsides and go for tooth implant.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I have sharp jaw pain that shoots up into my temple and down my gums for now I have sores now on the inside my cheek .

In case of pain in the sores you can apply numbing gels like Mucopain or Orabase gel for relief..

Extraction of tooth i.e pulling out of tooth is not a treatment option for your case as tooth pain is generalized in nature.I would suggest you to visit Periodontist once and get it examine properly. Go for root cleaning, curettage and root planning as you have debris inside gums which are causing detachment of gums from arch. Scaling is not the only option as you don't have superficial rather deep debris accumulation.Use antimicrobial mouth wash. Brush twice daily with proper brushing technique. Floss daily.

Is that okay to do? I didn't want to get dry socket. Please help I'm freaking out!!!","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern.Thanks for your query . Your dentist has not given stitches because of less traumatic injury during procedure and titches are not necessary. You are right that you should bite firmly but you should not bite barely at extraction site . You should first place cotton gauge  on extraction site and then bite it for half an hour to 45 mins .You should not put anything from oral cavity to socket because it can carry microorganism with it . Now you should wait for 2-3 days and follow the instructions given below.- Do not swish  or throw saliva forcefully out of mouth , because it can dislodge clot inside socket. - Eat soft food from side other then extraction or have liquid diet . Do not suck any liquid with straw .- Give warm compresses on cheek outside extraction site .- Take ibuprofen(if not allergic) or acetaminophen for pain and swelling.- After two days start warm saline rinses 2-3 times day.If it start paining after 2-3 days which is duration for dry socket formation then consult dentist or oral surgeon for proper examination .

I don't think this should hurt so much.","Doctor":"Hi..Can understand your concern..As per your complain you have got two crowns placed and pain after this can be due to either of the following reasons..One reason can be in case if the crowns were placed without root canal treatment of tooth (it is a treatment in which the nerves and blood vessels present in the tooth are cut off either to relieve pain due to infection or as an intentional procedure to avoid complications like pain and sensitivity after crown placement) the preparation of the tooth for seating the crown if done in excess can lead to opening of nerves and when the crown is placed over opened nerves it can cause inflammation of nerve and hence severe pain.In case if the crowns are placed after root canal treatment for an infected tooth pain can be due to persistent infection leading to pus formation and pressure which is not subsided or there is some vital nerve tissue left out in any missed root canal can cause severe pain on crown placement..I would suggest you to consult an ENDODONTIST and get evaluated clinically as well as by getting x ray done to rule out the cause of pain.In case if root canal is not done and pain is due to irritated nerves the crown needs to be removed followed by Root canal treatment and medicines and once pain is completely subsided crown can be placed again..In case of root canal treated tooth also re treatment will have to be done.You can take painkiller like Ibugesic plus or Ketorol DT (one tablet dissolved in half a glass of water) to provide relief.Hope your query is solved..If you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"The doctor said i have some kind of bacteri growing beside my tooth something like formation its a small pimple growing beside my decaying tooth on the outside layers of the chewing  gums.

The only precaution which you can take is avoid hard food items and do not chew from the affected side to prevent flaring up of pain.You should also avoid very cold and very hot drinks so as to prevent pain..Avoid eating sticky foods as they can lodge in the infected tooth cavity and can be painful while removing..Just continue taking the medicines on time and mostly after a course of 3 or   5  days the dentist will perform the extraction of the tooth as hopefully the infection will considerably reduce even if you still see the pimple.Hope your query is solved..If you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from mouth problem from last 3 month  when i quite chewing tabaco habit and afterwords firstly tingling sensation and bitter taste in mouth now a days ulcer in my mouth from last 2 weeks and went to dentist but he said everything is normal but my problem is increasing day by day , i am using now a days zyyte but no problem solved , tell me wt to do nd i am a smoker also  but i am trying to quite","Doctor":"Thanks for your query.

I had a case of gingivitis but now gums look healthy and dont bleed apart from a tiny speckle if that when brushing but I can taste blood 2 or 3 times a day?","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern.As per your query contraceptive pills which you are taking can cause bleeding of gums as contraceptives will increase level of progesterone in body and any small irritant like food, plaque, improper brushing can gums to bleed, swell and can turn them red.  Gums become more sensitive and the moment you brush or bite anything hard you taste blood in your mouth. These symptoms of gingivitis keeps on increasing if remain unattended as they will cause further bone loss and poor periodontal support of all teeth and in turn loosening of teeth.Certain antibiotics like amphicillin, barbiturates will reduce this effect of oral contraceptives. I would suggest you to visit dentist and get properly prescribed contraceptives. Hope your concern has been resolved.Get well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi, I just had my wisdom teeth out in the beginning of the week. It still aches but is okay. But theres hard lumps forming on the outside of my lower jaw on either side. My sister is the same way. what is this? Scar tissue? It prevents me from opening my mouth very wide.","Doctor":"Hi..Can understand your concern..As per your complain swelling and lump formation after removal of wisdom tooth may occur due to inflammation which can cause as extraction especially of wisdom tooth is a traumatic procedure.Other reason can be that there may be underlying infection (if infection was the reason for removal of wisdom tooth) which is not cleared off while extraction thereby creating a continuous source of infection in the region and causing swelling.Infection can also be caused if any foreign body or piece of tooth is left in the socket which leads to recurrence of infection.For this I would suggest you to consult your dentist and get an IOPAR        (x ray) done to get ruled out the reason of infection and it can be treated with antibiotics and painkillers and if some root piece of foreign material is left in the extraction socket removal of same followed by irrigation with hydrogen peroxide, betadine  and normal saline along with antibiotics can give relief..If inflammation is the reason it slowly gets reduced itself and many a time if pain killers like Ibuprofen ,acetaminophen is given it helps in reducing the swelling.In severe inflammation steroids are given to patient.Other part of question is that the swelling or lump on the other side of jaw can not be due to extraction  of the opposite side tooth..It may either be due to deeply infected wisdom tooth or due to infected and inflammed gum flap due to food debris deposition between gum flap and partially erupted or impacted wisdom tooth , the condition is called PERICORONITIS.For this also clinical evaluation and xray can give correct diagnosis..Do warm saline gargles as it will help in easing both the sides of jaw.Medication to be taken after clinical checkup by dentist..Wishing you a sooner recovery..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"Sir my doughter suffering from abdominal tuberculosis.  daiagation done in Asra Hospital, Hyderabad.

With a mirror and a little flashlight I saw that, except for a small red spot near the back of the roof, it was all white. I read the dialog between one of you & the 28-year-old man.  Except for some gluten crust pumpkin pie and some chocolate at a Christmas Day party, and a few sips from a friend's flask of tequila, I have been gluten-free vegetarian for a few weeks and before that gluten-free vegan, probably taking in too much raw honey.  It feels to me like my third set of teeth are coming in.","Doctor":"Hi Dear,welcome to Health Care Magic Team.Understanding your concern about health.As per your query you have very few teeth in upper and lower anterior area and whenever you chew it causes pain and difficulty the most probable reason for that could be temporomandibular joint diseases. As you have left with few teeth and while chewing the pressure mainly spreads to muscles and ligaments and which in turn put lot of pressure on joint.Diet which you had on Christmas day is not the cause of your problem. Tenderness on roof of mouth is also because of unequal distribution of forces and you feel like popping sound as well at times.I would suggest you to go to near by dentist and  get partial denture done for your remaining teeth with the support of anterior teeth. This will help you in better chewing and increases esthetic value. Forces will be evenly distributed then and you can eat any thing without any pain and redness.Do mouth exercises daily to prevent locking of TMJ joint.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"hi doctor,i just wnt to knw the cause tht why sometime but most ofently thick,viscous blood comes in my mouth","Doctor":"Hi,Snehlaji, Thanks for query, It seems that youmight have chronic infection or tartered teeth causing bleeding from gums.

Its nothing serious, the space around the tooth from where two teeth have been extracted is empty now and it causes deposition of bacteria, food particles. These bacteria keep on accumulating and improper brushing in that area builds them up which causes senstivity, itchiness in that area and that is the reason your tounge keeps on going in that area due to pressure built due to bacterial deposition. Hard bump on the roof could be because of any sharp tooth in lower arch which keeps on irritating upper arch as this is very common occurence after extraction.What you need to do is maintain proper hygiene of your oral cavity. Brush atleast twice a day. Use flossing interdentally to remove debris.Visit your nearby dentist for cleaning of your teeth. Get the sharpened edges trimmed. Apply dologel in the sharp bump area it will go away.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get well soon.Best wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I'm not sure if you can help me, but here goes, a week ago a crock pot lid fell of shelf hitting me on my 2 front teeth, now they are numb and some what sensitive, the gums behind these 2 teeth are irritated.My general dentist took x-rays which were negative for crack/fractures.","Doctor":"Hi..

I am afraid of taking it off and redoing it because the tooth has a crack in it.","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to Health Care Magic Team.Understanding your concern.New crown of last molar tooth as you said is lower in position which means this crown is not at all in occulsal contact with teeth of opposite jaw. If teeth are not in proper occlusal contact while chewing it will cause load to distribute unevenly which in turn cause pressure on muscles and temporomandibular joints and it will cause wasting of muscles.Your tooth can be saved easily that is not an issue but what your need is removal of existing crown and resetting it to higher level. A well fitted crown will allow you to bite proper once it is properly inserted.Resin cements along with bonding agents are used now a days for crown lengthening.Subgingival i.e below your gum line margin placement can be done to improve height of your crown. Alternation of tooth preparation design with placement of retention forms can be done.I would suggest you to stick to your exiting dentist and tell him your problem because if you will switch to another dentist that could be very costly for you and new dentist can cause same mistake again.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I recently went to a dentist about intenese pane in my teeth when i lay down i was told i had an abcessed tooth i have a consultation tomorrow morning, last night was the worst pain i have ever experienced in my life, when should i become worried and seek medical attention at the emergency room?","Doctor":"Dear,may be you are suffering by close pulpitis if the tooth is without carries or cavity.

Second, it's like its top is broken in a way that makes it detached from the gum.

Is it an infection? Is that a nerve uncovered? I got an appointment with an orthodontist but it's in May, can my tooth wait?

An orthodontist ?Thank you very much for your help!","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Understanding your concern.Yours left upper wisdom tooth about which you are talking about if its accompanied by symptoms such as intense pain, swelling over that area, fever, problem in breathing and headache then it needs immediate attention.Otherwise warm saline rinses, antibacterial mouthwash, OTC pain killers will provide relief.Ice chips around that area can be applied to relieve pain as that causes nerve numbness.Gap you are talking about between tooth and gum is filled with brownish substance which is called calculus which is a hard substance. Pain could be because of this as it builds pressure in that area. In that case subgingival cleaning/ scaling or curettage is treatment option. Wisdom tooth extraction is not an option for some people because of potential risk of complications so pain management is recommended in that case.Well its not an emergent situation.

The most common causes are H. pylori infection and GERD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. In GERD, the valve between the food pipe (oesophagus) and stomach does not function properly.  In H. pylori infection, there are several therapies available involving acid suppressants and antibacterials. The treatment of GERD includes the use of acid suppressants such as omeprazole or ranitidine sold under different brand names and ultimately surgical fundoplication, if necessary.  Drugs, particularly Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen also cause gastro-intestinal disturbances including acidity. Hence one should avoid using them.  Lactobacillus acidophilus/lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus lactis are all good bacteria that are used along with antibiotics. They are ingredients of many branded supplements. They are not likely to be of much help in reducing acidity.

Thanks, Saima","Doctor":"Hi...your swelling  is not going because  of pus formation  near root apex...There could be simple pus or a cyst filled with pus....If there is only abcess then RCT would solve  the problem  otherwise RCT  followed  by Apecectomy  should be done...A radiographer would revel the actual diagnosis. .."},{"Patient":"I had a tooth pulled last week because it was rotten and I thought it was making me sick.  I now have an extremely sore throat. And cough. Some sneezing.  My upper palate is all yellow. They did give me a numbing shot there. Wondering if this is normal? Before my tooth was pulled had a weird head tension and my limph nodes felt weird. My tooth wasn't hurting because I had a root canal there years ago. But the crown has since broken off and food and junk would always get stuck there. That's why it looked rotten. Figured it should come out. But now I feel worse with my throat. Thinking maybe I should go to urgent care?","Doctor":"Hi...that could be due to antibiotics prescribed for you...within couple  of days it would go by its own...All you can do is salt lukewarm  water rinses 2-3 times daily , it would help you a bit."},{"Patient":"I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed 4 days ago. A lot of the swelling has gone down. I only ever got pain on my lower left side wich was my only impacted tooth. It's been 4 days and Im still getting some pain and there's a hard ball in my cheek. It only hurts when touched and I can barely open my mouth or eat. Is it an infection?","Doctor":"Hi...Can understand your concern... First of all you should have not got all the 4 wisdom tooth removed in one sitting..You should get one removed at one time or two (one upper and one lower ) of the same side in one sitting..Now as per your question..You have pain in lower left side as it was the only impacted tooth, there must have been more trauma to that region while removing that tooth so it takes more time to heal and so more time for pain and swelling to subside... If you have a hard ball over your cheek it may be due to underlying infection and inflammation as well as mouth opening gets reduced due to same reasons..I would suggest you to take the full course of medicines which must be prescribed to you by your dentist and do mouth opening exercises like - Trying to open your mouth as much as you can under limits of pain toleration..-Other is try to take your tongue  out of mouth completely...These exercises will have an additive effect in improving your mouth opening along with medicines..If the condition still doesnt improve visit your dentist for follow up ..One thing you should NOT DO is that you should not do hot fomentations ( applying hot water bottle) over that area.. Cold fomentations using ice can be helpful..Hope you get well soon...Thanks and regards..Dr. Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 43 year old female in good health, exercise and at 5'3 I weigh 123 pounds.  Due to severe menstrual bleeding, anemia and unbearable pain and cramps caused by early onset endometriosis at 20 years old I  had my uterus, cervix and left ovary removed in 1991 and the remaining ovary removed in 2008.  I have recently began experiencing vaginal bleeding, it appears to be bright red and is increasing in flow and becoming more frequent.  I am also experiencing very low blood pressure which has been hovering around 80/47 and my pulse is also running low at around 67.  I have recently discovered I am anemic as well inspite of beginning a regimen of prescription iron supplements.  As if this wasn't provocative enough I have had 3 episodes of my chin, lip and bottom teeth suddenly and without explanation going numb.  It feels as if I have had a novocaine injection from the dentist.  It starts with a tingling lasts an hour or two then wears off just as if I had a dental procedure.  Then in early November 2014 I suffered from multiple seizures resulting in a diagnosis of  a seizure disorder for which I am now prescribed Keppra twice a day.  Any ideas on WTF???","Doctor":"Hi...The numbness is due to less conductivity in inferior  alveolar nerve hence giving you numbness...kindly consult neurophysiology regarding  this problem....orelse get the xray done to rule  out any lesion  below teeth compracing  the nerve. ."},{"Patient":"Im 25 years old and have 3 impacted wisdom teeth, along with one emerged but crooked.  Today I woke up with swelling in my gums in the back bottom left side of my mouth. We are leaving to go oout of town and have no time to fit the dentist in. I went to the doctor today for some possible relief. She prescribed me antibiotics and told me to take ibuprofen. 2 hours after I took the first antibiotic, the swelling went down and now it is completely normal besides slightly tender. Could something have gotten caught between my molar and gums and have it swell up so badly? Should I still worry about it?","Doctor":"Hi..Can understand your concern.The condition which you explained about your wisdom tooth appears to be \\"PERICORONITIS\\".It is at times very painful along with swelling of gums around and over the impacted wisdom tooth.With antibiotics , painkillers and warm saline gargles the swelling and pain subsides but may (not necessarily) reappear after a few days as medicines can give only short term relief.The swelling happens due to either deposition of food particles in between the gum flap and the wisdom tooth or due to continuous trauma to the gum flap by of the opposite arch tooth.The best thing you should do is to keep the area clean till you are out of town and can do warm saline gargles twice daily and take medicines as prescribed by your dentist.After you come back get your wisdom tooth evaluated by getting an IOPAR (x-ray) done to find out whether the tooth is impacted(impacted tooth does not erupt completely) or will erupt in proper occlusion.If it is impacted the best thing to do is to get it removed and if it can erupt to occlusion you can just get the overlying gum flap removed to get complete relief from the problem.Hope your problem get solved.Thanks and regards..Dr.Homey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"I have had a reoccurring toothache in an upper right tooth and just over the last day the roof of my mouth is swollen and painful to touch.

As far as the pain in the tooth associated with swelling is concerned, it is because of the tooth or gum infection. Nothing to be panic, consult a oral physician and get it evaluated.

It had very slight sensitivity to begin with , hence the filling but now after a week of nothing I'm experiencing terrible pain and sharp sensations when consuming anything cold and even when doing nothing (most of the time) . I've read that this sensitivity is common after effect for upto 2 weeks from the date of the procedure but I'm not sure why it showed up for me the way it did out of nowhere . Is there anything to worry about ?Thanks for your time","Doctor":"Hello,Post filling sensitivity can be common. Persistant pain to cold raises the concern that you may need a bite adjustment. Do you feel that you hit the tooth first when you bite down or do you feel the tooth gets in your way when you slide your teeth? Call your dentist to verify your bite and make a slight adjustment if indicated. Your dentist will check your bite for high spots with  a paper that marks how you bite down. Avoid chewing on the tooth, try to stay with a softer diet, brush with toothpaste for sensitive teeth and use fluoride rinses.If you have gum recession or inflammed guns around the tooth, this may be a contributing factor. Try the above suggestions. Be sure to continue good daily dental care and do not avoid cleaning the area.If you notice an increase in hot sensitivity and pressure sensitivity, this can indicate an abscess. Did your dentist warn you that the filling was deep and close to the nerve? Taking Antiinflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil may help reduce discomfort, but see your dentist to evaluate. A root canal may be necessary.If the filling is cracked or leaking this could cause cold sensitivity as well.Thank you for your inquiry.

It will take time to heal and may last 1-2 weeks. Avoid irritants such as acidic and spic  foods. Plan to keep on a soft diet, keep the area clean and rinse with warm salt water. Antiinflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil may offer some additional relief. Try to avoid chewing on that side. Benzocaine gels can be used to coat the area for temporary relief. Repeat episodes in the same location are possible.Infections can result in an irritation to the tissue. Abscesses can drain by creating a fistula tract. Swelling indicates the spread of infection. Antibiotic can be prescribed to control the spread of infection and a diagnosis will determine possible treatment such as a root canal or extraction. Wisdom teeth can become infected and are located in the back of your mouth. Infections require a thorough evaluation with XRays. You should visit your dentist to determine treatment necessary. Your described symptoms and having active insurance indicates that you should be seen by a dentist now.  Infections will get worse and be more complicated to treat.

Have you been clenching or grinding your teeth? This can cause TMJ dysfunction and muscle spasms that limit jaw movement. Try a soft diet and continue to take Antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin at regular intervals. Initial moist heat should help reduce symptoms.  If symptoms are prominent in the morning, you most likely grind at night. An occlusal guard can help stop this by breaking the grinding pattern   and muscles will not spasm. See your dentist to discuss your symptoms and look for clinical signs such as excessive tooth wear. The joint also has a disc that can be out of sync And cause jaw deviation. Diagnostic tests such as a panorex or cone beam X-ray can be considered to look for joint damage.Excessive damage to your teeth can result in fractures. A severe case could include a split tooth that often can be difficult to diagnose. See if you can isolate a single tooth on the right side. Some infections will take time for symptoms to pinpoint  the source. Swelling, pressure and hot sensitivity are all signs of an abscess. Have your wisdom teeth been evaluated or removed? Sinus, ear and oral infections can often cause mixed symptoms. You may need to check all areas to get a complete diagnosis.Thankbyou for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I have very bad decay in my front teeth I have tried fillings and they are no longer holding due to how bad they are my oral heigene isn't great and neither my diet as I don't have to worry about my weight so I don't worry about my diet I am on the urge of fighting to keep my son but could lose him over this would dentures be possible at this stage","Doctor":"Hi there. Thank you for contacting us. I understand that you could lose your son due to your bad front teeth and would like to consider dentures. I'm not sure how old you are, but dentures could be a possibility at any age. Depending on how many teeth are involved, you may be able to do a bridge, which suspends \\"fake\\" teeth between two good teeth and you won't have to worry about taking them out like you would for a denture. Another consideration is removing the teeth that are involved and put in implants. Implants are essentially \\"fake\\" roots that go into the bone and then a crown placed over the root. These implants would stay in more permanently and again, you wouldn't have to worry about removing them like dentures. In addition, implants can help save bone long term. I would discuss these possibilities with a talented restorative dentist and make an educated and informed decision on what your options are.

Take some Antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Advil to reduce symptoms. Look for initial signs such as a tingle. There are antiviral medications that can be effective if taken at early onset. Check if there is any type of ulcerated lesion. Stress can induce an episode. Track your diet or any change in products used. An allergic reaction is another possibility. While sleeping you may aggravate the side of your tongue with rubbing or dehydration that causes a sharp pain even if you don't see an actual bite mark.Your dentist can visually check for lesions or growths. The back side of the tongue is an area at higher risk for oral cancer, so seeing your dentist is a recommended choice to confirm that nothing new is now visible. There are blood vessels and salvia ducts that can also be visually checked.Consider having blood tests to check for any systemic disorders.

Is it normal for the white clot to come off? I'm paranoid that I'll develop a dry socket. I rinse often especially after eating. Am I far enough along now that I won't develop one?","Doctor":"hiaccording to the details which you have given me looks like dry socket. when the healing in under process, there will be a soft tissue covering over the extraction socket. After the extraction there is formation of blood clot- then there is white colour flim- pink color tissue and finally the gum formation.home care instruction:Avoid spicy food, it leads to irritationAvoid alcoholic and tobacco for a weekDo not suck anything, like ice cubes,etc, it leads to dislodgement of the clotAvoid having food from the extracted site for2-3 daysDo lukewarm saline mouth rinse 3-4/dailyDrink lots of water it will keep you hydrated.Consult your dentist."},{"Patient":"For the past year and half i have been in the process of getting dental implants in the area of #11 and #13 I have had many dental injections.  I found many of the procedures painful so asked for numbing for the implant exposure and subsequent try-ins, these procedures were within 6 weeks then the last two were within a few weeks of eachother.  Each time i received about 7 injections, some were not very deep, just around the area.  All the work is finished and now i notice my upper lip twitches sometimes.  It feels strange.  I am sure this is due to so many injections over the year and half procedures.  It has been about two weeks since i received the abutments and crowns.  Will this twitching subside in time?  I am 72 and a retired dental hygienist, retired 7 years ago.  Thank you for any advice.","Doctor":"Hello,Perhaps you have some residual inflammation causing your response. Time passage will tell for sure. Antiinflammatory medication may lessen the sensation. As you most likely know paraesthsia can occur with nerves being disturbed, cut, traumatized or damaged. This often lessens with time and normal sensation can return. I suggest patience and then consultation with a neurologist if the condition persists or definitely if worsens. This may be coincidental. Botox can be utilized to reduce twitching in some instances.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I Had  2 wisdom teeth removed 2 days ago and I was having a lot of pain , after he looked at my xray he saw my wisdom teeth were impacted and had to come out and it would ease the pain and said after examination they were infected and puss started coming out , he shaved off part of my tooth next to the wisdom tooth when trying to pull my wisdom tooth out, and its scratchy and rough and sharp","Doctor":"Hello,Wisdom teeth especially when impacted or partially impacted, can become infected. Removal and antibiotic treatment should stop the infection. As long as proper healing occurs, pain should decrease and you no longer should see pus. Take all medication as directed. Keep the area clean, rinse as instructed and see your dentist or surgeon for a follow up visit.If you feel a sharp or rough area, bring it to the attention of your dentist. This can be polished or may be part of your anatomy not noticed before. A broken section of tooth or filling is possible. An increase in pain may be an indication of a dry socket or delayed healing. This can be extremely painful. See your dentist for treatment and medication. Anti inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil can be taken, but you need to contact your dentist.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope that you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm a healthy 51 year old mail who is quite active and I'm wondering where the appendix is?

The appendix in the right lower abdomen to the right and lower area of the umbilicus, that is where you have got pain.The other reason for a fixed pain at this area can be typhlitis meaning inflammation of the colon or due to a stone in the right ureter at this level.

Can I treat my tooth abscess with ayurvedic medicine to get rid of the infection instead of antibiotics.  If not, then what kind of antibiotic is the least harmful to the gut flora YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello,you need to treat the source of the infection. When the source of the infection or abscess is a tooth, it can be treated with a root canal or removal. If the tooth has a gum infection or bone loss causing a periodontal abscess, it can be evaluated by a dentist for possible periodontal treatment or removal. Antibiotics are used to control the spread of the active infection, not a cure for a tooth abscess. You can use Antiinflammatory reducing means to help decrease symptoms, but you can not ignore the source. I prescribe the antibiotic amoxicillin as my first choice. Taking Acidopholus or probiotics help reduce gastric disturbances. Yogurt can be beneficial as well. Not all tooth abscesses require taking an antibiotic. Inquire if your abscess needs antibiotic or can be treated in a timely manner without the need of antibiotics.Thank you for your inquiry.

Taking Antiinflammitory medication such as Advil or Tylenol may help you to continue to heal.Consider scheduling a dental visit if the location and size are a functional problem or you continue to reinjure the area.

A bump at the roof of my mouth has just occurred. I have never had this happen before. Could this be from my sinus infection or is it pertaining to my teeth?","Doctor":"Hello,Bumps can from an infection. Location, texture, color, hard or soft are all factors that help diagnose the source. Hard bumps can be excess bone covered by tissue called tori that is not an infection. An infected tooth or periodontal abscess can drain and a pocket of infection can cause a soft bump. Sinus infection can drain into the mouth as well. Trauma can cause an inflammatory reaction. A growth, cyste or tumor is possible. Continue to monitor the area and note changes in appearance. Reporting symptoms of a long term chronic infection means your source is untreated and you need to confirm a diagnosis for treatment. Dental infections can change and localize with swelling.  I suggest that you schedule a dental exam to determine if you have a dental infection. Are you up to date on routine exams or do you have any broken teeth? Sometimes sinus and upper dental infections can be difficult to diagnose producing symptoms that could be either or a combined source. Your dentist will refer you to your physician if no dental source is determined.Rinse with warm salt water and take some Antiinflammitory medication. This may help control inflammation and cleanse the area until you schedule your visit. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Your C-Pap machine may be a factor causing you to breathe through your mouth or adjust your jaw position while sleeping. They can have a drying affect on your tissue and make plaque harder to remove. From your brief description, I am suspect of this. Review side effects and consider any recent adjustments such as a new mask, pressure? Are you sleeping well?Other factorssuch as your diet, other medications, allergies or sinus congestion may be contributing to your discomfort.Discuss all symptoms with your dentist at your next recall visit if symptoms persist. If your condition worsens, consult your dentist for an appointment. Make sure you keep up with good daily dental care. Try toothpaste for sensitive teeth and fluoride rinses. Keep well hydrated. Monitor your symptoms for specific areas of discomfort or tissue changes. This will help with your diagnosis.

I consult, to determine the amount of time needed to stop your medication, with my patient's physician before scheduling an extraction. Dental patients need to stop taking aspirin for seven days prior to an extraction to assist controlling bleeding.Are you planning to have a root canal? Did you have swelling and require drainage? Apply pressure to the area that is bleeding for 15 minute. Avoid irritants. Stay on your medication as prescribed and follow all instructions provided by your dentist. Call your dentist and ask specific questions about your symptoms to find out if this is unusual after your recent visit. Keep in mind a small amount of blood can mix with saliva and look like a greater volume of blood.  Remember, rinsing after an extraction can disturb your initial blood clot and promote bleeding or severely infected tissue can exhibit more bleeding.Do not stop your medication unless advised by your physician or dentist.

You indicate improvement. As long as this continues, do not worry. Gentle care and cleansing with warm salt water should be helpful. Antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Advil may assist healing by reducing your symptoms.

Monitor with follow up visits with your dentist. Look for changes that include swelling, redness and heat that would indicate an increasing infection. There are changes that can occur such as an infection or tooth abscess, periodontal conditions or allergic reactions. Please do not panic with only two days gone by. Expect two weeks for a large ulcerated area to heal. Avoid irritants.  This can be a sensitive area for injections in the mouth.

I have had endocarditis twice, in 2008, and in August 2014.  At the time of the valve replacement,  4 of my molars which had deteriorating fillings which were done during childhood, were removed.  My question is one which each of the doctors I have followed up with, the epidemiologist, heart rhythm, surgeon, have not given me the answer to the question I have:  If I have a replacement valve, do I still have mvp?  If so, why - that is what I don't understand.  How did I go 58 years with no problem with endocarditis, and for the first half of my life did not take antibiotics at the time of any dental work, and didn't acquire the disease until I was 58?  I live with the horror of the possibility of this happening again, and the fact that my new valve will wear out about the time I am in my 70's.  Can I undergo surgery for a third time while in my 70's? I am following everything the doctors have told me to do, including different methods and mouthwashes for my gums, which my dentist told me are very healthy at this time.  I don't think they were ever unhealthy, but my deteriorating fillings were causing me to use toothpicks constantly.","Doctor":"Hello,Please keep in mind that taking antibiotics prior to dental treatment is a prophylactic measure. Anytime there is bleeding, there is a chance that bacteria in the oral environment may enter the blood stream. Certain tissue and replacement valves are prone to affects of exposure to the bacteria.Consider having your oral bacteria analyzed to see your particular strains. Discuss this further with your dentist or visit a periodontist, gum and bone specialist. This is what I would recommend to my patient with your concerns.Your cardiologist should be able to discuss your condition with your dentist and advise if any additional precautions are necessary with your health history. Many surgeons require good dental health status prior to surgical clearance. I avoid nonemergency dental procedures for the first few months following surgery. Dentists follow a standard antibiotic prophylaxis regime prior to dental treatment. I follow guidelines set by the American Heart Association.Thank you for your inquiry.

About 3 weeks later I got a knot right below my jaw line it's about the size of a quarter and is very sensitive to touch. Is this an infection or something else?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The knot you are describing can be because of the tooth infection resulting in the formation of a cyst or osteomyelitis.

Does a clear MRI mean oral cancer has been ruled out?","Doctor":"Hi The lump in the area you have mentioned can be due to various resons . If you have been cleared off the 'ear,nose and throat' specialist ,its now the turn an 'oral' specialist to look into it . The lump on the gum is most commonly due to the tooth infection,which had spread beyond the confines of the tooth . There is also a possiblity of  a pocket ( an area of bone destruction ,mostly between the teeth ,where food lodgement can take place).presence of infection in this pocket (pus pocket ) can also lead to the same symptoms of feeling food being lodged and lump formation  .I advice you to visit a dentist to rule out  the above and for time being use warm water saline to rinse your mouth atleast twice daily and keep the area of your mouth (where the lump is present) clean . if possible use interdental brush and floss regularly .

Lipo and abdominaoplasty is an extensive surgery of the abdominal wall where-in many blood vessels and nerves will be cut as a part of surgery. In your case the cutting or stretching of the nerves cause numbness around the belly button. The appearance of the hard and darker appearance can be due to an organized hematoma or seroma, hence can not be aspirated as tried by your Doctor. I would advise you for a high resolution ultrasonography to see whether there is a subcutaneous collection or organization of the hematoma. Take Multivitamins for early recovery. Futher treatment will be as per the clinical picture seen on actual physical findings and that found on ultrasonography of the abdominal wall and the abdomen"},{"Patient":"My 8 yr old was just diagnosed with systemic mastocytosis . We know it is in the intestines. He has had bad abdominal pain for a month now. Blood dr a ppt. And allergist a ppt not for several weeks. No one is taking this seriously. What I read online states otherwise. Should we bring him to st Jude?","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to Healthcaremagic. Mastocytosis is a rare disorder consisting of too many mast cells in the body. Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Symptoms include fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, etc. The diagnosis can be made by bone marrow biopsy. There is no specific treatment for it and treatment consists of symptomatic medication. SO you should not worry about him and just take him to your doctor for treatment of his symptoms.

Is it anything serious ?? or due to heat the blood came ?? pls advice.Now the climate is getting changed from Summer to extreme winter and even now i experienced that problem. pls advise me and what foods must i avoid ?? and what is the reason for the blood. Thanks Monica","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,Blood in stools is not associated with hot climate or drinking cold water.Presence of blood in stools suggests some problem in the gastrointestinal tract.Most common cause of blood in stools is infection.Infection with certain bacteria causes blood in stools.Thus, a routine stool examination is required to look for evidence of infection in the gastrointestinal tract.In case there is evidence of infection, appropriate anti-microbial can be taken.If there is not infection detected on stool examination, you need to consult your gastroenterologist for certain investigations like stool for occult blood and colonoscopy.These investigations will determine presence of any disease in the gastrointestinal tract.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing fairly severe pain in my palate, right front tooth and up in to the septum.

I'm planning to see the dentist today. is there a chance my toothache has any direct connection to my recent activity at the gym?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The tooth ache has nothing to do with the gym activities. The tooth ache is because of the tooth infection secondary to decay. Nothing to be panic, consult a oral physician and get it evaluated.

Your doctor will identify the source of the bleeding . The source of most anterior bleeds can be identified using a headlight and adequate suction.Once the bleeding point is identified, cauterization—either chemical (silver nitrate) or electrical (hotwire or bipolar cautery)—usually provides definitive treatment. If cauterization is unsuccessful, anterior nasal packing is the next step.Nasal packing is the placement of an intranasal device that applies constant local pressure to the nasal septum which works by direct pressure, reduction of mucosal irritation, which decreases bleeding. hope this will be of some help to you . take care"},{"Patient":"dental filling from my 1st premolar tooth fell out and the tooth crushed afterwards, only the root remained in place.then i found out that my 2nd premolar tooth was deeply affected by caries from the 1st premolar.all my other teeth are completely healthy?the pain is unbearable.. so what i want to know is, what is the best home remedy for this horrible toothache and is it safe to take out 2 teeth at once? especially because one of them is a flat root.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for consulting HCMRead your query as you have deep caries in 2nd premolar tooth for that you can go for root canal treatment and afterward you can go for functional prosthesis (capping ) and for 1st premolar you can go for extraction if root stump is remained and extraction is safe procedure done under local anaesthesia .

I am pretty sure the dentist scratched my gums which is how this all starte.

Should I see an ENT and do I need a referral from a family doctor in order to see one in Ontario?","Doctor":"hello read through your query accordingly i must say that nothing to be worried in this case.It can be caused due to trauma( like fish bone or shell scratching through it)or any burns (while having hot food).or some constant irritation to that area.So I suggest you to meet p an ENT and get it treated based on the present clinical condition(as diagnosis said by me is purely based on your symptoms said by you treatment plan can vary depending on the clinical presentation).In the meantime I  suggest you to1)do warm salt water gargle(to increase healing)2)do tongue scraping(to avoid transfer of microbes of tongue to cause infection there)3)do chlorhexidine mouth rinse4)drink lots and lots of water5)have lots of fruitsand green leafy vegetables(to remove any deficiency and promote healing by itself)Besides all these stay cool and happy.COOL and HAPPY MIND can be best medicine for any disease condition of the body.Hope you are benefitted somethin =g from this reply.Have a Healthy Day!!!!"},{"Patient":"I have a bad tooththat has the front half broke off about 6 months ago or so and my whole face swelled up yesterday and I had a fever and very weak and now there is a pocket on my gums and green pus or something is leaking when will the leaking stop and its it bad to swallow it and what will happen if I dont get the tooth fixed?","Doctor":"Hi The condition you have mentioned along with the pus discharge is an indication of severe infection . Not only the fractured tooth needs treatment (root canal most probably) ,even the area around your tooth needs attention . It is a cumulative case of periapical infection with pus pocket ( since you are well aware that you have a pocket there too).

I was screaming my head off. know my right side is still swollen  I have a a rash all over my torso","Doctor":"Hello,Surgical extractions can result in swelling. You may have been prescribed a strong anti-inflammatory medication. If not, you can take one Tylenol and one Motrin to help control the spread of inflammation. This is a good combination to relieve pain and reduce swelling. Greater inflammation may relate to a large amount of infection or a very difficult, involved extraction. Realize infection changes the chemistry of the area around your tooth and this can alter the effectiveness of local anesthetics. Ask your dentist for more details about the sedation medication used for your extraction and details on known side effects.I am concerned that you report a rash. This can often indicate an allergic reaction. Where are you prescribed an antibiotic? Often after an extraction with a severely infected tooth, there will be a need for prescription antibiotic. Amoxicillin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic for dental conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications? Please stop any medications immediately that you are in risk of an allergic reaction. Inform your dentist. Otherwise, it is very important to complete prescribed medications at the correct dose and proper time intervals. Antibiotics need to be completed to be effective. Follow up with your dentist if you feel your condition is worsening and your medications are ineffective.Follow all post extraction instructions. Avoid irritants. After the initial 24 hours, be sure to continue to rinse your mouth with warm salt water.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you begin to feel better soon."},{"Patient":"I have what looks like, by sight, an extremely red and swollen roof of my mouth, including the gums and around the teeth.

With laser surgery there is often no associated pain. But post operative pain may develop  develop due to secondary infection or an ulcer."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 43 year old male but appear to have an NSGU. It was diagnosed as an ulcer and treated with dental paste. My first symptom was actually excruciating pain while urinatinating, and my Doctor didn t make any connection and has not appeared to have understood the condition. I was treated with several different trypes of antibiotics while results were pending but of course uktimately STDs etc were ruled out...which I d always been sure couldn t be the cause. Everything I can find on the web tends to refer to NSGUs in women, but as an uncircumcised male I know it could increase my chances of this or similar. The ulcer itself has been treated with a prescription dental paste and has improved somewhat. The pain in urination has almost gone at this point, a week after symptoms presented themselves. However, the reason I am writing is, while the oval ulcer itself appears to have improved, the skin around it on my glans now appears red, raised and irritated. I still have discomfort in that area but have started to feel a flight urge to scratch (which would hurt like anything!) which can usually be a sign of a wound healing. My question is, is it normal for a healing ulcer to affect the area around it? Could this just be increased blood flow? Obviously any anomaly on my glans is concerning, but I m so keen for this nightmare to be over...","Doctor":"Ulcers do have there origin from  bactria, virus and even fungus. Most of them are self limiting and heal with time. Non specifc Ulcers are difficult entities and if they are perisistent would require further investigation. first of all kindly mention the medication you are on presenty and also update us with your current medical status."},{"Patient":"I have what appears to be some calcium deposits below  the top of my gums poking through.  Rough on the tong.  I popped one of the deposits off through the gum and it was a hard, white deposit about 1-2mm and round.  Is this gingivitis?  I have been rinsing with hydrogen peroxide and using listerine since this became painful a week ago and have removed 2 with a dental pick.","Doctor":"White deposits your mentioning are calculus or commnly known as tartar. You would require a full mouth scaling in order to remove all deposits."},{"Patient":"I just got all four wisdom teeth taken out last Tuesday. The swelling has gone down and I am on antibiotics.

It is infront of the extraction site right next to the jaw muscle in the cheek. The underneath of my jaw is also swollen. what could this possibly be? Will it go away on its own?","Doctor":"Facial swelling in the area of the tooth extraction should be treated with heat after the first 24 hours of ice. Apply a moist warm towel to the area on a 20-minute on, 20-minute off schedule. Repeat as necessary.Rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) after meals and before bed. Do not use commercial mouth rinses.Even after a week or two of this regimen the lump/swelling doesnt subside visit your dentist for evaluation .Please remember complete healing doesn't occur for a few weeks to a few months following the extraction.

Any ideas what this may be?Thank you for your comments in advance,Fred","Doctor":"Unless the lesion is specifically examined, it would be difficult to attritube to any specific lesion.

He has gone through a recent 10 day of penicillin, the usual antibiotic, ending about 10 days ago.  However, now, in addition to pain starting up on his lower teeth area, the area underneath his tongue is also swollen.  I have recommended probiotic to help but what else can he do, prior to him obtaining health insurance next March?","Doctor":"In case of infection in his teeth its advisable not to wait for insurance.  These episodes of pain wont stop unless and untill the infection is taken care of by dental treatment. Infection in the teeth can be treated by Root Canal Procedure which I am sure your concerned Dentist must have advised you. And infection of gums needs to be treated by scaling and if needed flap surgeries which also I assume must have been mentioned by your Dentist. In short, getting treated is only the ultimate option before the infection results in loss of tooth. There are no medicines which can cure the infection of teeth as called as decayed tooth."},{"Patient":"So lately my jaw muscles have been really tight and painful. I've heard my jaw pop with movement, but yesterday it popped way worse than ever when I yawned. Now I have a hard bump on the out is of my lower jaw where my wisdom teeth should be. I also was eating a cookie just now and over the area with the hard lump there was a blister and it popped and a lot of blood came from it. Can you please give me some ideas as to what is happening.","Doctor":"According to the situation you have described it looks more like the partially erupted wisdom molar on your lower jaw. Which forms a pocket with the gums over it. This can get infected repeatedly as there can be food lodgement in this pocket. And this infection can lead to spasm in your muscles that help in chewing. You need to get an x- ray done to confirm the diagnoses. And if this diagnoses turns true you need to get your wisdom molar from lower jaw extracted which mostly will b done surgically. And also add a regime of antibiotics and muscle relaxants and pain killers."},{"Patient":"I have 2 sores on the roof of my mouth, it is swollen and red surounding this area.

Strep throat needs treatment with a prescription antibiotic and diagnosis can be confirmed with a tissue swab by your doctor. Viruses need time to clear your body. There are medications that can speed up healing if the virus is diagnosed early on. Keep well hydrated, use a benzocaine gel if the sores cause great discomfort. Anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil may help. Avoid irritants, acidic and spicy foods. Take balanced vitamins especially vitamin B12. Sometimes an oral yeast infection can develop in your mouth. Taking acidophilus can help prevent this occurrence. Treatment with the prescription anti-fungal, Nystatin, may be required. There are combination rinses available by prescription that can help healing and reduce discomfort. Viruses and step are contagious as well. Thank you for your inquiry.

This may result after extraction as patient tend to limit the mouth opening and chewing after the extraction. This results into spasm of the muscles in and around the TMJ as they have discontinued their function.

So for the past few months, the area where the teeth were pulled, white pus keeps coming out.  it builds up and gets swollen and he has to push the white pus out.  I did some research and it said that the white pus is actually dead white blood cells that couldn't fight the infection.  it also said that he has to go to a dentist to get the remaining white pus and then to be put on antibiotics.

I suspected for sinusitis. I did have a sore throat flu and fever couple of weeks ago which doctor prescribed an antibiotic for it. Then my fever and flu gone. But I noticed my nose not fully clear always feels congested but not runny. Few days ago I started having this very painful toothache which I can't sleep at night. It came and gone once in a while . I took a painkiller to ease the pain(paracetamol 500mg).I went to see a doctor yesterday afternoon and she gave me loratidine,pesudoeprine,piritone and flomist spray.But last night I still have a very painful toothache,and this morning again after taking all the medication the doctor prescribed 2 times (last night and this morning).I will go to another clinic for second opinion after this.For information I did feel a ittle bit pain when pressing the front face beside the nose(test for maxillary sinusitis).It is really painful although it come and gone once in a while.Any advice or recommendation? I was thinking of taking antibiotic for maxillary sinusitis for a week or so and monitor before meeting ent specialist.What do you think? Please help me doctor.Thank you.Abdul Rahman Halim.","Doctor":"Hello,Your tooth discomfort may very well be related to your sinusitis. This is not uncommon. Please be careful before introducing more antibiotics. You may need a change in the antibiotic or a stronger dose, if what you have taken has not been fully effective. Please consult your doctor before taking any antibiotics. Definitely take medication to reduce discomfort due to congestion. This will help determine if you have an issue with the tooth or it is merely a reaction to the inflammation caused by the congestion. Inflammation and the accompanying discomfort needs time to heal. Keep this in mind and try and reduce your discomfort while giving more time to heal. My suggestions are to use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, fluoride rinses, maintain good day dental care, follow a bland diet with no acidic and spicy foods. Your mouth may be acidic and this can cause a sensitive reaction at the gum line. This can be severe if you have root exposure or recession. You may also be breathing through your mouth with the congestion. This creates a harsh environment and dries out your tissue. Your plaque is much harder to remove. Please make sure you are well hydrated. Use of antibiotics can also cause a reaction such as an oral yeast infection. Taking acidophilus may prevent this. Other possible dental conditions may relate to grinding your teeth or a possible tooth with a fracture. You may continue to monitor the area and take an additional x-ray if your condition continues to rule out an abscess or other conditions.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you find my suggestion is usable and that you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"sir there is sudden increase in heart beat and on diagnosis my BP reading is 150/100.I had taken one tab by name olmezest h.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, BP reading is high, and u have to continue the medications, get ur complete blood investigations done to rule out other cause, its very imp to know ur age for the evaluation.

Now my front top and bottom teeth are hitting first and causing excruciating pain in gums and slight sensitivity.  What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,It is not uncommon to need a bite adjustment after a restoration such as onlay, crown or filling. Usually the new restoration is causing an interference. This often occurs on a movement from side to side called excursive movement. Please make sure this is checked and adjusted. From your description, this may involve other teeth than the tooth recently restored and still require further adjustment.Currently, you should stick to a soft diet. Give your mouth a chance to adjust. Take some Tylenol or Motrin, if necessary. Long dental procedures with local anesthesia can cause stress on the jaw. Do you grind your teeth? If so, do you wear a nightguard? You could consider purchasing a soft nightguard to reduce pressure on your teeth.. These are available we are dental supplies are sold such as your pharmacy.This may offer you some temporary relief.If your discomfort does not begin to  decrease with time, please consider having another clinical exam with a second opinion. This will determine if the restoration was done properly. If you have no contact with the tooth and your bite continues to feel off, the onlay may need to be redone.

Endodontist said there was no infection in the tooth he did the root canal on, but regular dentist prescribed antibiotic and muscle relaxer -- both of which make me nauseous, and make headache worse, and give me diarhrrea without helping at all with the pain. Am doing cold compresses every 15 min. and exercising jaw as much as I can.  How long will I have to go on like this and what more can I do.  I can't get crown on root canal tooth until I can open my mouth.  I also have bruxism.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The limited mouth opening and pain could be because of opening your mouth for long time and bruxism leading to disc displacement in the Temporomandibular joint. Consult a oral physician and get it diagnosed. You can take anti inflammatory drugs like piroxicam 20mg twice daily on first day and twice daily on next 6 days. You can also take muscle relaxants like chlorzoxazone. You can give hot fomentation over the joints. Do not eat hard things, do not open your mouth too wide. take soft diet. Give rest to the joint.For nausea and vomitting you can take an antacid like ranitidine and domperidone respectively.If all these wont work, then you have to get a splint done.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"My mouth is so dry at night that it wakes me up and I have to suck inside my mouth to collect saliva.

I have a deviated septum and wonder if that is causing my problems?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.As far as the dryness in the mouth is considered during sleep is quite normal. It is bacause of the lack of salivary secretion during sleep since there will not be any stimulus for salivary secretion unlike during day time. The other possible cause can be secondary to stone in the salivary gland or ducts. Nothing to be panic, if the dryness is too much you can use artificial salivary substitute like carboxy methyl cellulose(wet mouth gel), this can be applied over the cheek region that stimulates and produces saliva.But you need to consult a oral physician and take a opinion to rule out any other problems like stones in the salivary glands.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"hi,I am having a continous bout of bloating dyspepsia blurping in my stomach with irregular bowel movements ?

Even the nicotine chewing gums and lozenges. You are supposed to take sticky things following extraction. So try to avoid nicotine products to avoid complications.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"There are purple veins and yellowness in the back of my mouth.

Drainage as a first step is less aggressive. Ifthe condition does not reoccur and is not chronic, you may not need additional treatment. Conservative treatment as a first step is generally my recommendation.Injection of an antibiotic directly into the site is another consideration for treatment. Consider seeing another surgeon for a second opinion, if you are not comfortable. A thorough clinical exam with diagnostic test is necessary to give you proper recommendations, but do not feel forced to make a choice if you do not feel you have all the details necessary to make you comfortable with proceeding.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"For the last two days the inside of my mouth has been itching.

Rinse your mouth with warm salt water to soothe and cleanse. If you do not get relief or feel your condition is worse, see your dentist for an evaluation. A prescription anti fungal medication, Nystatin, may be required to treat a yeast infection. Other possibilities include viral infections will take time to heal. You should continue to avoid all irritants including smoking and alcohol.Consider your sleeping habits and congestion causing you to breath through your mouth. Any sinus concerns? This can dry out you palate and cause dry lips. Keep well hydrated.Any recent food changes? An allergic response could be responsible for this condition. Antihistamines can offer relief.

No I'm not in any pain as of yet. But recently they've started feeling like they're about to fall out. Why didn't i go back to get them taken off? I was traumatized by the ones that put them on and I'm now terrified of dentists. I don't know what to do. And every time i think about going to the dentist, i over think every little possibility. What if i lose all my teeth? What if they want to do immediate operation to get them out? What if i somehow die because of these? But i need advice. It's getting hard to chew and honestly the looseness is downright annoying. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,I suggest that you do make an appointment to see a dentist or orthodontist specialist for evaluation. My concern is with your overall periodontal health and how you have been cleaning your teeth. When was your last professional dental cleaning? X-rays would help diagnosis your condition and determine current dental needs. The spacers will need to be removed and I would hope this would be an easier procedure than your past unfortunate experience. Find a dentist that you are comfortable with. You can always make an appointment for an evaluation and decide not to proceed with treatment in that office if you are at all uncomfortable with the situation. Try to address your dental needs as soon as possible. With dental care small problems are always easier to treat. I strive to provide a comfortable experience for my patients during dental treatment. There are many techniques available in the practice of today's dentistry to provide you care with comfort. Please don't let this one experience compromise your dental health.Thank you for your inquiry.

I had a perio  cleaning, a molar extraction, and a bone graft implanted.  The dentist closed with stitches.  Because I had  a perio  deep cleaning on the other side of my mouth and have an aortic valve  surgery scheduled in a month, I have been on amoxicillin for 2 weeks and just finished that today.  Note that I do not get headaches.  Ever.       After the extraction, I have not had pain or  problems with the wound itself , nor fever or sickness, however, I have had a mostly-pressure headache constantly for the entire week, and it does not seem to be lessening.  It is not sharp like a migraine must be, but I  also seem to have a  light-sensitivity going on as well as the tension-type headache.","Doctor":"Hello,Your surgery is still considered recent and you are in an initial healing stage. It is not uncommon for you to experience some discomfort. Take anti-inflammatory medication and finish all medication as prescribed.Report your condition to your treating dentist. This is the best recommendation for evaluation post surgery. Upper extractions and surgery raise some concern if there is a sinus complication during the healing process. Do you experience any congestion in your sinus area?  This can explain a pressure headache. It is not unusual to experience a pressure sensation with a large amount of inflammation after multiple dental procedures. Again, anti-inflammatory medication may help you deal with this discomfort and your discomfort should continue to decrease with time. There is greater concern if you feel this condition is worsening.Thank you for your inquiry.

Since you have reported a recent trauma, I suspect you may have some nerve issues. Have you had an appointment with a neurologist? Inflammation can cause swelling and temporary pressure on nerves. Anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin may help reduce inflammation. Plan to schedule a visit with a neurologist if problems persist or worsen.A fall with trauma to the mouth can cause cracked fillings. If you have any metal fillings such as amalgam, this could be the cause of a metallic taste. Fractured teeth may occur at the time of an accident or months later. I suggest you consider a full dental exam with a complete set of x-rays. This may detect tooth problems and be a basis for any future problems to help a future diagnosis. Infections of the mouth and taste buds not functioning properly are other causes for a change in taste. I suggest that you discuss your condition and accident details with your dentist.I hope my suggestions are useful to you and your condition will improve."},{"Patient":"I recently had a root canal and the pain is HORRENDOUS!!!

Check for an broken teeth, bubbles along the gum and sensitivity to pressure and hot temperatures. A dentist can take an X-ray to evaluate tooth roots  and confirm a diagnosis. Take some antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Advil. You may need a prescription antibiotic if an abscess is present.You may grind your teeth and cause similar symptoms.

Any suggestions on what type of dentist I should see for help?","Doctor":"Hello,Your bite will need time to adjust to being out of balance. Consider returning to the dentist to recheck your bite and make sure there are no interferences especially with movement to the side. The extraction and difficulties with your bite may have stressed your jaw. The TMJ  may feel some pressure and strain that needs time to heal. Consider having an X-ray evaluation to check where the tooth was removed and the health of the root on the recently crowned tooth. Your symptoms could indicate an infection communicating with the sinus. The crowned tooth may need a root canal if an abscess is diagnosed. You can see an oral surgeon to evaluate the extraction area and look for an abscess. You could visit a root canal specialist, an endodontist, to evaluate your crowned tooth. A second opinion from a general dentist is an option as well.Take some antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin for relief. Try sinus Medications to see if your sinus feels better and the congestion is not tooth related. In this case, see an ENT specialist or your general doctor.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,My first thought would be to check for an oral infection that may contribute to these symptoms. Thrush or oral yeast infections can alter your sense of taste. Your tongue may appear red or have a coating. There may be an imbalance of the natural bacteria in your mouth.  Make sure to maintain good daily dental hygiene. Keep well hydrated. Take some acidophilus. Your dentist can prescribe an antifungal medication such as nystatin if necessary.See your dentist to rule out any active dental infections that require treatment. An abscess that drains will affect your sense of taste. Look for any broken fillings, swollen gums or bubbles on the gum that can indicate the need for dental treatment.Make sure you maintain a proper diet with well balanced vitamins. And imbalance can affect the oral environment. Gastric disturbances or an acidic condition have detrimental effects on oral tissue.  Your system is out of balance and it may take time for your mouth to re-establish a natural balance.  Consider further  evaluation of your salivary gland, saliva chemistry and taste buds function if condition persists.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you begin to feel better soon."},{"Patient":"I have been very light-headed and dizzy all weak with some mild nausea, and woke up this morning with an abscessed tooth swollen jaw and chin and under my tongue is swollen, could this be the reason for the vertigo?

I have quite a bit of pain in the last back tooth on the right side (which technically also may have been suffering the same problem as the one taken originally) but my main concern now is 1) there is a bubble/bump formed on the side of my cheek directly parallel to the remaining tooth.. 2)my cheek is still swollen.. so much so that I have difficulty smiling.. and 3) the back tooth is extremely sore when it is touched, any kind of liquid including the warm salt water solution I rinse with causes extreme pain... when the tooth was extracted it needed to be sectioned.. the dentist gave me MANY shots of local including atleast one that actually numbed my lower jaw (where some of my swelling is now) I would also wager a guess that my bump/sore is in the same general area where he was probably applying the needles.. it may also be that the remaining tooth could be rubbing up against it causing a very bad canker sore?? but the swelling is what really concerns me... I believe it could be infected as the dentist and the er doctor said, they thought it could be drainage.. the original reason I had the tooth taken was a bad taste coming from between the 2 teeth.. which was originally caused by trauma.. going to see the dentist tomorrow morning but I would really like to hear another opinion about this.. why is my cheek swollen all the way down to the jaw line when I had an upper tooth taken... 6 whole days ago... it was swollen to the point that my hair follicles were visible, looked like goosebumps.. what can I do to get back to feeling normal again","Doctor":"Heloo pt-First, fill an ice bag, baggie or even a surgical glove  with ice. Then, hold this ice pack against your face in that region directly adjacent to where your tooth has been removed.Leave the ice pack on your face for 10 minutes, and then leave it off for the next 20 minutes. Repeat this cycle for a few hours, or even all the way through the first 24 hours after your extraction.During the time frame 24 to 48 hours after your surgery, any swelling that's been triggered by the tissue trauma created by the extraction process should have come to a peak.

Treatment will depend on how much of the tooth is broken. Your tooth will require a restoration. Your dentist will suggest an x-ray to evaluate the extent of tooth loss and the health of the root of your tooth. An untreated broken tooth will usually continue to decay and can risk becoming infected. Avoid chewing on the broken tooth.  Stay away from extreme temperatures. You may be able to place a filling in the tooth. A crown or onlay will be recommended if a large section of the tooth is missing. If the nerve has been damaged, a root canal will be recommended before restoring the tooth.  There may be additional options depending on your diagnosis and your dentist will provide you details and options after a clinical exam.Thank you and I hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"I had an infected tooth for 28 years. It never showed up on the xray. I had a root canal in 2008 and the tooth is fine but I have an infection that will not go away. I finally convinced a doctor to treat with clindamycin. After 15 months the ifection is 95% gone but the clindamycin doesn t work anymore. What medication would you suggest? I am 62 years old, male, and take no other medications. My continuing condition is bacteria growing under my teeth that provide bitter taste, burning gums and makes me sick every day with headaches and sinus problems. I have almost no immune response to this particular bacteria.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The tooth infection can be secondary to the deposits below the gums leading to abscess formation resulting in pus discharge and altered taste. The medicines will work for a short period of time, if you keep taking you might develop resistance to that drug and it might not work in future. So consult a oral physician and find out the cause for tooth infection and also take an opinion regarding previously done root canal treatment. Mean while you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole combination. Do saline gargling.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"hi Doctor, I have a 4.5 year old baby boy and he has multiple cavities on atleast 8 teeth. recently he is diagnosed with having a eyesight of +3. he always complains about his ear itching and usually has a running nose. do you see any relation and do you suggest any mediaction? he is on spects now, but no specific mediaction for his teeth yet apart from brushing twice a day. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The decay involving multiple teeth can be a rampant caries secondary to improper maintainence of the oral hygiene and improper diet. The running nose and eye sight is not related to the teeth. Consult a pediatric dental surgeon and get the teeth filled. For the nose and eyes consult a ENT and ophthalmologist and take opinion.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I have really sore palette and headache .. I ve also got pressure in my ears .. The roof of my mouth looks yellow like there s infection there.. I am an oral herpes sufferer though so I m wondering if it s this , but I ve never ever felt this rotten before .","Doctor":"If it is a recurrent history herpes, you need to start on certain specific medication, for which you need a complete CBC."},{"Patient":"hi. just woundering...... im worried about my bottom teeth. for a few months my wisdom teeth have been trying to come through, im 25 , but there is no room. the pressure is horrible it comes and goes for a week or so every few months, but its done something to my front tooth, teeth. i hav overcrowed teeth anyway at bottom , one of my front tooth on bottom sits behind others always has but its moving more i think and now there is a bone like hard sensitive lump behind that tooth ? what is it. it has affected the way i bite and eat. is it my tooth pushing out from underneath. ??? please help is this costly ????","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain and swelling(lump)  could be because of the gum infection over the wisdom tooth (pericoronal infection leading to space infection).Consult a oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule the amount of space present for the tooth to erupt if space is there for the tooth to erupt then the gum covering over the wisdom tooth can be removed.If the space is not available then you have to get the wisdom tooth removed. Mean while you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole (if you are not allergic). The wisdom tooth might damage to the next second molar. so get it treated as early as possible. There might be movement of the front teeth because of the pressure from the wisdom tooth.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"i have one year without any medical control for my braces (for same problems) i took them of but my dentist didnt give me any retainer he said come after one month im scared that my teeth will move ...but maybe not bcs i had the braces one year without xontroling and they maybe had done the role of the retainer ??????","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The function of the braces is to move the teeth and align them in a proper way. The function of retainers is to maintain the moved teeth in position. If the braces are in a fixed and inactive state, that can act like a retainer. But it is better to wear retainers after removing the braces, if not the teeth will move back to its previous position.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"It s been 8 days since all 4 wisdom teeth were removed. They were all fully bonely impacted. I am still in excruciating pain. I went back to the oral surgeon on Thursday and he said I don t have any infections or dry sockets and wants me to see him again in a week. I just don t understand why I m in so much pain. The pain meds don t help me at all.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The severe pain after extraction of the wisdom teeth can be because of the excessive bone cutting during tooth removal or it can be because of the injury to the muscle while injecting local anesthesia. The other possible cause can be a sharp bony spicule left after tooth removal. Nothing to be panic, take an analgesic with anti inflammatory drug like diclofenac and serratiopeptidase combination. If the pain does not subside, even after this, then consult a oral physician and get it evaluated.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I had a tooth extracted which became infected, antibiotic taken, another tooth infected and was removed within same month. Now I have lost weight, have ulcer on my tongue and pus bags on front teeth, white blood count high and admitted to hospital for bone marrow test suspect leukiemia.. Could this be cellulitis instead?","Doctor":"It could be cellulitis. But you need to post your blood test levels. Kindly post ESR count if evaluated. Also mention your current medical ailments if any and age."},{"Patient":"Hi. I ve been suffering from bad breath for how many years now. It s so frustrating because I brush three times a day and even floss. I also have regular visits to the dentist. When talked to him about my problem, he said that my oral hygiene is fine. When I brush my teeth, it stays fresh for a about half an hour and then it starts to stink again. The stink isn t just from when I talk but when I breathe as well. I was hoping you could help me figure out what the problem is.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The bad breath or halitosis can be because of the gum infection or food lodgement, since you are telling your oral hygiene is good, the other possible causes of halitosis can be because of respiratory tract infection or gastro intestinal disorders. Nothing to be panic, consult a pulmonologist and gastroenterologist and get it evaluated. Mean while, you can use mouth wash containing chlorhexidine. I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"i have had pain on my right lower abdomin it started around my belly button and moved. the pain is getting worse i have a hard time walking onr beu=ing jarred at all. i have not hungry. i have no fever but i get hot then cold. i have gone to the er and at first they were not sure but now they are saying it was an ovarian cyst i have had ovarian cyst before and this does not feel the same.","Doctor":"Hi well come to HCM. Three things are possible 1 ovarian cyst,2 appendicitis, and a remot possibilities of diverticulitis and renal colick. Appendicitis, ovarian cyst, and renal colick you can easily differentiate with the help of USG. If your ovarian cyst was diagnosed with the help of USG abdomen there is no reason to doubt it severity may differ each time you get pain. Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had an eye tooth pulled and the dentist injected me 3 times one being right beside my nose. I have serious painin my nose now to the point that iI can t touch it. It is swollen on that side of the face also I have never had this happen before , what is it??","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain in the nose and the cheek can be because of the infection in the tooth which has been removed. Nothing to be panic, complete the course of antibiotics particularly, amoxicillin and metronidazole combination(if you are not allergic). You can take an analgesic like diclofenac for the pain. Do saline gargling.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I had a sinus lift/bone graft/implant six weeks ago, after suffering from frontal headaches and swollen cheek and a really bad taste in my mouth my GP put me on oral steriods for a week to reduce the inflammation. After six days of steroids the headache and swelling has just about gone but the bad taste in my mouth has remained especially after I have been lying down. My gum is now oozing pus from a small hole which had not healed from the stitches from the dental surgery. Can you advise....","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pus discharge from the gums could be because of the infection at the grafted site. Do not take steroids. You need to take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole combination. Steroids worsens the infection. Even the altered taste and bad breath is because of the pus discharge. Nothing to be panic, consult your dental surgeon and get it evaluated. get the area irrigated with saline and betadine.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"hi I had my top right wisdom tooth pulled and my lower right wisdom tooth extracted last Wednesday. im still having throbbing in the lower jaw and tenderness, also I have a salty taste in my mouth should I go back to my dentist? he told me to call him Monday but its throbbing","Doctor":"If there is any persistent pain, you need see your dentist right away. There is a possibility of localized infextion for which you should be clinically evaluated and xray taken if necessary."},{"Patient":"I got punched in the face about 5 days ago. It was an uppercut to the jaw on the left side. It wasnt until yesterday that i noticed any clicking but i felt no pain. The only time that i would feel it is when i would move my jaw side to side. I just woke up now and it hurts a bit but nothing absolutely unbearable. When i open my jaw wide i can feel a slight shift on my right side. It also hurts now to open wide.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain and deviation of the jaw, limited mouth opening can be because of two reasons.The first could be because of the disc displacement in the jaw joint secondary to the punch on the face. The other possible cause can be a fracture in the mandible. So consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. You need to take a radiograph like OPG to confirm the diagnosis. Later it can be treated accordingly. Till then, do not open your jaw too wide, take soft diet.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, i recently had my 4 wisdom teeth removed under anestisia and my swelling is gone and my teeth don t hurt but my jaw is locked and i cannot open my mouth more then 2 fingers, i am also still on antibiotics but i stoped the pain meds .. I am now also feeling shortness of breath, hot flashes, fatigued, weak and i get headaches frequently.. What is going on? I am a16 year old girl and i get tired walking from class to class and sometimes im to tired to talk to my friends on my way to class. What could be the problem?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The limited mouth opening can be because of the inflammation at the site of injection or because of the sutures. The other possible cause can be a disc displacement, if you would have kept your mouth open for long time during extraction.Nothing to be panic, Take an analgesic with muscle relaxant like ibuprofen and chlorzoxazone (if you are not sensitive or allergic). The weakness might be because of poor nutrition following extraction. Do saline gargling. Consume lot of water, take nutritious food. shortness of breath is not related to extraction. I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have a tooth that I was told needs to be pulled.  I haven't done so yet and I had a toothache in it for a day.  The following day I found a large bump on my gums right under the tooth.  It does not cause any pain but I have had it for nearly a month and it is not going away.   You can actually see tge lump on the lower oart of my cheek it sticks out that far.  The tooth has very little pain either however in looking at it it is clear it needs removed.  What could this bump be and will it go away on its own?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain and the lump over the gums can be because of the infection in the tooth and gums. Consult a dental surgeon and get the tooth removed. Mean while you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole combination(if you are not allergic). Then consult your dental surgeon or oral physician and  get the tooth removed as early as possible.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. im a 43 year old female. I had a dental implant that was failing and had to be removed. (tooth #13) The implant had caused me severe pain from the moment the crown was placed. I now have been suffering with neck pain, numbness in arms and hands and the worst is the vision problems. I have lost my depth perception and can no longer drive. My face still always feels like I have been punched. My ears make swooshing sounds. I have been for every test, CATscan, MRI... they all come back fine. The only thing I did find thru a D.O. is that I have no cortisol left (I have read that adrenal fatigue and long term dental infections go hand in hand). I m wondering if I could have a very deep sinus infection even though the CATScan was clear... or perhaps a deep dental infection. I have been take Kflex 250mg 4x p/day for three weeks while waiting to get in with oral surgeon. (he is going to assess me) Can a deep infection be causing the vision problems? or do you think the bones in my face shifted? my left eye and left side of my face go from pain, to numbness to just feeling strange . My left eye also changes shape a lot and sometimes gets very small. Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The loss of vision is not at all related to tooth infection, because the nerve supply to both the structures is entirely different. Regarding the numbness in the arm and neck is also not related to tooth infection. The dental implant placement or removal will not cause all these problems. It can cause pain after placement of the crown, if the crown has high points or if there is infection in the surrounding bone of an implant.Nothing to be panic, consult a oral physician and get it ruled out regarding implant.Consult an ophthalmologist and general physician for the vision and numbness in the arm and neck.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I recently had an exterpation of pulp on my top incissor tooth. I am going to have a root canal done on it soon. The dentist said the pain should subside in a day or two and It has now been four days and my tooth is still really painfull. Should I worry?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain can be because of the remnant infection in the root tip. Nothing to be panic, take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole for 5 days and analgesics like diclofenac. Later you can get the tooth treated with root canal treatment. Mean while get the root canal irrigated or cleaned with saline or hydrogen peroxide.

Usually it occurs secondary to stress or nutritional deficiency. Nothing to be panic, you can take a topical anesthetic like lignocaine and topical analgesic like choline salisylate.

Following extraction, the blood will get clot in the socket, then it becomes hard to form a callus in weeks, later it calcifies to become a soft bone.

It was permanently glued in and now that I am awake, the bridge is plain awful, ugly and to big for my mouth. The front teeth slant to the right, teeth are to big and it looks just terrible.

So far I am stuck with this nasty bridge. What do I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.I feel sad for your condition. The consent and permission will be taken when the patient is completely normal, responsive not while sedated.

I went to the dentist last week.  We set up a plan to start with deep cleaning of my gums.  Since my appointment and before my first cleaning, I have an issue with my back bottom tooth.  Last tooth.  It became very sensitive and painful.  I went this morning and am a bit frazzled since then.  My gums feel swollen. So I'm taking advil.  When the Advil wears off, the swelling is so bad I almost feel as though I can't open my mouth, I can but feels stiff from swelling.  She insisted I'm clenching my teeth.  Quite the opposite.

Without doing another x-ray, she wants to give me a large dose of antibiotics to see if it helps.  I am a very special case, allergic to most antibiotics.  Only one I've been able to take is a sulfa drug called Bactrim.  She said, wouldn't work on that type of infection.  Said she'd call pharmacist to see what they could give me.  Disappointed in no x-ray and that she was questioning my teeth clenching.  Advice please","Doctor":"Gums can become swollen as the result of inflammation due to poor oral hygiene. Since sticky plaque at the base of the teeth is what causes the gums to swell, brushing and flossing your teeth regularly, particularly at bedtime, can help prevent plaque from forming. Proper tooth brushing technique involves moving the brush in small, circular motions. Eating and drinking from dishes, glasses and eating utensils, which have not been properly washed and sterilized also transmit the bacteria that can cause gum disease."},{"Patient":"Hi, recently my jaw was hurting and could only open slightly (1.5 fingers).

Mix sea salt in a cup of warm water and rinse your mouth with the solution at least three to four times in a day. Especially rinse and gargle the solution after every meal.The sea salt solution will also help to remove the crusts and other debris that has developed around the pierced area.You can also use an antibacterial mouth wash.If there is swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, you need to be careful and immediately seek the physician’s advice.Use gentle tooth brush and take precautions that a food particle does not lodge inside the piercing area.Stop drinking alcohol and quit smoking as they prevent fast healing process.Yogurt helps a lot as it contains good bacterial flora.

It is this lactic acid that is responsible for eroding tooth enamel and causing tooth cavities.Food + Mucus + Dead Cells + Bacteria = Soft Plaque (within 24 hours after brushing)Soft Plaque + Calcium +Phosphates + Other Compounds = Hard Plaque (within 72 hours of soft plaque formation)Left untreated, the lactic acid will continue to erode the enamel and dentin and cause irritation of the nerve which is experienced as a toothache.A toothache (painful and tender tooth) is a late symptom of an untreated tooth cavity. Toothaches may also be caused by an infection, injury or the absence of a tooth.Jaw pain may also occur as a result of a dental cavity as the nerve supply of a tooth follows a path around or near the jaw. However,  jaw pain should not always be mistaken for a dental cavity as there can be other causes like TMJ dysfunction (temporomandibular joint syndrome), or more serious causes like angina or a myocardial infarction (heart attack).Jaw pain may precede, be accompanied by or follow after a toothache and this jaw pain may often radiate around the side of the affected tooth.

To treat the infection we were given amoxicillin and ibprofen for pain.

I am experiencing massive oral pain on the upper right side around my canine tooth. A little history: When a younger man in my teens (now 50yrs old), I a very bad head cold and sniffled very hard and heard a loud snap sound from my nose. Every since I have had constant sinus congestion and pain on the right side of my nose/sinus area. Over time, the pain moved down into my mouth around the canine tooth and I had to have the tooth remove and a bridge installed. Since then I have had massive swelling around the gum area and can taste a very salty rotten flavor in my mouth. If I create a suction in my mouth, I can sort of milk the substance out of my gums. Over time a lump has formed over the canine area on the roof of my mouth that is tender and sore. I have been to several maxiofacial surgeons and have twice had the tissue along the gum line cut open and my face peeled up so they could look around in the area just right of my nose. They have removed some scar tissue and scraped the bone, but have found nothing to cause the drainage or pain. I have had root canals done on all of my teeth in the immediate area, and have been to several ENT specialists (all of which can find nothing wrong with my sinus area) with no luck. The pain is usually unbareable and nothing (over the counter) even comes close to stopping it. This week I went to my dentist to get the bridge repaired / replaced, and he did some laser work around the gum area and stitched shut a hole (intentionally done by the surgeon to allow drainage) left by my last maxiofacial surgery 3 years ago. He felt the hole in my gum tissue was the cause on the foul taste in my mouth due to food getting trapped in it and his thinking is that by now (3 years later) it has most likely served whatever purpose needed.

I will be going to the dentist today, but I wanted a second opinion as to what could be going on. I had early signs of gingivitis in previous years, but have taken care of my teeth including brushing, flossing occasionally (not every day as I should) and using anti-gingivitis mouth washes. What could have caused the spread of such pain and bleeding in my gums over my molars in such a short time? Could it be related to my root canal?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The bleeding can be because of the gum infection, Nothing to be panic, get your teeth cleaned and maintain oral hygiene. once in a year you have to get your teeth cleaned.Regarding the sensitivity and pain in the teeth over the gum line, it can be because of the abrasion over the teeth because of excessive pressure applied over the teeth while brushing Or it can be because of decay in the next teeth. Please do take radiograph to confirm the diagnosis and later proceed with the treatment.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"my father recently had undergone stent angioplasty in main artery LAD which was blocked completely.

If there is any increase in the above said test values, then extraction cannot be done till it comes to normal.

Have the stitches be done properly? Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The flap just behind your second molar is normal after removal of the wisdom tooth. The flap might have sutured to the adjacent gums to close the gap. Nothing to worry its normal. Complete the course of antibiotics and do saline gargling. The flap will get fused or merged with the surrounding tissues in 10days. I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have recently had a tooth taken out. Two weeks later I had to go back to my dentist as my gums were noticeably swollen. My dentist confirmed this and redressed the area and gave me antibiotics. But I have also been experiencing head pains especially when coughing and sometimes when bending forward. I have seen my doctor who did not seem to worried about this problem but I did not mention about the tooth extraction. I have also recently had a bad cough. I have put the coughing pains in my head down to straining my head muscles. But although I now only cough occasionally, my head still hurts when I cough. I would like to know if my head pains could be linked with the tooth extraction or can I put the pains down to all the coughing.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The head ache what you are describing is a characteristic feature of the maxillary or frontal sinusitis. It is not related to the tooth extraction. The pain while bending forward will occur in sinusitis cases. Nothing to be panic, consult a ENT surgeon and get it evaluated. Meanwhile you can take the antibiotics and complete the course. You can do steam inhalation.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Had retreatment on root canal done several years ago on a very back upper molar.

(Currently out of my home area for work)  Fast forward 1 week and the crown broke in 2 and half of it came out.  Is there a rush or a concern that I should have to cause me to return home tomorrow rather then a week down the road to get a permanent restoration?  My dentist already stated he would warranty the crown prior to me getting the retreat as it is only 3 year old root canal he did.Thanks","Doctor":"Delaying a crown can provide an appropriate alternative in some situations. At other times, it might make the absolute worst choice. For this reason, you should never choose this option without the advice and concurring opinion of your dentist.In the case where a relatively serviceable, although less than ideal, filling already exists, postponing a crown may make a reasonable approach."},{"Patient":"Hi I've got what I believe is a mouth ulcer, two in fact.. one on the inner part of my lower lip and the other on my upper gum near just above my teeth..

I now have severe headache on my forehead and top of my head, its gradually worsening and keeping me up. What could the headache be from?","Doctor":"Heloo pt-The most likely explanation to your symptoms is that the nerve inside the tooth may be inflammed.  This can occur when the cavity and therefore the filling is very close to the nerve inside the tooth. The condition is called irreversible pulpitis and the treatment is root canal therapy.  There are simple tests a dentist can do to confirm this diagnosis.  The radiating pain you are describing is not uncommon with inflammed or infected teeth."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had been suffering from anal fissure for the past 4 months.

But the doctors suggested I should go for Lateral Sphincterectomy. I was operated 3 weeks back.

Some treatments may lead to healing of leukoplakia, but do not prevent relapse of the lesion or maliginant change. Regardless of the treatment used, a diagnosis of leukoplakia almost always leads to a recommendation that possible causative factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption be stopped, and also involves long term review of the lesion, to detect any malignant change early and thereby improve the prognosis significantly.Removal of possible predisposing factors and reviewBeyond advising smoking cessation, many clinicians will employ watchful waiting rather than intervene. Recommended recall intervals vary. One suggested program is every 3 months initially, and if there is no change in the lesion, then annual recall thereafter. Some clinicians use clinical photographs of the lesion to help demonstrate any changes between visits. Watchful waiting does not rule out the possibility of repeated biopsies. If the lesion changes in appearance repeat biopsies are especially indicated. Since smoking and alcohol consumption also places individuals at higher risk of tumors occurring in the respiratory tract and pharynx, \\"red flag\\" symptoms (e.g. hemoptysis - coughing blood) often trigger medical investigation by other specialties.Surgical removalSurgical removal of the lesion is the first choice of treatment for many clinicians. However, the efficacy of this treatment modality cannot be assessed due to insufficient available evidence. This can be carried out by traditional surgical excision with a scalpel, with lasers, or with eletrocoutery or cryotherapy. Often if biopsy demonstrates moderate or severe dysplasia then the decision to excise them is taken more readily. Sometimes white patches are too large to remove completely and instead they are monitored closely. Even if the lesion is completely removed, long term review is still usually indicated since leukoplakia can recur, especially if predisposing factors such as smoking are not stopped.MedicationsMany different topical and systemic medications have been studied, including anti-inflammatories, antimycotics (target Candida species), carotenoids (precursors to vitamin A, e.g. beta carotene), retinoids (drugs similar to vitamin A), and cytotoxics, but none have evidence that they prevent malignant transformation in an area of leukoplakia. Vitamins C and E have also been studied with regards a therapy for leukoplakia. Some of this research is carried out based upon the hypothesis that antioxidant nutrients, vitamins and cell growth suppressor proteins  are antagonistic to oncogenesis. High doses of retinoids may cause toxic effects. Other treatments that have been studied include photodynamic therapy."},{"Patient":"For the last two days my upper gums have be hard and swollen.

All this is starting to cause me some anxiety","Doctor":"Heloo.pt-The first step in treating gingivitis is to have the teeth thoroughly cleaned by a dentist. The tartar that led to the condition cannot be removed at home, so a cleaning is necessary. This cleaning will probably be a bit uncomfortable, especially if the gums are already irritated.Using an antiseptic mouthwash will also be part of the treatment following the cleaning. This mouthwash will be effective in clearing out any remaining bacteria.

Beginning a new vitamin, drinking more hot coffee, drinking more soft drinks, increasing alcohol consumption, having recently been on an antibiotic, or having had recent dental work are other causes. Basically, you must do a thorough \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" inventory to see if there has been ANY change in what you put in your mouth.2Discontinue any possible causes that you have defined. This should significantly improve your mouth soreness within 3 to 5 days.3Practice good hygiene. Improve your symptoms and speed recovery by practicing good mouth hygiene and avoiding trauma. Rinse your mouth 3 to 4 times per day with a salt water solution--not a mouthwash. The goal is to allow the mucous membranes to heal, and mouthwashes can be irritating. Avoid traumatizing foods like peanuts, chips, hard candies, hard vegetables and tacos as well as chewing gum. Use a soft bristled tooth brush. To numb your mouth, you can gargle with a mixture of an antacid and elixir of diphenhydramine.4See your doctor. If you cannot isolate a cause for the stomatitis, if it has not cleared in 3 to 5 days, or if it is interfering with your ability to take fluids, you should consult your doctor. This is important because there are many illnesses, some serious, that can cause stomatitis. Your doctor may need to do testing or prescribe specific medications.5See your doctor if you have recurrent ulcers. These small ulcers can be exceedingly painful, particularly if they occur on the tongue. They respond well to cauterization.6Treat angular chelitis (cracking at the corner of your mouth) with a mixture of an antibiotic cream and 1% hydrocortisone applied frequently during the day.

Can you see a 1mm. wide, deeper pink line of gum along its' edge up against your teeth?There are many cause of pink band around teeth.....Bleeding is likely to be obvious if you use floss between your teeth.Flossing is useful to get out bits of meat caught between teeth, but may not adequately clean away plaque.You will be able to cure mouth pain from gingivitis. Gum disease responds well to careful cleaning. This is also true if the apparent cause is drugs for epilepsy.Severe lack of vitamin C causes scurvy, with bleeding gums from gingivitis.

I'm also in tremendous pain in my jaw, ear, neck & gums on that side. The Dentist put a crown on about 3 weeks ago  only to find out a few days later that a root canal would need to be done. Last Friday he drilled through my new crown & started the root canal.  He was able to get 2 roots done but after 1 1/2 hours in the office, he couldn't get the 3rd one out because it was curved. He gave up on it that day & sent me home w/some pain meds & antiboitics. I went back this past Tuesday to try again. The shots were even worse & very painful; like he went in the same sore spots? With \\"much effort\\" he said he finally got it done. On Friday (the first & partial root canal) the numbness went away after a few hrs but lots of soreness from the work. Tuesday's completion of the root canal is steadily getting worse. I called them on Wednesday pm to report issues & they said to call back if not better by this Friday. If these meds don't soon kick in I don't know if I can stand it tonight.I will definately be calling them tomorrow am. What all is going on?","Doctor":"There are three possible causes for the numbness:1. A direct strike on the inferior alveolar nerve during injection. This is a random chance event. The numbness will go away in 6-12 months. There is NOTHING you can do in the meantime.2. Overfill of the root canal, impinging on the nerve. This would be a rarity, but easily seen on x-ray. The remedy would be surgery to the root end or extraction.3. Severe post-op infection putting pressure on the nerve. This is very rare.

I have gone through your query.The gap between the teeth can be treated with retainers. Get a new set of retainers and get it activated. You have to wear this for 2-3months. Once the gap is closed, then you can get a permanent retainer done on the inner aspect of the teeth, so that there wont be any relapse further. It is better to get a permanent retainer done and this is the permanent solution. These retainers are fixed along the inner surface of your teeth so that it will not be visible outside and it is just a small wire that is placed over the teeth unlike the removable retainer, where it comes as a plate.I hope my answer will help you.

I have gone through your query.If you are allergic to lidocaine, you can get the treatment done under other local anesthetic agents like mepivacaine or articaine. Most of the time people will be allergic to the preservative(methyl paraben) used in local anesthetic agent not the lidocaine. So you can use a local anesthesia without the preservative.

If there is grade 3 recession and grade 3 mobility you cannot go for orthodontic treatment. Consult a good ortodontist and get it evaluated. You need to take a radiograph  like OPG and IOPAR to check the status of the surrounding tooth. If there is a mal oclusion, causing damage to the teeth, then it has to be corrected with orthodontic treatment. Orthodontist will decide whether the treatment can be done or not. If you have a gum problem, it can be treated with scaling, root planing and grafting.

These were at first large as I had tonsillitis, but after antibiotics, they got smaller and stayed that way. However, 2 weeks ago, I went through a simple sore throat and noticed 2 irregular lumps on both sides of the jaw, and both underneath it, on about 4cm in size and the other about 2 cm in size. I decided to monitor these, and they have been getting smaller (after 2 weeks, the smaller one is approximately 1 cm in diameter, and the other about 2) They are both still irregularly shaped and hard, but moveable. The problem is that I am a hypochondriac, and and I have been squeezing the nodes in all palpable areas very hard, and new lumps have been popping up. These seem to enlarge up to about 1cm overnight and then stay that way. They have only done so in the groin however, but new ones apppear all the time. All the other areas of the head, neck and under the armpits are clear. The nodes in my groin are smooth but painful, but not to touch I have been cycling a lot and my legs have been sore, could this cause such enlargement?. The lumps under my jaw are painless. I am only 15. I am suffering no other symptoms. So, I have a couple of questions: Can this be lymphoma? None of the lumps are getting larger. And is it physically possible for an infection or malignancy to spread from under the jaw to the groin without affecting the lymph nodes in the clavicle and neck?","Doctor":"It more so looks like Local infection in that area. Even upper respiratory tract infection can give rise to the same. If it is a persistent problem then it would be better to approach a specialist for further investigation and opinion. Malignancy does not metastise to groin so quickly."},{"Patient":"hai Vijay kumar MB age 30 I have bad breath problem since 10 years i have consulted so many doctors. no results. recently i met ENT Specialist in apolo hospital after check up he told me 2 reaons for this  1. back side of my tougue (yelloyish) he gave me advice to clean tongue with Tooth brush i tried since 6 months no results Yet last i left the option tom remove my tonsils so pls advice by removing my tonsils will it solve my bad breath problem -- YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Halitosis or bad breath could be attri uted to several reasons, local apart from the tongue you mentioned, get a proper scaling done, if your ENT specialist ruled out any infection, consultant and get yourself evaluated for GI upsets."},{"Patient":"hi i had surgery to take a wisdom tooth yesterday and i was better later that day and today like at 1 or so in the morning i felt like there was more tounge skin under my tounge and then now i can t swollow or talk can you please tell me why this is happening.","Doctor":"Hope your taking proper medication after surgery and followed all precautions after surgery.

Usually the alveolar ridge resorbs gradually resulting in a narrow ridge, which is more prone to injuries. Consult a good oral physician and get it diagnosed. If there is a sharp ridge or any undercuts, then get alveloplasty done. If it is because of the sharp denture borders, then get the dentures smoothened or replaced(since it is 8 year old).

Current problem: Last September, 2009, I developed a weird taste in my mouth, something like dirt, but not quite. An earthy taste. It soon developed into a â??burningâ?? tongue. The tongue is irritated and â??burnsâ??, worse at night than in the morning. The tip and front edges are the location of the worst of it. My lips sometimes burn as well, on the front inside. I first thought perhaps it was dental, due to the taste, and had my dentist do a total workup. Nothing. Then I thought maybe it was a pharmaceutical cause and talked at length to my pharmacist. We eliminated most everything I take and I got no relief at all. Then I began trying to eliminate possible foods : caffeine, tea, (I donâ??t drink coffee or alcohol, or eat chocolate as they all trigger migraines), eggs, salmon, and never noticed any difference. I saw a second dentist for a second opinion, and he checked my saliva and all other aspects of my mouth and saw nothing unusual. My OBGYN put me on different hrt on the off chance that that was the culprit, nothing. I have done immense research on the internet and find that â??burning tongue syndromeâ?? shows up among mostly post menopausal women, but nobody seems to have come across a remedy. On the chats that I have seen, people say it sometimes goes away in 5-7 years. By the end of a bad day (some days are not as bad as others) my tongue is painful, swollen to the point of being able to see the teeth imprints on the edges, and my speech can be impaired by my enlarged tongue.

This can occur secondary to your malaligned teeth, where you cannot brush your teeth and maintain oral hygiene.If I am your treating doctor, I would advise you to get the teeth cleaned (scaling and root planing) and use topical gum astringents like stolin gum paint.Regarding your mal aligned teeth, you need to take a radiogrpah like OPG and lateral cephalograph to check the status of the bone and teeth.If sufficient bone support is there, then you can get the orthodontic treatment done by consulting an orthodontist.Consult a oral physician and get these things ruled out."},{"Patient":"i seem to have large bumbs on the back of my tongur like enlarged taste buds i searched the net and it could be enlarged circumvallate papillae. the reason why it causing me problem is becuase everything tastes bitter to me things like sodas and even water","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.Enlarged circumvallate papillae usually occurs due to few factors including hot and spicy food, gastro esophageal reflux and some infection, excessive smoking and canker sores.You should not worry as it is a not a condition which is dangerous.Maintain a good oral hygiene , reduce hot and spicy food.

Usually after starting the root canal treatment the swelling will reduce, because the puss will drain through the access cavity preparation through the tooth. So, it is not normal to have swelling after starting root canal treatment.

If you have had any ear,nose or throat infections before you started experiencing such gags then there is a high possibility that any such infection would have irritated your nerve and if not also you should consult a neurologist and get yourself examined.

Actually when a tooth is split in 2 halfs then the treatment depends on two things, if the split is extended till the gums then you have to go for extraction of tooth , as there can be further infection.

Usually such pain arises when the infection spreads below the roots and thus in that case pain can be manifested both while biting and also on opening of the jaw.

Will the bone grow back?","Doctor":"I would like to know if you have had any incidence of trauma previously? If not and its an infection by itself then the reason can be the position of the tooth is such that there is constant trauma to it by your lower tooth which has lead to such a bone loss and infection or it could be an infection of the supporting tooth structures by inadequate brushing in that region without any trauma. In either case if adequate support is remaining then the tooth can be saved though if trauma is present you will need to get tooth position correct by braces and only then any gum surgery would help. The bone wont grow back but bone grafts can be added to support your tooth which again would depend on the condition of the tooth which can be seen by your dentist. Though if you are told that the support  is such that it has to be removed then at such a young age you can go for a dental implant immediately to restore that tooth which good esthetic results which will be as good as your lost tooth.

It is not a lot of blood, but is definitely there. should I give it a day or 2 more or do I need to contact my doctor?","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCM Read your prob, as per your history you have been suffering from amebiasis, you should get stool examination , CBC. consult with your doc n start proper treatment. take plenty of liquid for avoiding dehydration."},{"Patient":"sir,my child name -Aviraj, Age-12 Years he is suffering the problem dentiral cyst in left lower joy from 2007, i operate as concern in max hospital in 2007,but the problem again develop and we reoperate in 2009, but sir, it will again reseen.Please advise me -what can i do","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for consulting with HCM.Actually it can happen only in cases when complete removal of cyst is not done and a lining is still left, which causes re- occurrence of the cyst.Even it can also be possible that the diagnosis has not been made properly and thus the treatment is also wrong.Better that once you should visit an oral pathologist and then an oral surgeon, as a confirm diagnosis will be made by oral pathologist and complete treatment will be done by oral surgeon.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"Good day, I am experiencing severe tooth pain, probably 7/10.  The standard 400mg motrin, 1000 mg tylonol mix isnt working (offset every 4 hrs) I have darvaset prescribed and have taken one, but am not sure if I can take another.  Time frame of meds is as follows:1000mg Tylonol  630pDarvacet             1030p","Doctor":"Tylonol and darvacet have the same active agent you can take tab Diclomol for your relief but i would not suggest you to rely on these medications for tooth pain. Any pain in tooth arises due to an infection in the tooth which usually is a dental decay or a gum infection in either case medication only temporarily subsides your pain and the problem recurs again after few days in worse manner so much so that it is not possible for the dentists to save the tooth. So for any of the patients with dental complains who are reading this if you know over the counter drugs you can take it to relief yourself of pain but do visit your dentist immediately to get the cause corrected at an earlier stage. You like your teeth don't you !"},{"Patient":"i had my left wisdom tooth extracted, yesterday. Now when i touch the Lips and the lover portion, am not getting much feel of touch. doctor suggested that it can be because of the nerve injury, as he had to cut some bones during the process of extraction, How long will it take for the nerve to regrow","Doctor":"Yes it will heal but it will take a minimum duration of 4-6 months depending on the amount of damage for complete healing. You can take neurobion tablets which are multivitamin b-complex tablets and would enhance the healing. Though it will take sometime for complete healing you will start getting your sensation back earlier. And it happens in many cases so don't worry about it. Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a question I was born with a cleft lip and palate. My mother is epileptic and took anti-seizure medication when she was pregnant with me. Cleft lip and palate does not run in our family.

I am also running a fever. I have recently gotten over a cold/URI, and finished two rounds of antibiotics. On top of all this I have other symptoms. What made me notice the bumps was that I felt like I had a hair in my mouth. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for consulting with HCM.Actually at the back of the tongue there are some taste buds, which are known as circumvallate papillae, and they are slightly elevated from the normal tongue, so they are slightly uncomfortable and noticeable.So there is nothing to worry about it.But if the symptoms persist for a long time then you have to visit a good dentist for complete diagnosis.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"I have a weird feeling inside my cheek. It started about a month and a half ago with a slight soreness in throat. My jaw has had a slight pain from time to time as well. I have dipped smokeless tobacco for about 4 years after quiting for 3 years. I usually dip twice a day. The feeling inside cheek doesnt hurt, just comes and goes and feels different than the other side. Havn t had any different things show up in my mouth except a small white bump 2 weeks ago that went away. I went to doctor about throat, said they thought it was allergies. Should I be concerned or visit my dentist, who I saw about 2 months ago before this started happening?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome.Thanks for sharing your concern.As per the history posted here it appears that there could be a lesion developed in relation to your cheek.This could be leukoplakia.What is the color and extent?Did you notice it carefully?In my view you must get it examined once so that any kind of developing lesion can be detected and controlled.Since there is no pain please do not ignore it.Also tobacco is not good for health.So please discontinue this habit.Hope it helps.Thanks.Take care."},{"Patient":"ive got a reacurring infection in the gum on a molar, ive used antibiotics they help get rid of it nearly to the point where its fully gone but I run out and it comes back within a week, is there any antibiotics that will completely kill the bacterial infection completely, so far ive taken clindamycin","Doctor":"Thank you for your query,From the symptoms which you have written, I can presume that you have gum over your tooth which is getting infected again and again.This condition is called pericoronitis, in which there is infection of the gum over the wisdom tooth.In such scenario, the infection is due to the food accumulation between the tooth and overlying gum. Antibiotics will help in getting rid of the infection time and again. You can take a course of Metronidazole, this will help.Also consult your Dentist who will be in a better position to suggest remedy for this which include, resection of the gum by lazer, to name a few."},{"Patient":"I am a 19 year old female. I take good care of my teeth everyday. Three days ago my gums began hurting and swelling on one side of my mouth it has now spread the entire way across my top gums and is starting on the bottom ones. What could cause this and do I need to see a doctor?","Doctor":"Do you have complains of food lodgement in your teeth and gums and have your gums ever bled? The reason for you gums to flare up like this can either be due to an infection, allergy or hereditary reasons. If you have been taking good care and have had no complains before then it may be infectious and hereditary presents with painless growth and so i feel it could be an allergic cause which may have started due to some food which you had in recent past or just in case if you have tried a new tooth paste or a mouth freshener. You can take a simple anti- allergic like cetirizine which wont harm in either case and report to a dental specialist to get it examined."},{"Patient":"On my left side of my mouth above my second molar there is a bump about the size of a pea that is very sensitive to pressure. When I press on the bump if feels as if I m trying to pull out my molar. Any idea what this bump could be. About 5 years ago I had a filling done on this tooth. There is no pain coming from the tooth though. Only pain from the pressure of the bump. It s getting to the point now that when I m eating occasionally it will bother me.","Doctor":"The bump in that region suggests that you are having an infection below that filling that you got five years back which is spreading to the roots and forming pus there. Usually this can arise when the decay spreads below the filling and we call it secondary caries. Though its not bothering you much now i would suggest you to get an x ray of that region that would clarify it and then you would require a re-filling with a root canal treatment. Don't be deceived by the painless nature of it as it may grow any time and get it treated as soon as possible.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, Tonight as I was making dinner, my tongue and the roof of my mouth started tingling.

I than started feeling quite weak, and within about 30 minutes I was nauseous with a head ache. I NEVER get headaches! I am 30 years old. Is this something I need to worry about? Thank you, I do hope you can offer some input.","Doctor":"Can you elaborate on any dental treatment that you ever got done, and has any member of your family had any similar symptoms or medical complains? If you haven't got any dental treatment done before and with the kind of symptoms that you are giving which is confusion, headache etc it suggests a neurological problem rather than related to dental,though the problem may be minor so you need not worry and better consult a neurologist as early as you can, because sometimes due to minor lesions in brain such seizure like symptoms may be seen. And the earlier you rule these out and start taking medications for such a thing the better.

The dentist confirmed the tooth was dead (no sensation), and then drilled it and cleaned the roots a little.  He left a hole filled with cotton to let it drain for 7 days while I wait for the final root canal appt.  Is there any danger to having cotton in the hole and draining this way - i.e in bacteria migrating up the cotton filled drainage port?  Also, the back of my head is tender where this root is emanating, and my neck is stiff ..... and I feel weak/tired -  how dangerous is it to wait for this procedure?  I've been on antibiotics since having this procedure -still 2 1/2 days until the final procedure.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The cotton kept after the cleaning procedure in a root canal treatment is common. It is done when the canal is not dry and when there is still pus discharge even after cleaning. In that situation a medicated cotton pellet will be kept for 3-5 days. Nothing to be panic, Complete the course of antibiotics, the infection will come down. The stiffness in the neck is not related to this.

I am concern now because i am a dibetic.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The swelling is because of the extension of the tooth infection to the tissue spaces(space infection). The amoxicillin alone will not be effective in this condition, you need to take a combination of amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Mean while you can start up with root canal treatment. Once the canals are opened the pus will reduceand swelling will come down.

Anyhow if i didn t brush them properly and there is still mold on them, can the mold grow oral, and if so can it cause bad breath, and what can I do to prevent that?","Doctor":"Hello,Mold may have spores that are difficult to remove. You need to soak these in denture cleaners. Brushing alone is not adequate. For resistant fungal infections with denture patients, soaking the appliance in bleach with a one part bleach and 10 parts water ratio is recommended for 10 minutes. Boiling can be required. A Nystatin rinse may be prescribed by your dentist, if necessary. Fungal infections can develop in your mouth. I recommend that you check with the Invisalign manufacturer or you dentist before using bleach on your trays. Trays are made from a custom impression of your mouth. Your mouth changes with time as your skull continues to grow throughout your life. These may not fit adequately. Are you up to date on your dental cleanings? Consider scheduling a visit and bringing your cleaned tray to see if the fit will allow you to continue treatment. Bad breath often indicates gingivitis and requires a dental cleaning to help eliminate this condition and avoid progression to advanced periodontal disease. Other serious dental conditions or diseases can affect your breath. Your dentist will assist you will a diagnosis at your dental recall visit.thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I haven t been to the dentist in a year and I know that I have cavities between several teeth because I can see them. 2 teeth are very slightly sensitive, but not to hot or cold.

I have stopped that habit recently though. What are the odds of me needing a root canal? Will my cavities be deep?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, i have gone through your query.The chances of the spread of decay from dentin to pulp cannot be predicted. It can take months to years...If the decay is too deep or approximating pulp then it can involve pulp in 5weeks. If you think of insurance and delay the treatment, you might end up to go for root canal treatment rather than normal fillings.So i advise you to go to some educational dental institutes and get it reatored.

Heart surgeon wants her off Coumadin fir 5 days  before dental surgery..PCP says no, stay on it. Any thoughts on stay on or off Coumadin","Doctor":"Hello,A very thorough medical history is absolutely necessary before any dental treatment. A blood thinner such as Coumadin affects the body's ability to clot. This is the initial stage of healing required after an extraction. If the clot is disturbed, delayed healing may occur. A dry socket or infection after the extraction is a risk. I routinely take my patient's off blood thinners including aspirin. If there are high risk conditions, I refer to the oral surgeon specialist. All doctors and specialists should consult, discuss risks and agree to treatment.Premedication for dental treatment, especially extractions, is necessary after knee replacement surgery. An antibiotic such as Amoxicillin should be prescribed. I suggest a consultation with an oral surgeon. Factors such as the amount of tooth in bone and risks need to be considered. Surgical complication risks will also need to be considered when choosing a location.

(we only go out once a month so i was blameing no sleep on pills) could this pill be causesing the soreness and habbit? could it be lack of sleep? or also we have recently just found a huge patch of mold in our bedroom that was hiding behind our cabinets could it be anything to do with that? please help","Doctor":"Hello,Definitely rule out an allergic reaction. Soreness with swelling could be a sign of an allergic reaction. This can be from ingestion or respiratory. Habits with your tongue and breathing through your mouth causes stress and dries out your tongue. You may be prone to an oral yeast infection with an oral flora imbalance. Redness, increased sensitivity and a coated tongue can indicate a fungal infection that will require the prescription Nystatin.Make sure that you are well hydrated is my number one recommendation. Drink lots of water and more water! Rinse your tongue with warm salt water. Gentle and proper daily dental care should include brushing your tongue. Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil. Benadryl is also an effective antihistamine that can reduce swelling and allergic reactions. Avoid all irritants such s smoking, acidic and spicy foods. Keep a well balanced diet that includes vitamins. Deficiencies can cause problems to your tongue. Vitamin B12 promotes healing.I hope your symptoms decrease as your body responds to good care. See your dentist if oral symptoms continue or increase. Consider a visit to your physician for blood tests and a physical if you continue to experience systemic effects that may indicate a compromised condition.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Hello, i recently has oral cancer surgery aug. 25/14 where a skin graft was used on my whole left cheek. I had over 100 disolvable, sutures and staples to close the wound and was to start radiation. On Sept. 28/14 I went back to Mount Sinai to have sutures and staples removed but one stitch was abscessed hence I was not released and am still at hospital.

Immediatly after the root canal she had a bad infection witch swelled up the side of her face. We called our hospital and they didn t take it serious and asked us to call the dentist for help. This is mostly because we are in a very rural area of Hawaii. She got those and the swelling went away but no doctor or dentist saw how bad her face swelled. Since then we have been back and forth to emergency rooms and doctor/dentist visits that have gotten us no where. She did swell in the face again though it was not nearly as bad as the first time, that emergency room doctor prescribed a stronger antibiotic. She has had serious fatigue and vertigo from this constantly. She says it hurts in her jaw and that its affecting her eye on that side. She doesnt seem to be getting better and we believe that her solution is to get rid of that tooth. She is afraid that she could have dead bone/tissue in her jaw from this, is that possible? How would we know? I am flying her to Oahu to a Root Canal specialist this week sometime but want to make sure we take the proper road to recovery as I don t believe she is going to have a long time to wait. Do you think she needs a Bone Scrape? Is the root canal specialist equip to help her? Should she see a Infectious disease specialist. thank you in advance for any advice you could give us.","Doctor":"Her swelling on that side of tooth is due to infection now you have two ways either you can go for extraction or a root canal treatment the confirmed treatment plan should be based on the x-ray of that area if the bone loss is more and the tooth is mobile than there is no other option than extraction its better you can see first a oral surgeon he will take x-ray and diagnose it whether the teeth can be saved or not long term antibiotics also disturb your gastric flora so instead of wasting time first meet a oral surgeon."},{"Patient":"hi,well my question is i think that i have a cavity and im super nervouse that i dont want to go to a dentist to get a fixed beacuse i know the pain.So either way i have to go to go get it fixed,my question is how to you repair a cavity and is there any way my dentist can give me something that can complety not make me feel the pain?","Doctor":"Generally cavity restoration is a painless procedure but if the caries is extended to your pulp chamber than dentist can do pulpotomy or in severe condition root canal treatment this treatments are performed under local anesthesia you will not feel any pain during and after procedure so don't fear meet your dentist and get it restored."},{"Patient":"hello. i had redness around my gums which lead to severe pain later on. after a day or so i ended with some swelling on the outside of my face around my gum area. i have started taking anti biotics and brufeon with that i use a mouth wash. but i am still concerned because i have spot like things coming up on my gums. could you please advice me. will this get better or should i do something else.","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for consulting with HCM.There can be two reasons for this gum and face swelling and spot. First it can be possible that the tooth might be infected  of that region, which has formed an abscess in the apex and a swelling with collection of pus. For this you have to go for root canal treatment of tooth as medications can not relieve it.Second it can be possible that there is an abscess of gums called as gingival abscess, for this also you have to visit a dentist.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I guess this is more of a dentist question, but maybe you'll be able to help me. I have a hole in my tooth, one of the back ones. Like a chunk of my tooth has fell out. It doesnt cause me alot of pain, only occassionally. Is this a problem?I have a real phobia of dentists so really don't want to go","Doctor":"Yes this is a problem, your complain suggests that you have a dental decay and if you still do not have pain its a great news ! because in that case you may require just a minor filling which would be painless. If you avoid the problem at this stage though then you may get pain and also getting treated would be more complicated as it would require more number of sittings and more expenditure as well. So get it corrected now only it would be simple and painless i can assure you."},{"Patient":"I have a chronic pain in my upper left teeth is not dental related. I have had a root canal and dental implants and still have steady throbbing pain. It gets worse sometimes when the weather changes. It always throbs though. I have had it for 35 years","Doctor":"Though the pain that you are having is not related to dental as per you but i suggest you to get that eliminated by your dentist once as such pain may be due do an inadequately done root canal treatment and also if your dental implant has impinged the maxillary sinus. If the pain is not due to that and specially when it has been worsening by weather then sinusitis may be the cause for which a proper care by an ENT specialist along with regular use of nasal drops to keep it decongested may help."},{"Patient":"I have no insurance and two months ago I had an upper molar abcess that had to have a drain put in and I was told I was very lucky!

When I go to th ER they refer me to a dentist that I cannot afford and they will not see me. Every tooth is black an rotton to the gums. Do I go back to the ER or am I going to die with these teeth? Hydrocodone is no longer working.","Doctor":"I will suggest you to start antibiotics containing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, hydrocone will just subside your pain and since can be addictive a pain killer with diclofenac is more recommended for you. Also you should know that taking medicines in case when you have tooth decay is not the solution so do visit your dentist for sure even if your problem subsides by medicines temporarily and make sure to get all your teeth which are rotten/decayed treated which may either need to be removed or filled so as to avoid any further such incidences."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have had a wisdom tooth infection for the past week. I was started on antibiotics yesterday and the swelling has gone down considerably and the pain has gone. I was wondering if you could tell me if there are any deleterious effects from working out. I understand I should probably not work out yet at heart rate 160, but even if it was just at 110, would that be ok? I heard exercise can assist in spreading infections from a localized site to other organs. Is that true? Thanks very much.","Doctor":"Yes certainly working out will result in spread of infection to the local spaces and may cause a larger swelling which is due to the griding of teeth and stress that could be associated with working out. If the concerned wisdom tooth has to be removed because of no space for it to come out or decay either of which may have caused infection then i would suggest you get it removed wait for 15 days and then start your workouts. If does not have to be removed then i would suggest wait for another week and then start your work outs in a gradually increasing manner."},{"Patient":"Hi we ll I ve been having this weird vibrating shaking in back of my neck and I feel it in my head and jaw also through my body sometimes because I get nervous of these symptoms and freak myself out more. I do suffer from pain in my mouth from wisdom teeth and swelling in nasal passages I just can t figure out what it could be I m 17","Doctor":"Any problem that lies in tooth or the nasal passage can not be a cause for vibrations throughout the body it can cause dizziness though which may be the reason which makes you feel that you have such a sensation through out. I would suggest you to get an MRI scan though to rule out anything more serious and then get treated for your wisdom teeth which may need to be removed if its in an improper position as wisdom tooth can be a cause of discomfort in head and neck which may be making you feel all that you are feeling at present. Also if you have a constant swelling in your nasal passages i would recommend you to visit an ENT specialist before your condition worsens."},{"Patient":"Thing of the moment is I had a tooth extracted at the dental school (oral surgery) a week ago Thursday. It was beyond bad & I think infected. I have had headaches, though right now is almost unbearable and my gums are inflamed & my bottom front teeth next to one taken out are very painful. There is another broken off tooth on the top, but they could only do one. That one had been seriously bothering me these last days. I don t feel well at all. All of my teeth need to come out and are decaying. Do you think this is an emergency situation at the moment? Any advice?","Doctor":"Though not an emergency, the situation that you are in demands immediate and complete care. The teeth that has been taken out must have been in a non salvageable condition. If all your teeth are in a state of decay then i suggest you to complete the treatment where the ones which are not in a very bad state will be filled and restored and the ones which need to be taken out though may not be still bothering you will be removed so as to prevent any further episodes of pain and discomfort. Also, since the gums as you reported are inflammed and painful a deep cleaning of all your teeth is necessary. If you complete all these procedures without leaving the treatment in between you will be in a state of good dental health soon."},{"Patient":"Hi,My teeth are all straight except that I have a overbite,and a gap in my front two teeth(I used to suck my thumb when I was little)I went to a dentist and he told me I would get a retainer to pull the front teeth together and move them inwards to get rid of the overbite and spacing,But the issue I have is that the underbite causes my face to look shorter,when I move my lower jaw outwards to get closer to my upper teeth my face looks much better,Does an overbite mean that my jaw are not align correctly?I d like to know if braces can actually move my lower jaw outward rather than moving my upper teeth inward or is there any other option that can do that, Im a 20 year old female am I too old to have my jaw align since I dont think its growing anymore?","Doctor":"Positioning you jaws by bringing them in front would not give you the correct idea of how your face would look after the correction of your overbite. Correction of overbite would not make your face looks shorter at all it would rather improve your profile. There are ways when the jaws are corrected and positioned differently to align them more aesthetically called distraction osteogenesis but that would be done only if the jaw alignment is improper. In your case a retainer and alignment of teeth would suffice so you needn't think about the jaw surgery unnecessarily. Also overbite can have lng term effects in the gums leading to more problems so i would suggest you to start the treatment without any further delay."},{"Patient":"do I(guy) grow fat and taugh when I drink my own sperm ?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for query, Who gave this foolish advice.

My gums are pink, but where these bumps are that region of my gum is whitish/pale. And the side of my mouth is swollen. What does that mean","Doctor":"This means that you are most likely having pus in your gums which can indicate gum disease. If you are systemically healthy and have no medical complains and your swelling havs been persisting then you can start antibiotic amoxicillin 500mg thrice a day and visit you dentist who would rule out the cause for such a pus which would be forming either due to a decay or gum disease and either of it warrants further treatment.

We are searching for a cause to some episodes my son is having and the timing with the extraction is suspect. Twilight sedation was used and only Ibuprofen for pain afterwards.","Doctor":"Wisdom tooth extraction can only be a cause precipitating the episodes your son would have been susceptible to it already. Extraction of teeth creates a certain stress that the body has to deal with which may also be evoked by things like heavy exercise, swimming etc. Its just that the cause would have already been and dental extraction just made it to manifest. You need not worry though, just be under proper follow ups for the seizures with the medical practitioner and do report it to the dentist in any subsequent visits so that the necessary protocol can be followed."},{"Patient":"Hello, I had my four wisdom teeth pulled last week thursday. Yesterday, at work I was leaning down and starting experiencing jaw pain. Now today, it grew into a sharper pain. My mouth is very small and maybe the pain could have been cause from the pulling of it open. I was worried of it being a dry socket. Can you tell me how a stitched up dry socket would look like? Or the symptoms please?","Doctor":"If four of your teeth were pulled out in a single visit then you ought to have such symptoms since it will take time to heal. If not so and still you are experiencing it in that case if there is a dry socket you will observe a dull grey open space instead of a closed socket in the region where your teeth have been pulled out. Pain will be throbbing type and would not subside on its own. Also if your pain has been increasing day by day then report to your dentist immediately if not and it has decreased then just take the necessary precautions and you will be good in the due course."},{"Patient":"pI started out with what I thought was a canker soar but after putting powdered elm on it realized their was another inside the bottom of my teeth (the floor of my inside teeth...my gums are red and see a few white patches on them Would this be oral cancer?

If you have any habit of tobacco chewing or smoking i would suggest you to discontinue that if not and still you have such a patch it could be due to fungal infection in which case you will be able to scrape that patch and it would appear more like curd.

There is very less possibility that wisdom tooth removal pain lasts for this long unless it is a traumatic extraction.

But this is very uncommon.Next the bone kind of thing and tonsil kind of thing that popped out could be the healing tissue as I've stated before.All these might have resulted in an opening rather communication between his mouth and nose, the reason for his difficulty in blowing his nose.This can be corrected by a small surgical procedure(if required, which has to be decided by ur treating dentist/oral surgeon)Till then avoid vigorous gargling, blowing nose, sucking and sneezing. In case of sneezing please close ur mouth and nose with ur hands. This is not an emergency situation, so be cool.Hope this helped u.

My child has a slight cavity in her first premolar tooth(primary), complains though not frequently of pain while biting a hard object. the xray showed 1 side of pulp being infected. please advise 1.whether the entire tooth needs to be removed & a crown inserted 2. what happens if i do not want to do the procedure. 3. what are the side effects. 4. does this procedure involve frquent followups. 5. will the child not find it uncomfortable with a crown in the mouth Anita","Doctor":"Thank you for your query,Pulpotomy is a procedure in which we excavate the pulp tissue from the crown part and leave the pulp tissue at the root level. The idea is to just excavate the infected part of the tooth pulp tissue and leave the uninfected part. The root pulp tissue helps in complete root formation.1. The crown or the entire tooth is not taken out. As mentioned, the pulp tissue inside the tooth is excavated and then the cavity is filled with restorative material and a crown is placed over the tooth.2. In case you do not go for this procedure, chances of tooth getting infected and resulting in infection, pain and sometimes swelling of the adjacent gums are more.3. There are no documented side effects as such. Its a relatively simple procedure.4. I do not think you have to follow up. The procedure is simple and once the tooth is cemented with crown it is a s good as uninfected natural tooth. 5.The crown is placed with the same dimensions as the natural tooth, so the child can not find any difference."},{"Patient":"Hi, Im having a lip travel reduction surgery wednesday Im really tired of my gum showing when I smile, alot of people are trying to talk me out of it b/c they say its dangerous l could possibly, if things go wrong be paralyed for the procedure is this true?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, i have gone through your query.the gummy smile can  be because of increased width of attached gingiva or progruded maxillary and mandibular anterior or front teeth.The gummy smile or appearance of gums on smiling can be corrected by the gum surgery or orthodontic treatment.Consult a oral physician or an orthodontist and take an opinion.

The other possible cause can be because of the cervical abrasion due to abnormal forces while brushing or it can be secondary to gingival recession because of gum infection.Nothing to be panic, Consult a oral physician and get it ruled out. If it is a attrition secondary to malocclusion, it has to be treated with braces. If it is secondary to the cervical abrasion then it can be restored with glass ionomer cement. If it is a gum infection, then the teeth has to be cleaned.Mean while till you consult your dentist you can use desensitising tooth paste like strontium chloride(sensoform or senolin), apply on the teeth and leave it for two minutes and brush it with normal brush. Instead of normal tooth paste you can use this.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a problem with all food suddenly tasting horrible. Even when I breathe through my mouth, the air tastes weird, a bit metallic, and yesterday I could not eat a mildly peppered clear soup because to me it tasted extremely spicy. I had a salmon burger the night before that tasted like mold. That was the first thing I noticed, but I ignored it then. Milk tastes like chemicals. Water tastes strange too.

My gums have been bleeding a LOT worse than usual lately.","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for consulting with HCM.This kind of taste alterations are observed when there is some kind of disease in the mouth for example Red or White lesion, which might occur because of some immune problem or habit of smoking or tobacco chewing.So better that once you should visit a dentist for proper examination of oral cavity and get it treated.The bleeding of gums can occur because of infection of gums called as gingivitis for which you have to get complete cleaning of tooth and gums done with dentist.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"I have been having a sore mouth, gums, get blisters and white patches in my mouth.

You can complete the course of antibiotics prescribed after extraction preferably, a combination of amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). For the soreness in the tongue, you can take topical anesthetic and analgesics like 2%lignocaine and choline salicylate gel (anabel gel) apply 3-4 times daily before food. Do saline gargling.

Your dentist will review the medical history and most likely Schedule a follow up visit to check the extraction site and further diagnosis any problems.Continue to rinse the area well with warm salt water. Are there any symptoms such as soreness, swelling, drainage or pain at the extraction site? A delayed healing may require antibiotic medication. Take some antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Advil to assist healing.Make sure a proper diet with balanced vitamins has been resumed. Blood loss, if excessive, can result in dehydration and low iron. Kerp well hydrated. Infection can have some systemic effects that can cause weakness as your body healsNext steps include further diagnosis with your physician and blood tests to diagnosis other medical conditions that could cause these symptoms.

Couldn’t sleep for the whole night and my right side near the ear-the nerve was bulging out bcoz of immense pain…I couldn’t do much with it and had to tie a towel tight around my face bcoz it was paining to the limit…so I finally did meet the doctor- he took an xray and told me tht my tooth can’t be save and he even told me tht we need to take out the upper tooth also bcoz teeth must be in proportion…he took at my tooth while it was paining-gvng me 2 local anesthesia- and then he gave those stitches… I had gone back home and then was getting this weird jerks but just one /day so I thought tht the stitches might be pulling and its in the process of recovery but on the 4th day I got like 7-8 jerks- and in these jerks my mouth use to open to the full and then close-all in a fraction of a second- involuntary ones- and its use to be very painful becoz the upper tooth use to crush my tongue,cheek ot the extraction area and I would get an electric shock feeling near my ears when this use to happen….the doctor was saying tht it might be bcoz of the stress- but I told the doctor tht y on earth will I have any stress or y willo I think of my tooth once its gone…..but then he gave me anxit to have- to reduce sm anxiety which I didn’t even have-before tht I was having amoxyllin and bruffen….the thing took place again on the 6th day and it was for 15-16 times together but the next day was the day to remove my stitches- and once the stitches were out the jerks stopped- but till then the dentist had referred me to psy and neuro depmt where they gave me duzela ,zapiz and tegretol to have, for fever and stuff- they had taken 4 types of blood tests(for biochem, malaria, haemoglobin etc) and a chest scan- and all was normal….the gen phy gave me hifenac –a painkiller for fever and weakness…… Today is the 42nd day and im still persisting with complications tht are increasing day by day- im getting half head pains like migraine and severely near my ears and at the spinal area- the ent guy said it might be TMJ syndrome but the dentist checked and told tht I dnt have tht problem….the dentist is saying tht of excess stress I have got facial muscle dysfunction which is found in ladies over age 40- but he says tht I show those symptoms- bcoz of which my nerves are acting abnormally- so he gave me relaxon for muscles……but the thing is still there- I dnt knw wht to do- now these doctors are giving me stress becoz they r unable to treat me- will u pls guide me as to what shall I do- what tests should I go thru like teeth xray, or EMG or ctscan or MRI- or anything to know what the problem really is- im even experiencing pain in my lower left side-is it a kidney problem….im afraid- tht is there any infection of any sort in my brain, or tumor, or cancer- I am forced to think all of this bcoz im fed up of wht these doctors and wht they are doing to me….they just give me medicines and ask me to leave without going thru any examination…..A friend of mine just got a brain stroke and his half of the body got paralyzed bcoz of sm infection in his brain- and the doctors are telling tht it was due to stress…..is tht the same in my case- coz from the past 3-4 days the pain is continuous and im not at all at ease……please doctor help me out…im tired of being sick- I wana go outside and play like my other friends….

Could you tell me some conditions that cause this?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for consulting HCM Read your query as you have white patch in jaw and palate this can be your smoking habit induced white lesion it can be oral leukoplakia , smokers palate , bacterial infection candidiasis , or oral submucous fibrosis . Dont worry I will advise you to quit your smoking habit first it is injurious to your health. Maintain proper oral hygiene , use mouthwash chlorhexidine regularly , you can take capsule vitamin A Supplements with Antioxitant by consulting with your local doctor .

The other possible cause of black stains can be because of the chromogenic bacteria or it can be secondary to the use of mouth wash also.Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. If it is because of the coffee or tea or smoking, get the teeth cleaned and avoid the habits and rinse your mouth soon after eating anything. If it is chromogenic bacterial infection you need to consult a oral physician and take a course of antibiotics and get scaling done.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I ve recently had my wisdom teeth extracted on the bottom .

The hydrogen peroxide burns the tissues so do not use, it has to be used cautiously by the dentists not by the patients.

If the decay is involving the third layer that is pulp, where the nerves and blood vessels are present, if the filling has been done over that, then you will get pain. So consult a endodontist and get the tooth treated with root canal treatment.Nothing to be panic, Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic) and analgesics like diclofenac 50mg with serratiopeptidase. Do saline gargling. Once the pain comes down you can get the tooth treated.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"hellow dr, gud evening.am vijaya aged 28 years married.i have tooth decay since ten years with no pain.i consulted the same dental dr twice in trichy whether i need to take the teeth.he said it has been damaged but as long as i get pain the teeth need not be taken. my problem is, today as chewed chewing gum i noticed partial of decayed tooth got stuck on the chewing gum.still i didnt get pain or discomfort other than that as 3/4 th of the teeth is being disappeared.shall i need to wait till i get pain or consult the dentist.am just recovering from typhiod fever for the past 2 weeks.also am very scared of pain during taking teeth.please advice","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCMif the tooth is decayed then you must get it treated.Mostly your tooth is in chonic stage thats why you are not gettin any pain.but it can cause you pain anytime.Ask your dentist whether that tooth can be saved through root canal treatment (RCT) or not.otherwise you can get it removed.Dont worry about the pain as the tooth removal will be done by making that area numb.you will not feel pain.Hope this answer helps.RegardsDr. Shesh"},{"Patient":"my right lower wisdom tooth has come out recently and a pocket has formed near that.

I have what I think is a swollen lymph node under my jaw on the right side of my jaw. It hurts really bad. My lymph nodes under my jaw are usually swollen, but not this bad.

What could this be caused from? Is it treatable? Is it a serious condition to be concerned about?","Doctor":"Hello, I went through your query. The swelling under your neck is may be either a swollen lymphnode or a swollen salivary gland. The lymphnodes below the jaws will get enlarged as a reaction to any local infection like an infected tooth or gums. and the fact that is very painful, it is more indicative of an infection. also there is a possibilty that the swelling may not be a swollen lymph node. It can be a salivary gland whose duct may be blocked by a calculus(stone).

However the problem persisted and has got to a stage where every night I am awoken by sudden swelling of this ulcer (I call it an ulcer but its clearly something else as dehydration makes it much worse) tongue due to dry mouth, even though I always breath from my nose and drink plenty of waterbefore going to sleep. I am awoken by a pulling sensation of the tongue, which causes a sudden and severe pain. By checking on the internet it appears that this area I am refering to is the Foliate Papilliea area of the tongue and is affecting the left side of my tongue only. Could you please help me diagnose what this is. I have had mouth ulcers on both gums and tongue in the past and these have gone after a few days.
